Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to paint \nthe larger picture of why the small business health plans are so \nimportant to our Nation, to everyday Americans, and to the 46 million \npeople who do not have health insurance today, and how it affects the \ncost of health care and thus the quality and access to health care.\n  Much of the discussion that has gone on and that will go on as we \nproceed with this bill centers on the fact that America is facing a \nhealth insurance crisis. It centers on the fact that health care \npremiums are growing. They are growing faster than individuals' wages \nor income, and this growing cost--skyrocketing cost--of premiums \ntranslates into a significant portion of the 46 million people who \ndon't have insurance today--solely because of the price of the premiums \nof health insurance. I do think--in fact, I know--that is unacceptable \nin a country that is as prosperous as ours.\n  The medical impact and the impact on quality of life and life itself \nis embodied in the statistic that the Institute of Medicine reported in \nthe fact that 18,000 Americans die prematurely each year because they \ndon't have health insurance. A lot of people say why, because you \neventually can get into a hospital, but it boils down to the fact that \nif you have some health insurance--just some health insurance--you do \nbetter than if you don't have health insurance. People can still go to \nemergency rooms whether they have health insurance, but entry into our \nsystem is much easier if you have health insurance.\n  So this is a big problem that troubles me as a Senator and as a \nphysician, and it troubles and should trouble every American. That is \nwhy we are on this issue today.\n  About 60 percent of uninsured employees today work for small \nbusinesses. Unfortunately, these skyrocketing health insurance costs, \ncoupled with very complicated State regulations, are pricing small \nbusinesses out of the health insurance market. They simply can't afford \nto buy insurance and to offer that insurance to their employees.\n  We hear a lot of statistics on the floor, we have already heard a \nlot, and you will hear them continually over the next couple of days as \nwe address this issue. In the past 5 years, the cost of health \ninsurance to companies has nearly doubled from roughly $4,200 per \nfamily--almost double--to $8,100. In 2005 alone, health care costs rose \nthree times faster than inflation, and even faster for many small \nbusinesses. Consequently, the small firms, the small\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\nbusinesses are the ones that are hit the hardest.\n  Many of them are operating on a very narrow margin already. They have \nhad to cut benefits and, in many cases, eliminate coverage altogether \nfor their employees. Some of them have been forced to lay off workers \nbecause of the cost of health care. They simply can't sustain it; it \neats into their profits and they can't stay in business. So it is no \nwonder that small businesses across America have said to us and have \nmade it known that access to affordable health care is their No. 1 \nconcern: access to affordable health care.\n  That is what this small business health insurance debate is all \nabout. It is the guts, the thrust of the bill on the floor today. Small \nbusiness owners want to take care of their employees and their \nfamilies. They want to do everything they possibly can. Most small \nbusinesses are family affiliated, many of them family run, but it is \nbecoming impossible to do in the face of increases that are so far \ngreater than any margins they have, these double-digit increases in \nhealth insurance every year.\n\n  One survey reports that only 41 percent of firms with 9 employees or \nless can afford to offer health benefits, compared to 99 percent of \nlarge firms. That hurts the ability of small businesses to attract \ncapable workers, to stay in business, to stay competitive in the larger \nmarketplace. Unfortunately, the system is broken and small businesses \nare caught. They are stuck.\n  Eighteen hundred State mandates are choking the ability of the \nprivate sector to offer affordable choices, reasonable choices. We have \nto cut out the redtape. We have to streamline the process itself. We \nhave to get rid of the waste and abuse in the system.\n  We all know that small businesses are the engine of economic growth \nin our economy. These small businesses are where innovation occurs and \nthese innovators create 60 to 80 percent of all new jobs nationwide. \nThey generate more than 50 percent of the gross domestic product. In my \nhome State of Tennessee, 97 percent of all businesses are small \nbusinesses. This aspect of affordable health care is their No. 1 \nconcern.\n  It makes sense that if we want to expand health care coverage, if we \nwant to diminish the number of uninsured, we need to start to at least \nmake a major advance in an area where we know we can make a difference, \nand that is where the jobs are. That is why the Enzi-Nelson-Burns small \nbusiness health insurance bill that we bring to the floor and will \nformally open debate on here in about an hour is so important.\n  I want to applaud Chairman Enzi for his tremendous work to pull \npeople together on both sides of the aisle to address these issues. \nThis bill represents the first real, major, solid step to end the small \nbusiness health plan stalemate that has characterized this body in over \na decade. Its purpose is to deliver meaningful reform for millions of \nAmericans employed in the small business sector.\n  Under this plan, small business firms would be able to combine their \nnegotiating power and to group that negotiating power in a way that \npurchasing clout can be used to purchase more affordable plans. By \nallowing that to happen, they could reduce the cost of health insurance \nby as much as $1,000 per employee, while reducing the number of \nuninsured, people who are uninsured today, by more than 1 million. The \nCBO recently estimated the Enzi-Nelson-Burns plan would increase \nFederal revenue by $3.3 billion between 2007 and 2016, while saving \nStates an estimated $600 million in Medicaid spending during the same \nperiod.\n  I know this is a very important bill. I am delighted that we will \nbegin on this bill in an hour, or a little over an hour from now. It \nwill be a substantive debate and will go right to the heart of a major \nproblem facing this country, and that is the uninsured. It will address \nthe issues of cost, access, and quality. I encourage Members on both \nsides of the aisle to participate in this debate, to stay on the \nissues--we are talking about small business health reform--to not bring \nin extraneous issues, and with that pass a very important and \nsubstantive bill for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4242-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the problem with the Enzi bill is laid out \nin great detail in a report filed by the minority of the HELP \nCommittee. This is not a question of my not liking the bill, it is not \na question of Democrats versus Republicans, it is a question of the \nbill not being good. It is not a good bill, as indicated by 41 \nattorneys general. Forty-one attorneys general have signed letters \nsaying the Enzi bill is not good for their States. These attorneys \ngeneral are from Democratic States and Republican States. Insurance \ncommissioners from around the country have acknowledged that the bill \nis not a good bill. The bill is opposed by 206 different advocacy \ngroups and health care organizations, disability groups, and \nprofessional organizations.\n  For example, we know that the American Association of Retired People \nopposes this legislation. I was able to speak to Mr. Novelli a couple \nof times about this bill while it was moving through the system, and \nAARP believes the bill is very hurtful to senior citizens, as well as \nthe Small Business Majority, the National Health Council, and the Lance \nArmstrong Foundation. As I said, more than 200 different organizations \nthink this legislation is bad for the American people.\n  I have been led to believe that when this bill is brought to the \nfloor, the 30 hours doesn't expire postcloture on the motion to proceed \nuntil sometime this afternoon. We have agreed to go to the bill at an \nearlier time. But it is not going to give the people in our country the \nopportunity to move forward on progressive, strong legislation. We will \nbe stuck with the Enzi bill, and AARP doesn't think it is going to go \nanyplace. The amendments will be controlled by Senator Enzi. If he \nlikes the amendment, he will allow us to offer it. If he doesn't, he \nwon't. I submit that is not the way we should move forward on \nlegislation brought forward during Health Care Week dealing with health \ncare reform.\n  There are many issues related to health care we need to deal with. \nThere are issues that are so fundamental to what is going on in the \ncountry today, and we believe the proposal put forward by Senator \nLincoln from Arkansas, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus, and of course a person who has worked very hard on this \nlegislation for months, Senator Durbin, should be the legislation we \ndebate. But it will not be. We should have the opportunity to offer \namendments relating to postponing the May 15 cutoff line of the \neligibility for Medicare drug benefits. That is not going to be \nallowed.\n\n  We should be able to offer legislation dealing with the ability of \nMedicare to be competitive and bid for drugs at a lower price. That \nwon't be able to be offered.\n  We should be able to offer an amendment dealing with stem cell \nresearch, giving hope to millions of Americans. We won't be able to do \nthat. That is unfortunate.\n  Walking into the Chamber today, I was asked by someone: Tell us what \nyou stand for. I think, rather than what I stand for, what we stand for \nas a minority, it is who we stand for. I think that is the direction we \nshould be focusing: Who do we stand for?\n  There are lots of people we stand for. We stand for parents with no \nhealth care. We stand for those people with maladies who are crying out \nfor some research on stem cells so we can move forward finding cures \nfor these diseases--Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes.\n  We stand for children who are attending failing schools because the \nBush administration refuses to put money into the schools that needs \nit. It is reported today that very soon there will be 10,000 schools in \nAmerica that will be failing. I don't think that speaks well. Why are \nthey failing? It is because of this Leave No Child Behind Act that the \nPresident pushed so hard.\n  We stand for the soccer mom who, today, someplace, is going to fill \nup her vehicle with gasoline and find the price is prohibitive. Rather \nthan filling up her tank, she will fill it half full,\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\nenough to get through maybe the rest of this week, because the cost of \ngasoline is so high.\n  We stand for the high school graduates putting off being able to go \nto college because they simply can't afford the tuition. During the \nlast 5\\1/2\\ years of this administration, college costs have gone up 40 \npercent. Student aid has been cut. Pell grants have been cut.\n  We stand for the guardsman who is concerned because he has been \ncalled back for the second tour of duty in Iraq. Reading the Washington \nPost today, I find that two Nevada soldiers were killed in Iraq \nyesterday, both from Las Vegas, a 46-year-old man and a 26-year-old \nman--killed yesterday.\n  We stand for the grandparents who are concerned about the debt this \ncountry is accumulating, recognizing their grandchildren will be forced \nto pay this debt. How big is the debt? During the 5\\1/2\\ years \nPresident Bush has been President, the national debt has almost \ndoubled, now approaching $10 trillion. We just raised the debt ceiling \nto $9 trillion, and through some shuffling in the Republican-dominated \nHouse they have, in the last few days, raised that to $10 trillion.\n  We stand for senior citizens who are unable to have the proper \nmedicine to take care of themselves.\n  The part that is so concerning is that we are doing nothing in this \nCongress to address the issues. There are editorials running around the \ncountry today talking about the majority, the Republicans, not raising \nissues of any kind because the debate is one they know they can't win. \nWe need to be focusing on the high cost of energy and high cost of \neducation. We need to focus on global warming, and we are not. It is \nbeing ignored because in the minds in the White House, it doesn't \nexist. We need to focus on this staggering debt. Remember, during the \nlast 3 years of the Clinton administration, we paid down the debt. We \nwere spending less money than we were taking in. That is certainly not \nthe case now.\n  We are going to have a so-called debate on health care this week, but \nit is a so-called debate. It is really not a debate because we are \nbeing prohibited from offering amendments of significance. We are going \nto be forced to focus only on the Enzi legislation, which is a flawed \nbill. It is so flawed that it took the minority in the HELP Committee \nabout 250 pages to outline the problems with this legislation. Usually \nminority reports are very short. This one is not. It is not because the \nconsequences of the Enzi bill are so significant. This report looks at \nevery State and indicates how every State is hurt as a result of the \nEnzi legislation.\n  I look forward to maybe a change of heart. Maybe there will be the \nability for us to offer amendments. That doesn't appear to be the case. \nI hope that it is the case, that we will be allowed to offer \namendments. That is the way we should deal with Health Care Week and \nnot be stymied at offering amendments to this legislation, amendments \nthat would really help--help those people who need help, not only with \nthe hope of curing dread diseases but with the hope of 46 million \npeople in America who have no health insurance, the senior citizens who \nhope they will be able to get prescription drugs at a lower rate, but \nbecause of the Medicare bill passed by this Republican-dominated town, \nMedicare cannot even negotiate for lower prices. They have to go to \nRite Aid and buy their drugs like everyone else. HMOs can negotiate to \nlower prices because the legislation was directed toward managed care, \nnot those Medicare recipients who badly need help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4243-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come on the heels of the minority leader \nspeaking about or at least attempting to define what he and his party \nbelieve in. I watched him struggle this morning to try to shape what \nthey are versus what we are, and that is really what we heard discussed \na few moments ago. But he kept going back to the issue of high energy \ncosts and the soccer moms and their inability to fill their gas tanks \ntoday. So I am going to focus on that part of what he struggled to \ndefine this morning and speak to the realities that are out there and \nwhat has transpired over the last several decades as it relates to the \ninability of this country to produce energy and why that inability \nexists.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I came to the Senate floor to inform this \nSenate and awaken America to the reality that just 50 miles off the \ncoast of Florida, China is drilling for oil--Not the United States but \nChina. And the reason China is drilling for oil is that we have \nprohibited our own companies from the opportunity to drill in the \nnorthern Cuban zone, so that Cuba is now leasing out to other countries \nin the world except the United States.\n  Then I watched a rush to judgment on the other side as there was a \nflurry to say not only do we have to stop Cuba, we dare not let \nAmerica, American companies, experts in deepwater drilling, experts in \nenvironmental soundness, ever drill in that region.\n  Today I wish to expand on that idea. I wish to talk about why America \nis in trouble today with energy and why that soccer mom is paying more \nat the gas pump today than she ever has. The answer is really right \nhere. It happened right here in the Senate over the last several \ndecades, starting in 1950.\n  From the 1800s to 1950, we were energy independent. We were the great \nproducer of oil. But as folks came home from World War II and as our \neconomy began to expand, we began to use more oil. Then, starting in \nthe 1960s and 1970s, we began to say about oil: We need it, but we \ncan't drill here and we can't drill there and we will drill elsewhere.\n  Here is our problem today, so clearly defined in a supply and demand \nenvironment in which we have become 60 percent dependent upon foreign \ncountries to produce our energy for us. America now knows that. Two \nweeks ago, we watched the other side blame and blame again somebody, \nincluding this administration, for a failure to produce. But they \nfailed to tell you what they had not done, had denied over the last two \nor three decades.\n  I went to the White House during the Clinton years and asked \nPresident Clinton to work with us, to floor what we call marginal wells \nin west Texas and Oklahoma so they could continue to produce. Why? \nBecause oil was below $18 a barrel and there was no economy there. They \ncouldn't make money and they were shutting the wells in. We said: Let's \nfloor it and keep them producing.\n  We couldn't do it because of the politics of that Democratic \nadministration. What happened? Those wells went off line. They were \nfilled with concrete, and they stopped producing what would be a \nmillion barrels of oil a day into this market right now. So to the \nAmerican consumer who is paying those high gas prices, you are lacking \na million barrels a day into our markets by a Democratic administration \nthat denied its happening. Darn it, that is a fact. That is reality.\n  What transpired during that other time? Let's go on to the next chart \nthat talks about our failure to get certain things happening. The \nPresiding Officer knows all about ANWR. He knows all about Alaska and \nAlaskan production. It was Bill Clinton who vetoed, a decade ago, the \nANWR bill which would have put upwards of 10 billion barrels into the \nmarket at about a million barrels a day. Let's do the math now. We shut \nin a million barrels a day in Texas and Oklahoma because of the \npolitics of that administration, and then they vetoed ANWR at 10 \nbillion or a million a day. That is 2 million barrels a day to which \nthey said no. So the answer to the minority leader as to why the soccer \nmoms are paying the highest price ever today for gas is quite simple. \nIt is because they said no. They said no to stripper wells, they said \nno to ANWR.\n  Now let's talk about the rest of the story because what I am \ninterested in\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\nis the reality of the ``no'' politics, the ``no'' production, the \n``no'' refinement. That is the answer to our problem today. You saw it \non the last chart, the chart of supply and demand and 60 percent \ndependency on foreign sources. We cannot even drill in our own \nhemisphere.\n  Then let's go to this map. I call it the no zone. Why is it called \nthe no zone? Because you can't drill here and you can't drill here and \nyou won't drill here and you can't drill here. Why? American politics \ntoday. It is the no-drill zone.\n  If we could drill in the no-drill zone, it is possible that we could \nfind, through U.S. geological surveys already under way, 115 billion \nbarrels of oil and a phenomenal amount of gas. But the answer is no. \nWho said no? They said no. Republicans didn't say no.\n  Let me talk about that for just a moment. President Bush comes to \ntown. We meet over here in the leader's office. He says: My first \npriority is to allow the Vice President to assemble a group of the \nexperts and put together a national energy policy. We have to get this \ncountry back into production. He said that as his first initiative. \nFive years later, after they kept saying no, last August we got a bill. \nWe are beginning to produce. But this is still all ``no.'' Mr. \nPresident, 115 billion barrels are outside the reach of the American \nconsumer today, even though our technology is the best in the world and \neven though, after the worst natural disaster ever, we proved ourselves \nout in the gulf. In this little clean area right over here where we \nhave not said no--at least the States of Texas and Louisiana didn't say \nno--we found out that wells went off line, rigs got blown off their \nfoundations, but no oil was spilled. Why? Because of the phenomenal \ntechnology today and because of environmental rules and regulations \nthat we have asked for and demanded compliance and received it from the \nmajor oil companies that drill in deepwater and the Outer Continental \nShelf.\n  The reason I bring these issues today is quite simple: We have to \nquit saying no. The other side can demogog and they can try to blame, \nbut the reality is here. The facts are here.\n  Let's run down the rest of the chart. We have said no to ANWR, no to \nOCS, no to 181 leasing, no drilling in the northern Cuba zone--at least \nAmerican companies--while China drills in our backyard. American \nconsumers need to know that the answer to their problem is not no. It \nis, yes, we can produce and, yes, we ought to produce and, yes, we \nought to be energy independent and, yes, it ought to happen in our \nhemisphere, and, yes, we ought to be less dependent on foreign oil.\n  If we put all of those things together, America can be independent \ntoday. But you are not independent by saying no. And the answer has \nbeen no, no, no, no. That is why we ought to talk about the ``no zone'' \nand the naysayers and the minority who have said no for so long.\n  Reality is at hand. The American consumer is being squeezed at the \ngas pump like never before, and the answer still remains no. Americans \nare demanding that this be resolved. We are rushing to new production \nin all kinds of alternatives, but you do not get away by denying the \nobvious.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the leader for that time.\n  I will conclude by simply saying 115 billion barrels of oil are \ndenied because somebody--and it was over here--said no, and now we \nenter the ``no zone.'' Americans do not believe it. Americans are going \nto demand a change, and we ought to be able to deliver.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time to yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Presiding Officer. I will raise \nthe questions in a speech later on. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we want to accommodate colloques. If the \nrequest is to be asked and granted by the Chair, then I suggest the \nmorning business hour for the Republican side be extended 10 minutes to \naccommodate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. How much time does the Senator require?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am not going to request time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I seek the concurrence of the \nPresiding Officer to speak about 12 to 14 minutes regarding General \nHayden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4244-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4244-S4246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     APPOINTMENT OF MICHAEL HAYDEN\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I have known this fine officer for some time. I worked \nwith him, and I'm very pleased that the President of the United States \nhas asked the Senate for its advice and consent on this important \nnomination.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is at war on two main battlefields--Iraq \nand Afghanistan. The national security apparatus of our country centers \naround the White House, the National, Security Council there, the \nSecretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity and, most importantly, the new organization headed by John \nNegroponte, our national intelligence community.\n  It is imperative that this Nation receive as early as possible the \nreplacement for Porter Goss to take over his position with the Central \nIntelligence Agency, and I hope that the hearings, which I believe will \nbe scheduled, subject to Chairman Robert's views, early next week. \nEarly next week there will be a very thorough investigation of this \nofficer, and we, the Senate as a body, can conform General Hayden and \nmove forward. This Senator, the Senator from Virginia, will give him \nthe strongest support and as an ex officio member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, I will participate in those hearings.\n  Before turning to General Hayden, though, I would like to say a few \nwords about Porter Goss. Mr. President, I am privileged to know this \nfine public servant who, presumably, is going to step down here shortly \nand conclude, perhaps, maybe not, maybe another assignment some day, \nbut he certainly has had a distinguished public record of service. He \nwas at the CIA himself, and served thereafter in the Congress. That is \nwhen I first came to know him.\n  The Presiding Officer may recall that there was a time here, a dozen \nor so years ago, when, I remember, our good friend, Senator Moynihan \nfrom New York, said, it is time to re-examine the CIA, and possibly \nabolish it. Well, I and others came to the forefront and did what we \ncould to begin to put that debate into balance. And we successfully put \nin a bill, and Porter Goss in the other body put in a similar bill, to \nestablish a commission to review the origins of the CIA, and see how it \nwas an integral part of our intelligence system.\n  The late Les Aspen, the former Secretary of Defense, was the first \nchairman of that commission. He had an untimely death, and was succeed \nin that position by former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, at that \ntime also having finished his work in the Department of Defense. The \nCommission did an excellent job. I just point that out as a reference \nin history of how hard Porter Goss has fought throughout his career to \npreserve the integrity and the viability of the Central Intelligence \nAgency.\n  Now, we do not know, many of us, all the facts regarding this \ntransition of positions. I personally hope to visit with Mr. Goss, and \nwill do so prior to the hearings, so that I can understand his \nperspective more fully. But he did a lot of valuable work at that \nagency, notably he began to restore the focus of the agency to its \nprinciple function as it was established some 50 years ago, and that is \nthe collection of human intelligence. So I say to Porter Goss, well \ndone. And I say to General Hayden, you fill the shoes of a very able \nman, but you have a challenge of your own.\n  Now, there are several issues that have been brought up by the \ngeneral's nomination, and I would like to address those issues. First, \nthere is a question of surveillance. As the head of the NSA, the \nNational Security Agency, General Hayden was in the business of \ncollecting electronic signals from around the world, from emissions \nabroad. We will go into that very thoroughly during the course of the \nhearings. I think that debate I appropriate. But I wish to point out \nthat a very important debate has proceeded on that\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\nissue on the Senate floor. It will continue for some time. And that is \na debate over the legal ramifications, in other words, what are the \norigins of the power of the President to have directed this type of \ncollection?\n  I do believe that you can separate the collection, really, into two \nparts. One, the value of the collected intelligence from abroad as a \ncontribution to our overall security. We have established now, here in \nthe Senate, a larger committee that is looking into that, and I am \nconfident that there will be a unanimous view that the collection of \nthis intelligence, thus far, has been an important contribution to this \nNation's effort in the war on terrorism.\n  The other question, equally important, is the question of legality. \nNow, let me make it clear. In my visit with General Hayden yesterday, I \nsaid to him, ``You're not a lawyer.'' He said, ``No, I'm not a lawyer . \n. . I, General Hayden, when instructed to initiate this program, \ncarefully assessed all variety of legal opinions, and it was clear by \nthose contributing the legal opinions, the Attorney General, the White \nHouse Counsel, and others, that I had the authority to do so. As a non-\nlawyer, I accepted their opinions, like all of us do every day in life, \nI accepted the opinions of our counsel, whether it be in private or \npublic life.''\n  So I believe that the Intelligence committee, as it sorts that out, \nwill eventually find that, while we may not resolve--and I doubt in the \ncontext of this nomination we will in fact resolve--the very important \nquestions of the legalities of this program, we will decide that \nGeneral Hayden acted in accordance with prudence, and was guided by \nappropriate counsel. So I believe that that issue will not be an \nimpediment to his nomination.\n  Next is a question of the fact that this distinguished officer has \nrisen through the ranks to become a four-star general. I have been \nprivileged, I say with a sense of humility, to work with the uniformed \npeople of this country for close to a half a century, in one way or \nanother. I had a very modest military career of my own, but \nparticularly when I was Secretary of the Navy, I had the opportunity \nwork with and assess the biographies and the careers of many officers \nwith worked their way from the lowest ranks up to four-star ranked \ngeneral and flag rank in the Navy and Marine Corps.\n  Now, I certainly say to the people of this country, that an \nindividual who can withstand all of the rigor, all of the competition, \nto come from the very bottom to the very top is one who has been \nscreened and thoroughly reviewed by many peer groups. And how proud \nthis officer is to have succeeded to have gained four-star rank. I do \nnot personally have any trouble with his retaining that rank in this \ncapacity, if confirmed by the Senate to lead the CIA. The question is \nraised, though, legitimately. It should be a civilian running our \nintelligence. But my distinguished colleagues, I say to you, it is a \ncivilian that runs the intelligence community: John Negroponte. He is \nnow the top individual in charge of this magnificent intelligence \nsystem that this country has.\n\n  Yesterday, I visited with Secretary Rumsfeld on this issue on several \noccasions by phone, and he spoke publicly to the issue, as well. He \nendorses General Hayden. He said, General Hayden will report directly \nto John Negroponte, the head of the overall intelligence community. And \nin no way does Secretary Rumsfeld feel that the fact that General \nHayden continues to wear this uniform should there be any impediment in \nthe chain of command, or in the responsibilities or the direction that \nthis officer will give to his responsibilities. So, again, I believe \nthat issue will be resolved in the committee hearings.\n  In the work of the Intelligence Committee to review the credentials, \nthe integrity, the character of this individual, I am confident that he \nwill meet the highest standards of the office which he aspires to take \nover at the direction of the President. So that will be behind us.\n  Finally, I would like to say a little bit about the Central \nIntelligence Agency itself. It is in Virginia, and I am privileged, as \na current Virginia Senator, as have my predecessors, to give a little \nspecial attention, to that Agency. When the new structure of the \nintelligence community was devised here on the floor, I was active in \nthe debate, and I think, if I can say with some modesty, helped to \npreserve more and more of the functions of that agency which I felt \nshould remain in that agency, and the CIA has survived that \nlegislation, I believe, quite well.\n  There is still more to be done in finally convincing various persons, \ndistinguished individuals in that Agency, that this is the way it is \nunder the law, and this is the way we have got to conduct our business \nin the future. General Hayden can do that. He did it at NSA. He made a \ntransformation of the thought process over there, and likewise he can \ndo it here.\n  But it is interesting: who would be his deputy? Well, we don't know \nentirely for sure, but I would like to read part of a column in today's \nWashington Post by David Ignatius. I happen to know him. His father, \ncoincidentally, was Secretary of the Navy just before the late Senator \nChafee and joined that Secretariat. And he is an author of some \ndistinction.\n  He points out that the current thinking, and I believe it to be \ncorrect, is that the transition in the CIA would be painful for General \nHayden, I read from his article, but he's got a good choice for the \nsecond person in Mr. Stephen Kappes. And it is interesting about Mr. \nKappes' career. I would like to read just a part of the column.\n  At the core of the intelligence puzzle is the CIA, whose very name is \noutdated. It is no longer the Central Intelligence Agency, coordinating \nthe work of the community. That's the DNI's job now. In a sensible \nreorganization, the CIA should refocus on the specific mission for \nwhich it was created more than 50 years ago--gathering HUMINT, which is \nintelligence jargon for the secrets between someone's ears. The days \nwhen the CIA could be all things to all intelligence consumers are \nover. Today's CIA should be a truly secret intelligence service in \nwhich the job of analysts is to target operations. The all-source \nanalysis that creates finished intelligence should be managed by the \nDNI.\n  Making this transition at the CIA will be painful, and Hayden is a \ngood choice for the necessary surgery. As a feisty military officer, \nhe's paradoxically the right person to fend off poaching by the \nPentagon. By his own admission, Hayden doesn't know much about the \nCIA's operational work, but he does know how to modernize a big, \nhidebound bureaucracy. He did that at the National Security Agency--\nhelping the wiretappers adapt to a new world of e-mail, fiber-optic \ncables and wireless phones. He made enemies at the NSA, but he was a \nsuccessful change agent.\n  Hayden will have the ideal partner in Stephen Kappes, who is slated \nto be deputy director. Kappes is something of a legend at the agency: a \ncharismatic ex-Marine who knows how to lead from the front. He punched \nall the tickets--fixing a broken Iranian operations group that had lost \na string of agents, serving as chief of station in Moscow and as head \nof counterintelligence, and visiting Moammar Gaddafi and persuading him \nto give up his nuclear weapons program. Kappes' pitch to the Libyan \nleader is said to have been blunt, and irresistible: ``You are the \ndrowning man and I am the lifeguard.''\n  And on it goes. It points out very carefully that in the eyes of the \nprofessionals at the Agency, this gentleman, Mr. Kappes, is a man of \nimpeccable credential, one who resigned from the Agency rather than \nfire his deputy, and that is to his everlasting credit.\n  So I believe the morale at the Agency will be raised, Mr. President. \nIt is a magnificent group of professionals. Our Nation should take \npride in the quality of persons who fortunately are selected to serve \nin the CIA for generations. And I am proud and humbled to have a voice \nin representing so many of the officers at the CIA, who are my \nconstituents. But I do so in knowing that this Agency is essential to \nour intelligence operations. This new leadership team of General Hayden \nand Mr. Kappes will take over and provide the strong direction that is \nneeded to even strengthen the Agency, and to the extent that there has \nbeen any diminution in morale, I am confident this team will raise in a \nvery short period of time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full column from David Ignatius, and an excerpt from the official \nbiography of General Hayden.\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 10, 2006]\n\n                       The CIA's Mission Possible\n\n                          (By David Ignatius)\n\n       Firing Porter Goss was the easy part. The challenge now is \n     to complete the reorganization of U.S. intelligence so that \n     the 16 spy agencies under Director of National Intelligence \n     John Negroponte are fighting America's enemies rather than \n     battling each other in bureaucratic turf wars.\n       But how to fit the pieces together? That's the quandary for \n     Negroponte and Gen. Michael Hayden, the administration's \n     nominee to succeed the miscast Goss. I suggest they take a \n     careful look at the British model. The Brits have a basic \n     division of labor: a small, elite Secret Intelligence Service \n     (known as MI6) collects human intelligence; an interagency \n     group known as the Joint Intelligence Committee analyzes that \n     information for policymakers and tells the spies what to \n     collect. When I look at Negroponte's organization chart, \n     that's the model that I hope is emerging. If so, he's moving \n     in the right direction.\n       At the core of the intelligence puzzle is the CIA, whose \n     very name is outdated. It is no longer the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, coordinating the work of the community. \n     That's the DNI's job now. In a sensible reorganization, the \n     CIA should refocus on the specific mission for which it was \n     created more than 50 years ago--gathering HUMINT, which is \n     intelligence jargon for the secrets between someone's ears. \n     The days when the CIA could be all things to all intelligence \n     consumers are over.

A former agency officer remembers the \n     reaction to Kappes's departure: ``It was a devastating body \n     blow, like someone has punched you in the solar plexus. The \n     wind came out of the sails that day and it has never come \n     back.''\n       Kappes had a plan for reorganizing the Directorate of \n     Operations when he left, and he's in a position to implement \n     it now. It's said that he wants to create a far more nimble \n     spy service--one that can attack terrorist groups and other \n     targets around the world more aggressively. Today the CIA is \n     still locked in a Cold War structure, with the same fixed \n     array of directorates and geographical divisions. The agency \n     is frantically hiring new case officers, but under the old \n     structure there aren't ``OCPs'' (or overseas covered \n     positions) ready for them, so many of the young recruits \n     languish, ``stacked up at headquarters like cordwood'' in the \n     phrase of one CIA insider.\n       CIA veterans say Kappes hopes to create an operations \n     capability that's more like a flying squad--detached from \n     headquarters and its layers of bureaucracy. If an al-Qaeda \n     call surfaces on a remote island in the Philippines where the \n     United States doesn't have an embassy or consulate, officers \n     from Kappes's revamped spy service could grab a laptop and be \n     on their way in hours.\n       Maybe it's time to say goodbye to those three spooky \n     initials ``CIA'' and the bloated, barnacle-encrusted agency \n     they represent. Let Negroponte move his shop to Langley and \n     create a new elite analytical service there. Meanwhile, let \n     the covert operatives slip away in the night to destinations \n     unknown, where they can get to work stealing the secrets that \n     will keep America safe.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              Biography of\n\n                U.S. Air Force General Michael V.

Mr. President, on Monday night, with unanimous \nsupport, the Senate passed resolution No. 458 that I sponsored, along \nwith 12 other Senators, affirming that the Pledge of Allegiance and the \nNational Anthem be said or sung in the language that unites us as one \nNation, that language being English.\n  This was more than bipartisan. It was unanimous, with one dissent \nexpressed on the other side. It should be virtually unanimous.\n  This is the land of immigrants. Almost all Americans know we need and \nmust value our common language, which is English. Yet during the last \nweek, the idea of a non-binding resolution expressing the Senate's \nthought that whenever we say the Pledge of Allegiance, sing the Star-\nSpangled Banner, take the oath of citizenship, that it ought to be in \nour common language, produced quite a little storm across the country. \nSome said we were restricting liberty.\n  But this not about what we are free to do; this is about what we \nought to do at the opening of the Senate, at the opening of a ball game \nor Boy or Girl Scout troop meeting. As Americans, we are free to sing \nthe Star-Spangled Banner in Swahili, we are free to say the Pledge of \nAllegiance in pig Latin, but that is not what we ought to do. And the \nSenate, by unanimous consent, said that on Monday night.\n  Some said this was disrespect for other languages. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. I believe our official documents ought to be in \nour common language. I have always favored, including when I was \nEducation Secretary of this country, what I call ``English plus.'' The \nluckiest among us are those who know more than one language, but one of \nthose must be English. Children should learn it as quickly as possible \nif they want to succeed in the United States of America.\n  The real reason for the storm of reaction to the singing of the Star-\nSpangled Banner in a foreign language is that most Americans \ninstinctively understand that while diversity is important, unity is \nmore precious. That is why we pledge allegiance to the American flag \nrather than the flags of the countries from which our ancestors came. \nThat is why most of our politics is about principles upon which we \nagree, principles found in our founding documents. That is why we give \nrights to individuals instead of to groups. That is why we honor our \ncommon language, English.\n  In Sunday's Washington Post, a Chilean-American playwright, a \nprofessor at Duke, said our country is well on its way to becoming a \nbilingual nation and that he thought we would endure just fine. I \nrespectfully disagree. I think it would make it harder for us to \nendure. I think it would make us more a United Nations than the United \nStates of America.\n  Now the Senate unanimously agrees. So does the mayor of Los Angeles, \nan\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\nHispanic American. Antonio Villaraigosa said:\n\n       I was offended by the idea of a national anthem in another \n     language because for me the national anthem is something that \n     deserves respect. Without question the vast majority of \n     people in the United States were offended, as well. Our \n     anthem should be spoken English.\n\n  So says New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, a Hispanic American, who \nsaid on the ``CBS Early Show'' last week:\n\n       I agree. The national anthem should be in English. Most \n     immigrants want to become American. They want to learn \n     English. They want to be part of the American mainstream.\n\n  Twelve cosponsoring Senators agree. Many Democrats in the House of \nRepresentatives have joined as cosponsors. Senator Conrad from North \nDakota spoke on this in the Senate last week and said:\n\n       A common language is absolutely essential to our Nation. I \n     look to our neighbors to the north [meaning Canada] and see \n     incredible traumas they have been through because they are \n     speaking in two different languages. My own strong belief is \n     we ought to say the pledge in English and sing the national \n     anthem in English.\n\n  Ramon Cisneros, the publisher of a Spanish language newspaper in \nNashville, e-mailed me:\n\n       Thank you for the resolution. Our common language as \n     Americans is and will always be English. Our national symbol \n     should always be said and sung in English.\n\n  We have worked hard to make English our common language, creating \ncommon schools, requiring new citizens to learn English to the eighth \ngrade level. The Senate last week passed grants to help prospective \ncitizens learn English. We welcome legal immigrants to this country. \nBut we expect they will become American, that they will learn our \ncommon language, English, that they will learn our history, that they \nwill subscribe to our values as found in the Declaration of \nIndependence and Constitution, and when they became citizens, they will \nrenounce allegiance to their former government and swear allegiance to \nour laws and Constitution. That is what holds us together as the United \nStates of America.\n  So I am glad, in conclusion, that as the Senate stood together for \nour economic identity as Americans, it did it unanimously and passed \nour resolution affirming that statements of national unity, including \nthe Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem, should be said or \nsung in our common language, English.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of \nsignificant importance to the people of Hawaii, S. 147, the Native \nHawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005. While opponents of this \nlegislation have sought to characterize this issue as a Native versus \nnon-Native issue, I am here to tell you that there is nothing further \nfrom the truth. This bill is important to all of the people of Hawaii.\n  Why? It is significant because it provides a process, a structured \nprocess, for the people of Hawaii to finally address longstanding \nissues resulting from a dark period in Hawaii's history, the overthrow \nof the Kingdom of Hawaii. The people of Hawaii are multicultural and we \ncelebrate our diversity. At the same time, we all share a common \nrespect and desire to preserve the culture and tradition of Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples, Native Hawaiians.\n  Despite this perceived harmony, there are issues stemming from the \noverthrow that we have not been able to address due to apprehension \nover the emotions that arise when these matters are discussed. There \nhas been no structured process. Instead, there has been fear as to what \nthe discussion would entail, causing people to avoid the issues. Such \nbehavior has led to high levels of anger and frustration as well as \nmisunderstandings between Native Hawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians.\n  As a young child, I was discouraged from speaking Hawaiian because I \nwas told that it would not allow me to succeed in the Western world. My \nparents lived through the overthrow and endured the aftermath as a time \nwhen all things Hawaiian, including language, which they both spoke \nfluently, hula, custom, and tradition, were viewed as negative. I, \ntherefore, was discouraged from speaking the language and practicing \nHawaiian customs and traditions. I was the youngest of eight children. \nI remember as a young child sneaking to listen to my parents so that I \ncould maintain my ability to understand the Hawaiian language. My \nexperience mirrors that of my generation of Hawaiians.\n  While my generation learned to accept what was ingrained into us by \nour parents, my children have had the advantage of growing up during \nthe Hawaiian renaissance, a period of revival for Hawaiian language, \ncustom, and tradition. Benefitting from this revival are my \ngrandchildren who can speak Hawaiian and know so much more about our \nhistory.\n  It is this generation, however, that is growing impatient with the \nlack of progress in efforts to resolve longstanding issues. It is this \ngeneration that does not understand why we have not resolved these \nmatters. It is for this generation that I have written this bill to \nensure that we have a way to address these emotional issues.\n  There are those who have tried to say that my bill will divide the \npeople of Hawaii. As I have just explained, my bill goes a long way to \nunite the people of Hawaii by providing a structured process to deal \nwith issues that have plagued us since 1893. The misguided efforts of \nmy colleagues who seek to delay the Senate's consideration of this \nbill, however, may have a divisive effect on my state.\n  This bill is also important to the people of Hawaii because it \naffirms the dealings of Congress with Native Hawaiians since Hawaii's \nannexation in 1898. Congress has always treated Native Hawaiians as \nHawaii's indigenous peoples, and therefore, as indigenous peoples of \nthe United States. Federal policies towards Native Hawaiians have \nlargely mirrored those pertaining to American Indian and Alaska \nNatives.\n  Congress has enacted over 160 statutes to address the conditions of \nNative Hawaiians including the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement \nAct, the Native Hawaiian Education Act, and the Native Hawaiian Home \nOwnership Act. The programs that have been established are administered \nby federal agencies such as the Departments of Health and Human \nServices, Education, Housing and Urban Development, and Labor. As you \ncan imagine, these programs go a long way to benefit Native Hawaiians, \nbut they also serve as an important source of employment and income for \nmany, many people in Hawaii, including many non-Native Hawaiians. There \nare many Hawaii residents whose livelihoods depend on the continuation \nof these programs and services.\n  This, colleagues, is why this bill is important to the people of \nHawaii. I ask all of you to respect our efforts by voting to bring this \nbill to the floor for consideration and for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, under the previous order, if I \nmight inquire, the time is allocated to this side; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Twenty-two minutes remains on \nthe minority side.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, may I be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, the underlying bill we are \ndiscussing is an attempt at a much needed reform of the health \ninsurance system of this country.\n  If you wonder why there is the organization of health insurance in \nthis country that we have, it is as a result of a historical accident. \nIt was when all the veterans were coming home after World War II that \nemployers, in order to get them to come and work for their company, \nwould offer fringe benefits, one of those fringe benefits being health \ninsurance. Therefore, a system developed in this country of organizing \nhealth insurance around an employer.\n  As time grew and things got more complicated, health insurance \noffered\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\nby an employer that was a large employer, with hundreds and thousands \nof employees, could offer a cheaper rate because of the principle of \ninsurance; that is, you take the health risk, you spread it over the \nmost number of lives, and therefore you bring down the per-unit cost or \nthe cost to the individual for the health insurance premium. Because in \na much larger group, you have young and old, you have sick and well; \ninstead of a group being smaller and smaller--especially if it is a \nmom-and-pop store that wants to insure their employees--there are not \nmany lives over which to spread that health risk, and therefore the \ncost of that health insurance is going to be so much more than on a \nlarge group.\n  That is why we have used the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan \nas an example we should try to achieve. There are approximately 9 \nmillion people in that health insurance plan. So you have 9 million \npeople over which to spread the health risk, and therefore you can \nbring down the per-unit cost. You can let it be private enterprise with \nthe individual insurance companies competing for that business. And you \ngive the consumer the choice: do they want a ``Cadillac'' policy with a \nlot of bells and whistles or do they want a ``Chevrolet'' policy, which \nis much more pared down?\n  Now, that is the ideal we ought to achieve, and that is what the Enzi \nbill is trying to achieve. The problem is that the Enzi bill has a \nfatal flaw; that is, there is no regulation of the insurance companies. \nThat is the fatal flaw.\n  Now, I can inform the Senate, this Senator from Florida, prior to \ncoming to the Senate, had the privilege--and I might say the toughest \njob in my entire adult life of public service--to be the elected \ninsurance commissioner of the State of Florida. And through one crisis \nand another, you kind of, in that crucible, start to learn something \nabout insurance. One of the things I learned is, if insurance companies \nare not regulated, then, guess what, insurance companies will want to \ninsure the lower risk--in other words, the healthier people, the \nyounger people who are not going to get sick--and if they do insure the \nsicker and the older, the price is going to go up through the roof.\n  You need a regulator to regulate the business of insurance, to \nprotect the interest of the public. That is why, in the 1930s, the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act, passed by the U.S. Congress, left to the 50 \nStates the regulation of insurance, and that is why departments of \ninsurance are set up in most States--most of which, by the way, have an \nappointed insurance commissioner; very few States have an elected \ninsurance commissioner--and they are there for the purpose of \nprotecting the consumers of a product which is not a luxury and has now \nbecome a necessity. In the case of health insurance, we Americans look \nat it as almost something that is, if not a right, clearly something \nthat is a necessity for the good health we all want to have.\n  So what is wrong with the Enzi bill? I can tell you, there is not a \nfiner Senator than Senator Enzi. There is not a finer gentleman than \nSenator Enzi. So as I have talked to Senator Enzi about the deficiency \nof his bill, the fatal flaw--the idea of pooling is great, but when \ninsurance companies are not regulated, as is the case in his bill, what \nis going to happen? The price is going to get jacked up. The group is \ngoing to get smaller and smaller. It is going to get older and older. \nIt is going to get sicker and sicker. And the insurance premiums are \ngoing to continue to go up.\n\n  So I have talked to Senator Enzi, and I have said: Let's correct this \ndeficiency by amending it so we impose what has been the delivery of \ninsurance in this country since the 1930s; that is, the protection of \nthe consumers with a regulator. But guess what. Senator Enzi is under \nthe direction of the majority leadership, and the majority leadership \nsays, in the consideration of this bill, they will not allow it to be \namended.\n  Now, isn't the Senate the place where deliberation is to occur? And \nif this Senator from Florida, on the basis of his experience for 6 \nyears as an insurance commissioner, can point out an improvement to the \nbill that otherwise, if passed and went into law, would do one thing: \njack the rates up--exactly the opposite that all the small businesses \nthat are advocating for this bill want; it would have the exact \nopposite result, it would jack the rates up--is it not the business of \nthe Senate to deliberate, to consider amendments, to amend, to perfect, \nto improve, and then, hopefully, pass a much needed piece of \nlegislation to give small business some relief from this accident of \nhistory that started at the end of World War II with the veterans \ncoming home, organizing insurance around an employer?\n  Small business has it rough because small business cannot afford the \ncost of the insurance.\n  Now, another amendment that, of course, we would like to entertain \nhappens to do with health insurance as well. But it has to do with \nsenior citizens' health insurance; that is, Monday, May 15, is a \ndeadline for senior citizens signing up under the new prescription drug \nbenefit. Increasingly, senior citizens are anxious because they have \nthis deadline they are being forced into.\n  Many of them--millions of them--not the ones who have automatically \ngone into the new program under the new law--I am talking about senior \ncitizens who have to make a choice, knowing they are going to be \npenalized if, by Monday, they choose a plan, and then, if it is the \nwrong plan, it cannot be changed until the end of this year. So they \nare stuck. Or if they do not sign up for this plan by Monday, May 15, \nthey are going to be penalized 1 percent a month. How many months is \nthat between May and the end of the year? Six or seven. In other words, \nthen, when they sign up, they are going to have to pay a 6- or 7-\npercent penalty. That is not right. We should not do that to our \nseniors.\n  All we could do is amend this bill. OK. Do not take my position, \nwhich gives them to the end of the year. Well, let's give them 2 or 3 \nor 4 months before the deadline comes. But the clock is ticking, and it \nis ticking down to next Monday, May 15.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, wasn't the Senator's impression that the \nprescription drug program was going to be a voluntary program? And for \nmillions of people--or for hundreds of thousands in my State--people \nfelt it was going to be a voluntary program. They were absolutely \nconfused. We have 45 different programs with a wide variance in copays \nand deductibles with individuals on a formulary one day and off a \nformulary another day.\n\n       I would be interested as well if the Senator would comment \n     on the General Accounting Office's report that I thought was \n     rather devastating in terms of the ability of the CMS to be \n     able to communicate to seniors about their options.\n\n  As I understand what the Senator from Florida is saying, millions of \nAmericans thought the prescription drug program was voluntary, so they \ndid not think they really had to get involved in it. Then, they might \nhave heard they better sign up. Now they are increasingly conscious \nabout the penalty and, at the same time, we have a General Accounting \nOffice report that said the ability for our seniors to understand the \nprescription drug program is a real mystery.\n  How has that played out for the people in Florida whom you represent? \nHow have the conclusions of that General Accounting Office report \nplayed out that said people would call up and they would get \nmisinformation on the phone? There was confusion even among those who \nwere supposed to be doing the briefings for seniors. The degree and the \nextent of confusion for seniors is because of the multiplicity of \nprograms.\n  I would be interested in what the Senator's experience in Florida has \nbeen.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis exactly right. In my State of Florida, being one of the States that \nhas the highest percentage of senior citizens, indeed, they have been \nconfused, they have been bewildered, and they have been frightened. \nThey are confused because there are 43 plans in Florida they are trying \nto choose amongst. They are frightened because they know if they choose \nthe wrong plan that maybe does not have the drug they need, they are \nstuck until the end of the year to make a change into another plan or \nthey are frightened because if they are paralyzed to the point they \ncannot make a\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\ndecision by next Monday, then they know when they do make a decision, \nthey are going to be penalized 6 or 7 percent on the premiums they are \ngoing to pay. Either way, they are going to get hit, through no fault \nof their own.\n  If only we would show some compassion here. As I said, as the Senator \nwas coming to the floor, you do not have to take this Senator's \nposition and delay it all the way to the end of the year. Why don't we \nget some compassion and delay it a few months so that, again, the \ngroups that are out there that are trying to advise the seniors--one of \nthe major concerns of the senior citizens is getting the health care \nthey need; and prescription drugs today means so much to them, indeed, \nto us, as well, with regard to the quality of life we are privileged to \nhave not compassionately extend this deadline a few months in order to \ngive some relief?\n\n  Yet we come to the floor, we try to do that, and we are prohibited \nthrough a parliamentary procedure of filling the amendment tree so that \nwe cannot offer these amendments, whether it be this one or the one I \nspoke about earlier which is to correct the deficiency of the Enzi bill \nand have some provision for regulation of insurance companies in health \ninsurance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand the President is in his home State today. \nGiven the track record of the administration and the mismanagement of \nthe prescription drug program and the fact that there is genuine \nconcern and confusion among seniors, what reason did the administration \ngive you for not following your extremely reasonable, sound suggestion \nthat could make a difference for seniors all over the country?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nquestion. The answer is, I have asked representatives of the \nadministration in two different committees this same question. The \nanswer comes back, cold-heartedly: We have a deadline. We have to \nenforce that deadline or people will not make a decision.\n  I understand the necessity of a deadline. The nature of human beings \nis that we often procrastinate. But there are compassionate exceptions \nthat ought to be considered. This is one. Coming from a State, as I do, \nwith a high percentage of our population made up of senior citizens, \nthis certainly ought to be a compassionate exception.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am happy to yield to the distinguished \nassistant minority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I understand we are only about 5 days away from the \ndeadline for people to sign up for Medicare prescription Part D. I know \nthe Senator has joined me and others in suggesting this program could \nhave been done differently, a lot fairer, a lot simpler, could have \nmore competition so that seniors would have had even lower drug prices. \nSadly, major parts of it were written by the pharmaceutical industry \nand by the insurance industry.\n  I know the Senator from Florida has spoken to many seniors, as I \nhave, and knows that as they have tried to understand the program and \nsign up for it, some of them have been overwhelmed. In Illinois, there \nare over 45 different programs from which to choose. I talked to \npharmacists, who are a good source of information, who tell me the \nseniors come in, throw up their hands, and say: What are we supposed to \ndo?\n  I ask the Senator from Florida, when you reflect on the fact that \nthere are some 35.8 million Medicare beneficiaries who have drug \ncoverage, according to the administration, isn't it true that 70 \npercent of those people--more than 26 million--already had prescription \ndrug coverage before this program was underway? And of the 16 million \nwho previously did not have coverage, about 10 million or so have \nsigned up. So we still have about 6 million of the 16 we were trying to \nsign up for drug coverage--sounds to me like a substantial percentage, \n6 million--who have not signed up at this point, about 40 percent. They \nare facing a penalty.\n  Do I understand the Senator from Florida has joined with others, \nincluding myself, in legislation extending the deadline for signing up, \nalso saying to the seniors: If you made a mistake in choosing a \nprogram, we will give you a makeover, a do over, so that you can change \nthe program within 1 year without penalty? I ask the Senator to \nexplain.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The distinguished Senator from Illinois \nunderstands correctly. If the deadline were extended until the end of \nthe year, the administration's own figures are that an additional 1 \nmillion-plus senior citizens would sign up of that group of 6 or 7 \nmillion. If that is a million seniors who would not suffer the economic \nhardship of an additional 6 or 7 percent penalty or the economic \nhardship of not being able to have the right drug they need because \nthey signed up with a mistaken decision of a wrong formulary, then is \nthat not worth it for the sake of the senior citizens to grant a \ncompassionate extension?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Florida, does he believe, as I do, \nthat if we would have allowed the Medicare Program to bargain with the \ndrug companies to get, by bulk discount, the lowest prices for seniors, \njust the way the Veterans Administration does, that the end result \nwould have been at least one kind of standard program, Medicare \nProgram, with lower prices which other private companies could have \ncompeted with, if they chose? Wouldn't that have offered the lowest \nprice to the seniors and one simple standard program to turn to if they \nhad any doubts about the right choice?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is correct. As a matter of fact, \nit is something the Federal Government has been doing for over two \ndecades in the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration \nbuys prescription drugs in bulk. As a result, the cost to veterans is \n$7 per month for their prescription drugs. Using the law of economics \nin the private free marketplace, buying drugs in bulk, you can \nnegotiate the price down. But when this body passed the prescription \ndrug bill 3 years ago, Medicare, the Federal Government, was prohibited \nfrom purchasing in bulk and negotiating the price down.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Less than 1 minute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The administration has argued the reason they didn't let \nMedicare bargain down in bulk discounts is because they wanted the \nmarket to work its will. Am I correct in remembering that they also \nappropriated hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize the insurance \ncompanies that were going to offer this? Is that kind of massive \nFederal subsidy consistent with free market economics?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator's point is not only correct, but \nit is so pointed that anyone who hears it should suddenly say: Ouch.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson).

Madam President, for those Americans who believe the \nSenate was going to have a debate this week on health care policy--and \nthey have been watching the activities in the Senate this morning--they \nmust be mystified about how and whether we are going to have a debate \nat all. We will know the answer to that at 2\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\no'clock, when the majority leader will address the Senate.\n  The best judgment now is, for all intents and purposes, that the \ndebate on the issue of health care will be terminated through a \nparliamentary process that will be worked out, making it impossible to \noffer amendments to the underlying bill, which is the usual way of \nproceeding in the Senate. Instead of debate on health care, we will \nfind that time will move on, there will be debate and discussion about \nsome of the tax issues tomorrow and probably voting on cloture on the \nunderlying Enzi legislation.\n  Let me point out how disappointed I am in this result. We are aware \nthe leader said we were going to have a Health Care Week in early May, \nand we would have a chance to debate issues which relate to health \ncare. Health care is a matter of enormous importance to families all \nover this country--we all know that. As Members of this Senate, we \ncannot go to our home States without being exposed to different aspects \nof the health care crisis. Certainly this is true more so today, \nperhaps, than in recent times. We are very disappointed that the Senate \nwill not have the opportunity to address some of the underlying issues \non health care.\n  We now have 46 million Americans who do not have health insurance. \nThe total number of uninsured has been increasing by about a million a \nyear over the period of the last 6 years. There is every indication \nthat this increase in the number of uninsured is a phenomenon that is \ngoing to continue.\n  We know that in terms of the coverage, an increasing number of \nAmericans are only a paycheck away from losing their health care \ninsurance. They are very concerned about losing coverage, especially \nwith all of the changes we see in terms of the economy and the \nchallenges we are facing in terms of good jobs, good benefits, and \nhealth care protection.\n  For all of these reasons, Americans are concerned about losing health \ncare insurance.\n  We have increased the total health care spending over 6 years from \n$1.3 trillion to $1.9 trillion. We are spending $600 billion more on \nhealth care and yet 6 million people have lost coverage. The numbers \nrelated to health are spending and the uninsured are going in the wrong \ndirection. We have a growing number of uninsured, yet we are paying \nmore in taxes and for the costs of health care. This does not make a \ngreat deal of sense. We ought to get about the business of trying to \ndeal with the problem of decreasing numbers of insured Americans and \nincreasing health care spending.\n  My State of Massachusetts has tried to get its arms around the \nproblem of inadequate coverage of health are insurance, and I commend \nour leaders in Massachusetts for attempting to do that. We need to do \nthat here in the Senate. Premiums have gone up 73 percent in the last 6 \nyears. Wages have gone up approximately 13 percent. How do average \nworking families possibly get ahead and afford the kind of health care \nthey need when we see the costs of health care going right through the \nroof?\n  It is not just the costs of health care creating problems for working \nfamilies. We know that working families are paying more in terms of \ngasoline, and they are paying more in terms of higher education. This \nlast winter, in many instances my constituents were paying a great deal \nmore on fuel assistance because of the rising costs of fuel. While \ncosts are rising, wages are not.\n  All of these challenges are out there for Americans. Beyond this, we \nare in the age of the life sciences with new possibilities for \nbreakthrough drugs in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. If we had a \nbreak in terms of Alzheimer's disease and we were able act on that \nbreakthrough, we would empty one-third of the nursing home beds in my \nhome State of Massachusetts. There are profound implications in terms \nof the quality of life Americans people could live. Our influence could \nnot only improve the quality of life for people in the United States \nbut it could also influence the quality of life of people around the \nworld. Though unimaginable, we have made reductions and cuts in NIH \nresearch at a time when we have splendid opportunities for \nbreakthroughs in health care.\n\n  We thought we might have an opportunity to have a health care debate \non stem cell research, an issue which led to legislation being passed \nin the House of Representatives. The legislation, which we believe a \nclear majority of this Senate favors, is now waiting on the calendar. I \ncall it the legislation of hope--there are no guarantees about what \nstem cell research might be able to do in the future, but it will \nprovide great hope for millions of families that have Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, spinal cord injuries, and so many other illnesses.\n  We should be able to do something that Senator Nelson from Florida \nhas been talking about for weeks. Unless we take action, approximately \n8 million American seniors will be paying more for prescription drugs \nif they do not file under the Medicare prescription Part D drug program \nin the next few days. We know most seniors are living on fixed incomes, \nand they will be paying hundreds of millions of dollars more if they do \nnot file under Medicare Part D drug program. We have an opportunity to \ndo something about this problem, but we are being blocked.\n  We are blocked on stem cell research. We are blocked on doing \nsomething for our senior citizens in terms of penalties related to the \nMedicare Part D drug program. We are blocked from perhaps changing our \nlaw and permitting our Medicare system to bargain with the \npharmaceutical companies to get lower priced prescription drugs for our \nseniors as we do in the VA system. All of our seniors understand that \nMedicare should be able to negotiate lower prices for prescription \ndrugs, but we are prohibited from doing that by law. There is virtual \nunanimity among the Democrats to change Medicare's ability to bargain \nfor lower drug prices. Do we have an opportunity to do that? No, we \ncannot do that, either. We are prohibited from having that debate, \nhaving that discussion, having that vote which would mean so much to \nthe quality of life of so many of our seniors, let alone the issues \nregarding the possibilities of reimportation of drugs, which has been \nan issue that many Members know can make a big difference in terms of \navailability of prescription drugs. However, we are not going to have \nthat opportunity.\n  Finally, we are not even going to have the opportunity to see the \nsmall business proposal which has been prepared by Senator Durbin and \nSenator Lincoln which I strongly support. Their proposal can make a \ndifference for small businesses. It helps small businesses retain \nhealth insurance for their workers and will provide incentives for \nthose small businesses, the engine of the American economy, to bring \npeople back into health care coverage. We ought to have the debate \nabout Senator Durbin and Senator Lincoln's small business health plan \nproposal. Let the Senate make a judgment, a decision, about whether \nthey favor, on the one hand, the proposal by Senators Lincoln and \nDurbin or, on the other hand, Senator Enzi. Let's have the votes and \ncall it as we see it. But we are virtually prohibited from having that \nvote in the Senate.\n  Most Americans believed, when they elected their representatives, \nthat they were going to come here, they were going to learn these \nissues, and they were going to tell their representatives what was on \ntheir minds. The Senators were going to learn the issues and then have \na voice and a vote and try to move that process forward. Certainly that \nis what we all believe is our responsibility as elected officials. We \nthought we were going to have these debates and votes on health care \nthis week, but we are not. I believe that this is a grave \ndisappointment. It is an abdication of our leadership in the Senate on \nan issue which is of overwhelming importance--the quality of health \ncare and the affordability of health care for the millions of American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, first I commend my colleague, Senator \nKennedy, for his leadership on this very important issue and all the \nmany other issues on which he provides great leadership in the Senate.\n  I rise today to oppose this Senate bill, 1955. I believe it is well \nintentioned. I have the greatest respect for Senator Enzi and the role \nhe is playing\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\nas chairman of the Committee on Health and Education, on which I am \nprivileged to serve.\n  However, I also believe this particular proposal, S. 1955, is flawed \nand has many potential unintended consequences which could have a \ndevastating impact on millions of Americans who currently have health \ninsurance coverage. It is for that reason that I am a strong supporter \nof the alternative to which Senator Kennedy referred; that is, the \nalternative Senators Durbin and Lincoln have put together which I will \nspeak about in more detail in a minute.\n  I also suggest an alternative proposal that would bridge the gap \nbetween these two approaches and would build on the bipartisanship we \nclearly need in order to make any progress on health care issues in the \nremaining weeks of this Congress, which are diminishing rapidly, as all \nare well aware.\n  First and foremost, we need to keep in mind the important tenet that \nis referred to often when we talk about health care; that is, first, do \nno harm. That is what physicians are taught when they go to medical \nschool. Clearly, that is something we should be taught when we come to \nthe Senate.\n  One of the most significant concerns I have with this legislation \nthat is pending in the Senate is that the language contains sweeping \npreemptions of literally hundreds of State insurance laws, not just for \nassociation plans or for the self-employed or even just for small \nbusinesses, but the legislation as presented to us preempts those State \nlaws for large businesses as well.\n  Consequently, for the millions of people who currently have insurance \ncoverage and count on consumer protections and benefits--including \ncoverage of cancer screenings, diabetes treatment and supplies, \nimmunizations, well-baby care, prenatal care or whatever benefits and \nprotections their States require be included in insurance policies--\nthat security is wiped out by S. 1955.\n  In short, the bill literally puts at risk the health security of \nmillions of Americans by preempting longstanding State insurance laws \nto impose an untried, untested proposal throughout the country.\n  While I certainly do not disagree with the idea that there may be \ninsurance laws and mandates that States have enacted that are not \nneeded, I do think most often the mandates and the provisions that are \nadopted at the State level are adopted in response to real needs those \nState legislatures have perceived and real crises that have been \npointed out in those States. As such, by preempting those consumer \nprotections, there are real national goals that we all share that would \nbe undermined.\n  For example, we have a national goal to improve immunization rates \namong children. So why should we backtrack and potentially undermine \nwhat the States have done to ensure that insurance plans offered in the \nindividual States provide for coverage of a full set of immunizations \nfor their children?\n  While a number of Senators have come to the Senate floor condemning \nvarious State mandates, who really thinks we should not be covering \ncancer screenings, as an example, and treatment and prevention or \ndiabetes education and supplies?\n  Some will argue that the benevolent insurance industry would never \nfail to cover these items. But, in fact, there are insurance products \nfor sale in this country in some States--for example, in Ohio--that do \nnot cover diabetes supplies and education, precisely because there is \nno requirement they do it.\n  State insurance laws, including mandates or laws regarding market \nconduct of insurance plans, were passed because of real problems that \nwere perceived in the insurance market. Consequently, it makes little \nsense to preempt literally hundreds of State laws overnight and to put \nall hope that insurers would have to offer businesses a plan offered to \nState employees in one of the five most populated States. That is what \nis touted as the guarantee of consumer protections.\n  As the bill now reads, if a plan fails to offer certain protections, \nand it is being offered to employees in one of these five most \npopulated States by that State, then that is a minimum that is \nacceptable throughout the country with regard to all insurance plans. I \ndo not see why the people of New Mexico or the people of any other \nState should be at the mercy of what one of the Governors of these \nlarge States decides to offer to that State's employees.\n  The five Governors are certainly respected public servants--Governor \nSchwarzenegger, Governor Bush, Governor Perry, Governor Pataki, and \nGovernor Blagojevich--that is a mouthful, Madam President--but I do not \nsee why any of those Governors should be able to lessen the protections \nthat we provide to consumers in New Mexico.\n  If Governor Bush passes a barebones package in Florida, do all of the \npeople of my State of New Mexico have to fear losing health benefits? \nThat would be the effect of the pending legislation.\n  In fact, for rural States, a package in the five most populated \nStates is very likely to fail to recognize the special challenges we \nhave in rural communities. Let me give you one example.\n  In New Mexico, we have a mandate for access to psychologists. If you \nsell a health insurance policy in New Mexico, you have to cover access \nto psychologists. This was passed in response to the fact that our \nState leads the Nation in the number of suicides per capita. Also, \nthere are very few psychiatrists who are located in areas outside of \nAlbuquerque and Santa Fe, which is our more urban part of the State.\n  So our State leaders, in part due to the leadership of my colleague, \nSenator Domenici, have been making great strides with respect to mental \nhealth coverage and benefits in New Mexico. But that could be \nundermined by this pending legislation. Literally overnight, our State \nmandates could be preempted and replaced with the allowance that \ninsurance companies could provide whatever benefits they desire or that \nany plan offered by the five most populous States in the country to \ntheir employees would be adequate in New Mexico.\n  I would note that even though 42 States have requirements that \ninsurance plans offer access to psychologists, Florida does not, and \nmay not, in their State employees' plan. Therefore, any insurer could \nadopt that plan and hundreds of thousands of people would lose access \nto mental health professionals in a State such as mine, New Mexico. \nThis is one example of real regional or local issues that I believe are \nnot adequately addressed in this bill.\n\n  Another simple but important example of a problem with the \nlegislation is that most States require insurance plans to cover \nnewborns and adopted children and adult disabled children. This bill \nwould undermine such requirements. Why should the Senate undermine this \ncritical coverage of some of our Nation's most vulnerable children?\n  Fundamentally, we should not be encouraging underinsurance and \nbenefit insecurity among most Americans as part of a bill that is \nintended to increase health coverage among small businesses, but, \nunfortunately, that is the unintended consequence of S. 1955.\n  It is why literally hundreds of national and State-based \norganizations have come out in opposition to S. 1955, including the \nNation's State health insurance commissioners and 41 of our States' \nattorneys general. All of these groups and individuals are opposing S. \n1955 precisely because the legislation contains numerous provisions \nthat, as the attorneys general write, ``erode state oversight of health \ninsurance plans and eliminate important consumer protections.''\n  While some organizations have literally tried to claim that the \nattorneys general did not know what they were doing by taking the \nposition they have taken, I was an attorney general of my State, and I \ncan assure you those attorneys general knew exactly what they were \ndoing when 41 of them joined together in a letter of opposition to S. \n1955. They surely know a lot more about the laws of their States and \nthe consequences of eroding insurance laws than some of the groups that \nare attempting to criticize them in this debate.\n  But even if you do not believe the attorneys general, the bill's text \nreads clearly it will ``supercede any and all state laws'' applicable \nto small business health plans as well as State laws regulating all \nother types of health insurance plans, not small business health plans, \nin six key areas: No. 1,\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\nmandated benefits; No. 2, rating requirements; No. 3, internal appeals; \nNo. 4, rate and form filing; No. 5, market conduct reviews; and, No. 6, \nprompt payment of claims. So in all of those six areas, this \nlegislation would override whatever the States have previously done.\n  So what are the consequences? As the attorneys general write:\n\n       The point is that history has shown that eliminating state \n     regulation of insurers has had extremely negative \n     consequences for consumers, and there is no reason to exempt \n     any insurer from the important consumer protections afforded \n     by state regulation.\n\n  The sweeping nature of preemption of State laws and oversight is \nfairly breathtaking in this legislation. It is surprising to see how \nmany of our colleagues, who are typically advocates for States rights, \nhave embraced this legislation. It culminates with a provision in which \ninsurance companies are afforded the right to sue States in Federal \ncourt.\n  The legislation, first of all, overturns and preempts this \nlongstanding State authority over State insurance matters. Secondly, it \nimposes a new Federal system upon the States. Third, it declares States \nas nonadopted States if they do not conform their laws to the newly \nimposed Federal system. And, finally, it allows insurers to sue States \nin Federal court if they do not like the way the States are \nadministering the federally imposed law.\n  Somewhere, it seems to me, the goal of the legislation has been lost. \nThe stated goal was to give small businesses greater health insurance \npurchasing power and to reduce administrative costs in the purchase of \nhealth insurance. However, there are, in my opinion, far better \napproaches to achieving that goal than to gut State oversight of health \ninsurance plans and to eliminate these important consumer protections.\n  For instance, eliminating the guarantee of coverage of insulin makes \nany insurance product meaningless to someone who has diabetes. As a \nresult, I am a supporter--I know Senator Kennedy indicated his strong \nsupport--and I also strongly support the legislation introduced by \nSenators Durbin and Lincoln precisely because it would address the \naffordability problems for businesses in the small group insurance \nmarket by giving them the ability to access a large purchasing pool \nwhich would be modeled on the successful Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program, FEHBP. It would do so without eroding any of the \nconsumer protections afforded people in State insurance laws and \noversight.\n  Under this Durbin-Lincoln bill, small businesses would be allowed to \nband together in a large purchasing pool that would reduce premiums, \nreduce administrative costs, and give every small business and their \nemployees a wide choice of plans. The amendment harnesses the power of \nmarket competition to bring down health care costs by using a proven \nnegotiator that provides Federal employees across the Nation with \naccess to affordable health care.\n  Let me make it very clear that we are not in any way affecting the \nhealth care coverage of Federal workers with this proposal, this \nDurbin-Lincoln proposal. Small businesses and their employees who \nchoose to participate and buy their health care through this purchasing \npool would be buying their health care through a separate pool--\nseparate from Federal workers--but still a very large pool of small \nbusinesses around the country with 100 or fewer employees.\n  Last year, there were 249 private health insurance plans that \nparticipated and competed for the business of the FEHBP enrollees. This \nsystem would also benefit small employers. It would do so without \nundermining the benefits and coverage of large employers or the \nconsumer protections that are afforded everyone under our State \ninsurance laws.\n  What people fundamentally want from their insurance policy is \nsomething that is truly there when it is needed. Unfortunately, S. 1955 \npreempts that security and creates more unintended harm than good \nthrough an untested and unproven model of State preemption. In sharp \ncontrast, this alternative that Senators Durbin and Lincoln--and I am \nproud to be a cosponsor--are proposing achieves the goals of helping \nsmall business in the underlying bill through a proven mechanism that \neach and every one of us and our staffs benefit from without upsetting \nthe security that the health insurance marketplace provides to millions \nof Americans around the country.\n  There is also another alternative that I think is most promising for \nsome type of health care reform in the reasonably near future in this \nCongress. This is bipartisan legislation that I was proud to join \nSenator Voinovich in introducing yesterday. This legislation, entitled \nthe Health Partnership Act, is intended to move beyond the political \ngridlock we have in Washington on health care reform. I think that \ngridlock is, unfortunately, highlighted by the very debate we are \nhaving in the Senate this week.\n  Instead, the proposal Senator Voinovich and I have introduced sets us \non a path toward finding solutions to affordable quality health care \nfor all Americans by creating partnerships between the Federal \nGovernment and State and local governments and private payers and \nhealth care providers to implement some different and promising \napproaches to health care. In contrast to preempting State laws and \nsolutions, the Health Partnership Act, which Senator Voinovich and I \nintroduced yesterday, would provide for Federal funding and support to \nState reform efforts such as that recently enacted in the State of \nMassachusetts to reduce the number of uninsured, to reduce cost, and to \nimprove the quality of health care. A Federalist approach to health \nreform, in sharp contrast to state preemption, would encourage a broad \narray of reform options that would be closely evaluated to see what is \nworking and what is not.\n  Justice Brandeis is famous for his statement in 1932:\n\n       It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that \n     a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve \n     as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic \n     experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\n\n  The Health Partnership Act encourages this type of State-based \ninnovation through a partnership rather than through preemption. This \nwould help the entire Nation to better address both the policy and the \npolitics of health care reform. As the debate before us underscores, \nthere is not a consensus at the Federal level on any one approach. \nInstead of preempting State laws and innovation, we should be \nencouraging States to adopt a variety of approaches that may help us \nall better understand what does work and what does not. Rather than \nfighting to a standstill over whether the Enzi bill or the Durbin bill \nis the best approach, I would argue that the best solution would be to \nhave a few States experiment with a model based on Senator Enzi's bill, \nif they chose to do so; other States experiment with a model based on \nthe Durbin-Lincoln approach, if they chose to do so; and other States \nadopt alternative reforms such as those that have recently been passed \nby Massachusetts, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Illinois, Oregon, and \nMontana. This would also include encouraging reforms in local areas \nsuch as the three-share initiatives in a number of communities.\n  If given the opportunity--and there is still uncertainty about \nwhether I will have that opportunity--I plan to offer an amendment that \nwould give the States the choice between being covered by the Enzi \nmodel or being covered by the Durbin-Lincoln model for their small \nbusinesses. Therefore, the amendment would add the Durbin-Lincoln \nlanguage to the Enzi bill with additional language that gives States \nthe choice of deciding which approach to take.\n  If the proponents of S. 1955 are so confident that their approach is \nthe best, let's let the States choose for themselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, it was agreed that each \nSenator would be limited to 10 minutes under morning business. The \nSenator has exceeded that time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. From monitoring the various reform approaches that are \ntaking place around the country, it is far more likely that we might \nlearn from those efforts to actually find a mutual solution to the \nproblem than to\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\ncontinue to have needless health care debates on the Senate floor. Just \nas States passed expansions of coverage for children prior to Federal \nenactment of the State Children's Health Insurance Act, we should once \nagain let the States lead the way to reform. When the passions of this \nweek die down and there appears to be nothing left standing, I hope \npeople will take a serious look at the bipartisan legislation Senator \nVoinovich and I, Senators Akaka and DeWine have introduced. It is \nsupported by groups such as the American Hospital Association, the \nAmerican Medical Association, the National Association of Community \nHealth Centers, and numerous other national and community-based \norganizations.\n  As speaker after speaker has noted, it is well past the appropriate \ntime to act. I hope we can act and actually legislate in this area \nduring this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, many Members over the last several days \nhave come to talk about health care, specifically the effects on small \nbusiness. I know my colleague didn't mean it the way it sounded, that \nthis was a ``needless'' debate about health policy. It is a very needed \ndebate about health policy.\n  In North Carolina, 98 percent of the firms with employees are \nconsidered small business. Small business is who we are here to \nrepresent in this piece of legislation. Small business is the American \nbusiness today that can't afford to offer health care as a benefit to \nits employees. Why? Because small business has few employees. They \ndon't have the ability to negotiate in the volume that large \ncorporations do.\n  Some have argued this is not a crisis. In North Carolina, we have 1.3 \nmillion uninsured North Carolinians; 900,000 of that 1.3 million are \nindividuals in a family or on their own where an individual works full \ntime. There is somebody in the family who works full time in that \nhouse, be it the individual or a family member, who would have the \noption to be insured under this bill, at least individually or, if not, \nunder a family plan, and our uninsured population from North Carolina \ncould go from 1.3 million to 400,000 with the passage of one piece of \nlegislation.\n  This is not a needless debate. This is a needed debate. This is a \npopulation that today has two choices--nothing and nothing. Because an \nemployer has found that health insurance is cost prohibitive. What is \nthe employer's choice? I can provide you health care, but I can't stay \nin business. What good have we done for the employees, whether they are \nin North Carolina or anywhere else, if the option is, I can give you a \nbenefit, but I can't keep you employed? This is to attempt to try to \nbring the same ability that big business has to small business, to \nnegotiate as an association, as a group. This is the most natural thing \nI could think of that we could do to begin to relieve the pressure.\n\n  Does it solve health care? Absolutely not. It will take much more \npressure from the American people for us to tackle the real structural \nchanges needed in health care. But let me relate some stories from \nNorth Carolina and around the country. This comes from Hickory, NC. \nThis woman owns a custom plumbing and heating business. She says she \nwould like to be able to offer her employees and their families \naffordable health care coverage.\n\n       As a parent and employer, I know the importance of having \n     affordable insurance and the financial devastation that \n     occurs when you have no coverage. Unfortunately, there has to \n     be a tradeoff.\n\n  She says she only has one of two options to keep her doors open--\neither employees have no insurance or they don't have a livable wage.\n  Another one from an area in North Carolina, a small business owner \nhas provided health insurance for his employees at no cost to them for \nthe past 10 years. However, every 2 or 3 years he spends at least 2 \nmonths shopping for insurance because he knows that the rate increase \nis coming. We have all faced that. He would like to continue to provide \ninsurance for his employees but he doesn't think he can hold out much \nlonger.\n  Think about the employees. Think about the families.\n  This one is from Greenville, SC, a small business owner who says that \nproviding health insurance is becoming unbearable for small businesses \nsuch as hers. She calls it a ``hardship.'' She is a widow. She is self-\nemployed. Her health insurance is an expense she can hardly afford. \nSimilar to many of her employees, she has a $5,000 deductible, and her \nmonthly premium consistently increases 35 to 40 percent every 6 months. \nThis is unbearable. It is not something that she can stand, and it is \nnot something that we should strap the American people with. But small \nbusiness after small business, State by State, is faced with the same \nthing today: They can't buy with the effective tools that large \ncorporations can.\n  We have spent over 30 hours debating whether we would even proceed to \ndebate the bill. This is incredible. Now we are getting to a point \nwhere we will debate the bill and we will consider amendments. We may \nconsider alternatives such as my colleague from Arkansas will discuss. \nBut make no mistake, this is a very needed debate. This is not a \nneedless debate about health policy. This is one that we have needed to \nhave. We have needed to have a policy in place for years now. It is \nincredible to me that we could think that small business can continue \nto hold on just like the fingertips on a windowsill.\n  Across the country, the No. 1 issue facing small business today is \nthe rising cost and the lack of access to quality health care. Earlier \nthis week, we debated liability reform, something that is driving \ndoctors out of the profession, that is affecting new medical students \nas they choose a specialty, where they are shying away from specialties \nlike neurology, OB/GYN, things that to a population that is growing \nolder and a population that we want to repopulate, as families decide \nto have children, are absolutely vital.\n  But we were denied the ability to proceed, denied the ability to go \nto a debate because people said we don't have a liability problem in \nAmerica. Yet I gave a firsthand story about a friend of mine who is a \nnephrologist. I don't even know what that is. But he told me this: We \nare likely not to get sued. He told me that in the past 2 years his \npremium has gone up 300 percent. Some come to this floor, and they say \nthis is not a crisis. We don't have a problem. Medical liability does \nnot contribute to the rising cost of health care.\n  Any place in health care that experiences a 300-percent increase in a \nmatter of years has an inflationary factor on everybody's health care. \nThat is one example of a profession that is not the most likely to be \nsued, as are the OB/GYNs, the neurosurgeons. But we were denied the \nability to move forward. It took us 30 hours to be able to debate the \nassets that we find in S. 1955. Is it perfect? No. Is it a carefully \ncrafted piece of legislation that incorporates the State insurance \ncommissioners who are in the business of regulating insurance products? \nAbsolutely. It incorporates everything that everybody who sat around \nthe table who had an interest in this said had to be there. Change one \nlittle piece, and now you have affected all the moving parts that \nexist.\n  What are we trying to do? We are trying to make sure that small \nbusiness has the opportunity, if they choose, to provide for their \nemployees' health care coverage. Anybody who would be against that, I \ncan only assume that the only way they want to provide health care \ncoverage is if the Government provides it.\n  I will tell everybody a story. I was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives 12 years ago. I worked for a small business, less than \n50 employees. When I came here, I had an option of all the choices I \ncould choose for insurance. I chose the company and the exact same plan \nthat I had before in a company of 50 employees. What was the only \ndifference in my health care coverage? It cost me $50 more a month to \nbe a Federal employee and to have that health insurance. But there are \nsome up here who suggest that the Federal Government should negotiate \neverybody's health insurance. From firsthand experience, the Federal \nGovernment is the last one I want negotiating anything for me. I would \nbe willing to bet that my constituents feel the same way.\n  Ask the business owners I referred to if they want the Federal \nGovernment negotiating their health care policies. Absolutely not. They \nwant the option of being able to offer health insurance.\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\nThese employees today have two choices--nothing and nothing. This \ndebate is very simple. It is about whether we are going to offer them \nsomething versus nothing. This is a debate that is well past due. It is \na debate that has to be completed. I am not convinced today that this \nbill will find it to final passage. I think it will get blocked. I \nthink it will be filibustered.\n  I think Members of this body will, in fact, block the consideration. \nIn North Carolina, this will block 900,000 individuals who could have \nhealth insurance who, because somebody here decides we are not going to \nmove forward, won't have that option. Their choices tomorrow will be \nnothing and nothing.\n  Health insurance costs are on a track to becoming the largest portion \nof an employer's total benefit package--more so than what employers are \nputting into retirement plans or 401(k)s.\n  Madam President, I am going to continue to come to this floor, and I \nam going to continue to talk about real people across this country, not \njust in North Carolina--the ones who have the horrors of no choices and \ncannot continue to afford the policies they have, the employers who \nreally do want to offer their employees a benefit because it enables \nthat employee to stay with them. I am going to continue to read these \nstories in hopes that my colleagues on the other side will understand \nthat this is about real people, that for once maybe they will look at \nthe human face of this issue and understand that there are casualties \nall across this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I, too, would like to echo the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, that this is a debate which is extremely critical. \nIt is an issue which is--particularly from my standpoint--one that I \nget most consistently when I return home to Arkansas. I don't think the \ndebate is whether it is a critical issue for us to discuss and come up \nwith a solution; the critical question here is, Are we really doing our \nbest? Are we really working hard to produce the best product we \npossibly can for the constituency that really needs us the most?\n  Small businesses are our No. 1 employer in Arkansas. They are the \nengine of our economy all across this great Nation. There is no doubt \nthat they deserve the same quality of health care we have here as \nMembers of Congress.\n  The Senator mentioned that, as he left small business and came to \nWashington, his premiums went up. The statistics show us that the \npremiums for Federal employees rise at a disproportionately lower \npercentage rate than the premiums rise in the small business market. We \nhave seen drastic increases in the premiums in the small business \nmarket over the last several years. However, while we also, as Federal \nemployees, have seen increases in our premiums, they have not been \nanything compared to the increases that have been seen in the small \nbusiness marketplace. So there may have been some changes, but the \npoint is that we have a good product that we enjoy as Members of \nCongress. The quality control on what we have is tremendous because we \nadhere to the State mandates and what States have seen in their States \nto be important to their constituency.\n  All States are different, but most of the States are consistent when \nit comes to things such as diabetes, maternity care, well baby care, \nimmunization, cancer screening--things that have really made a \ndifference not only in people's quality of life but also in terms of \nthe cost of health care. States such as Connecticut actually cover \nanything--or mandate the coverage of Lyme disease because in \nConnecticut you actually see a prevalence of that. States have the \nchoice. It is the State's right to be able to make sure that what their \nconstituency wants in that product is going to be there. I believe that \nhas worked very well. It is something we want to maintain. It is a \nquality control we enjoy, and there is no reason small businesses \nshould not, also.\n  Madam President, I wish to comment and lend my voice to the fact that \nthis is a critical debate, one about making sure we are providing for \nevery other American out there, particularly in small businesses, the \nsame opportunities and the quality of health care we enjoy.\n  I wish to address some of the issues that have been brought up in \nthis debate that I have heard about the bill that I have worked hard on \nover the last 3 or 4 years--a bill Senator Durbin and I helped each \nother put together after realizing what a great job the Federal \nGovernment had done in bringing the best of what Government can do in \nits oversight and the best of what private industry and competition in \nthe marketplace can bring. It brings it to us as Federal employees and \nMembers of Congress, and has for over 40 years, and it keeps down an \nadministrative cost that is drastically lower than private plans out in \nthe small business marketplace. At some point, it is somewhere around \n25, or plus, percentage points lower in terms of administrative costs, \nwhich is practical in this day and age and something that is essential.\n  I applaud Senator Enzi in his effort and hard work at bringing about \nthis issue and focusing on how important it is. I hope that the debate \nand our willingness to work to produce a good product is genuine and \nthat we can actually do what is best for the American people and that \nwe don't get caught up in a lot of the details of procedure here so \nthat we miss the forest for the trees.\n  On the other side of the aisle, they have argued that our bill is \njust another costly Government program, which will cost taxpayers a ton \nof money. We are getting ready to spend a ton of money tomorrow in \nextending tax cuts that haven't even expired and don't expire for \nseveral years. We are going to spend a tremendous amount of money--$50 \nbillion plus--on extending those tax cuts which don't even come up for \nexpiration for another couple of years.\n  Here we have an opportunity to provide a tax cut to small business \nthat could actually make an immediate impact on bringing down their \ncost of health insurance for themselves and their employees. This is \nkind of the first time I have ever noticed my colleagues on the other \nside, who all of a sudden don't want to provide a tax cut to small \nbusiness because it costs. Yet we are going to have multiple tax cuts \nbrought before us that come at a tremendous cost to the Government and \nto the deficit, and we don't even need them yet. Yet here is an \nopportunity to provide a direct tax cut, a credit, to small businesses \nto engage in the health care marketplace, encourage them to provide \nmuch needed health insurance for their employees, for themselves, and \nfor the self-employed, and all of a sudden it is a cost that is just \nout of control. But if you look at that cost, it is amazing. It is \nmaybe a third of the cost of the HSA that the President has been \nproposing. Yet we have the possibility and capacity under this plan to \nserve millions more Americans with health insurance--health insurance \nthat is backed by the State mandate and the Office of Personnel \nManagement, a proven negotiator, that negotiates for us, Members of \nCongress. So I just have a real problem with that argument.\n\n  The fact is that SEHBP won't create any new bureaucracy. Our plan \nwill be run by the same agency that runs the health care program for \nall Federal employees and Members of Congress. The administrative costs \nare less than 1 percent. There is no new bureaucracy created. It \nalready exists in the Office of Personnel Management. We might have to \nincrease some of those people in that office, but we don't know what is \ngoing to happen at the Department of Labor, which is charged with \nimplementing Senator Enzi's plan. There is no one in the Department of \nLabor who has ever done that. There is no part of that agency designed \nor created in order to do that. We would have to reinvent the wheel to \nprovide a section of the Department of Labor that would be able to \ninstitute the Enzi bill.\n  In fact, most of the costs, as I have said, of our benefit plan for \nsmall businesses come in the form of a tax cut. So our costs are not \nadministrative. We actually bring those down. Our costs are not an \nimplementation. Our costs are providing the assistance to small \nbusiness to actually get into the marketplace because we know that the \nmore small businesses that get into the marketplace, the greater the \npool.\n  I doubt there is anyone here who will argue with the fact that the \nreal key to\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\nproviding good, quality, low-cost, consistent health insurance is in \nthe volume of the pool because we all want to make sure that \ncompetition in the marketplace is what is driving the issue here. When \nyou have a larger pool to negotiate with private industry, you are \ngoing to be able to negotiate a better deal. It is a better deal for \neverybody.\n  Forty-six million Americans are not getting health insurance now. \nDisproportionately, the largest percentage of those 46 million are \nworking in small businesses. They are not getting health insurance. \nHealth insurance companies should love the idea of being able to \nincrease their market share with those numbers of people. In fact, we \nhave worked hard over the last 2 or 3 years with the insurance industry \nto make sure that what we were creating was improvement on what was \nalready in existence other than the Federal plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I believe it is so important that we \nheed the words of most of our parents, I am sure, when we were growing \nup, and those are: If it is worth doing, it is worth doing right.\n  We enjoy, as Federal employees, an incredible opportunity to provide \nhealth insurance for ourselves and for our families which provides \nreal, substantial quality. It is not something we buy into with the \nidea that we will never get sick; we buy into it knowing that maybe we \nare just one automobile accident or one chronic illness away from \nneeding comprehensive health insurance.\n  The increases my colleague from North Carolina talked about in terms \nof the number of people who would be added, those are immediate and \nthey are temporary. They are mostly young, healthy people. The fact is \nthat if we don't include everybody and we don't make sure all of the \ndifferent chronic illnesses that exist out there are going to be \noffered, those who are less healthy are going to be shut out, they will \nbecome more costly, and the first time one of those young individuals, \nhealthy individuals, has an accident or reaches a chronic condition, \nthey too are not going to be covered under this plan. So I hope we will \nheed the idea that it is important to do what is right.\n  We have an opportunity here, at no additional cost. We could \neliminate it, if the other side doesn't want to provide a tax cut to \nsmall business, that is OK. But we should maintain the quality, and I \nhope my colleagues will join me in that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I was here about 15 minutes ago, and I \nlearned one inevitable fact: this body is long on rhetoric and \noftentimes short on results. In the case of health insurance and health \ncoverage for the American people, we stand at a point in time when we \nhave a chance to produce real results.\n  I have listened to the arguments over the last couple of days. In \nfact, I presided last night and got to listen to some of these negative \narguments about S. 1955. I wish to try, in a positive way, to talk \nabout the result that it affords and brings to the American people. I \nwant to do it by, first of all, trying to establish credibility.\n  The reason I say that is, most of us come to the Chamber and speak \noftentimes on subjects about which we have had few life experiences. \nMost of the Members--certainly a majority--have never really been in \nthe private sector. Certainly, a lot have not been independent \ncontractors. None of us right now are in the marketplace for health \ninsurance in America.\n  For 33 years before coming to the Senate, I ran a small business. I \nhad 200 employees but 800 independent contractors. My employees had \nmedical benefits because we qualified under ERISA. My independent \ncontractors, who were my salespeople, the assets of the company, \nbecause of Federal law and IRS treatment, were not allowed to be \noffered a benefit. They were subject to the free market, to buy spot \ninsurance. They weren't the young and healthy. They were middle age, \nsecond- and third-career people, mostly women, and some men. They were \nvery difficult people to cover in the spot market.\n  As a legislator during those 33 years, while I ran a small business, \nI did a ton of work on health care. In fact, I was the author of one of \nthe State mandates in Georgia for direct access for dermatological \ncoverage. I did so for a passionate reason: I am the survivor of a \nmelanoma. My doctor caught it in time, and it was removed in time, and \nI am here today. I have great respect for that mandate for direct \naccess.\n  As some of the people who have spoken--in fact, many on the other \nside have talked about the horrible thing this bill does by not \nincluding all of the mandates required of all of the States in this \ncountry. And the ads we see in some of the periodicals we read portend \nwe are removing the possibility of people to have coverages that are \nmandated in their States. Let me address that and make the record \nstraight.\n\n  Currently, in the United States, there are 109 mandated medical \ncoverages in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. My State of \nGeorgia has 39. This bill doesn't preclude any of those from being \noffered, but it doesn't mandate that they be offered, and it doesn't \nallow small businesses to associate across the Nation, form a large \nenough risk pool to be competitive in the marketplace and be able to \ncompete and provide insurance to the American people who do not have \ninsurance.\n  The first fantasy that has been purported as fact is that this bill \ntakes away mandates. It doesn't take a mandate away from a single \nperson who has it. What it does is give people who don't have any \ninsurance at all the chance to get good, solid, basic health care, and \nwhen they get it, when they make their purchase decision, this requires \nthey make that decision by being shown, at the same time they are \npresented with a basic policy, a policy that contains all the mandates \ncontained in the five most populous States in the country. The consumer \ngets the choice that right now they do not have.\n  For the other side to allege we are taking away benefits, what we are \ndoing is providing opportunity to folks who have no opportunity. I defy \nyou to be 45 years old, a working carpenter with a wife and two kids, \nout in the marketplace trying to buy spot insurance. Can you buy it? \nSure, if you want to pay $2,000, $2,500 a month, a price you can't \nafford to pay and put food on the table and shelter as well. So what do \nthey do? They fly without coverage. When they get sick and they are \nreally sick, they go to emergency rooms, and they end up raising the \ncost of health care to everybody, which raises the cost of health \ninsurance to everybody.\n  What this bill does and what Chairman Enzi has done, which is the \ngenius of it, it brings forth the ability of small businesses and \npeople who cannot afford the coverage to go into the marketplace and \nbuy health insurance.\n  On the mandate issue, there is no question that some of the insurance \nthat will come out of this process will not include every mandate, \nmaybe not all of the mandates, maybe not half the mandates. But what it \nwill include is good, basic health care, and if a family that doesn't \nhave good, basic health care coverage now all of a sudden has it, what \nhappens? They start practicing better health. They start having more \nwellness. They start seeing physicians before they are sick rather than \nafter they are sick and in pain. What happens is, we have more \nwellness, more preventive health care, and we have a lower cost of \nhealth care in this country to all the Americans who have coverage.\n  For the other side to say that what we are trying to do is take \nbenefits away from people is disingenuous and wrong. We are trying to \npreserve the benefits of people in America, and to the 45 million who \ndon't have any, we are trying to give them the opportunity.\n  For those who think the State knows best and therefore we ought to \nmandate they can't do this, they are denying choice of the most basic \nneed in the United States of America, and that is the choice for a man \nand a woman and their children to be covered in the medical needs they \nhave.\n  I can tell you that I spent most of my time running my business \ntrying to make sure there was some access to affordable health care for \nthose independent contractors to whom I could\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\nnot legally provide it. Over the 20 years I ran the company, it became \nmore and more difficult. And over those same 20 years, the cost of \nhealth insurance went higher, higher, and higher. It went higher \nbecause the mandates became more and more difficult to provide to those \nindividuals, in part because of the State mandates as well.\n  This opens a new door. It opens hope and opportunity for 45 million \nAmericans. It gives us the chance to cover maybe 11 million, maybe 12, \nmaybe 13. Senator Burr thinks 900,000 in North Carolina. The number I \nhave heard for Georgia is the same. But whatever the number, S. 1955 \noffers hope and opportunity for affordable health insurance and better \nhealth care to millions of Americans. It takes away mandates from no \none and ensures that the customer always has the choice of buying the \nproduct and the coverage they want and they can afford.\n  Chairman Enzi and the committee have done a great service to the \nAmerican people. It is time for this Senate to do great service to \ntheir constituents. Give them a chance to have access to affordable, \naccessible health insurance for the 45 million Americans who do not \nhave it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Who yields time? The Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes, but each Senator has been \nallotted no more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is my understanding that there is no request for \nuse of time on our side, so I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nuse all of the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are in the midst of Health Week. \nApparently, during Health Week, we don't pass any of the bills the \nAmerican people want but, rather, we schedule procedural votes.\n  Why aren't we taking up something such as stem cell research? That is \nwhat the American people want to see us do. There is such value in the \nuse of stem cells for research and potential treatment of all types of \ndiseases. Despite all the promises of stem cell research, we are not \nworking on it this week. This week we are simply doing our political \nstuff: posturing for the next election.\n  There are other important health care issues besides stem cell \nresearch that we could be taking up; namely, Medicare. We should be \ndiscussing that on the floor of the Senate. We should be passing \nlegislation to extend the Medicare enrollment date past May 15.\n  Right now, under the present Medicare drug plan, if you don't sign up \nby this coming Monday, you will be penalized permanently for signing up \nlate.\n  Millions of Americans are having serious problems understanding this \noutrageously complex Medicare plan, but the administration, the \nPresident of the United States is saying: Hurry up and make the choice, \nwe are not going to extend the enrollment date. It is insulated from \nwhat reality is. It is too bad.\n  In New Jersey, seniors have to choose among 45 plans offered by 19 \nproviders, and we are saying rush, rush, rush. Most people can't get \nthrough the language, no less the dates and those requirements. But the \nadministration is saying to my constituents that even though their \nhealth is at issue, they have to rush to a decision. It sounds like \nthis is a deadline that nothing can move and, unfortunately, that is \nthe truth coming from this administration.\n  If we want to talk about health initiatives, Republican health \ninitiatives, let's talk about the one that is in place, this horrible \nnew Medicare plan.\n  We have seen the Republican model of health care, and it is not \npretty. In fact, many have called it a disaster. One need only pick up \nthe local newspapers to see this disaster play out from Maui to Miami, \nfrom Portland, OR, to Portland, ME. The new Medicare drug plan is \nfailing our seniors.\n  We see it demonstrated in this placard in the headlines: The Boston \nGlobe:\n\n       Many seniors say Medicare drug plan will not help them.\n\n  Newsday:\n\n       Medicare guide is in need of Rx.\n\n  The New York Times:\n\n       Drug plan enrollment opens amid confusion.\n\n  It goes through all of these well-known newspapers, showing the \nopinions they are hearing from their constituents.\n  How did we get there? This Medicare Part D Program is an example of \nthe majority vision for the future of health care in our Nation. One \nthing that is pretty clear about Medicare Part D is that whoever wrote \nit was clearly not focusing on the health of our seniors, and if the \ngoal were to help our seniors, there would not be this thing called the \ndonut hole, a gap in coverage.\n  Many Americans have not heard about it or don't know what this \ncoverage gap is. When I explain it to people listening at home, they \nare not even going to believe it. But it is true because I have heard \nabout it when I address people all across our State.\n  The way the program works is that for many people, in the middle of \nthe year when you have spent $2,250 on drugs, which is not a lot of \nmoney considering the drug use for preserving health and for prolonging \nlife, their prescription drug coverage will stop at $2,250. They will \nnot have any coverage, but they will still have to pay the premium.\n  What does that mean? It means that sometime in the summer or fall of \nthis year, millions of Americans will walk into a pharmacy for their \nmedication and the pharmacist is going to ask them for hundreds of \ndollars in payment. When the person says, Wait a minute, I have \nMedicare, the pharmacist will say: Yes, but you are in the donut hole, \nwhen you don't get any benefit until you reach spending over $5,100; so \nyou will have to pay the full price now.\n  It makes no sense. It is hard to understand, but unfortunately it is \ntrue and it is happening. My office has been contacted by constituents \nwho experience this problem, and we are trying to help them, but this \nis only the beginning.\n  Another senseless component of the Republican Medicare law is the \nprohibition that prevents Medicare--can you believe this--prevents \nMedicare from negotiating prices directly with the pharmaceutical \ncompanies. The VA permits that and the discounts are significant. But \nyou can't do that in Medicare because the focus is to protect the \ncompanies rather than it is to protect the citizens.\n  I come from New Jersey, home of the world's leading drug companies. \nAnd I admire these companies. Their discoveries have saved the lives of \nuntold millions of people. To be quite honest, they are often targets \nof unfair criticism. But I don't see any reason to prohibit Medicare \nfrom negotiating prices with these companies. Medicare, the largest \nhealth care system in the entire world, is prevented from negotiating \nwith these companies. The Republican Medicare law prohibits Medicare \nfrom negotiating for a good price, and there is no valid reason for it.\n  When I talk with my constituents about this new Medicare law, all of \nthem ask the same question: Why is this program so complicated? That is \na good question. The program is complicated because the people who \nwrote it were not focused on helping seniors. Rather, they were focused \non promoting ideology. The Republican ideology is now destroying \nMedicare because it is based on the need to privatize everything, \noutsource Medicare.\n  If the goal were to help seniors get their prescription drugs, the \nresult would not be so complicated. We can't blame seniors and their \nfamilies for being confused when we present them with the kind of \ncomplex picture they see.\n  The Democrats invented Medicare, and when it comes to serving the \nAmerican people, running an effective Government, we do know how to do \nit. I think it is pretty obvious now in the wake of this Medicare mess \nand the bungled response to Hurricane Katrina that there is little \nability to run our Government. It doesn't seem to work. Incompetence \nruns rampant.\n  Why can't they run a Government? Because they always want to farm out \nthe hard work to the companies--Halliburton, the HMOs, and the list \ngoes on and on. They even want to outsource our air traffic control \nsystem. Remember that fight? And that still looms in front of us. I \nwill give you a real-world\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\nexample of why the Republican insistence on privatizing Medicare is \nhurting America's seniors. In one of my local papers back in New \nJersey, the Bergen Record, there was an article about a pharmacist who \nhas been trying very hard under tough circumstances to help his \ncustomers with this new Medicare program. One of the customers needed a \n25-milligram version of a drug because her doctor found that the 50-\nmilligram pill was causing too many side effects. When the pharmacist \nfilled the 25-milligram prescription, the Medicare drug plan, run by \nUnited Healthcare, said they will not cover the 25-milligram, the \nsmaller milligram, version. It is hard to understand.\n\n  United Healthcare told the pharmacist to cut the 50-milligram pills \nin half. The pharmacist correctly told the insurance company that it \nwas a sustained-release drug and cutting it in half would make the pill \nineffective. After waiting for some time on hold with United \nHealthcare, the pharmacist was told the customer would have to go back \nto her doctor and ask the doctor to file an appeal with United \nHealthcare, looking for special permission to get the smaller dose of \nthe pill.\n  That is what real seniors are going through every hour, every day \nunder this drug program.\n  I want to talk about United Healthcare in particular. United \nHealthcare paid its CEO, William McGuire, $124 million last year. That \nis right. The CEO of United Healthcare made almost $124 million in \n2005. Now, if they were making widgets, that would be all right. But \nthey are supplying health care to seniors and having this man walk away \nwith millions of dollars--when the people who need health care are \npaying for it--it is not right. Those people are paying for that kind \nof a salary, that kind of an asset base.\n  The seniors in my State are upset, while the real beneficiaries of \nthe Republican Medicare bill are still paid these outrageous salaries. \nIt doesn't make sense. It is a disgrace.\n  The question has been asked: Should we scrap this program and do a \nreal Medicare drug benefit? Maybe. But I would say this to the American \npeople: As long as the same group is running this Congress, you are \ngoing to see more of the same happening. All we have to do is look at \nthe condition that we find ourselves in over in Iraq, not knowing \nwhether we are going or whether we are staying, and lives are still \nbeing lost. The cost for that war is going to be somewhere around half \na trillion dollars before this year is over, and we are funding it with \nsupplementals that carry all kinds of pork-laden projects. The \nmanagement is terrible.\n  Management of the environment is terrible, when we look at what is \nhappening and we see that snowfields in Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa \nthat were there since the beginning of time will no longer be there in \na few years, when we see that Glacier National Park will soon not have \na glacier there, having had glaciers there since the beginning of time. \nThe glaciers are melting in front of our eyes. If you look at pictures \nof animals up in Alaska, such as the polar bear, they are scrawny. They \ndon't have the body size they should have when they are not getting \nsufficient nourishment. There is nothing being done about that. There \nis nothing being done about global warming as the Earth that we live on \ngets warmer and as the threats of flooding all over the seacoast States \nand communities becomes more and more apparent. So there is a question \nof competency that we have to look at. It is certainly not reflected in \nthis Medicare plan.\n  Although it is late, I wish the President would show some good \nheartedness and say: You know what, seniors of America, we are going to \nhelp you. We know you can't get through this Medicare drug plan in \ntime, so what we are going to do is delay it a few months. What is the \nbig deal? I don't get it. Instead of permitting people to adequately \nreview these plans so they can understand what they are getting into, \nthere is a push to sign up. It is one that I don't understand.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4257-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4257-S4259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH PLANS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am going to speak under morning business \non Senate bill 1955, the small business health plans legislation that \nis going to be before us shortly for formal debate. I come to the floor \nto talk about a piece of legislation that is important to my Colorado \nconstituents. I would like to talk about the Health Insurance \nMarketplace Modernization Act, sometimes known as HIMMA.\n  This legislation, which is also known as the small business health \nplans bill, would allow for small businesses to come together to form a \ngroup which could then use their combined purchasing power to influence \ninsurance companies for affordable health plans.\n  It has been suggested that those who serve in the Senate have no \nunderstanding of what small business folks are going through and that \nmost of us have never been faced with the reality of having no health \ninsurance and therefore don't understand the plight of the small \nbusinessman. I come to dispel that rumor. I am a former small \nbusinessman who couldn't afford the cost of health insurance for myself \nor for my employees.\n  My wife and I discussed options for ourselves and for our employees. \nSimilar to many other small business owners across the country, we \ndecided it would be better to raise our employees' rate of pay and \nallow them to purchase their own individual plans. My wife and I \ndecided to begin setting aside our own savings account to pay for \nhealth care costs in case, for some reason or another, I had an \nincident or she had an incident where we needed to go to the hospital \nand thus needed health care coverage.\n  Being a veterinarian and lifting heavy dogs onto the exam table all \nthe time, and not expecting the dog owner to pick up the other half of \na giant breed such as a Great Dane, I ended up having back problems and \nhad to have back surgery. I didn't have health insurance, but I paid \nfor it myself out of my own pocket. Fortunately, my wife and I had the \nforesight to set aside a savings plan so that if something such as this \ndid happen, we could pay for it. But it did set us back.\n\n  We were able to survive that particular incident. It was kind of an \ninteresting thing, what happened to me when I went to go to the \nhospital. The administrators didn't want me to go into the hospital. \nThe hospital would not let us in because we did not have health \ninsurance. I said: Well, I will pay for it. When we got in there, I had \nthe surgery, and I did very well, and I am very active today. The \ndoctors did a great job on surgery. When we checked out of the \nhospital, the administrator said that they would reduce our costs by 20 \npercent because they did not have to deal with the paperwork and with \nthe cost of having to process my claim. So much of the paperwork is \ndriven by trying to protect the hospital, the doctors, and the \nadministrators from frivolous lawsuits. That has been my personal \nexperience.\n  I must admit I was disappointed when, earlier in the week, Members of \nthe Senate chose to side with trial lawyers instead of women and \nchildren. And I was disappointed that Members of the Senate decided to \nsupport turning the medical profession into a cash cow for the legal \nprofession instead of allowing for legitimate compensation.\n  Again, in a matter of minutes, we will be debating the small business \nhealth plans bill and another attempt to bring down the high cost of \nhealth care, specifically for working class families who are employed \nby small businesses that, similar to my own situation, cannot afford to \nprovide health insurance for their employees.\n  I think it is important for us to focus this debate on at least \ngiving small businesses the opportunity to make a choice on providing \nhealth care for themselves and for their employees. Currently, because \nof the prohibitive cost of health care coverage for their employees, \nmany small business employers don't even have the option of offering \ncoverage.\n  Some of my constituents have brought to my attention over the past \nfew weeks their worries that because of the lack of insurance benefit \nmandates, they could lose important benefits such\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nas diabetes services and supplies, and coverage of preventive services \nsuch as colorectal screenings and mammograms. These worries are \nunfounded. Today there are over 1,800 different State mandates for \nhealth care coverage, including different coverage mandates in \ndifferent States for the same preventive care, services, and supplies. \nThis huge variation in mandates has made it nearly impossible to \nprovide standardized coverage on a national basis.\n  Additionally, the Government Accountability Office, which is an \nagency which helps to watch our dollars, has also found that the cost \nof mandates to a typical plan results in an increase between 5 and 22 \npercent. The Congressional Budget Office, another dollar-watching \nagency, estimates that for every 1 percent increase in insurance costs, \na minimum of 200,000 Americans are left uninsured.\n  Facts suggest that things such as diabetes services and supplies and \npreventive services such as mammograms and colorectal screenings are \nusually covered by health plans, regardless of the State mandates. For \nexample, the five most populous States require that diabetes care be \ncovered. According to the American Diabetic Association and the GAO, \nonly 4 out of 50 States do not require diabetic coverage.\n  The General Accounting Office also studied States that are not \nsubject to mandated coverages of diabetic services and supplies. \nDespite not being subject to mandated requirements for coverage, \nseveral of the largest plans and many of the largest Fortune 500 \ncompanies provide comprehensive coverage for diabetes care.\n  This factual evidence also applies to preventive services such as \ncancer screening. The Government Accountability Office found that the \nmajority of States that do not have mandates continue to provide \ncoverage in a majority of their employer plans for cancer screening.\n  The bottom line is that the small business health plan bill makes \nlogical sense. It will give small business owners what they want and \nwhat they need, and they will offer insurance coverage for their \nemployees. It makes logical sense that plans covering preventive care \nwill be offered because preventive care costs less in the long run. It \nmakes logical sense that small business owners who currently cannot \nprovide their employees with health care would purchase coverage \nbecause it is more affordable.\n  It is important to note at this point that a small business owner who \nbuys health care coverage is also naturally subject to the same health \ncare coverage that he provides his employees. Small business owners are \npushing for health insurance coverage for themselves and their \nemployees, which they otherwise could not afford. It is not logical \nthat they would pay money for a plan that does not provide them with \nmedical coverage. Also, the point of small business health plans is so \nthat small businesses can join together to use joint collaboration to \nget their health care needs met.\n  I support the legislation because I support giving small businesses a \nchoice. I support giving small businesses the opportunity for health \ncare coverage that they currently do not receive. I support giving \ndiabetics the opportunity for health care coverage, instead of leaving \nthem completely without services and supplies. I support giving small \nbusiness employees the opportunity for cancer screening and preventive \ncare, instead of leaving them with nothing and no opportunity to \nprovide health care for themselves and their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the small business health plans \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Senate bill \n1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act. I urge my \nfellow Senators to give small businesses the opportunity to access \nhealth care for themselves and their employees.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to speak \nabout getting some long overdue help for small business men and women \nin Tennessee who have really been struggling to afford health insurance \nfor themselves, their employees, and their families. We have an \nopportunity in this body to do something about it. This is not some \nabstract discussion we are having here; this is about something every \nsingle one of us hears--at least I know I hear it. Whether I go to \nMountain City or Sevierville or Lexington or Memphis--wherever I go in \nTennessee, a small business man or woman says to me: We cannot afford \nhealth care costs; we need some help.\n  We have some help. We have a proposal by Senator Enzi that will \nprovide some help to small business men and women. Now is the time for \nus to act. Now is the time for the people of this country who are \nlistening to this, who know we need this, to say to Senators: Let's go. \nLet's do this. Let's take the Enzi bill and reduce health care costs \nfor small businesses across this country, and at the same time let's \ncut into the millions of Americans who are uninsured because the people \nfor whom they work cannot afford to offer them health care insurance.\n  Here is the situation in Tennessee. We have well over 2 million \npeople at work in Tennessee, and 97 percent of all businesses are what \nwe would call small businesses. So that is whom we are talking about in \nour State--more than 2 million people who work, many of whom are \nworking for companies that cannot afford to provide them health care \ninsurance or are gradually reaching the point where they can't give \nthem that benefit anymore. Increased health insurance costs are driving \nemployers and families away from comprehensive coverage. Increased \ncosts are taking away the opportunity for a working family in Tennessee \nto be able to work for a company that can offer a basic insurance \npolicy that the family and the employer can afford. What we are doing \nthis week is moving away from that situation. What we are doing in the \nSenate this week and next week is providing an opportunity to change \nthat situation.\n  Dennis Akin runs the Wash Wizard car wash in Hendersonville, TN. We \nare not talking about big-time CEOs who make $350 million a year and \nfly corporate jets somewhere. We are talking about Dennis Akin who runs \nthe Wash Wizard car wash in Hendersonville, TN, just outside of \nNashville. This is what he says:\n\n       I am currently providing health care for all my employees \n     and their families. The cost at the present time is over \n     $44,000 per year for 5 employees, up 28 percent from last \n     year. The premiums have escalated at about that rate for the \n     last several years, and twice I have had to drop to plans \n     with lesser coverage to be able to pay the premiums.\n\n  Dennis Akin went on to say:\n\n       We really need to be able to find some kind of relief or \n     we'll have to reduce our benefit level to where the financial \n     burden on my staff could be devastating. In a business as \n     small as mine health care costs are my largest expense and \n     there seems to be no end in sight.\n\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, about a third of Tennessee \nfirms with 50 or fewer employees offer health insurance to their \nemployees. In contrast, 95 percent of Tennessee firms with 50 or more \nemployees offer health insurance to their employees.\n  Our economy is not static. It changes all the time. Every year, we \nlose an estimated 5 to 8 percent of our jobs. That is a lot of jobs. \nThat is between 100,000 and 150,000 jobs just in Tennessee. The good \nnews is we have the strongest economy in the world and we are gaining \nmore jobs than we lose. But where do those jobs come from? They don't \nprimarily come from Federal Express or Eastman Chemical or the Aluminum \nCompany of America or DuPont. We are glad to have all those great \nemployers in Tennessee, but most of the new jobs come from the Wash \nWizard car wash in Hendersonville, TN, and companies like that. These \nare new companies, small companies. They may be adding two or three \nemployees a year. Currently, only a third of those firms, those firms \nwith 50 or fewer, can afford to offer health insurance of any kind to \ntheir employees.\n  What does that mean? That means that most Tennesseans are simply left \nwithout any access to health care that they can afford because in our \ncountry, the way things are today, most people\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\nget their health insurance from their employer. Maybe that is not the \nway it should be. Maybe 10 years from now, we will be in a different \nsort of system. But since World War II, that has been the way it has \nbeen. By an accident of our history, most Americans get their health \ninsurance at the place where they work.\n  What we are saying is, in States such as Tennessee, and all across \nthis country, only a third of the people who work for small \nbusinesses--which is where 97 percent of the people work--can get a \nhealth care plan there. No wonder we have a lot uninsured people, and \nno wonder we have a lot of families worrying about the rising cost of \nhealth care.\n  The reason we are having this debate is the chairman has a bill that \nwill fix that situation. It will lower health care costs for small \nbusinesses and help families be able to afford a basic health insurance \nplan. Every American ought to want that to succeed, and we need to pass \nthis bill. We need to do this, and it is important for the American \npeople to know that we intend to bring this to a vote in the next few \ndays.\n  The discrepancy between what is available in the big companies and \nwhat is available in the small, independent companies is absolutely \nunfair. There is no reason for it.\n  Earlier this month, the National Federation of Independent Business, \nTennessee's largest small business advocacy group, delivered 10,905 \npetitions in support of this bill signed by small business owners in \nTennessee who want lower health care costs. We must make health \ninsurance affordable for Tennessee's small business owners and for \nworking families.\n  How will the Enzi bill help? When I say the Enzi bill, that is the \nchairman of the committee who has worked on this bill and who has been \nable to work through a lot of obstacles that prevented this from \nhappening in the Senate before.\n  The Small Business Act--a fancy name is the Health Insurance \nMarketplace Modernization and Affordability Act--I, like Chairman Enzi, \nlike to call it the Small Business Health Insurance Act. That is a \npretty good name because that says what it does. Here is what it will \ndo.\n  It will allow businesses and trade associations to band their members \ntogether and offer group health insurance coverage on a national or \nregional basis.\n  It will empower small business owners and give them the opportunity \nto choose a health plan that is best for their families and best for \ntheir employees. This bill will promote lower costs and greater access \nto health care. Lower cost means the employer can afford it. The plan \nitself, with the employee contribution--if the employee can afford it--\nbeing available means there will be more access to it. It will do that \nby, No. 1, permitting the creation of fully insured small business \nhealth plans; No. 2, creating more options in benefit design--in other \nwords, you will have more choices; if you want this or this, if you \ncan't afford that, you can try this--and, No. 3, it harmonizes \ninsurance regulations across State lines while keeping States as the \nprimary regulators.\n  I am a former Governor. I am for States rights. You often see me on \nthe Senate floor asserting the principle of federalism. I believe \nstrong States and strong communities are important for our country and \nthat we ought not be constantly passing national solutions to problems \nwithout recognizing that.\n  But I believe the Enzi bill properly respects the principle of \nfederalism. It protects State oversight. It protects State authority. I \nalso believe it is important to have a level playing field for everyone \nin the market--and the bill does that as well.\n  A study prepared by the Milwaukee firm of Mercer Oliver Wyman for the \nNational Small Business Association found that the Enzi bill would, \none, reduce health insurance costs for small businesses by 12 percent, \nabout $1,000 per employer, and reduce the number of uninsured and \nworking families by 8 percent, approximately 1 million people \nnationwide would have basic health insurance who today don't have it.\n  This bill would cut the cost of health insurance for small \nbusinesses, which is 97 percent of where the people in my State work. \nThat is No. 1. No. 2, it reduces the number of uninsured and working \nfamilies by 1 million people across this country.\n  This is a piece of legislation worth passing. It actually does \nsomething for somebody. This is a rare opportunity to help small \nbusinesses. It is a real milestone moment, and Chairman Enzi is to be \ncommended for getting the bill this far.\n  The House of Representatives has passed this legislation, on which \nthe Presiding Officer served, and I am sure he has voted for it three, \nfour, or five times over in the House of Representatives. But then it \ngets over here to the Senate, and we have been in gridlock for 10 years \non this issue. The House of Representatives has passed this legislation \neight times, and for 10 years we haven't been able to find a way to say \nwe are going to reduce the health care costs for small businesses by 12 \npercent and decrease the number of Americans who are uninsured, that we \nare going to give 1 million of them insurance. That was until Chairman \nEnzi set his sights on trying to unravel the stalemate. He did it. He \ngot the small business community together with the insurance \ncommissioners and the insurance companies all around one table to \ndiscuss how to make it work.\n  We need to take advantage of this rare opportunity to help the small \nbusiness men and women in Tennessee and across this country to find \naffordable health insurance by passing this important legislation.\n  We have said on the Republican side that this is Health Week; that we \nhave heard the American people; we know that there are uninsured \nAmericans; and, we know that small businesspeople are struggling. They \nare struggling with the cost of runaway litigation. We are trying to \nstop that, but the other side of the aisle blocked that twice this week \nwhen we put up legislation that would have given mothers and babies a \nchance to be better served by OB/GYN doctors.\n  Who can be against that? The other side of the aisle was against it. \nThey basically kept Tennessee mothers who are pregnant from having a \nchance to be served by OB/GYN doctors. Now they have to drive a long \nway to have their babies. Unfortunately, they are going to have to keep \ndriving because the other side of the aisle said, no; you are not going \nto even be able to vote on that.\n  Now we have moved to the next issue that will help small business. If \nwe couldn't this week help mothers who are about to have babies by \ngiving them better access to health care, at the very least we can take \nthe Enzi bill and pass it and say to the thousands and thousands of \nrealtors, to the thousands and thousands of barbershops, gas stations, \nand say to Dennis Akin who runs the Wash Wizard car wash in \nHendersonville, TN, we can say to the small businesses in Tennessee--\nwhich is 97 percent of all the businesses--we will cut your insurance \ncosts by 12 percent, or at least give you that option, and to the \npeople of this country we will increase by 1 million the number who are \nable to get insurance.\n  This legislation is a good piece of legislation to help lower the \ncost of health insurance. I hope very much that in the next several \ndays we can pass it. The House has passed it eight times. We can at \nleast pass it once, and then the American people will see that we hear \nthem and we are doing the job they want us to do.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4259-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4259-S4262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will yield myself such time as I might \nuse.\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, we thought we would have a \ngood opportunity to have a good, healthy debate on a range of different \nhealth policy issues. This was designated as Health Week. A number of \nour colleagues had some very important amendments--some that are \nextraordinarily timely--one by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, to \naddress what is going to be effectively a new tax or fee on millions--\nthe best estimate is 8 million of our senior citizens--who are not \nenrolled in the Medicare Part D Program. That will cost seniors \nhundreds of millions of dollars if that is not the addressed. We have a \ngood opportunity to address that in the Senate.\n\n  We have the issues on stem cell research. That is enormously \nimportant legislation at the desk. The bill offers such extraordinary \nhope to millions who are affected by Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's \ndisease, diabetes, other genetic diseases. The possibilities are \nunlimited. I call it the hope bill because it offers so much hope. We \nthought we might have an opportunity to move forward on that. There are \na clear majority of Senate Members who are for a good stem cell \nresearch program.\n  We have passed a good program in my own State of Massachusetts, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike coming together, as we would on this \nlegislation, but we are not going to be able to address that issue.\n  The whole issue about whether we give the Medicare system the ability \nto negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs that could benefit our \nseniors is something the VA does and it does very effectively. It saves \nmillions and billions of dollars for our elderly people because of the \nability to get a better price, which Medicare is prohibited from doing \nnow. We believe we should at least have an opportunity to debate that \nissue and come to judgment on it. It can make a major difference. These \nare just several of the amendments out there.\n  I was looking forward to offering an amendment to the Enzi \nlegislation that permits States to opt out of the Enzi proposal, if \nthey so desired. It sounded to me that we had a vote on that issue in \nour Committee on Human Resources, and it was defeated. It seems to me \nwe should give the State the option.\n  We have had at least a pretty good discussion of the underlying Enzi \nbill, which effectively means skyrocketing premiums for many if they \nare older or have had some illness in their families. I will get into \nthat in greater detail. But we permit States to opt out. That was \ndefeated. We ought to have an opportunity to vote on that in the \nSenate.\n  All this can be done. I know the proponents of the amendments would \nbe willing to agree to very reasonable time limitations on this. \nHowever, we effectively are being told that is not going to be \npossible. We are going to have a take-it-or-leave-it approach. That is \nnot the wise way to proceed. I certainly hope we are not going to have \nto be required to take it.\n  I will review some of the statements and comments made by some of \nthose who have been in support of this legislation that need focus, \nattention, and some correction. Those who support the Enzi proposal are \ndoing it enthusiastically, but I think it is worthwhile to put the \nfacts out on the table. The facts are we have some 47 million Americans \nwho do not have health insurance. The fact remains, as we have seen in \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the Enzi proposal actually benefits \nsome 600,000. That is 1 percent of the 45 million who are uninsured.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, the Democratic leadership, with Sal \nDiMasi and President Travaglini coming together with Governor Romney, \nhave the goal of covering 95 percent, minimum. Most believe we will get \nto 98 percent of all the people in our State. It is a valuable \nundertaking.\n  We have a proposal with 45 million uninsured and we expect, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, some 600,000 will be included. That \nis from the assessment on page 5 from CBO.\n  In terms of the firms themselves, the CBO has pointed out one-quarter \nof all the small business firms will actually pay more for their health \nbenefits. Those that support it have neglected that. A quarter of all \nthe firms under the Enzi bill will have to pay more.\n  That is not true with the Durbin-Lincoln proposal, and the Durbin-\nLincoln proposal will cover millions--not 600,000--millions of small \nbusinesses.\n  These are some of the facts from CBO. The premium decrease, according \nto CBO, would be 2 percent to 3 percent, a one-time savings of only $80 \nto $120 for the average individual and $215 to $325 for a family plan. \nThe cost is lesser benefits. If you are going to eliminate your cancer \nscreening, your well-baby care, your help and support in terms of \ndiabetes, if you are going to eliminate the mental health benefits, \nsure, you can get some reduction in premium. That is what they do. But \nin State after State, including mine, we have those protections. That \nis the savings, one-time savings, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  For those who want to have a good understanding of exactly what this \nbill does and what it does not do, I hope they will have a chance to \nreview the CBO estimate and analysis because it is at odds with a great \ndeal of what those who have been supporting the proposal have stated. \nFinally, the total savings on employer-sponsored coverage are two-\ntenths of a percent.\n  On the other hand, let me mention an excellent analysis that has been \ndone by Alex Feldvebel, the deputy commissioner in New Hampshire and an \nexpert on this type of health insurance issue. These are his comments, \ntalking about the market relief. That is what we call the ratings. What \nis the swing in a particular State? States can vary the ratings in \nterms of the market.\n\n  In, Alaska 2.5 percent to 1; Arkansas 3.3 to 1; California, 1.2 to 1. \nIf you are an older person, older worker, if your family has maybe had \nsome illness, you can only vary the premiums 1.2 percent in the State \nof California. In my State, it is 3 percent, 3 to 1. There are a number \nof States, such as New York, where you cannot change it. You cannot \nvary it. Everyone is in the same boat, so to speak.\n  Now, in the Enzi proposal, listen to this regarding the ratings, the \npermitted rate variation under this small group market rules is \nextreme. The total permitted variation between the highest rate group \nand the lowest rate group for the same health benefit is 25.4 to 1, or \n2,540 percent. If the lowest rate is paying $100 per month, the highest \nrate would pay 2,500 per month. If you are young and healthy and just \nout of school, they give you the physical, and you are an A-1 specimen, \nyou get it for $100. But if your family has had some illness or \nsickness and maybe your company has dropped its health insurance, if \nyou have to purchase this, you can pay $2,500. Think what that will do. \nThat is obviously going to be prohibitive, and more and more people \nwill be left out.\n  Here is how the variable comes out. Age, 500 percent. Gender, 25 \npercent, it should be saying, women, 25 percent. They are \nautomatically, under these calculations in this bill, gender, will be \npaying a higher premium. This is the Enzi legislation. And the variance \ncontinues. If you are in a wellness program, you get a 5-percent \nbenefit. If you come in with a whole group of very young people who are \nvery healthy, you can get a 40-percent reduction, but if you are an \nolder person with sickness, you are up to 500 percent. That is the \nvariation.\n  That is not acceptable. We all know what is going do happen. That is \ngoing to be the incentives.\n  This legislation, on page 100, talks about the definition relating to \nthe model ``small group'' and those who supported the legislation use \nthe Model Small Group Rating Rules for the Small Employer Health \nInsurance Availability Model Act of 1993. It is interesting that the \ninsurance commissioners have upgraded this review and study several \ntimes. Do you think we are dealing with the most recent publication? \nNo. We are back to 1993. It is the insurance organization, the NAIC \nmodel, that basically has been rejected and repudiated by the State \ninsurance commissioners.\n  All you have to do is read from your own insurance commissioners, and \nthey ask: Why in the world would the Senate use an old model, when we \nhave much more recent information, much more updated information? The \nreason is, if you use this, the profits for the insurance industry are \ngoing to be much higher.\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\n  We ought to understand that. The insurance commissioners themselves \nhave effectively rejected this particular proposal.\n  If we go to page 110, we will see ``Superseding of State Law.''\n\n       This part shall supersede any and all State laws . . .\n\n  This does not just say small business. This is about all State laws. \nHere it is, the clinical trials, cancer screening, diabetes, \neffectively preempt all the State laws, to and after the date relating \nto rating and in the small group insurance market.\n  It says to Massachusetts and to most of the States, if you have a \nbenefit package, those are going to be preempted. That is what it says \nright there on page 110.\n\n  Page 110 actually is where it permits the fluctuation of the rating \nsystem. It talks about ratings. And that gives you the flexibility that \nI have mentioned. And then the preemption of State benefits is actually \non page 119.\n  I would have thought, if we were serious about trying to do something \nfor small business, we would have had the opportunity--Mr. President, \nhow much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time under the control of the minority has \nnow expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. My time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the debate we are having today on small \nbusiness health plans is a debate that I hope will ultimately lead to a \nvote in the Senate on this legislation.\n  This bill, or something very similar to it, has passed the House of \nRepresentatives on eight--eight--different occasions. Small business \nhealth plans have passed the other body, the House of Representatives, \non eight different occasions.\n  I believe if we were allowed to vote today on this legislation in the \nSenate, we would have a big majority vote--a decisive majority vote--\nbecause I believe a majority of Senators support the legislation that \nhas been produced by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee under the leadership of Chairman Enzi. I believe there is \nstrong majority support for that in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, what will happen today--and in the days ahead--is we \nwill not get a chance to have that vote because our colleagues on the \nother side have decided again to filibuster this legislation, to block \nit from ultimately being voted on. That is unfortunate. It is \nunfortunate for, most importantly, the people across this country who \ndo not have health insurance coverage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. THUNE. I will not yield at this point. You had your time, \nSenator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was wondering if you would yield for a question.\n  Mr. THUNE. I am not prepared to yield at this time. I will allow you \nto speak on your own time.\n  But the important point is that this particular legislation has not \nhad an opportunity to be voted on in the Senate, legislation that would \nhelp small businesses in this country that currently cannot cover their \nemployees, that currently have families of those employees without \ncoverage.\n  In fact, if you ask small businesses today--and about 22.5 million of \nthe 45 million uninsured in this country are employees of small \nbusinesses or are their families, and about another 15 million are \nself-employed in small businesses--the reason they cannot cover their \nemployees is the cost.\n  What this legislation attempts to do is address the issue of cost, to \nmake health insurance more affordable to more Americans, to small \nbusinesses, to their employees, to their families, to self-employed \npeople in this country who currently do not have coverage because of \nthe cost.\n  It is a very simple concept. It is a concept that has been passed \neight times by the House of Representatives but never voted on in the \nSenate because of obstruction on the other side. They will not allow it \nto come to a vote. That is unfortunate because this is an issue the \nAmerican people expect us to address.\n  So I hope when all is said and done, my colleagues on the other \nside--the Senator from Massachusetts has strong feelings on this \nparticular issue, which he has articulated--have an opportunity to air \nthose opinions, to debate this issue, but that, in the end, they let it \nbe voted on.\n  Let's let this come to a vote. Let the will of the majority in the \nSenate decide one way or the other about whether we want to do \nsomething about the high cost of health care in this country to cover \nmore people.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said--the Senator from \nMassachusetts quoted the CBO--the Congressional Budget Office has said, \nif this legislation is enacted, almost a million more people in this \ncountry will be covered and, in fact, it will lead to lower insurance \ncosts.\n  So it is a good deal for the people who are uninsured. It is a good \ndeal for the small businesses that are trying to cover their employees. \nAnd I might add, it is a good deal for the taxpayers because the \nCongressional Budget Office has also said if this particular piece of \nlegislation is enacted, the cost of Medicaid to the Federal Government \nwill go down by almost $1 billion and the cost of Medicaid to State \ngovernments will go down by about $600 million.\n  Further, the Congressional Budget Office has also found that this \nwill actually lead to higher revenues for the Federal Government. Why? \nBecause when the small business cost of health care goes down, they are \nable to provide more benefits and more in the form of salaries to their \nemployees. Those salaries and some of those benefits are taxable. \nHealth insurance benefits are tax excluded in many cases. So those \nbenefits and those additional salaries would be taxed at the marginal \nincome tax rates, and it would generate, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, an additional $3.3 billion over a 10-year period for the \nFederal coffers.\n  So we have a bill that covers more people, according to CBO, that \nlowers insurance rates, according to CBO, and that actually generates \nmore revenue for the Federal Government. Yet we cannot vote on it. Why? \nBecause our colleagues on the other side will not allow this \nlegislation to be voted on.\n\n  I think the American people deserve and expect more from their \nelected leadership. As I said, the House of Representatives has voted \neight times in support of this, with strong majorities. I believe there \nis a majority in the Senate in favor of this bill, if we could bring it \nto a vote today. Maybe we won't vote on it today. Maybe we would vote \non it tomorrow or maybe we would vote on it next week, but let's vote \non it.\n  Let's vote. That is what we are here for. Let's debate the issue, but \nlet's vote. Let's not use the rules of the Senate to obstruct something \nthat has clear majority support in the House, something that has been \ndebated here but never voted on in the Senate because it has been \nblocked from final consideration.\n  Let me also say one other thing about this debate because there is a \nproposal that has been talked about some on the floor of the Senate, \noffered up by some of our colleagues on the other side, that is \nintended to respond to the Enzi legislation, the small business health \nplan legislation, that we are currently debating.\n  Interestingly enough, that particular piece of legislation offered by \nour colleagues on the other side is a Government-type approach to this \nissue. The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has found that the \nproposal they put forward actually costs the taxpayers $73 billion over \na 10-year period.\n  So you have two bills. You have a bill that has been offered by \nSenator Enzi, the chairman of the HELP Committee, offered by the \nleadership on this side of the aisle, which lowers cost, which covers \nmore people, which has been found to actually save the taxpayers money; \nand a bill that has been offered by our colleagues on the other side, \nat a cost to the taxpayers of $73 billion in additional tax dollars \nover a 10-year period.\n  Now, it seems to me, at least, that if you are a taxpayer, that bill \nis not a very good deal. It is also a proposal that leads to more \nredtape, more bureaucracy, more Government, at a time when we ought to \nbe looking for ways to improve the market-based system we currently \nhave in this country, by\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\nallowing our small businesses to take advantage of the leverage they \ncould gain by joining larger groups.\n  The very simple principle behind this legislation, behind the Enzi \nbill, is to allow small businesses around this country and their \nemployees to be part of a larger group, thereby driving down the cost \nof their insurance premiums.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THUNE. I will not yield at the moment. We have a few minutes left \non our time, and then the Senator from Illinois could use his time to \nspeak.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THUNE. Not at the moment. Thank you, though.\n  What I would simply say is, the bill offered by the Senator from \nIllinois and by his colleagues on the other side is, again, legislation \nthat comes at a high cost to the taxpayers: $73 billion over a 10-year \nperiod.\n  So it is important, when we have this debate, that the people in this \ncountry who are following the debate have a clear understanding of what \nthe differences are between the approaches that are being offered--the \nEnzi bill, the bill that is under consideration today, the small \nbusiness health plans bill, and the bill offered by our colleagues on \nthe other side--the differences in terms of their approach, one being a \nGovernment approach, one being a market-based approach, one actually \nbeing scored by the Congressional Budget Office as achieving savings \nfor the Federal taxpayer, and one that clearly adds to the costs of the \ntaxpayer by about $73 billion over a 10-year period.\n  This has been dubbed Health Week because we are debating health care \nlegislation. Small business health plans is one component of that. We \nalso tried, Monday, to get a vote on legislation that would allow for \nreforms in our medical malpractice system that would, hopefully, again, \ndrive down the cost of covering people in this country. The high cost \nof medical malpractice insurance is driving OB/GYNs and other \nspecialists and providers out of the profession, driving up the cost of \nhealth care in this country.\n  In fact, the Department of Health and Human Services, a couple years \nago, did a study that suggested the cost of defensive medicine and the \ncost of the medical malpractice system we have in the country today is \nactually costing the taxpayers, under Medicaid, an additional $22.5 \nbillion a year.\n  It is important we address these issues. I believe the American \npeople want us to act. More importantly, they want us at least to vote. \nThat is all I am simply saying. For those on the other side who have \nconsistently resisted the enactment of these two pieces of legislation, \nthat is fine. I understand that is part of this process, that we have a \nvery open and free-flowing debate. That is part of the Senate. That is \npart of our democratic process we have here.\n  But when all is said and done, let's bring this to a vote so the \npeople of this country, who expect action out of the Senate, at least \nknow where their elected folks stand when it comes to the issue of \nsmall business and whether we are going to provide health care for the \nemployees of small businesses across this country and whether we are \ngoing to do anything to address what I think is a very important \neconomic issue to a majority of Americans; that is, this ever-rising, \nincreasing cost of health care.\n  These two pieces of legislation--small business health care plans, S. \n1955, offered by Senator Enzi, the chairman of the HELP Committee--and \nit is a bipartisan bill; it also has Democratic support, although not \nenough to stop a filibuster--and the medical malpractice reform \nlegislation, which, again, there were two pieces of medical malpractice \nreform legislation voted on Monday--we were not able to get enough \nvotes to stop a filibuster to invoke cloture--but, there again, I \nbelieve both pieces of legislation have majority support in the Senate \nand, clearly, have majority support in the House of Representatives.\n  They have already passed there repeatedly. Small businesses health \nplans have passed eight times in the House of Representatives. Medical \nmalpractice reform has passed five times in the House of \nRepresentatives. That legislation has come to the floor of the Senate \nand has been blocked from receiving an up-and-down vote.\n  I think it is in the best interest of people across this country who \nare expecting Congress to act on the issue of health care and the high \ncost of health care. They want us to come up with solutions that \nrespect and are in the best interest of the American taxpayer. I \nbelieve these two pieces of legislation accomplish that objective.\n  So I hope before this Health Week is over--and even if we have to \npush this into next week--we at least get a vote on the floor of the \nSenate that will enable us to take final action on a couple of pieces \nof legislation that have been lingering around here for way too long \nand deserve action by the Senate.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me summarize or attempt to summarize \nwhere we are in terms of what we just did and where we have been. After \na 96-to-2 vote on invoking cloture on the motion to proceed, we have \nnow finally proceeded to the small business health plans bill. We are \nnow at a point that we can begin debating the substance of this bill.\n  Chairman Enzi is here and is ready for relevant amendments to come \nforward and be debated. He will have more to say on that shortly.\n  What is clear is that there have been attempts or suggestions that we \nuse this bill as a Christmas tree for all sorts of amendments, as well \nintended as they might be, but amendments that don't relate to the \nunderlying bill.\n  Earlier this week, we began to address and tried to address issues \nsurrounding medical liability. We were unable to do so. We have now \nproceeded to the small business bill, and it is my intention to stay on \nthat bill, with amendments related to the bill. This bill should have \nstrong, bipartisan support. As it plays out, we will see how strong \nthat bipartisan support may be.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the majority leader to clarify something in his \nremarks. He referred to amendments as ``Christmas tree amendments.'' \nThere is one amendment on this side of the aisle that he supports on \nstem cell research. If this is Health Care Week, it would seem that \nthis is a related issue. Does the majority leader characterize that \namendment as a ``Christmas tree amendment''?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the issue of stem cells is a very important \nissue. As my colleague knows, I am very committed to addressing that \nparticular issue.\n  What is very clear to me, as we started discussing health care on \nFriday of last week--and it is now Wednesday--is that we need to \nsystematically take an issue, one by one, that is important to the \nAmerican people, that I have clearly laid out, starting with medical \nliability, and then proceed to another medical liability bill and \nproceed to small business, without jumping to other important issues. \nThere is a whole range of issues that affect cost, quality, research, \nand affect people's lives and affect access to health care. But the \nonly way we are going to be able to address those in an intelligent, \neffective, step-wise way is to take them one at a time, like medical \nliability. We were unsuccessful there. We are now moving to small \nbusiness and focusing on that. There will be amendments, and we welcome \nthem. The chairman is here and ready to talk substance on those \namendments. Let's dispose of those and stay on small business. Then we \nwill go and look at a whole range of other issues on health care at an \nappropriate time.\n  My intention is to go step-wise through this, with relevant \namendments. The chairman is willing to address that and address the \nissue of small business health plans. We have 46 million people out \nthere who are uninsured today. This doesn't solve the problem, but it \nfits very nicely with allowing the people out there who don't have \naccess to health care today, who work in small businesses, to have for \nthe first time the opportunity to get the reasonable, affordable health \ncare they simply don't have today. There are a million people--if we \npass this bill and it is signed by the President--who are uninsured who \nwill have the opportunity to have insurance.\n  Let me yield to our chairman because I do encourage our Members on \nboth sides of the aisle to come forward so that we can have substantive \ndebate on the small business health insurance issues out there, without \ntrying--because I know the other side wants to address many other \nissues, as has been expressed over the last several days, which are \ntheir priorities that they want to put before small business health \nreform plans. But we are simply not going to do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, I say with the greatest respect \nthat it is kind of interesting that the majority leader presents a \nproposal to the Chamber on behalf of the human resources committee--and \nas we know, under the Senate rules, that is entirely appropriate--and \nthen in the same breath he asks us to recommit the legislation back to \nthe committee, after he has just spoken for the committee, which \nsuggests that there is a parliamentary maneuver, which is now quite \napparent to all of us, that we are not going to have the opportunity to \neven get a debate on small business assistance, because we have on this \nside of the aisle the Durbin legislation dealing with relief for small \nbusiness which effectively we are precluded from having an opportunity \nto offer.\n  If I understand the last sentence of the leader, he said we are going \nto have to dispose of this and go this route before we consider any \nother amendments. As I understand it from our Democratic leader, we \ncould have reduced those to four or five different amendments that deal \nwith the emergency penalties that some 8 million seniors are going to \npay on the prescription drug program, the issue of the ability of \nMedicare to be able to negotiate lower prices, and the stem cell issue, \nwhich my friend has commented on, and Senator Harkin and Senator \nFeinstein, and I know the Senator from Tennessee understands the full \npotential of this. But effectively, as I understand it, this is \nWednesday at 3 o'clock; we were here Wednesday morning. I have been \neffectively here since 10 o'clock in the morning, and we have Wednesday \nand Thursday and a full week where we can deal with these issues.\n  It just is troubling to many of us, when we went through this whole \nargument a week or 10 days ago on the immigration issue, where we were \nlistening to those on that side of the aisle say: Let's have some \namendments. Now we hear from them that, no, we cannot. We want lots of \namendments on that, but we refuse to have amendments on this.\n  I daresay that the Senate rules permit debate on different \namendments. We have a set of rules out there. You can have an amendment \nin the first or second degree, and you can have ultimate judgments and \ndecisions. I just want to mention at this time that the action that has \nbeen taken now by the leader is effectively going to foreclose an \nopportunity at this time, when we are having our health care debate, to \ndebate either stem cell research or relief for our senior citizens, who \nwill be paying the penalty because of the requirements of the \nprescription drug program. We will be denied an opportunity to consider \nreimportation or negotiation for lower prices. Those are effectively \nissues that I think most Americans can understand. Certainly these are \nissues which Members of this body are familiar with and not new issues. \nWe have not been able to get an opportunity.\n  I certainly regret that is the case because I think, with all \nrespect, as the CBO talks about, there are 48 million Americans without \nhealth insurance. According to CBO, this is going to help solve it for \n600,000, where we have the option with the Durbin proposal to solve it \nfor millions in small business. But we are denied that opportunity. It \nis difficult for me to follow that kind of rationale, but we are where \nwe are. I regret that judgment and decision, but that is where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to comment a little bit on that. I \nthink there is plenty of blame to go around for any delays that are \nhappening around here. When we are talking about incorporating in this \nbill, which deals with small business health plans, an opportunity to \ngive small businessmen a chance at negotiating in the market to bring \ndown costs, with an alternative being proposed--when we are being asked \nto incorporate into this and put all the weight of the stem cell debate \nor drug reimportation or Medicare Part D on top of this as a full-blown \ndebate, everybody in this body knows that any one of those would easily \ntake up not just a full week but probably 3 weeks because there would \nbe other kinds of motions and parliamentary objections and processes \nthat would drag any one of those out for that time.\n  The difficulty with being able to debate anything around here is the\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\nlength of time as a result of the right to offer any amendments that \nanybody wants on any topic. So we do make some efforts to try to keep \nthem relevant. If we do cloture, then they are germane. Germane is a \nmuch tougher test, but relevant is not any health care idea in the \nwhole world that could be amended and amended and amended and debated \nand have processes put in against it that would keep us from ever \ngetting to a decision on small business health plans.\n  So we are trying to stay with small business health plans. I know \nSenators Durbin and Lincoln have an alternate approach. The alternate \napproach ought to be voted on, but the alternate approach should not be \nvoted on to the exclusion of ever getting to a vote on this. So we \ndon't want to have just one of them vote and one side feel very good \nbecause they got a vote for that one and the other side never gets to \ntheir vote. We are trying to find a way to make sure there are votes on \nboth sides on the issues and that not just one side is taking the tough \nvotes but that we do something so we can get to a conclusion for small \nbusiness. Yes, we are trying to focus this on the problems of small \nbusiness.\n  I would like to speak a little bit on the managers' amendment that is \nbefore us because there are some changes to the bill that I think the \nother side of the aisle will like. In most respects, this amendment \ncorresponds very closely to the underlying bill reported out of the \nHELP Committee in March. It enables small businesses to pool together \nto save costs and increase access. It allows small business health \nplans and other plans to offer more affordable coverage options. It \nwill also help streamline the current hodgepodge of health insurance \nregulation. However, the managers' amendment does make a number of new \nand important changes to the bill, most importantly in the area of \npremium rating.\n  Before I address the managers' amendment, I want to first emphasize, \nas I have throughout this debate, that I am eager to start sorting the \namendments my colleagues might want to offer. As we start the amendment \nprocess, I look forward to debating all amendments from my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle that are relevant--I mean relevant to the \ngoal of more affordable health insurance for small business owners and \ntheir employees and their families.\n  I have reviewed some of the amendments Members have filed and want to \noffer. There are many that don't have any place on this bill and only \nserve to obstruct or delay passage of the bill--amendments addressing \nthe energy efficiency of hybrid cars, Medicare benefits, hate crimes, \nand environmental air standards. They don't have any place on this \nbill. This bill is about health insurance for small business owners and \ntheir families and their employees and their families. I stand ready \nand willing to debate all relevant amendments to this bill.\n  For instance, Senator Snowe will file an amendment on the issue of \nbenefit mandates. Her amendment would ensure that benefits and services \nwhich have been mandated by a majority of States would continue to \napply to small business health plans and other insurers. I know there \nis a lot of strong feeling on all sides of this issue, and I look \nforward to a lively and serious debate on it. I will have more to say \nabout the Snowe amendment later.\n  For now, I will focus on what we have done in the managers' amendment \nto address the concerns raised by many Members of this Chamber. The \nmain change we have made is related to how health insurance premiums \nare priced for small business. Most States do have rating laws. Those \nlaws limit the amount of variation between premiums charged to \ndifferent small businesses. Some States allow a great variation; some \nStates allow very little variation.\n  During debate on this bill yesterday, I heard my Democratic \ncolleagues make a number of speeches on this issue. They expressed \ntheir concern about how the bill, as reported from our committee, would \naffect the health insurance market in their States. They expressed \nconcerns about how the rating rules in our bill might affect businesses \nwith older workers or workers who have serious or chronic illnesses. I \nalso heard these concerns in private conversations with a number of my \ncolleagues over the past few weeks. I don't believe everybody should \nhave to pay exactly the same amount for health insurance. Rules like \nthat hurt young families and lower income workers. They get hurt \nbecause they get priced out of the affordable health insurance market.\n  But I have listened to my colleagues. I have also consulted with some \nof my colleagues on our committee and with Senator Nelson of Nebraska, \nwho coauthored this bill with me. I value his perspective as a former \nState insurance commissioner. I also reviewed the bill Senators Durbin \nand Lincoln have offered. I have talked with experts in the insurance \nmarkets and insurance regulation, and they don't think the bill \nSenators Durbin and Lincoln have offered would create new and \naffordable options. In fact, some of those experts think that bill \nwould make things worse, not better.\n  I will speak some other time in more detail on that. I prefer to go \nin the direction that we know can work. We know small business health \nplans will work because they worked in the past before the thicket of \nconflicting State laws made it too cumbersome to offer such plans.\n  Our committee heard testimony on this last year, but Senator Nelson \nand I looked at the Durbin-Lincoln bill anyway to see if there were \nsome ideas we could harvest, some ideas we could incorporate.\n  After talking with Senator Nelson and my colleagues on the committee, \nwe have developed an amendment that should address the concerns of most \nof my colleagues on the issue of rating.\n  The managers' amendment would do two things: First, it would permit \nStates to limit the allowable variation in premiums to a much narrower \nratio between the highest and the lowest rates as compared to the bill \nmy committee originally reported.\n  Second, it would allow States to continue to require community rating \nof the health insurance policies. What that means is that the bill \nwould allow States to prohibit small business health plans or insurance \ncompanies from using the health status of a group of workers as a \nfactor in determining the group's premium.\n  If States want to allow health status as a factor, they can allow it; \nif they don't, they can disallow it. This means two things: First of \nall, most States would be unaffected by the new rating threshold of the \nmanagers' amendment. As a matter of fact, we estimate the rating \nprovisions would have no impact on approximately 40 States. The vast \nmajority of those States have reasonably competitive markets, although \nthose markets would be even more competitive if we allow for the \ncreation of small business health plans, allowing small business to \nband together across State lines to increase their leverage and to cut \nadministrative costs. That is a huge factor.\n  Second, the managers' amendment preserves much of our original intent \nto create greater affordability for low-wage workers and for younger \nworkers and their families, but it also allows States to retain \nreasonable limits on what high-risk groups can be charged. The \nmanagers' amendment sets a different threshold for allowable variation \nin premiums.\n  The new threshold is similar to the model act published by the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners and updated in 2000, \nits most recent model, and it is what Senators Durbin and Lincoln used \nas the basis of their bill.\n  So under the managers' amendment, the States use community rating and \ncould continue to use community rating. That means these States could \nstill prohibit the use of health status as a rating factor as long as \ntheir system is adjusted to the point that it maintains affordability \nfor low-wage workers and young people and families.\n  Under the managers' amendment, States would also be permitted to \nlimit small business health plans and other insurers from setting rates \nthat vary by more than a 5-to-1 ratio. In other words, the highest rate \nfor a group in a particular insurance pool could not be more than five \ntimes the lowest rate. That would ensure that the insurance pool has a \nbetter and more stable balance of risks in the pool while ensuring \nmeaningful limits on premiums for higher risk groups. This is an \nadjusted community rating standard used in the bill authored by \nSenators Durbin and Lincoln.\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\n  Again, just like the Durbin-Lincoln bill, the managers' amendment \nfollows the most recent model from the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners. The Durbin-Lincoln standard works out to the \nsame 5-to-1 ratio between lowest and highest rating. So I hope my \ncolleagues understand that here is an area where we have tried to \nstrike a compromise, where we tried to work with them.\n  I should point out that most States don't use community rating. They \nuse what is known as rating bands. These bands allow for a variety of \nfactors to be used in setting premiums, including health status. We \nwill allow States that use rating bands to continue to use rating \nbands. None of these States would be required to use community rating \nif they don't want to. They can continue to allow greater premium \nvariation than the 5-to-1 ratio if they choose. It is a very important \npoint.\n  The managers' amendment allows States to continue the use of two \nsystems for rating health insurance policies. They can use either the \ncommunity rating or what is known as rating bands. All the managers' \namendment asks is that community-rated States follow the model set \nforth in the Durbin-Lincoln bill. At least if some reasonable variation \nin premiums is allowed, young families and lower wage workers may be \nable to find affordable policies. Of course, affordability would be \nenhanced if their State markets became competitive enough to attract \nsmall business health plans. So we are saying in 10 States it may not \nattract small business health plans.\n  I know the rating is extremely complex. This is a very difficult \nissue to talk about. I kind of enjoy it as an accountant. But the \nbottom line is very simple. First, we need to maintain a minimum level \nof affordability in how premiums are set across the country. Young \nfamilies and lower wage workers in certain States deserve access to \naffordable health insurance and, therefore, affordable health care, and \nthey deserve the ability to join together with other employees as part \nof a pool of small business workers through the association in their \nindustries.\n  Ensuring that all the States have competitive health insurance \nmarkets will enable small business health plans to create truly \nnational pools so they can maximize the full size of their membership \nas they negotiate for better benefits and for better prices.\n  This is a major area of compromise, and I hope my colleagues \nrecognize it. We have taken a major concept from the bill authored by \nSenators Durbin and Lincoln and we have incorporated it in the \nmanagers' amendment. We have done this because Senator Nelson and I and \nthe other cosponsors of the bill are working in good faith to find \ncommon ground.\n  While rating is the most significant issue that we revised in the \nmanagers' amendment, it is not the only one. For example, the managers' \namendment includes several provisions to make it clear that the scope \nof the bill's preemption of State law is very narrowly tailored to only \nthree areas. Those three areas are rating, as I have already discussed, \nbenefits, to enable small business health plans to offer national \nbenefit packages, and administrative functions, to reduce some \nunnecessary costs of health insurance regulation.\n  It has been a key priority for my Democratic cosponsor, Senator Ben \nNelson, that State oversight authority be retained to the maximum \nextent possible. We have a few former State insurance commissioners in \nthe Senate, and I know they share Senator Nelson's opinion on that. \nThere are also a few former attorneys general in the Senate, and I have \nlistened to them. I have also listened to some of our current attorneys \ngeneral who have voiced their concerns recently.\n\n  I mention that some of their concerns refer more to the House-\nassociated health plans bill, and it is important for people to know \nthis is different from that bill.\n  We have listened and done these appropriate changes. We have added \nnew provisions that make it very clear that this bill does not preempt, \naffect, or even disrupt traditional State authority regarding consumer \nprotection, plan solvency, and insurance oversight. That stays with the \nState.\n  Most importantly, it would be crystal clear that the bill does not \nlimit in any way a consumer's right to petition their State insurance \ncommissioner or the State courts. That is a very important point. I \nwant to repeat that. It should be crystal clear that it does not limit \nin any way a consumer's right to petition the State insurance \ncommissioner or their State courts.\n  The managers' amendment before the Senate represents a significant \neffort to find common ground. It addresses the issue of rating, which \nis one of the two major concerns that Senator Nelson and I have heard \nfrom colleagues. Senator Snowe's amendment with respect to State-\nmandated benefits is an attempt to address the other major concern.\n  So Members who have raised concerns about these two issues ought to \nsee we are willing to work toward a compromise. There should be no \nreason we can't arrive at a solution over the next couple of days. \nSmall business owners and working families I don't think are going to \naccept excuses.\n  The matter at hand is small business health plans. It is not stem \ncell research, it is not drug importation, and it is not Medicare. The \nmatter at hand is about creating more affordable health insurance \noptions for small business, and it is an issue that I think can be \ncovered this week or a very small part of next week.\n  As a manager of this bill, I am willing to entertain any germane \namendments. With the consent of my colleagues, I will even go further \nthan that. I will consider relevant amendments. But stem cell research \nis not relevant to this bill. Drug importation is not relevant to this \nbill. Medicare is not relevant to this bill. What is relevant to this \nbill is amendments that address the 27 million Americans without health \ninsurance who work for or depend on small businesses.\n  If my colleagues have amendments like that, Senator Nelson and I are \nmore than willing to discuss them. Let's focus on the matter at hand. \nLet's take a meaningful step forward to give America's small business \nowners and working families more affordable health care.\n  In regard to some of the comments that have been made, as an \naccountant, I do remind my colleagues that this is not a case of \nsubtraction. This insurance plan is addition. It will be bringing in \nnewly insured people. When you go to the dry cleaners tonight to pick \nup your laundry, can you look that person in the eye and say: I don't \nthink you deserve health insurance because you might not demand enough \nfor yourself, so I saved you from yourself? Can you look them in the \neye and say to the mom and pop running the business down the street \nfrom your home: You don't deserve health insurance either; you don't \nhave it now, we're not going to make it more affordable for you; too \nbad, we had other things we wanted to discuss?\n  As you go home today, after you leave the Hill, think about the \npeople around you, the regular people--the cab driver, the worker at \nthe dry cleaner, the person in your neighborhood restaurant, all those \npeople you may not notice who really make the world operate. Many of \nthem don't have any insurance. Some may even own a little business just \naround the corner, be the owners of it, and still not be able to have \ninsurance.\n  I am not talking about deluxe insurance, I am talking about any \ninsurance. We are not talking about the employees at the big hotel \nchains or the big chain restaurants. We are not talking about the \nemployees at Wal-Mart. We already said to them: You can form whatever \nbenefits package you want. You don't have to answer to any State. You \ndon't even have to have review or oversight by insurance commissioners. \nYou don't have to meet any State requirements. We already said that to \nbig business, and big business has done that. They haven't left out \ncritical things. They said: Let's see, this is a competitive market. We \nhave to be competitive. We want to have employees. And you know what. I \nthink they included almost everything that has been talked about here. \nThey did it because they wanted to compete.\n  Small business isn't any different. They need good employees. They \nwant good employees. They know that if they are going to have good \nemployees they have to do as much as they can afford.\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\n  Oh, yes, and when they are doing that, they can also pick up some \ninsurance for themselves, and what they do for themselves, they do for \ntheir employees. We hear the estimates of how much this will or will \nnot save. I would like to make a couple of comments on that. We have \nalready seen that the big businesses, instead of paying 35 percent in \nadministrative costs--35 percent--remember, each 1 percent of insurance \ncosts drives 200,000 to 300,000 people out of the market. We are \ntalking about 35 percent administrative costs. But those big businesses \nthat we gave permission to do whatever they wanted to, theirs runs \nabout 8 percent. Do you think they would be more competitive than the \nsmall businesses? What keeps the small businesses in business is their \nflexibility and how much less they make.\n\n  So I am not talking about deluxe insurance; I am talking about any \ninsurance. Did you know that in several States there is only deluxe \ninsurance? Did you know that in some States there may only be one \ninsurance provider? Others have been driven out of the market. No, it \nhasn't been the competition that has driven them out; it could be well-\nmeaning legislators wanting to make sure that everybody has everything \nthey need.\n  There is a lot with our bodies that we ought to be doing on a regular \nbasis. We ought to be taking care of our body like we take care of our \ncar--well, maybe not like we take care of our car. But the way we \nusually take care of our body is similar to a rental car. We drive it \nuntil something goes wrong and then we take it into the shop. But there \nare regular services that we ought to provide for our own bodies, and \nwe can do that.\n  The big companies get to do that tax deductible. It would be nice if \nthe small businesses were able to do that tax deductible as well, and \nwe can get into several of those issues later. We do have a plan here. \nWe are willing to make modifications to it. We are willing to take \nrelevant amendments. We do want to be sure that we get a vote on this \nbill, if we vote on an alternative measure. I think that is fair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that I salute \nSenator Enzi from Wyoming. He has shown extraordinary leadership and \npolitical courage to bring this issue to the floor. The last time we \nhad a serious conversation about health care for American families and \nbusinesses was in that one brief shining moment when the Democrats were \nin control and brought the Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor; \notherwise, during the time that I have served in the Senate, we have \nrun away from this issue. I salute Senator Enzi. Although I disagree \nwith his bill, and I will explain why, I admire his political courage \nand vision to report a bill from his committee and bring the issue to \nthe floor. I have said that before the press, I have said it at home, \nand I want to say it on the floor on the Record. Although we may \ndisagree on approach, I respect him very much for being willing to \nbring this complex and politically controversial issue to the floor.\n  I think if you put it up for a vote as to when a week ends in \nAmerica, we might not reach a consensus. There are some people who \nwould argue: Why, a week ends on Friday night. That is the end of the \nweek. Others say: No, a week ends on Sunday night. But what we have \nfound is that Health Care Week in the Senate ends at 2:30 on Wednesday \nafternoon because that is when the Republican majority leader came to \nthe floor and filled the tree, which means closed down amendments on \nthe health care debate.\n  The Republican majority leader felt there were only two issues \nrelevant to health care in America. The first was the issue of medical \nmalpractice and preempting the States that traditionally regulate \nmedical malpractice. For I believe the fourth time, Senator Frist \noffered the medical malpractice bills at the beginning of the week, and \nthey failed again, this time failing to even attract a majority of the \nSenators supporting either bill that he brought. Then the Senator moved \nto the health care issue before us: small business health insurance. \nThen the majority leader came today, having given us all of about a day \nand a half to consider this issue, and said that is the end of the \nstory. No more amendments. We are not going to consider any other \nhealth care amendments in the bill before us. We are closing down the \nSenate when it comes to health care issues.\n  That is interesting because what the Republicans have done is to \nclose down debate on stem cell research. Senator Frist came to the \nfloor and said: We don't want Christmas tree amendments. Christmas tree \namendments--stem cell research. I don't know if Senator Frist has been \nback in his State. I have. They have roundtable discussions about stem \ncell research. They sit at a table surrounded by men and women who have \ntheir hopes pinned on medical research, those who are suffering from \njuvenile diabetes and the serious problems that come with it--a mother \nwho gets up several times during the course of the night to wake her \nyoung daughter and to test her blood to see if she needs insulin, if \nshe needs to eat something; another family with a young man with Lou \nGehrig's disease who has reached the point now where he cannot \ncommunicate. All he can do is sit in his wheelchair, this young man in \nhis 20s, with tears rolling down his face, as his mother says: Senator, \nplease, please do something about stem cell research. It may not save \nhim, but it may save someone else. Parkinson's disease--to have my \ncolleague and closest friend in Congress, Lane Evans, a young man \nstricken with Parkinson's, forced to end his congressional career, who \nhad the strength to come to the floor last year in the House and beg \nfor stem cell research and others suffering from Parkinson's and spinal \ncord injuries. Think of those people whose lives have been compromised \nand slowed down because of these injuries. All they want is a chance \nfor a vote on stem cell research.\n  This President has prohibited stem cell research beyond a single line \nof available stem cells and has virtually closed it down as a Federal \nundertaking. We have decided, as a matter of Federal policy, that we \nwill not do this research. We have been asking for over a year for a \nvote on the floor of the Senate on stem cell research. We were \nheartened when the Senate majority leader, Senator Frist, came to the \nfloor in July of last year and said: I may be switching my position, he \nsaid, but I am going to support stem cell research. It meant so much \nbecause we respect him, a heart transplant surgeon, a man with his \nmedical credentials, to break from the President on this issue, on stem \ncell research and say he would join us in the fight. But how \ndisheartening to hear today as the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee refer to debate on stem cell research as not relevant to \nhealth care. Not relevant. It may not be relevant to their lives, but \nit is relevant to the lives of thousands of Americans.\n  We in the Senate know what is at stake. If we don't bring this matter \nup for a vote this week on stem cell research, the chances of seeing \nthe bill before the end of the year are slim to none. When we think of \nall of the families counting on us to step up for stem cell research, \nI want to ask you, Mr. President, isn't this worth a fight? Isn't this \nworth a fight on the floor of the Senate, to make sure that we get a \nvote this week on stem cell research, for the people who are counting \non us, whose lives are compromised and broken because of disease and \nillness? Isn't this worth a fight in Health Care Week? Obviously, not \non the other side of the aisle. They have declared stem cell research \nnot relevant to Health Care Week.\n\n  And what else? They have decided that Medicare prescription Part D is \nnot an important part of Health Care Week. Medicare prescription Part \nD, where some 9 million Americans in 5 days, if they don't sign up for \nthis program, will face a lifetime penalty. Medicare prescription Part \nD is a program written by pharmaceutical companies and insurance \ncompanies, a program which has been one of the worst that has ever been \ndreamed up on Capitol Hill. When we want to take a few moments to fix \nsome basics and take the penalty off seniors, the Republican leadership \nsays, now, wait a minute. That is not relevant to a Health Care Week \ndebate. Prescription drugs for 9 million seniors, that is not relevant \nto a health care debate.\n  Of course, we have heard Senator Dorgan of North Dakota repeatedly\n\n[[Page S4299]]\n\nasking for the opportunity to reimport drugs into the United States so \nthat people have a fighting chance to pay for the drugs that keep them \nalive. He has been stopped by the Bush administration. He has fought \nfor this opportunity to bring this issue to the floor time and again \nand insists on it this week in Health Care Week, and the Republican \nleadership has said, affordable prescription drugs coming in from \nforeign countries is not relevant to Health Care Week.\n  So, Mr. President, I think you can understand why many of us come to \nthe floor at this point disappointed. First, we were encouraged by \nSenator Enzi's decision to bring this matter forward, and then when \nSenator Frist said we are going to make it not just the Enzi bill, it \nwill be Health Care Week, we finally said: Here is our chance, a chance \nfor all of the people who have been waiting on us and who have been \ncounting on us. Well, that chance was snuffed out at 2:30 this \nafternoon with Senator Frist's procedural motion. Health Care Week \nturned out to be too good to be true.\n  It is interesting as well when we consider the basic underlying issue \nof health insurance. Do you know what the two competing issues are on \nhealth insurance? It is very basic. I don't have to explain it to my \ncolleagues in the Senate, and I will tell you why. The proposal that I \nand Senator Blanche Lincoln have brought to the floor of the Senate to \nmake available to every business across America is exactly the same \nhealth insurance that Members of Congress have. If it is good enough \nfor Members of Congress, we think it is good enough for American \nfamilies. But I listen as Senator Enzi and Republicans stand up and \ntalk about what a terrible idea this would be, to offer to every \nAmerican the same kind of health insurance that Members of Congress and \nFederal employees have. Well, if it is so bad, I wonder how many of \nthem have decided not to sign up for it themselves. My guess is they \nhave all signed up for it.\n  Do you know why it is so good? It is not a government plan. It is a \nplan administered by the Government at less than 1 percent \nadministrative cost that offers private insurance plans to Federal \nemployees and their families, retirees, and Members of Congress. \nPrivate insurance offered by the Government. It is so good that it has \nworked for 40 years.\n  Now we have the Republicans coming to the floor, Senator Enzi and \nothers, saying what a terrible idea this is, the same health insurance \nthat protects the Senator arguing against it. You have to ask yourself \nwhy, if it is so good for us, can't we offer it to American families? \nInstead, Senator Enzi has come forward with a plan which makes dramatic \nchanges, not to the health insurance we might offer to the uninsured \nbut in reducing protection, reducing coverage, and increasing costs for \npeople who are already insured. If you thought to yourself for a \nmoment, that is an interesting debate on health insurance, but I am not \nworried about it, I already have my plan, think twice, because the Enzi \nbill which he brings before us is going to make your health care less \nvaluable, less protection, and more cost. That is the Enzi plan. That \nis unnecessary and unfair.\n  Let me tell you what two organizations have to say about Senator \nEnzi's proposal, his health insurance plan. You might expect I am going \nto read something that has some political ring to it. Who is this \norganization that Senator Durbin is quoting? They must have some \npolitical agenda. I would like to quote from a letter, dated May 10--\ntoday--from the American Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society is \nhardly a political organization. How do they describe the Enzi bill \nbefore us?\n\n       It is our view that the basic construct of this legislation \n     is fatally flawed and therefore, we ask you to oppose it, \n     regardless of the amendment process on the Senate floor. \n     Consumers will be at the risk of losing important cancer-\n     related protections such as guaranteed insurance coverage of \n     colorectal cancer screening and clinical trial participation.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       It is our view that the Enzi bill will not result in \n     increased access to quality care for most people.\n\n  That is from the American Cancer Society.\n  Now let me go to another letter, and you decide whether this is a \npolitical organization. It is the American Diabetes Association. The \nAmerican Diabetes Association believes that:\n\n       The proposed approach in the Enzi bill is fundamentally \n     flawed and must be opposed in all forms in order to protect \n     your constituents with diabetes. Any preemption or weakening \n     of State laws is a major threat to the well-being and lives \n     of people with diabetes and should not be acceptable to the \n     Senate.\n\n  And listen to these statistics: Every 24 hours, 4,100 people in \nAmerica are diagnosed with diabetes--4,100 every 24 hours. There are \n230 amputations from diabetes every day in America. There are 120 \npeople entering end-stage kidney disease programs, and 55 people go \nblind every day from diabetes. We lose 613 Americans daily and 225,000 \nannually due to this epidemic. Diabetes continues to grow by more than \n8 percent each year. And listen to this: One in three of our children \nwill be diagnosed with diabetes in their lifetime--one in three of our \nchildren will be diagnosed with diabetes in their lifetime.\n  They go on to say:\n\n        . . . we cannot allow for any loss of ground in this \n     battle.\n\n  Signed by the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer. \nThey say:\n\n       Accordingly, we ask you to stand with us in full opposition \n     to [the Enzi legislation], no matter which cosmetic changes \n     may be proposed on the floor.\n\n  This is a stark and clear choice for the Members of the Senate, what \nwe offer to small businesses and Americans presently uninsured: the \nsame quality health insurance that protects our families as Members of \nCongress have or we offered them a watered down health insurance \nprogram that has been rejected by the American Cancer Society, the \nAmerican Diabetes Association, the American Association of Retired \nPersons, the AFL/CIO, AMA, the American Nurses Association--I could go \non for three pages of health groups in America that reject the Enzi \napproach because it will reduce coverage.\n  We know what the problem is. It has been a long time since we have \neven taken up this issue. During that period of time, we have seen the \nnumber of uninsured Americans grow from 37 million in 1993 to 46 \nmillion today--46 million uninsured Americans. But this is the wrong \nmedicine. This Enzi bill will put the insurance companies, not the \ndoctors, in charge of health care. People will be worse off, with less \nprotection.\n  Yesterday, Senator Kennedy and I went down to a press conference a \nfew blocks from here. A beautiful young lady came up. She was from \nCleveland, OH. She brought her guide dog with her and she told the \nstory about how her diabetes, untreated, resulted in her blindness--\nyoung, beautiful lady. She said: I didn't have coverage for it in my \nhealth insurance, and as a result my life is much different. She said: \nI almost died. I am lucky to be alive and thankful to be alive. But \nwhen you talk about diabetes protection, you are talking about that \nyoung woman and others who could be just like her.\n  Another young woman came to speak to us and told us how she was a \nyoung mother, healthy as could be, but tired from raising those three \nlittle kids. Somebody suggested to her to get a mammogram. She thought \nabout it because she had a history of breast cancer in her family, but \nshe said to herself: How much is it going to cost?\n  They said: $250.\n  She said: We don't have that. I need $250 for my kids.\n  She said to her husband: Check the health insurance and see if it \ncovers mammograms.\n  Her husband called her the next day and said: You can get the test \nthe next day for free.\n  This beautiful young woman went to get a mammogram and learned within \n24 hours that she had the earliest stage of breast cancer. They did a \nlumpectomy. She went through months of chemotherapy.\n  She said: I lost my hair, but I got through it all and I am here and \nI am alive and I am safe and I am going to be a mother for these kids \nfor a long time to come.\n  So when we talk about cancer screening in health insurance, I don't \nthink that is deluxe care. I don't think that is luxury care. I don't \nthink that is going overboard. Whether it is prostate screening, \ncolorectal screening, or\n\n[[Page S4300]]\n\nmammograms, that is basic preventive medicine that saves lives and \nspares suffering and cuts the cost of health care.\n  Unfortunately, many of those benefits are casualties in the Enzi \napproach. As I travel around Illinois, health insurance is the No. 1 \nissue and has been for years for businesses large and small, labor \nunions, individuals, families, parents whose kids reach the age of 23 \nand they finally realize: They are not going to be under my policy. How \nare they going to be covered?\n  Between 1993 and 2003, annual premiums Americans paid for health \ninsurance in that 10-year period increased by 79 percent. Employer \ncontributions to their employee insurance increased by 90 percent. \nThese premium increases make it tough for businesses to survive and \noffer health care protection.\n  Let be me give an example of one family I know, Jim and Carole \nBritton. They own the Express Personnel Services in my home town of \nSpringfield, IL. They are good folks, good hard-working businesspeople. \nThey have 24 employees. They pay 85 percent of their employees' \npremiums. They want to keep doing it. They really believe it is the \nright thing to do.\n  Like many small business owners they shop for a small business policy \nevery year because premium costs keep going through the roof. They have \nbeen forced to raise the deductible to keep premiums manageable. Last \nyear, the deductible doubled from $500 to $1,000. To save money, Jim \nand Carole offered a health savings account, which many on the other \nside of the aisle think is the salvation, a health savings account. I \nwon't go into it in detail, but it is a perfect health insurance plan \nif you are wealthy and never expect to get sick. They offered it. One \nof their employees decided they would sign up for a health savings \naccount. That employee now regrets the choice because his wife is \npregnant and he wishes he had better, real health insurance coverage.\n  To those who say solving the health insurance problem is too \ncomplicated or too expensive, look beyond the obvious. We already have \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. It has worked for 40 \nyears for every Member of Congress and 8 million Federal workers. Small \nbusiness owners and their employees deserve nothing less.\n  I, along with my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Blanche Lincoln, \nhave introduced legislation to give small businesses affordable choices \namong private health insurance plans and expanded access to coverage. \nWe call it the Small Employers Health Benefits Plan. We presented it to \nSenator Enzi. It has been a while now, a few months ago, that we said \nto him: Take a look at it. You know what this plan is all about. You \nlive with it. We all live with it. We love it. It is a wonderful plan \nthat has competition and real choice from private insurance.\n  We didn't convince him. I am sorry we didn't. Maybe someday we will. \nWe will keep working on it. But let me tell you why we think it is \nimportant, why there are many advantages to the Federal employees \nprogram model. This chart spells them out.\n  Nationwide availability. It covers Federal employees from one coast \nto the other. Young and old, rich and poor, black, white, and brown, \nhealthy and sick, every Federal employee is covered by it.\n  Consumer choice. There are more than 278 private insurance companies \nthat bid for this Federal employee coverage. For these private \ninsurance companies, they believe this is a good deal, to get in a pool \nof people this large.\n\n  Group purchasing discounts for small employers: In our bill, we \ncreate one nationwide purchasing pool of small employers and self-\nemployed people, which means they can fight for premium discounts just \nlike the Federal Government.\n  Low administrative costs: Do you know what it costs the Government to \nrun the health insurance program for 8 million Federal employees? Less \nthan 1 percent a year. Some of these plans we are talking about that \nprivate businesses have to turn to charge 25 to 30 percent \nadministrative costs each year. You wonder why the costs go up? They \nare making more money, charging for administration. We don't have the \nadministrative overhead. We use private insurance plans already there.\n  There is strict oversight and regulation in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefit Program. We know it works. We like it so much that every \nsingle one of us is protected by it.\n  Two economists have examined our proposal, Dr. Len Nichols of the \nnonpartisan New America Foundation, and Dr. John Gruber, Ph.D, from \nMIT. They estimate that our bill could save small businesses between 27 \npercent and 37 percent on health care premium costs every year, just \noffering to these small businesses the same health insurance deal that \nMembers of Congress and Federal employees currently receive.\n  That means Jim and Carole, whom I mentioned earlier, currently \noffering a policy for a family of four that costs $10,000 a year and \npaying $8,500 of the premium, could save anywhere from $3,000 to $3,100 \nas employers and $400 to $500 for each employee. That is before any tax \ncredit, which we propose in our bill, for low-wage workers.\n  Under our plan, premiums would not be government subsidized, but \nemployers will receive an annual tax credit for contributions made on \nbehalf of workers making $25,000 or less per year.\n  There is a big debate in this town about tax cuts. If you read the \nmorning paper, you may have noticed the chart on the front page of the \nWashington Post. The new tax cut proposal from the Bush administration, \nwhen it comes to capital gains and dividend incomes, is a very generous \nproposal to a very small group of Americans. Let me tell you what I \nmean.\n  If you are making less than $75,000 a year, the Bush tax cut \nproposal, warmly embraced by the Republican majority in the House and \nSenate, means about $100 a year in tax breaks. There is that old $100 \ncheck they wanted to give you last week for your gas bill. Here it \ncomes again. That is your tax cut if you are making less than $75,000.\n  But the same Bush Republican tax cut proposal which will come through \nCongress now gives to those who are making $1 million a year in income \nalmost $42,000 in tax cuts. I don't recall receiving a single letter \nfrom a millionaire saying: Would you please give me a tax cut?\n  They are insistent on it. We must do this. We have to give them a \nbreak. But when Senator Lincoln and I suggest giving a tax cut to a \nbusiness that offers health insurance to low-income employees: Oh, that \nis a terrible Federal subsidy. How could you consider doing that?\n  Senator Thune from South Dakota came to the floor yesterday and said \nit was going to cost us $78 billion over 10 years. Today he came and \nsaid it would cost $73 billion. We are gaining some ground. But the \nbottom line is there is no estimate in that range, anywhere near that \nrange. My challenge to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you \nbelieve in tax cuts, why wouldn't you believe in tax cuts for small \nbusinesses that provide health insurance for their employees? Isn't \nthat closer to the American dream than a $42,000 tax cut for somebody \nmaking $1 million a year? I think it is fairly clear. Obviously they \ndon't.\n  There are more than 26 million Americans making less than $25,000 a \nyear working in small businesses; 12 million, 40 percent of them, have \nno health insurance. Is it valuable for America that these people who \nget up and go to work every day in the small shops and small businesses \nacross our country have health insurance.\n  I go around Illionis and talk to all kinds of different groups--\ndownstate in my home area, small towns, rural areas, the big city of \nChicago. Whenever I say to people: Wouldn't it be part of the American \ndream that every American had health insurance, it never fails to get a \nround of applause. That is really an aspiration and a dream which many \nof us share. We can't reach that dream if we insist on giving tax cuts \nto millionaires who aren't asking for them and don't provide a helping \nhand to businesses that are doing the right thing, providing health \ninsurance to low-wage employees.\n  The tax credit we propose would equal 25 percent of the cost to that \nbusiness for self-only policies, 30 percent for employees who are \neither married or single with a child, and 25 percent for family \npolicies. So if a family of four working for Jim and Carole in \nSpringfield make less than $25,000 a\n\n[[Page S4301]]\n\nyear, there would be an additional savings of $1,874 to $2,172.\n  Under the Durbin-Lincoln bill, private insurance plans would compete \nto offer insurance to small businesses, just like they do in the \nFederal employees program. This chart shows the potential savings that \ncome from the current system and what might occur under the Small \nEmployers Health Benefit Program that Senator Lincoln and I will offer. \nCurrently, many of these businesses, like the one I described, pay 85 \npercent of insurance costs, so on a $10,000 policy they are paying \n$8,500.\n  Look at how it drops for family coverage under the plan we are \nproposing--to $3,230 for family coverage. It shows the dramatic savings \nfor each business and the opportunity for them to offer real health \ncare.\n  A lot of people say: Are you talking about a government insurance \nplan? Let me show you the choices that my wife, Loretta, and I had when \nit came to health insurance this year as Federal employees and Members \nof Congress. Look at these plans: There are 13 plans that we had to \nchoose from as Federal employees.\n  I will tell you what happened to one of my employees. She chose a \nplan 1 year, didn't like the way they treated her, and when open \nenrollment came the following September she dropped them and picked up \nanother plan. What a luxury, real competition. You don't treat me \nright, you don't get my business next year. It is like shopping for a \ncar and having some real choices.\n  Most small businesses and most Americans have no real choices, so \nwhen we come up with this plan, the Federal employees model plan, and \nthose on the other side of the aisle dismiss it as unrealistic, unfair, \ndeluxe, it is exactly the same health insurance coverage they are \nliving with right now.\n  If it is good enough for us, why isn't it good enough for the rest of \nAmerica? That is the bottom line.\n  All Federal employees receive a booklet every year about the choices \nthat are available for coverage. If you want to take an expensive plan, \nthey will take more out of your paycheck. For the basic plan they take \nless.\n  I have a lot of young people on my staff. Krista Donahue, my staffer \non this issue, gets up and swims every morning. She picks her health \nplan. She signed up for a very cheap HMO. My wife and I, maybe not in \nthe same physical condition, sign up for more coverage. That is our \nchoice.\n  That is everyone's choice in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives and throughout the Federal Government.\n  What is wrong with giving that choice to America? Senator Enzi's plan \ndoes not give that choice to America. This bill we are proposing has \nbeen supported by many groups. It isn't just a matter of Senator \nLincoln and I coming together.\n  Look at some of the groups that have endorsed the Lincoln-Durbin \nplan, or the Durbin-Lincoln plan, depending on whether you are from \nArkansas or Illinois: The American Academy of Family Physicians, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatricians, the American Cancer Society, the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Osteopathic Association, the \nAmerican Psychological Association, Consumers Union, Families USA, \nFederation of American Hospitals, International Chiropractors, March of \nDimes, the National Association of Community Health Centers--the list \ngoes on and on.\n  And the indication is that these men and women and groups that focus \ntheir professional lives on health care reject the Enzi approach which \noffers less coverage and less protection and believe, as I do, that the \nplan being offered to Federal employees should be offered to businesses \nacross America.\n  Sadly, the Enzi plan will wipe out benefit requirements.\n  I will concede that what I am about to say may have changed somewhat \nin the managers' amendment. To his credit, as Senator Enzi has realized \nthe weaknesses of his legislation, he has added more protection. If I \nam going to cite something that has been changed in the managers' \namendment, I apologize and will stand corrected on the Record. But what \nI am about to read is based on our best knowledge of what was in the \nEnzi bill. Maybe it has been changed. I want to give the Senator a \nchance to correct me, if I misread it.\n  The Enzi bill will wipe out benefit requirements, including diabetes \nsupplies, mental health coverage, cancer screening, maternity coverage, \nand child immunizations for 84 million Americans. That includes almost \n4 million people in the State of Illinois. The number of Americans who \nwill lose benefit protection under the Enzi plan, S. 1955, each one of \nthese ``stick'' pictures represents 1 million Americans who will lose \nbenefit protection. These are not people who currently have no health \ninsurance. These are people who are gathered here and watching this and \nhave health insurance who think they are part of this debate. Surprise. \nThe Enzi bill has brought you into this debate. Your health insurance \nis about to be reduced in coverage. The things that you thought you had \nsigned up for, the things that you had bargained for as part of your \nunion that you believe were covered in your plan will be reduced. The \ncoverage will be reduced by the Enzi bill.\n  His belief is, if we can just lower basic health insurance coverage \nto a lower level, we can say everybody has it. But what good is it to \nhave health insurance if it isn't there when you need it?\n  That is the point he missed. If we miss the most basic things in \nterms of protecting Americans and then sit back and fold our arms and \nsay: Well, we took care of that uninsured problem, sure, we took care \nof it until someone desperately needs health care and can't afford it \nbecause their health insurance plan doesn't cover it.\n  The idea behind Senator Enzi's bill is if you provide less benefits \nand less coverage and less protection, it should cost less. That is \nright. It is reasonable. But if the insurance doesn't cover your \nillness, if you are left exposed to paying for it out of your own \npacket, what are you going to do?\n  One of the ladies who came to our press conference yesterday is a \nperfect illustration. Her husband had bought a health insurance plan \nthat he thought was a good one, one through an association. He even \nsigned up for a chemotherapy rider on the plan because there had been a \nhistory of cancer in his family. Guess what happened. Sadly, he \ndeveloped virulent lung cancer which required a lot of treatment. They \nwent to their health insurance plan, and they said: We are glad we \nbought that rider.\n  Then, in the fine print, there was a limitation on how much they \nwould pay. The poor man lived for years and died an agonizing death. \nHis beautiful young wife from California was there yesterday. When he \ndied, she was left with medical bills of $480,000.\n\n  Is that deluxe coverage--what we heard earlier--luxury coverage of \nhealth insurance? Would you want to find yourself and your family in a \nsituation where you needed cancer therapy to survive and your plan \ndidn't cover it?\n  Unfortunately, the Enzi bill moves in that direction, and it doesn't \nhave it. All of the benefit cuts result in about 3 percent to 4 percent \nsavings on premium costs. These are not expensive when they are spread \nacross large populations. They are expensive when they are borne by one \nfamily. But if there are millions of people being covered, and a small \npercentage need it, you spread out the cost. That is what insurance is \nall about. It is a point that is missed in the Enzi legislation. That \nis not much of a savings--3 or 4 percent--when you are talking about \ndiabetes, maternity coverage.\n  Maternity coverage. I know a little bit about that, being the father \nof three. I can tell you that one of the toughest moments in my life \nwas as a law student--I got married in law school. Yes. We used to do \nthat back in the old days. Loretta was pregnant. The baby came along \nand she had a serious health problem. We had no health insurance. We \nwent to Children's Hospital in Washington. God bless them. They \ncouldn't have treated us better. They finally said after a while: You \nare not going to be able to afford to pay this, Durbin. You either sign \nup for welfare, which you can do because you don't have any income, but \nget ready to go bankrupt. You won't be able to pay these bills. There \nis one choice. There is another choice you can consider. You can go to \na clinic for people who are uninsured.\n  Sure enough. I had to leave my law school and cut a class, drive out \nto\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\nMaryland, pick up my wife and our little baby girl and sit in a clinic \nfor hours to get a doctor in rotation--never knowing who you would see \nand sure you would never see them again. They would ask you all the \nsame questions. Let's go through the history again. You tell them over \nand over--you want to give them everything.\n  That is what life is like when you don't have health insurance.\n  When it comes to maternity care, you have to be careful. I will tell \nyou why.\n  Twenty-five years ago when I was an attorney working in the Illinois \nState Senate, it came to our attention that there was a company selling \nhealth insurance in Illinois with maternity benefits, but when you read \nclosely, the maternity benefits did not cover the newborn infant for \nthe first 30 days of life. Do you know what that means? In our case, in \nmy family's situation, a situation just like it, that sick baby \ndramatically in need of expensive care for the first 30 days wasn't \ncovered. We put a provision in the Illinois State law which said you \ncannot offer maternity benefits saying you will pay for the delivery of \na baby unless you cover that baby from the moment it is born. That is a \nrequirement in law.\n  It makes sense, doesn't it? It would be wiped out as one of the State \nrequirements under Senator Enzi's approach. You can buy maternity care. \nYou may be on your own the first 30 days. Heaven forbid you are in a \nsituation with a sick child--and I have been there. It is no fun at \nall. It took us years to pay those medical bills. We were glad to pay \nthem, and they couldn't have been nicer waiting to be paid, but there \nwere a lot of anxious moments when this father sat in that waiting room \nwondering if he would ever get to see a doctor for his little girl.\n  There was a study in the New England Journal of Medicine in the years \nafter President Clinton required that the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program cover mental health benefits. I can't go to a town \nmeeting in my State and mention mental health clinic benefits where I \ndon't have the following occur. I can guarantee you that in any large \ngroup this will happen: I will say that health insurance ought to cover \nmental health benefits--and I think it should. Senator Paul Wellstone, \nthat great champion, used to sit in that back row and stand and beg for \nhealth care to cover mental health benefits.\n  If you mention that at a town meeting in my State or any other State, \ndo you know what happens when the meeting ends? Two or three people are \ngoing to wait for you. They will want to talk to you privately. It has \nhappened time and again. They say: Senator, we have a teenage son with \na serious mental health problem. We don't know where to turn. We can't \nget health insurance. There is no coverage for him.\n  Every time you mention mental health, you find that across America \nthere are people in need of mental health benefits.\n  When it came to mental health benefits, it was one of the first \ncasualties in the Enzi bill. About 42 States currently offer mental \nhealth benefits as part of their health insurance. And that State \nrequirement would be wiped away in the Enzi bill.\n  Is that deluxe coverage? If you have a bipolar teenage son, a \nschizophrenic daughter, someone suffering from grave depression in your \nown household, is that deluxe and luxury coverage? I think it is basic. \nI think it is what we should be about in America: taking away the \nstigma of mental disease and offer mental health coverage.\n  We received letters from organizations such as the American Nurses \nAssociation--God bless them--the American Cancer Society, AARP, and the \nAmerican Diabetes Association. They are all opposed to the Enzi \nwatered-down approach.\n  In a letter to Congress, 41 attorneys general, including my own \nattorney general, Lisa Madigan, in Illinois, have publicly opposed this \nbill.\n  Another way the Bush-Enzi bill would make people worse off is that it \nsets Federal rules of how insurers can charge people. I will try to \nexplain what I understand Senator Enzi just did.\n  Right now in America you can charge health insurance premiums based \non a number of factors: Are you well? Are you sick? Are you young? Are \nyou old? Where did you live? What is your injury?\n  You can be charged different health premiums depending on how you \nanswer those questions. The disparity in health insurance premiums \nbetween well people and sick people can be 26 times as expensive for \nsick people as it is for well people.\n  There are nine States--most of them in New England, except for North \nDakota and Oregon--that have community ratings, which means that \neverybody in the State of Massachusetts represented by my friend, \nSenator Kerry, is in the same pool, everybody just like the Federal \nemployees pool. So everyone is charged the same premium, young and old, \nregardless of their medical history. Senator Enzi comes and says: We \njust want to change this slightly. We want to be able to say that you \ncan charge five times as much for someone who is sick than someone who \nis well, even in States with community ratings--five times as much.\n  They tried that in New Hampshire a few years ago, increasing the \npremiums for sick people. They dropped their coverage, and 21,000 \npeople were dropped. In a year New Hampshire dropped the plan, saying \nit is not a good idea. It wasn't a good idea in New Hampshire, and it \nis not a good idea in the Enzi bill.\n  That is what is being proposed. Let me show you a study. The Lewin \nGroup, a nonpartisan actuarial firm, shows rates would rise \ndramatically for businesses with a higher number of older Americans or \nwomen of childbearing years.\n  This shows the average premiums for community-rated States, the \naverage cost per contract. You can see this yellow line. What is \nhappening because Senator Enzi is allowing this divergence and \ndiffering amounts of premiums to be charged, you can see a dramatic \nrange of increase that could occur in any given State.\n  So there is no protection on the upside below 5 to 1. There could be \na 5-to-1 difference in premiums charged the lowest rated person in the \nState to the highest rated person. It is a significant difference.\n  The Lewin study found that small businesses in strictly regulated \nStates are currently paying the average of $7,738 per month for health \ninsurance for their employees. Under the Enzi bill, businesses with a \nhigh number of older people or women of childbearing years would see \ntheir premiums increase to more than $20,000 a month, while companies \nthat have a disproportionately high number of healthy, young people \nwould see a decrease in their premiums to $3,096 a month.\n  Finally, the Bush-Enzi bill will not help the self-employed. Self-\nemployed people are the worst off. They are forced to purchase \ninsurance in the individual market which has the least amount of State \noversight. The Enzi bill will take away what little protection self-\nemployed people already have in benefit mandates, which means if you \nare on your own--you own your little business and looking for health \ninsurance, and you at least know when you are offered a policy it has \nto provide the basic coverage that your State requires--Senator Enzi \nwipes that away. It will not give self-employed people a way to pool \nwith larger businesses.\n  The Enzi bill prohibits self-employed people from being pooled with \nlarger businesses, so they miss out on the discounts of the larger \ngroups. Right now, we believe the realtors who are pushing the Enzi \nbill ought to step back and take a close look at that provision and ask \nthemselves what percentage of the membership of realtors across America \nis self-employed. The coverage and protection is not there for you. \nThis may sound good for their members until they take a look at the \npolicy and there is no protection.\n  Individuals would be pooled with other individuals, so they may save \non marketing costs, but they will be priced the same way they are \ntoday: individually. Under the Enzi bill, self-employed people can \nstill be denied coverage if their State law permits it, and they can be \ncharged exorbitant rates based on their health status, gender, age, or \nindustry.\n  Diane Ladley of Aurora, IL, is self-employed and has a chronic \ncondition called fibromyalgia, which causes\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\nchronic pain and fatigue. She has been denied insurance in the \nindividual market. She is currently cutting her pills in half because \nshe cannot afford them.\n  The Bush-Enzi bill will do nothing to help Diane. Even if she joins \nan association health plan, an insurer could deny her coverage. If she \nis offered coverage, insurers will still be able to exclude her current \ncondition or charge an amount so high she could not afford it.\n  The Lincoln-Durbin bill would allow Diane to be pooled with other \nsmall businesses in one national pool. She would have access to the \nsame negotiated discounts as all other small businesses in the pool.\n  We can make health insurance for small businesses more affordable \nwithout slashing benefits or charging people who need insurance even \nhigher prices. My bill, with Senator Lincoln, is an example of how it \ncan be done. It is a reasonable approach.\n  I will come back to my starting point as I close my remarks because I \nknow there are other Senators in the Senate waiting to speak. This is a \nmatter of simple justice. If Members of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives take advantage of the Federal Employees Health Benefit \nProgram because they believe it is fair and right for their families, \nwhy won't they offer that same opportunity to other Americans who need \nhealth insurance? Why should we give ourselves the status of a \nprivileged class when it comes to health insurance? Why should we say \nthat people across America shouldn't have the same protection our wives \nand our families have? We ought to offer them in good faith an approach \nthat is the same as our own. If this health insurance we use is good \nenough for Members of Congress, it is good enough for American \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like a chance to answer the 45 \nminutes of accusations that were made about my bill and also bring up a \nfew things about the Durbin-Lincoln bill that I have not had a chance \nto talk about yet, but could I inquire how long the Senator from \nMassachusetts will speak?\n  Mr. KERRY. Not that long, maybe 15 minutes, something like that. Hard \nto say entirely.\n  Mr. ENZI. I almost hate to break the continuity of the debate when we \nare talking about some very specific things.\n  Mr. KERRY. I welcome it. It is not often a debate breaks out in the \nSenate anymore, so I am happy to welcome it. I ask, through the \nPresiding Officer, how long the Senator from Wyoming might think he \nwould engage in debate?\n  Mr. ENZI. Probably about as long as it took Senator Durbin to cover \nthe fallacies and to boost his bill. I ask that I be the next to \nspeaker after the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate that. Maybe that will work because I will \njust add to some of the things the Senator will probably want to \nanswer, and he can take it all in one bundle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  A unanimous consent has been requested that Senator Enzi speak after \nthe Senator. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Wyoming.\n  I listened carefully, and I hope a lot of other folks did, to the \ncomments of the Senator from Illinois and from other colleagues in the \nSenate over the course of the last days.\n  I wish the Senate were engaging in this issue in a serious way that \nallows Members to debate the merits of individual approaches to small \nbusinesses being covered. Regrettably, that is not the choice of our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle. What they have done is come in \nwith a series of amendments, with second-degree amendments, and, in the \nlanguage of the Senate, filled the legislative tree, which basically \nmeans blocked out the ability of Democrats to bring amendments, to have \na real choice between plans as to how we approach small businesses. \nThat is point No. 1. That is irrefutable and damaging to the prospects \nof trying to deal with the health care crisis we face.\n  Two years ago, when I was traveling the country as a candidate, no \nmatter what State I went to, no matter what town or what size community \nor what the political definition of that community was, you always felt \na profound sense of responsibility was thrown at you by the people you \nmet from all walks of life.\n  I met people in town meeting halls, in VFW halls, in rope lines at \nrallies, in visits to factories, in visits to medium-sized businesses, \nlarge businesses. A whole bunch of folks would come up and tug at my \nsleeve, often with tears in their eyes, look at me, and say: Senator, \nyou have to help us on health care. You have to do something to help us \nbe able to afford health care. They would show me a photograph and say: \nLook, this is my sister, or this is my mom, and they would tell you \nabout a loved one who could not afford the medicine they needed or who \nlost their health care when a factory shut down or when a business \nclosed or moved overseas. The faces of those people stay with you \nforever. Their names do, too.\n\n  People--many of them Republicans, many of them conservative small \nbusinesspeople--were pleading not for a dumbing down of the system, not \nfor an automatic reduction in coverage, but for a way to expand the \nability to have the level of coverage they have today and be able to \npay for it. They were looking wearily to this city for help.\n  I met an awful lot of poor folks who obviously do not have any health \ncare, and the numbers are climbing. More importantly, there is a change \nin the fabric of our society. I met an awful lot of working Americans \nwho are increasingly watching health care costs go up, education costs \ngo up, energy costs go up, and their wages either stay the same or go \ndown. That is not a sustainable equation in our country.\n  Increasingly, those workers are being pushed out of the middle class \ninto the working poor or downward within the middle class itself. There \nisn't one of us who has not met a mother of a child who would describe \nsituations in which she would make life choices for that child, about \nwhether to let her kid play football or some other sport--hockey--\nbecause she was afraid she could not afford the medical care if her \nchild broke a leg or somehow were injured.\n  I heard again and again stories from teachers who would tell me about \nkids who get no preventive care, they do not get routine exams. Schools \nhave cut nurses, so you do not have a nurse in the school now to take \ncare of someone.\n  I heard instance after instance of kids who had some form of acting-\nout in the classroom as a consequence of either an earache or some \nother chronic disorder. Some of them went to the doctor for the first \ntime when they were 9, 10, 12 years old, and it was too late; they \ndiscovered they had a permanent hearing impairment as a consequence. I \nmet the head of pediatrics in the State of Washington at an event we \ndid in Seattle for children's health insurance who told me specifically \nof kids she had examined who had permanent hearing impairment, and now \nthey will be in special needs education because we did not care enough \nto give them early intervention.\n  I met a lot of small business owners who would like to be able to \nprovide their employees with health care but cannot afford it and who \nknow the health care costs are so high that they are standing in the \nway of being able to hire more workers because they do not have the \nflexibility and the ability to be able to expand the business and try \nto cover people or pay even a portion of the health care.\n  In New Hampshire, I met a woman who had breast cancer. I got to know \nher pretty well. She told me how she had to keep working day after day \nright through her chemotherapy no matter how sick she felt because she \nwas absolutely terrified of losing her family's health insurance if she \ndid not show up for a day or two.\n  In Erie, PA, I met a man named Albert Barker who wonders how he is \ngoing to pay literally thousands of dollars in medical bills that he \ncannot afford. And after he suffered a heart attack and he underwent \nsurgery, guess what. His employer just stopped his health coverage \nbecause it was too expensive because he had gotten sick. So they cut \nhim off at the moment of need, and he was basically at that time facing \nbankruptcy as a consequence. His wife said at the time that she was\n\n[[Page S4304]]\n\nreduced to hoping and praying that nothing else happened.\n  In Council Bluffs, IA, I met a woman named Myrtle Walck who at the \ntime did not know what she would do if the price of medicine rose any \nhigher--which it has--and she paid a huge chunk of her Social Security, \nwhich was not very big and was her only source of income, her Social \nSecurity check, to the drugstore every month just to cover the cost of \nher two daily prescriptions.\n  In Jacksonville, FL, Renee Harris, who owns a schoolbus company that \nwas in her family for over 50 years, was forced to sell the company \nbecause she could no longer afford to insure her workers and felt \ncompelled to want to be able to do so.\n  I heard daily about workers' fears of losing coverage because they \neither could not afford the higher premiums, the deductibles, the \ncopays, or they thought their employers would drop the coverage \naltogether.\n  I talked to people who told me what it was like to live knowing they \nwere one medicine bill, one hospital visit away from bankruptcy. That \nis the real world we are living in today. That is the real world the \nSenate ought to be debating. All of these problems are in our health \ncare system today. Yet there is so little time devoted in this Congress \nto finding the common ground, to finding solutions to get something \ndone for those people who want to believe we will do something to help \nthem.\n  Instead, what do we have? We have a so-called Health Week in the \nSenate. This is Health Week so that Senators can come to the Senate and \ngive speeches--not legislate but give speeches. We have speech after \nspeech in a stalemate where the whole week is going to go by, and \neveryone knows what will happen at the end because we are not really \nlegislating because we are not really here to solve problems. The \npeople I have met deserve to have a Congress that insists on a real \ndebate, really getting the job done.\n  In all the 22 years I have been here, this is one of those \npeculiarities of a moment in American history where the Senate is about \nas dysfunctional as it has been in that whole period of time. Serious \nefforts to try to deal with problems are just not on the table.\n  What are we going to have? We are going to have one up-or-down vote \non a flawed bill with no chance for Democratic amendments. I know the \nSenator from Wyoming is going to argue it is a good bill--and we will \ngo through some of those details in a minute, et cetera--but what we \nhave been reduced to doing here is spending an awful lot of time trying \nto stop bad things from happening instead of putting the competent \nenergy of a lot of people who think a lot about these issues, some of \nwhom have extraordinary expertise, into trying to fix them and move \ntoward a positive health care agenda for our Nation.\n  Right now, we are fighting to fix the devastating changes that have \nbeen forced on the Medicaid Program. We need to overturn the rules \nallowing increased cost sharing that has been imposed on families who \ncannot afford it. And we need to prevent new rules from tossing out the \nearly periodic screening diagnosis and treatment protections for \nchildren on Medicaid.\n  Who wrote to the Congress and said: ``Kids in America have enough \ncoverage. We ought to cut out early periodic screening''? Every doctor \nyou talk to worth their salt in this country will tell you what we need \nis more preventive care, wellness. We need to teach wellness in \nAmerica. We need to be doing preventive care instead of treating people \nwhen they finally get sick, at a time when it is far more expensive \nthan if we intervened early.\n  On diabetes alone, if we had diabetes screening for every person in \nAmerica, you could probably save $50 billion. You would avoid a lot of \namputations. You would avoid a lot of dialysis. And you could treat it \nin a far less expensive, more easy way. Are we talking about that here?\n  We also have to fix the Medicare prescription drug debacle and extend \nthat May 15 deadline for signing up without penalties. Why? Because it \nhas been confusing to seniors all across this country. Because the \nimplementation has been exactly what a lot of people predicted. The \nresult is a whole bunch of things that ought to be happening to reduce \nthe cost for seniors are not happening.\n  A simple thing would be bulk purchasing to negotiate lower prices on \nprescription drugs. We ought to be simplifying the enrollment \nprocedures. We ought to be making the benefit more comprehensive, by \nclosing the gaps in coverage.\n  But the bottom line is, it would be a tragedy if all we did was try \nto stop these bad things from happening, when everybody knows we have a \nhealth care system that is increasingly in extremis, a health care \nsystem that is in crisis and imploding on itself in many ways.\n  This bill, I regret to say, because it deregulates in a selective way \nall of the insurance delivered in the States, is going to create chaos \nfor people as States choose different offerings and the rules go out \nthe window.\n  I might add, for a group of people who traditionally have come to the \nfloor to defend States rights, they have, in the last years, proven \nthemselves remarkably selective in where and when they want to protect \nthose States rights because State after State across the country has \npassed a certain standard of health care. Why? Because they know it \nworks. Because they know it reduces costs. Because they know it helps \npeople have greater quality of care and a better quality of life. \nInstead, this bill is going to open up the opportunity for people to \nreduce the level of coverage for people.\n  There are a whole series of real health care initiatives that the \nSenate ought to be dealing with. I am convinced we can find an ethical \nway of dealing with the thorny issue--I recognize there are ethical \nconsiderations--but we could find, if we wanted to, an ethical way to \ndeal with a host of in vitro embryos who, regrettably, are going to be \ndiscarded altogether, thrown out into the garbage and lost, rather than \napplied to the possibility of saving life. It seems to me there is a \nway to fully fund, in a limited way, the appropriate research of \ninitiatives at the National Institutes of Health.\n  We also need to take up real legislation to get at the heart of \nracial and ethnic health disparities. We need to make it legal to \nimport prescription drugs from Canada. We need to put medical decisions \nback in the hands of doctors and nurses and patients, not insurance \ncompany bureaucrats. We need to address the nursing shortage by fully \nfunding all the programs under the Nurse Reinvestment Act that we \nfought so hard to enact.\n  We need mental health parity, which I heard the Senator from Illinois \ntalk about. We need to address our growing childhood obesity problem \nwhich is going to increase the cost of health care all across the \ncountry. And we definitely need to reauthorize the State Child Health \nInsurance Program.\n  But this is Health Week, and we are going to have a Health Week on \nthe floor of the Senate. It is not going to deal with any of those \nissues. It also avoids giving families and small businesses access to \nthe same private health insurance that Members of Congress give \nthemselves. I heard the Senator from Illinois talk about this.\n  I raised this all across the country in 2004. What is it about being \na representative of the people, elected by the people to come here to \nrepresent the interests of the people, that empowers us to abuse that \nprivilege by giving ourselves the best health care in the world, at \nless expense, with a nice Government match, bigger than what most \nbusinesses can afford, and we are not willing to allow that to happen \nall across the country? What kind of values does that represent for \nthose who run around talking about values?\n  It seems to me we ought to stand up and make it clear that every \nsingle family's health care is as important as any Member's of \nCongress. We ought to be offering every single person the opportunity \nto at least buy into it. Why shouldn't they be able to buy into it and \nget the coverage? Why shouldn't we open up Medicare and let people who \nare 55 or older buy into Medicare early? That could happen, and a whole \nbunch of people would get coverage and we would reduce costs to \nAmerica.\n  All you have to do is talk to any hospital administrator in America. \nFirst of all, they are dipping into their reserves. A lot of them are \non the brink of bankruptcy. Many of them get refunded so late and with \nsuch difficulty,\n\n[[Page S4305]]\n\nit is hard to plan and come up with a business plan for the hospital. \nMost importantly, none of them can afford the massive investments in \ntechnology that would, in and of themselves, reduce the cost of health \ncare and raise the quality of life.\n  Something like 45,000 to 50,000 to 90,000 people a year die in \nhospitals because of medical error. And often, that medical error is \nthe result of pain management or pain mismanagement. The VA has a \nterrific system. I have been in the VA hospitals. I have seen it. Why \ndo they have the system? Because it is the VA. It is a Government \nhealth care plan, and the Government made certain they could invest in \nthese pain management computerized systems. The result is, they have \nreduced the incidence of mistaken pharmaceuticals being taken, people \ngetting the wrong medicine, getting too much, getting it at the wrong \ntime, getting it even when they took it already--all of these kinds of \nthings that happen.\n\n  This week, unfortunately, instead of bringing up a bill that would \ngrant real relief to our small businesses, we are considering a bill \nthat 41 attorneys general of the United States have written to say is \nbad policy and will only exacerbate the problems in States today. Why \nare we doing that? Attorneys general are looking at the regulatory \nprocess. They are looking at the overall ability of a State without \nregard, in many cases, to the politics of it but to the law and to the \nimplementation of what happens. And 41 attorneys general have written \nto say this bill is going to exacerbate current troubles. I hope the \nSenator from Wyoming will address all of the concerns expressed in the \nletter of the attorneys general of the United States.\n  We have also seen the numbers. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports \nthat the number of firms offering health benefits has declined from 69 \npercent in the year 2000 to 60 percent in 2005. Forty-seven percent of \nfirms with fewer than 10 employees offer health insurance, compared to \n90 percent of firms with 50 employees or more.\n  So everybody agrees something ought to be done. The problem is, the \nplan offered by the Republican leadership today is not going to help \nthe small businesses to be able to gain coverage for their employees, \nunless, of course, they give up a whole set of things that currently \nthey are covered for and then without regard to what the pricing is \ngoing to be for that. It is a wholesale deregulation of insurance \nmarkets. And a wholesale deregulation of insurance markets is, in fact, \ngoing to put consumers at risk. The studies show the approach we are \nbeing offered will, in fact, have a better chance of increasing the \nnumbers of uninsured, rather than offering small businesses a lot of \nthe relief they so desperately need.\n  The proponents argue prices are going to drop once we get rid of the \nbenefit mandates created and enacted by State legislatures. Well, first \nof all, that claim, frankly, does not stand up. There are two separate \nstudies that show benefit mandates are estimated to increase health \npremiums by a small total of about 3 to 5 percent. Juxtaposed against \nthe annual double-digit premium increases that we have been seeing, it \nis clear a benefit mandate is not at the heart of the problem. If the \nbenefit mandate is only a 3- to 5-percent increase, but we have been \nseeing double-digit increases over a period of time, something else has \nhappened.\n  More importantly, why do we have mandates? What happened to the right \nof a State to make a decision, as Massachusetts has in the last weeks, \nthat they want to make certain every person is going to be covered and \nto mandate a system by which businesses have agreed and the legislature \nhas agreed they are going to fund it and people are going to be \ncovered?\n  Now, the people who have often argued about the heavy unfunded \nmandate hand of the Government--the people who have most objected to \nthe Federal solution for individual States--are now going to come in \nand literally give this great gift to some small businesses to be able \nto go out and do whatever they want and take away from States the \nability to guarantee a quality of care for their citizens.\n  Forty-nine States have passed laws mandating that insurers cover \nmammography services because they are proven to save lives. Twenty-\nseven States have passed laws requiring cervical cancer screenings \nbecause too many women are dying as a result of poor detection. Forty-\nsix States have passed laws requiring diabetes supplies to be covered \nbecause 20.8 million Americans are living with this disease and they \nhave a basic need for care.\n  So the Senate is going to come in and say: Those mandates are not \nimportant. You do not have to do that anymore. And companies are going \nto be able to create this unbelievable morass of different offerings \nwhich are going to confuse and, I predict, infuriate the consumers of \nthis country, just the way the prescription drug medicine Part D \nprogram has infuriated seniors across the country.\n  Now, the numbers I cited about cervical cancer and mammograms and \nscreening, those are not just numbers in a report. We have seen, every \nday in Massachusetts, how those things make a difference.\n  Kirsten Paragona of Ipswich discovered, in a routine pap test, that \nshe had developed stage 3 cervical cancer. She was 23 years old. And \nbecause that pap test was included as a mandatory benefit in her health \nplan, Kirsten is alive today, with a 2-year-old daughter, instead of \nliving without a reproductive system.\n  For all those in the Senate who want to talk about a culture of life, \nthat is a culture of life. And that is a culture of life worth fighting \nfor.\n  And then there is Gracie Bieda Javier of Jamaica Plain. She lost her \nmother to breast cancer in 1987. Without mandated coverage for \ntreatment, Gracie's mother was unable to afford the service. And now \nGracie is dedicated to helping other women avoid her mother's fate. And \nbecause Massachusetts now requires mammography and treatment services, \nGracie screens and treats more than 800 low-income women a year. That \nis because it is mandated.\n  What is going to happen when you open this up to so-called market \nforces? People who cannot afford it are really going to get hurt. In \nher own words: ``[Gracie] could not think of a better way to honor \n[her] mother on Mother's Day than to make sure we maintain these \nlifesaving mammogram services.''\n  I think she has it right. It saves lives.\n  Under this bill, 2.3 million people in Massachusetts alone will lose \nguaranteed health benefits. So what are we going to do? We are going to \ngo back and tell them: Gee, the Senate, in all of its wisdom, deemed \nthat these things that the State thought were important for you--they \nare not important for you. And the State does not have to provide them.\n  Typically, the great thing about a democracy is that if there is a \nbetter idea, people get to hear it and they get to perhaps choose it. \nThey get to debate that kind of alternative on the Senate floor and \nengage in a debate on the merits of each of these approaches. What is \nso fundamentally frustrating about this week's discussion is that \ndiffering approaches are not really allowed to see the light of day \nexcept in speeches.\n  Frankly, there are a lot of ways we could approach the small business \nissue. Senator Snowe and I have had hearings in the Small Business \nCommittee. We have worked for a number of years to try to narrow down \noptions on AHPs. A lot of people don't like them because of the mandate \nissue. We have tried to wrestle with how do you deal with the mandates \nand still lower costs. There actually is a way to open regional pooling \nfor States and allow a State that doesn't want to lose its mandates to \nopt out. Why can't we have that discussion on the floor of the Senate? \nYou could create pooling. You could create a regional effort to reduce \ncosts. But you could allow people the right to also choose to hold onto \nthe benefits they want, if they want, and not deprive the States of \nthat option. There were a host of other ideas that we have been working \non.\n  I regret enormously that all of the effort that went into those \nnegotiations and discussions is not going to see the effort of real \nlegislation by voting on those different amendments. We also had \nhearings which suggested a whole bunch of different ways which we could \nprovide and help small businesses without doing harm to the system. \nNone of that has been incorporated or is going to be incorporated here.\n\n[[Page S4306]]\n\n  In 2004, I offered America a plan that would provide every single \nAmerican the same health insurance enjoyed by Members of Congress. \nSince that time, Senator Durbin and Senator Lincoln have taken that \nidea and turned it into a bill that creates the Small Employers Health \nBenefits Program which he discussed. I am a sponsor of that. Under that \nbill, small businesses could join a national pool and could take \nadvantage of the same Federal administrative functions and bargaining \npower that is enjoyed by 8 million Federal employees across the Nation. \nWhy should we discriminate against them? Those small businesses could \nhave the ability to pool, to come in and negotiate less expensive \nhealth care and provide better benefits to their people and do it with \nthe same leverage that the 8 million Federal employees do. Most \nimportantly, it would protect the State mandates that individual States \nhave decided they want to put in.\n  Republicans argue that that alternative does not provide the savings \nthat small business owners desperately need. The facts tell a different \nstory. We all want savings. We have to reduce the burden of health care \non small business. I understand that. That is why Senator Snowe and I \nhave been working to arrive at a way to do so. But experts predict that \npremium savings for participating small businesses could reach as high \nas 50 percent higher in the first 2 years, if it passes. It seems to me \nthere is a way to approach this. If you go with the idea of Senator \nDurbin and Senator Lincoln, we would actually be able to reduce those \ncosts by almost 50 percent.\n  If this week was actually an effort to provide relief to small \nbusinesses, we would be discussing all of the options to provide that \nrelief. I don't think that coming up with a precooked, one-size-fits-\nall, one-ideology, one-approach, one-party plan is the way to help \nbusinesses. It seems to me that what is going to happen is, a lot of \nour small business owners and about 25 million uninsured Americans who \nwork for them are going to get caught up in this political show of the \nweek. It is obvious there is a partisan disagreement in what is keeping \nthe Senate as divided and as incapable of doing real legislative \neffort. And that is a shame. It doesn't have to be that way, if we \nmapped out enough time and actually worked across the aisle to try to \nfind the common ground. This is one of those issues where you have to \nput the politics aside. That is how you are going to win one for \nstruggling entrepreneurs.\n  There are a couple of places we ought to be able to find that common \nground pretty quickly. First, how about for children in America? The \nexample I gave earlier of a mother who makes a decision about a child \nnot playing a sport or a child who comes up with a permanent impairment \nis replicated tens of thousands of times over across the country. We \nhave 11 million children who have no health insurance at all. Sure, if \nthey get extremely sick, they will wind up being taken care of in a \nhospital and somebody will ultimately see them, if it isn't too late. \nBut the fact is, by that early screening and by involving ourselves \nearly in their lives, educators and medical experts tell us that kids \nwho are properly fed, who have good nutritional practices as a \nconsequence of their meeting with doctors and mothers, learning about \nthose kinds of things, do 68 percent better in school and, in fact, \nreduces the cost in the long run because they begin to learn good \nhealth practices as a consequence of that exposure.\n  Why couldn't we be using Health Week to talk about the most \nfundamental value of all, which is caring for our children and \nproviding every child in America with health insurance? You would \nreduce unnecessary hospitalizations by 22 percent, and you would \nreplace expensive critical care and inexpensive preventative care. \nObviously, we would do much better in the classroom and much better in \nfamilies if that were the case. We are the richest Nation on the \nplanet. Yet one in four kids in America goes without immunizations. One \nin three children with asthma don't get the medicine they need. It is \nunbelievable to me that there is as much talk about family values as we \nhear in the political dialog, such as it is in the country, but then \nyou have 11 million children who don't have any health care, and the \ncountry is content to let it stand.\n  You could insure every single child in America for less than it costs \nto roll back the Bush tax cut for the wealthiest people. That is the \nchoice. Every child in America could be covered with health insurance \nif people earning more than $1 million a year didn't have to get \nanother tax cut. But Washington chooses the tax break for the few who \ndon't need it instead of health care for the 11 million who need it \ndesperately.\n  A 2005 Mason-Dixon poll found the following: 82 percent of \nrespondents think that every child in America should be covered by a \nFederal health program, if their parents can't afford it; 90 percent of \nvoters believe that 11 million uninsured children in America is a \nserious problem and Congress ought to address it and resolve it; 79 \npercent agree that it is our moral responsibility to ensure health care \nfor every child and for the Federal Government to invest in such \nprograms.\n  In addition, the poll found that when voters are presented with a \ndescription of Kids First, the specifics of the bill that would provide \nkids with health care, 75 percent of voters support it and support its \npassage by a margin of three to one. They have said overwhelmingly that \nproviding health care to kids is more important than providing the next \nround of the tax cuts and making them permanent.\n\n  So Americans know what we need to do. There is no more pressing need \nthan improving health care for our children. That is why nearly 25 \nnational organizations representing over 20 million Americans have \nendorsed the Kids First proposal. When I first sent an e-mail telling \npeople about the Kids First, within 2 days, over 20,000 parents phoned \nin with recordings of why the Kids First Health Program is important to \ntheir families. Let me share one or two of those with you.\n  Jennifer from Central Islip, NY, called in and said:\n\n       I have a child who is on medication . . . that costs me \n     $250 or more a month. I have children who can't go to the \n     dentist. You know, it's the worst feeling in the world, as a \n     mother, to know that in order to afford health care, you're \n     not going to be able to afford the home you live in.\n\n  Jordan from Reading, PA, called in and said:\n\n       Nalani . . . my 3-year-old . . . was born with cataracts . \n     . . Eventually chances are she will be blind. Unfortunately, \n     times are really hard in my house and we don't have health \n     insurance and I can't afford to give her the surgery that \n     will fix the problem that she has. I just can't imagine \n     growing up knowing that there was a way that you could have \n     helped. But because nobody thought you were important enough \n     and because your parents didn't have enough money for health \n     insurance . . . you went blind.\n\n  With calls like this, it is extraordinary to me that Congress \ncontinues to offer a blind eye to these cries for help. This program \nthat is being offered, I regret to say, is only going to confound and \nconfuse and make worse the current delivery of health care in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, the Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. That went a little longer than I anticipated. I have now \nlistened for an hour and 25 minutes to the other side. I ask unanimous \nconsent that our side have that kind of an opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have an office that is kind of interesting. It is Phil \nGramm's old office. He retired from the Senate after several years of \nmentoring a number of us and was a real force around here. \nOccasionally, when I am sitting in my office, some phrases will come by \nthat he used. I grab them and I put them in a jar. I figure I will \nnever have an opportunity to use them. But I think today I will pick \nout of the jar again. He said: When the Democrats talk about health \ncare, they want national health care. The ship of health, they do not \ncare who steers it, as long as it wrecks, and we can have national \nhealth care. That is a little bit about what we are talking about \ntoday, that plus a combination of saying we are not going to let \nanybody out there have anything unless they can have everything. That \nwould be nice. I would like for the people of this country to have \nbetter insurance than we in the Senate have. That would be my dream.\n\n[[Page S4307]]\n\nI wish we could give them better insurance than we have.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I had better insurance than I have now. \nWhen the Democrats say that they want to open up the Federal employee \nhealth plans to everybody, they want everybody to have the same thing \nwe have, they don't really mean that. They can't really mean that. I am \nwilling to bet that if we were actually opening up that same pool and \nletting the Federal employee insurance be used by everybody in the \ncountry, the Federal employees would say: Whoa, not on my shift. The \nFederal unions would say: No, not on my shift. That is a closed pool. \nThat isn't open to everybody. If it was open to everybody, it would be \na whole different range of costs. And it is subsidized.\n  The Democratic alternative, S. 2382, is an open, voluntary pool \npurchasing agreement. That kind of an arrangement has failed nearly \neverywhere they have been tried. There is no evidence that they would \nsucceed if they tried it now and would succeed where others have not. \nMany States have tried this. It is with very little success.\n  It may look like the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, but the \nFederal employees plan is a closed pool that provides premium support \nto all eligible individuals. The Democratic alternative is an open pool \nthat would provide a tax subsidy to some of the eligible employers. In \nother words, it would be apples versus oranges.\n  A tax subsidy? Let's see, would everybody be able to get a tax \nsubsidy for their health? No, you only get a tax subsidy if you buy the \nDurbin-Lincoln health plan, a one plan fits all for the United States.\n  Now, there was some discussion about whether it was $78 billion or \n$73 billion over 10 years. Let me tell you, they have never scored it, \nso they have no idea what it would cost. That is what some of the \nseparate actuaries have looked at and said it would score. The Enzi-\nNelson-Burns bill would reduce costs and increase coverage, and that is \naccording to respected actuaries. No one can say for sure what that \nDemocratic alternative would do--whether it is tens or hundreds of \nbillions over 10 years.\n  The Durbin-Lincoln proposal eliminates the ability for national plans \nin that bill to offer uniform benefit packages. Why is that important? \nThe plan I have put forth--the plan that has come out of committee--\nallows small businesses to work across State lines to form bigger pools \nso that they can negotiate effectively against the insurance companies. \nThat is where the savings are. We talk about mandates a lot in here, \nbut the savings come from the ability to have a uniform package so that \npeople in adjoining States can all be bargaining for the same package \nand have a big enough pool to go up against the insurance companies to \nbe sure they get a better price.\n  The national plan--the Durbin-Lincoln plan--would still have to meet \nthe requirements of each and every State, even down to the specific \nparticulars of each mandate. Did you know that there are currently \n1,700 mandates in the United States? Did you know that those mandates \nare seldom the same from State to State? They may have the same title, \nbut they are not the same. So how do you put together a package where \nyou say you have to do all of them and be able to go across State \nboundaries to form bigger pools? You cannot. You would have to do 1,700 \nmandates if you wanted it to be uniform across the United States.\n  I need to tell you, too, that some of these mandates we are talking \nabout are screenings. We heard about mammography over there. That is \nvery \nimportant. I hope women get mammographies. But did you know that in \nWyoming, we really emphasize at this time of year--and I will mention \nit because Mother's Day is coming up, and this is a huge program in \nWyoming to encourage people to buy that for their mother for Mother's \nDay. It works well. People know exactly what they are buying and \nexactly how much it costs. It isn't one of many mandates that are in \nthe package that they pay for even though they don't use it.\n  Somebody said that mandates only add 3 to 4 percent to the bill. No. \nIn the State with the minimum amount in mandates, it adds 5 percent, up \nto Massachusetts, which adds 22 percent in mandates. Now, I am not \nsuggesting that any of those mandates should not be done. The bill I \nworked on does set up the ability to have a basic plan. Would people \nnecessarily do the basic plan? They can do the basic plan up to \nwhatever they think is responsible coverage for the people in their \nassociation. That doesn't mean nothing; it means they can pick.\n  You get the impression here that if you allow a basic package, \neverybody in the country is going to jump on the basic package and say: \nI can really sock it to my employees; I don't have to provide them with \nanything anymore. That is not America, and that is particularly not \nsmall business America. In small business America, they know they need \ntheir employees. Of course, as somebody pointed out, sometimes the only \nemployees are mom and pop. They would like to be insured if they could \npossibly afford it. So we have to find some way for them to be able to \nafford it. But this notion that just because there is a mandate out \nthere, everybody will use it, and this notion that just because there \nis a mandate out there, if we don't require it, it will be dropped--you \nknow, we allow big business in this country to do whatever they want. \nAnd do you know what. They provide those basic things.\n  Now, one of the things which has been mentioned is colorectal cancer \nscreening. Again, the facts suggest that health plans cover important \ntests like this regardless of State mandate, so it is likely that small \nbusiness health plans would cover them as well.\n  In 2004, the Government Accountability Office found that 20 States \nhad laws mandating coverage of colorectal cancer screening tests, which \nare strongly recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for \npeople 50 years or older. Now, the GAO then surveyed 19 small employer \nplans in 10 of the States without laws mandating this coverage--without \nlaws mandating that. This is an opportunity for those small \nbusinessmen, if they are the way they are accused of being here, to \njust drop it for everybody. Now, despite the absence of State mandates \nto cover colorectal cancer screening, all 19 small employer plans in \nthose 10 States provided the benefit. Can you believe that? If you have \nbeen listening to the discussion this week, you would think they would \njust drop it. They didn't drop it. They said: Our employees are \nvaluable, and we need to do whatever we can afford to to help them.\n  Now, how do we help them to afford it better? Let's see. If we could \njoin up with all of the other realtors in the United States--\nincidentally, the realtors are coming to town next week to their \nregular annual meeting. As I understand it, 9,000 of them will be here \nnext week, coming to a national convention. Oh, how I wish they would \nhave come 1 week earlier. They could have explained their case. But we \nhave a whole bunch of small businesses out there that really think it \nis important to be able to band together and get a better deal. It \nworks.\n  Part of the discussion we have heard today has gone off on some other \ntangents. That is one of the reasons we are talking about relevant \namendments. One of them that we went off on is prescription drug Part D \nand how, by Monday, people need to sign up for a plan. I really \nappreciate the coverage we have gotten to get that word out to people \nacross America to make that decision this week. Make it this week. \nDon't have a penalty because you missed the deadline.\n  Now, for months I have listened to the Democrats say: This is \nterrible; this is confusing; this doesn't work; we need to do something \ndifferent; we have to make it simpler for our seniors. Let's see. Let's \njust have one Federal plan for them to pick from. It sounds like Phil \nGramm again, doesn't it? Ship of state wreck so we can have a national \nopportunity.\n  Let me tell you what happened. I was really worried about this \nprescription drug plan. Wyoming has such a small population--less than \n500,000--and we keep hoping we will get off that mark. So far, we have \nnever gotten a city big enough to kind of feed on itself and grow. I \nsaid that Wyoming just doesn't have any luck attracting businesses for \ncompetition, and we probably won't have any luck on prescription drugs, \nso I wanted to make sure there was an underlying thing that says if \nnobody is interested in Wyoming, the Federal Government will take care \nof it. Do you know what. Wyoming got 41 plans--41 of them. Competition \nworks.\n\n[[Page S4308]]\n\n  Now, that is what causes the confusion the Democrats keep talking \nabout on prescription drugs. They say that there are too many plans out \nthere for people to make a logical choice. That makes it confusing for \nseniors. If we infuriate them, we can really get them storming. They \nhave done a pretty good job of that.\n  You know, I did town meetings, and I tried to help them out. Not only \nwere they appreciative, but a whole bunch of people already signed up \nand were getting far more benefits than they ever dreamed of. I said: \nHow were you able to make such a critical decision all by yourself? \nThey said: There is this 800 number, and all I needed was to know my \nprescriptions and the dose and whether I want to buy them locally or do \nthem by mail order, and I got a list of four plans that line up, line \nby line, that I can make a comparison on. So I know exactly what I am \nbuying, what it is going to cost, and I know what it will be in the \nlong run. How difficult is that?\n  Oh, but the telephone isn't your only opportunity. You can also go \nonline. There is an online spot that will do the math for you, provide \nthis same kind of list for you to make the comparison. I did it for my \nmom. Quite frankly, a lot of seniors are going to need help from their \nkids--kids who are young like me--and they will go through the process \nand find out how it works. There were things I had questions about, and \nI got ahold of Health and Human Services and got some changes to make \nit easier. At first, it looked as if you were signing up before you \nknew what you were buying, but they changed that so you could get the \nevaluation first.\n  Did you know that competition brought down the price by 25 percent \neven before the first person signed up? That is what those 41 companies \nwho were competing did. Yes, the Democrats say: Wait a minute, there is \nthis penalty and there are a whole bunch of people who don't need any \ndrugs now, so they should not have to sign up now. That is not how \ninsurance works. You buy insurance in case something happens to you. \nThis is a Federal program, so we built in a benefit so that if you had \nsomething already happen to you, you can still get low-cost insurance.\n  In Wyoming, there is a package you can buy for $1.87 a month and \navoid all penalties. It gives you assurance that you have coverage in a \nnumber of areas. And this is something that would only happen on the \nFederal level, too. If you come up with something that changes your \nwhole drug prescription thing and it goes up dramatically, every \nNovember 15 to December 30 you can change plans. You can go to somebody \nwho will provide all of the benefits you need--the cheapest possible \nplan. Again, you can have Medicare do the math for you.\n  So one-size-fits-all doesn't bring prices down. Competition brings \nprices down. I know that the dream of every person is not to have to \nsit down with every insurance agent and try to work out something or \neven understand what their package is. That is where the confusion in \nthe Medicare prescription plan comes in--that possibility of having to \nsit down with 41 different insurance agents. How many evenings will \nthat take you? There has to be simplification. The simplification we \nprovide in the bill I have been talking about is the ability for your \nassociation to work across State lines, build a big pool that is \ncompetitive, and to be able to sit down and talk to all of those \ninsurance agents so you can come up with the best possible plan for \nyour association and to save administrative costs.\n  I am not talking about eliminating the mandate to save the 5 percent \nto 22 percent--although when they are doing those, they don't only use \n25 percent of them, so maybe there is some consideration there. I am \nnot worried about that part. That is not where the savings come in. The \nsavings come in being able to negotiate in a competitive way and reduce \nadministrative costs. Right now, a small businessman pays 35 percent in \nadministrative costs. Big companies that do their own plans pay 8 \npercent. That is a pretty nice savings, especially if every 1 percent \nin costs brings 200,000 to 300,000 more people into the market. Let's \nfind a way to bring them into the market. So 35 percent minus 8 percent \nis a 27-percent savings. Multiply that by 200,000 and see how many \npeople it brings into the market.\n  We have small businessmen out there--22 million of them--who work in \nsmall businesses who are uninsured. That is counting the owners and the \nemployees in the small businesses. We have another 5 million who are \nself-employed who are uninsured. That is 27 million people in whose \nlives we can make a difference because they can work through their \nassociations to get better prices--not by eliminating mandates. They \nwant those for their employees. They need those for their employees, to \nkeep their employees; otherwise, they move on to bigger companies. \nEmployees are the heart of the business, and small businessmen realize \nthat more than big businessmen.\n  But there is another reason the Durbin bill won't work. He has taken \naway the ability of plans to form these uniform benefits on a national \nbasis, like the national Federal employees plans can do.\n\n  So there is not going to be this national pooling because they are \nnot going to be allowed to do what our Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan does because there would not be any insurers who would \nwant to offer a national plan without the same freedom from State \nmandates that exists for national plans under--get this--the national \nplans under FEHBP, what we are proposing and what is referred to as the \nEnzi bill. I like to think about it as the small working peoples bill.\n  This bill would just create 50 State pools, no true national pools, \nand all of the 50 State pools will have all the other problems we \ncited. The Enzi-Nelson-Burns bill trusts small business owners to band \ntogether to negotiate for good benefits, while the Democratic \nalternative gives small business no say in the matter.\n  They say: The Federal Government is right again; we are going to do \nwhat the Federal Government does; oh, but we can't do what the Federal \nGovernment does or anything like what the Federal Government does, but \nthat is what you have to settle for.\n  The Democratic alternative will create a new insurance pool that will \noperate under a different set of rules which creates the same \nopportunity for cherry-picking which is adverse selection that \nDemocrats claim the House bill creates. You have to look because the \nEnzi-Nelson-Burns bill solves that. It solves that cherry-picking. It \nlevels the playing field. It doesn't just grab the best customers from \nthe insurance companies and move them over into the health plans. It \nallows the insurance companies to compete and also to reinsure, but \nthey have to work with a bigger group.\n  The Democratic alternative sets up a dual Federal-State regulatory \nstructure that would create confusion for consumers and participating \ninsurers. I will probably cover that a little bit more later. I made a \nlot of notes on points I ought to cover.\n  There is one very important one. We were talking about childcare a \nwhile ago, and everybody considers childcare to be extremely important. \nWe talked about newborn care. I think everybody considers newborn care \nto be extremely important. When they talk about eliminating mandates, \nthey like to expand that well beyond what the bill ever allows.\n  There are requirements in States for who are covered persons. This \ndoesn't change that one bit. Newborns who are covered are not touched--\nnot now, not ever, no intention to do that. So if they are covered now, \nthey will be covered then. It is the law.\n  I have several other people who would like to use a portion of this \ntime that I just reserved a while ago. I yield time to Senator Burns \nwho has been very patient. I yield Senator Burns 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wyoming, a man who \nlives south of the 45th parallel from our State, for the work he has \ndone on this legislation.\n  We have been asked a lot of times what drives us on this legislation. \nI have been on the Small Business Committee now for three terms. We \ntried to pass an association health plan for the last 12 to 15 years. \nEven Senator Bumpers, the senior Senator from Arkansas back in those \ndays, worked on a bill, and his own side wouldn't let him complete that \nexercise.\n  The landscape has changed a little bit, and the numbers we are \ngetting\n\n[[Page S4309]]\n\nnow are much larger than they were, say, 10 years ago: 27 million \nworking Americans are uninsured; 63 percent are either self-employed or \nwork for a small business. For small businesses with 10 or fewer \nemployees, 34 percent of those are uninsured. And for firms with 10 to \n24 workers, 27 percent of them are uninsured.\n  Then I looked at my own State and looked at those numbers, and they \nare compelling numbers. In Montana, 60 percent of small businesses with \nfewer than 10 employees do not offer health insurance. That is a big \nnumber, 60 percent. Incidentally, most employers in Montana are small \nbusinesses. They make up the vast majority of our working force. They \nare people who run small firms that we typically think of as small \nbusiness, but there is another small business--and some are a little \nbit bigger and can be defined as a big business--that we tend to \noverlook, and they are the people who live on farms and ranches across \nthis country. They have the same desire and same needs for insurance \ncoverage.\n  As I talk to my folks who live in rural Montana, ranch families \nsimply cannot afford health insurance. Those who can, typically carry a \nhigh deductible catastrophic policy and then hope they will be able to \nweather the health care costs should tragedy strike. Consequently, many \nranch families must work second jobs, and do, simply to get health \ninsurance benefits.\n  Furthermore, very few farm and ranch owners provide their farm \nworkers with health insurance. This isn't because they don't wish to \nprovide that coverage. It is because providing such coverage is \nunaffordable. One ranch family my staff spoke with currently spends \n$2,000 a month for coverage of their family of four. As expensive as it \nis, they can't afford to go without the coverage as one of the members \nwas in a ranch accident which confined him to a wheelchair for the rest \nof his life.\n\n  Consequently, these hard-working Americans are forced to rely on \nalready burdened emergency rooms and health clinics. These small \nhospitals in rural Montana, some of which we define as critical access \nhospitals, could not have kept their doors open had it not been for a \nredefinition of critical access hospitals, telemedicine, and the \nability for people to afford health insurance. I fear if we do not \nbegin to seriously address this issue of the uninsured, particularly in \nrural areas, many of these small critical access facilities cannot \nsurvive.\n  I have heard their argument on the other side. Why would they put at \nperil health care facilities in rural America? And that is what they \nwould be doing should we continue to do nothing. Therefore, the choice \nwe must make this week could not be clearer. Do we prefer to give small \nbusiness and individual proprietors the ability to offer their \nemployees health benefits, or do we prefer to continue to limit their \nability to offer benefits by Government regulations--mandates?\n  People like to have a choice. They don't want to go to the store and \njust buy one brand. It is an easy question for me to answer. The \nfarmers and ranchers and small businesses of Montana--and Senator Enzi \nhas almost the same makeup in his State as we have in our State. \nAgriculture plays a huge role in Wyoming and Montana. In fact, it \ncontributes more to the GDP than any other industry. So it is not fair \nto those hard-working folks in rural areas to deny them the benefits \nthat large corporations enjoy or unions and, yes, those of us who serve \nin this Senate. It is incumbent on us to get these business health \nplans in place, and now.\n  As we have no doubt heard, one of the major criticisms of the bill is \nit allows small business health plans to avoid State-enacted insurance \nmandates. I don't think that is quite accurate. Specifically, some of \nthe loudest critics allege this bill will cut off coverage for \nmammograms, childhood immunizations, supplies, colorectal cancer \nscreening, and many other procedures. It is not true. It just isn't \ntrue. To use a scare tactic does not do much to further the debate on \nhow we should approach this particular problem.\n  Studies have shown that health care plans cover these and other \nservices regardless of State mandates. Members of the Senate need look \nno further than their own health benefits package to know this is the \ncase. Federal employee health benefits plans are not subject to State \nmandates. Yet these plans provide comprehensive coverage for these \nservices and often provide better coverage than would be covered under \nmost State mandates.\n  I don't like to see small business characterized as this is a way to \nsave money at the expense of their employees. Small businesspeople are \ncloser to their employees. They understand their responsibilities \nbetter than anybody in the world of commerce because they are small, \nthey are a family. That is why the owner has to take the same policy as \nthe employee. You wouldn't even have to mandate that.\n  I can remember I started a small business and it stayed that way. It \nwasn't planned, but it did. We insured our employees, and yet my wife \nand I carried no insurance, and we had a growing family at that time. \nWe did it for economic reasons. But we had the responsibility to \nprotect the folks who worked there.\n  Most plans cover essential services required by State mandates \nregardless of whether they are mandated. So why? Because it is not only \ngood policy, but it is good business. For instance, plans generally \ncover breast cancer screenings regardless of State mandates because it \nis far cheaper than having to pay for a mastectomy. Plans generally \ncover screenings for colorectal cancer regardless of State mandates \nbecause it is far cheaper to catch it early. Plans cover diabetes \ntreatment regardless of State mandates because it is far less expensive \nthan having to pay for all the maladies that can come about if you are \nnot treated, such as blindness and, yes, amputations.\n  It is far better to have childhood immunizations in your plan than \npay for the more serious diseases that may develop if you are not \nimmunized.\n  It just makes good sense if you want to keep the employee around and \ntheir family that you have grown to know because when you run a small \nbusiness, it is a personal thing.\n  We have crafted this approach--and it is not a panacea to cure \neverything, but at least it is a step in the right direction to cover \npeople who have no insurance today.\n  It is impossible for small business associations to offer uniform \nhealth insurance benefits packages affordably on a regional or national \nbasis. It is hard. If we try to do anything around here, we try to pass \nlegislation that is one size fits all. That is pretty tough to do. \nCircumstances in Maryland or Virginia are probably a little bit \ndifferent than they are when you get west of the Mississippi River, \nespecially in my State of Montana.\n  For instance, what is required for diabetes coverage in Montana is \nnot the same as is required in the States of my friends from Idaho, \nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Thus, the association that \noffers benefits to small businesses in this region must adhere to the \ndifferent mandates in each State. Having to fashion a plan to meet the \nmandates for each State drives up the cost. What we are trying to do is \nget our arms around the cost of it. It is impossible to offer a plan \nwithout first addressing cost. According to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office, \nthese State-imposed benefit mandates raise the cost of insurance and \ncause countless Americans to go with no coverage at all.\n\n  Moreover, some of those mandates in certain States are for coverage \nprocedures that the vast majority of Americans would not want and \nprobably do not even know are offered. Acupuncture, for example, is a \nmandated benefit in some States. Some people may benefit from this \nservice, but the vast majority of Americans do not. This is but one \nexample of the hundreds and hundreds of mandates throughout this \ncountry for services many do not realize they are covered for and would \nnot avail themselves of if they did. Yet the cost of covering this and \nother procedures is paid by everyone in that State due to those \nmandates.\n  It is a simple thing, insurance. I don't think I have heard it used \non the floor since this debate got started. Simply put, when costs go \nup, coverages go down. It is a simple fact in the underwriting \nbusiness.\n  So by allowing the businesses to band together and pool their \nresources, thereby giving them the same bargaining power large \ncorporations enjoy, this bill, S. 1955, will lower cost\n\n[[Page S4310]]\n\nand improve access for millions and millions of Americans who do not \nhave it today. This bill will not create a perfect health plan for all \nAmericans, but that is not what we are talking about. This bill will \nincrease the number of Americans with health insurance. This body can \ndebate endlessly on what the perfect health plan is, but that does \nlittle good for the employees of small businesses who currently have \nnone at all. So the choice is clear: Do we increase the amount of \nworking American families with health insurance or do we let \npartisanship rule the day, as it has for too many years? The American \npeople need better and they deserve better, and this bill will give \nthem better as we move it along.\n  S. 1955 will lower health costs. All the figures we see tell us that. \nMore importantly, it will give many working Americans affordable health \nbenefits, something they don't have today. My farmers, my ranchers, and \nthe small businesses in small towns across America, which are the \nbackbone of our economy, deserve the same rights as the Fortune 500 \ncompanies, unions, and yes, even us, the Government.\n  It is time to act, even though it may not be perfect. Perfection \nshould never get in the way of doing something for small businesses and \ntheir employees.\n  I thank my friend from Wyoming for allowing me this time.\n  Mr. CORNYN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming controls the time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana. I thank \nhim for all of the work he went through during the past year as we \ntalked with the insurance companies sitting down with us and the \ninsurance commissioners sitting down with us, trying to work out a \nplan. I appreciate the efforts of those two groups and all of the \nassociations, and I will talk about those a little bit later.\n  At this time I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to express my wholehearted support \nfor the bill that the chairman of the HELP Committee, the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, the Senator from Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi, has shepherded so far through this process, this small \nbusiness health plan bill. I think it presents an outstanding \nopportunity for the Senate to do what my constituents tell me they want \nevery time I go back home and I talk to them, and that is to have \naccess to good quality health care.\n  The fact is this bill will allow small businesses to band together on \na national basis and give them the leverage they need to negotiate good \nterms with insurance companies for their small businesses and for their \nemployees. This bill would let these insurers bypass some of the \nmandates that are well-intentioned but which have the impact of driving \nup the cost of health insurance for employers to the point where many \npeople can't afford it.\n  In my State we have the unfortunate distinction of having one-quarter \nof the population without health insurance. What that means is that \npeople end up going to the emergency room for their health care, which \nhas a couple of unintended consequences: No. 1, it costs a whole lot \nmore than it should to treat those conditions in places like a clinic \nor somewhere else where they could be treated on a nonemergency basis. \nNo. 2, it has the consequence of causing emergency rooms to have to go \non divert status, and that is when people come with true emergencies to \nthose emergency rooms and they can't be seen because the emergency \nrooms are full of people who are going there for nonemergency care. It \nliterally endangers the life and certainly the well-being of that \nindividual who needs to be seen in an emergency room. So we have a \nbroken health care system that can be so inefficient and not serve the \nbest interests of the American people.\n  What this bill does is provides a means for, as I said, small \nbusinesses to band together to increase their negotiating leverage. It \nis anticipated to be able to bring down the price of health insurance \nby about 12 percent, which will allow more and more people to gain \naccess to health insurance so they don't have to go to the emergency \nroom, so they have more choices, and so they have the peace of mind \nthat comes with having that coverage in a way that allows them to enjoy \nthe benefits that many of us have but which we take for granted.\n  We have an alternative that has been offered by Senator Durbin and \nSenator Lincoln, and I think it serves a useful purpose, not because I \nagree with the alternative proposed, but what it does is it \ndemonstrates the competing approaches or visions or principles between \nthis side of the aisle and that side of the aisle when it comes to \nproviding access to health care.\n  It has become increasingly apparent to me that while we share the \ngoal of access to good quality health care on both sides of the aisle, \nwe approach it in fundamentally different ways. For example, our side \nof the aisle--and this bill, I think, reflects the fact that we believe \nthere ought to be something other than a government-run health care \nsystem; that private insurance companies offering competitive plans to \nindividuals create consumer choice. It creates competition. And we know \nthat competition creates better service and better prices for American \nconsumers.\n  The alternative being offered is a command-and-control health care \nsystem operated by the Federal Government that is neither efficient nor \ndoes it offer the sort of choice and competition, lower price and \nbetter service that would be offered through private health insurance \noptions. Indeed, I think our friends on the other side of the aisle \nhave, if nothing else, been consistent in their approach to health \ncare. They believe the Government ought to dictate health care choices \nfor the American people, whether it has to do with CHIPS, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, the Medicaid Program, the Medicare \nProgram, or whether it is veterans health care. They believe the \nFederal Government knows best and that bureaucrats in Washington, DC \nought to make the choices that I believe ought to be reserved for me \nand my family when it comes to what is best for us.\n\n  As I said, this is an issue I hear about all the time when I talk to \nmy constituents. It is, in fact, the growing cost of health care and \nthe unavailability of health care that is one of the greatest concerns \nof my constituents in Texas. Rising costs, systemic inefficiencies, \nbarriers to access, and the increasing costs of coverage represent the \nchallenge we have to confront and which this bill directly addresses.\n  I understand the difficulties that small businesses have in Texas \nwhen trying to obtain quality health care coverage for their employees \nat reasonable prices. One employee of a small business in Addison, TX, \nfor example, had this to say about the disparity in coverage available \nto small versus big businesses:\n\n       Our February 2006 renewal premium increased by nearly 40 \n     percent. For a group of 4 insured with no major medical \n     issues and no increases in plan benefits, this was difficult \n     to understand. Our course of action was to look for \n     affordable plans with fewer benefits, but that proved to be \n     difficult and the results undesirable. Fortunately, one of \n     our employees decided to waive coverage and join the policy \n     offered by a large corporation that employs her husband. Her \n     premium under our policy would have been $4,740 a year. The \n     price to carry her on her husband's policy was only $700 a \n     year. Now, that is a disparity. If adequate health coverage \n     is to be provided to employees of small businesses, it is \n     going to be vital that small businesses be allowed to pool \n     their employees in order to maximize their leverage and in \n     order to minimize the premiums to which they are now being \n     subjected.\n\n  That is exactly why I support this legislation. Because it would \nallow associations such as trade, industry, professional, chambers of \ncommerce, for other small business associations to offer fully insured \nhealth plans to small businesses. I am a proud cosponsor of this \nlegislation, and I believe this bill is an important step toward making \nhealth insurance more available and affordable to more Americans.\n  I thank Chairman Enzi and his committee for their hard work in \nbringing this bill to the floor.\n  The goal of this bill is to reduce health care costs and expand \naccess by creating small business plans. As I mentioned, a recent study \nindicated that the price of health insurance could literally be brought \ndown as much as 12 percent and as many as an additional 1 million \nworking Americans insured who currently are not insured and have no \nalternative but to go\n\n[[Page S4311]]\n\nto the emergency room for their health care.\n  Recently, the Small Business Health Plan Coalition sent a letter \nsigned by organizations that represent more than 12 million employers \nand 80 million workers. They wrote in support of this bill, saying it \nwill:\n\n       Provide workers employed in small businesses and the self-\n     employed with access to Fortune 500-style health benefits now \n     enjoyed by workers in corporate and labor union health plans.\n\n  This is a principle that resonates with the American people, and I \nmust say that the American people have every right to be frustrated at \nCongress's unwillingness to step up and deal with this problem. And woe \nbe it to those politicians who stand between the American people and \ntheir desire to see health coverage expanded and access increased. \nAlmost 90 percent of voters, including 93 percent of Republicans and 86 \npercent of Democrats, in recent polls state that they favor allowing \nself-employed workers and small business employees to band together to \nnegotiate lower insurance costs.\n  It is time for the Senate to act. In 2005 alone, health care costs \nrose three times faster than inflation--and even faster than that for \nmany small businesses. Many small firms had to simply cut benefits or \neliminate health care coverage entirely. Only 41 percent of firms with \n9 or less employees offer health benefits, compared with 99 percent of \nlarger firms.\n  We all know that small businesses are our Nation's chief job \ngenerator, our No. 1 job creator. They deserve to be treated fairly. \nBut by themselves, these small firms and self-employed people have \nalmost no leverage against insurance companies to try to negotiate fair \nprices and fair plans.\n  As it stands now, if they want to join other small employers and \npurchase insurance through national associations, they have to deal \nwith an enormous array of State-level health insurance regulations and \nbenefit mandates. It goes without saying that many of the mandates that \nare ordered by State legislators to be included in insurance policies \nin their States are passed with the best of intentions, but they have \nthe unfortunate effect of raising the price of the insurance to the \npoint where many people simply cannot afford it.\n  It makes no sense to say that everyone must have a Cadillac with all \nthe bells and whistles when all some people want or can afford is a \nbasic model of a similar vehicle. Big businesses, for the most part, do \nnot have to deal with these regulations. The Congressional Budget \nOffice and Government Accountability Office and others have found that \nState-imposed benefit mandates raise the cost of health insurance and, \nin effect, represent an unfunded mandate on employers.\n  Small business health plans will have a strong incentive to offer the \nbest policies possible for their members. After all, that is what the \ncompetitive market is all about. Small businesses will have to compete \nwith large businesses for employees. And when employees decide where \nthey want to go to work, they will look at not only the salary they \nwill be offered but the benefits that will be offered, including the \nhealth coverage that is available. This is simply a case of the market \nworking and allowing individuals the maximum freedom to choose what is \nbest for themselves and their families.\n  In order to remain competitive and attract a talented workforce, I \nbelieve small businesses would want to have the ability to offer high-\nquality health benefits, the same opportunity that large companies \ncurrently enjoy. Right now, small businesses effectively have the \nchoice of offering expensive plans with all the required mandates, \nwhether employees will actually even use those services or simply not \noffering insurance at all. That policy in my State is part of what has \nbeen responsible for 25 percent of the people of Texas not having \nhealth insurance. It must change.\n  This is not a complete panacea, but it will provide dramatically \nbetter and expanded coverage to the people of my State and the people \nacross this country.\n  Under the Enzi bill, every small business owner will have the \nopportunity to choose a comprehensive plan, but they will also have \nother, more affordable, high-quality choices, too. This will improve \naccess for millions of Americans who currently do not have any \ninsurance at all. I believe this legislation is a good step in the \nright direction toward increasing the affordability and access to \nhealth care that all Americans deserve.\n  More can certainly be done, and I certainly believe that while this \nis an important step, we should not stop here. We should continue to \nincrease the number of choices available to the American people--things \nlike consumer-oriented health care, which provides greater transparency \nand provides information to consumers so they can determine where to go \nfor their health care services based not only on price but based on \noutcomes--things like health savings plans, which would give people \ngreater access and greater control over their health care decisions and \nallow them to determine how their health care dollars will be utilized \nrather than having to buy high-priced plans that contain attributes \nthat they frankly don't need or don't want and which cost them \nadditional money.\n  Certainly, more could be done, but I urge my colleagues today to \nsupport this important legislation because I think it represents a \ndramatic and long overdue improvement over the status quo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sergeant at Arms will restore order in the \ngallery.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I do have several things I need to cover. I \nthink I have another speaker or two on their way down. People are \ntalking about being able to offer amendments. They can offer \namendments. We want to have discussion, debate; we want to cover \nobjections, answers, proposals on this bill, and we are willing to do \nanything that is relevant.\n  There has been a lot of talk about needing to talk about drug \nreimportation. That is important--at least a 3-week topic. Prescription \ndrugs, that one best wait until after Monday until we see what the \nexact problem is before we do it. And stem cells, that is probably \nanother 3-week debate.\n  It took us a year to be able to get this one to the floor so we could \ntalk about small business health plans.\n  I need to make some comments in regard to a couple of the letters \nthat were read earlier because I am aghast at what was in the letter. \nThe American Cancer Society, as part of that, said: No matter what is \ndone to the Enzi bill, don't vote for it.\n  That means that should we have an amendment that does everything that \nis done across the United States for cancer at the present time, they \nare still urging people to vote against it? It is a little early to say \nthat. It is a little early to say there are not going to be any changes \nbecause we will have votes. It may require cloture in order to stay \nwith germane ones instead of the ones that I mentioned and also to make \nsure--I want to have a vote on the Durbin-Lincoln bill. But I want to \nhave a vote on my bill as well. I think we both ought to have them.\n  If we release the Durbin-Lincoln one for a vote now, then they can \nput all kinds of blockages on there so I can't ever get to a vote. And \nthe only vote that we will have had will have been theirs.\n  We are trying to have some fairness, and so far we have not been able \nto get to that point.\n  Another one was the diabetes letter. Again, it said: No matter what \nyou do to the Enzi bill, vote against it. That means, if we instituted \nevery single thing that is being done for diabetes in any State in the \nNation, they are still suggesting that they will vote against the bill? \nWow. I mean, I have never run into anything such as that.\n  We looked at the diabetes thing and we said: How do we do this? \nBecause out of the States that do it, there are no two that do it \nalike, so how do we get these agreements across State lines so they can \npool into bigger pools and be able to negotiate against the insurance \ncompany so they can bring down rates through negotiation and they can \nbring down rates by eliminating administrative costs? We are not \ntalking about bringing down rates by eliminating mandates. We are \nallowing\n\n[[Page S4312]]\n\nthem to have some flexibility in the mandates so they can come up with \na common package, and I am sure that it would include that, just as I \ndid the thing on colorectal cancer. All 19 places that they have been \nallowed to do that, they included that, even though it wasn't a \nmandate. They were excluded from that.\n  I also wanted to put into the Record an editorial from the Arkansas \nDemocrat Gazette. It was in the ``Opinion'' section. It says:\n\n       Ever face a really tough decision like where to attend \n     college, or whether to take that new job, or should you go \n     with the lasagna or the meatloaf for lunch? So you get out \n     the yellow legal pad and make a list of the pros and cons, \n     right? Well, maybe not for the meatloaf vs. lasagna bit. Some \n     things are a simple gut decision.\n       But it helps to compare and contrast. And it sure helped to \n     compare and contrast the two bills now floating around the \n     U.S. Senate to make it easier for small businesses to offer \n     health-insurance to their employees. One bill is co-sponsored \n     by Arkansas' senior Senator, Blanche Lincoln.\n       You could find the comparison on page 2A of Wednesday's \n     paper. There was Senate Bill 1955 (sponsored by Mike Enzi of \n     Wyoming) on one side, and Senate Bill 2510 (Blanche's bill) \n     on the other.\n       Both sounded fairly similar.\n       Both promised to make it simpler for businesses to band \n     together and buy cheaper health insurance.\n       Both promised to save businesses money and cover more \n     folks.\n       Then we got down to the bottom, to the very latest, biggest \n     question, and, boyohboy, talk about a pro and a con.\n       The question: What would it cost the Federal Government?\n       The answers: Nothing for the Enzi Bill.\n       For the Blanche bill, oh, somewhere in the ritzy \n     neighborhood of between $50 billion and $73 billion over 10 \n     years.\n       When an estimate for new government spending has a margin \n     of error of some twenty-three billion dollars, you know that \n     new program is just gonna bleed money.\n       What's worse, or at least as bad, is that Senator Lincoln's \n     bill creates a national health program that'll be under the \n     administration of the federal Office of Personnel Management.\n       Translation: We the American Taxpayers will be in charge of \n     the care and feeding of yet another bloated bureaucracy.\n       Why? Why do we need another federal program under federal \n     so-called management adhering not just to federal rules and \n     regs but all the state rules and regs, too? (It gives us a \n     headache just thinking about filling out those insurance \n     forms.)\n       We suppose it's because some politicians, who may have the \n     best intentions in the world, can't imagine a health plan \n     that doesn't have the government deciding what should and \n     should not be offered at every single bureaucratic level. \n     Thank goodness that isn't required of private employer plans. \n     Can you imagine the red tape? Perish the pencil-pushing \n     thought.\n       Senator Enzi's proposal, unfortunately entitled the Health \n     Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act, \n     takes a freer-market approach. His bill would let small \n     businesses band together and get better deals on health \n     insurance through trade associations.\n       Now for the devilish detail: Senator Enzi's bill would be \n     regulated by the feds but largely exempt from individual \n     state mandates. The better to offer these plans nationwide \n     and keep costs down.\n       Remember, the idea is to help small business, not burden \n     them with more state regulations.\n       Besides, it's nothing new. Major companies like General \n     Motors long have been granted exemptions from state laws \n     regulating insurance--it's called an ERISA exemption, because \n     they have employees all over the country. They couldn't very \n     well insure their employees from sea to shining sea while \n     abiding by every queer detail of every law in every state. \n     Especially when employees move or get transferred and want to \n     keep their insurance.\n       But won't the absence of state regulations lower standards? \n     Not if the small businesses offering the insurance want to \n     keep their employees. It's in businesses' interest to have \n     good health insurance for their workers, or their workers \n     will go somewhere else. It's how the free market works.\n       Think of these small-biz health plans like charter schools. \n     They'd be free of, to quote Senator Enzi, ``the current \n     hodgepodge of varying state regulation.'' That way, small \n     businesses across the country can band together and negotiate \n     group health insurance on their terms. Which would be more \n     affordable for the businesses, the employees and, unlike the \n     Blanche bill, the taxpayers.\n       If we gotta have a federally regulated Small Business \n     Health Plan, we sure don't need one as costly as Blanche \n     Lincoln's. And, yes, we gotta have a Small Business, etc. \n     Because what we've got now isn't working.\n       Look at the numbers: Of the more than 45 million uninsured \n     Americans, 60 percent are employed by small businesses or are \n     in some way dependent on those businesses. But it's getting \n     harder for a small business to offer health plans because \n     insurance premiums cost so much these days. Since 2000, the \n     cost of health-care premiums for employers has gone up almost \n     60 percent, including some 11 percent in 2004 alone.\n       Pass the Enzi Bill and, according to a study by a Milwaukee \n     consulting firm, small businesses would save 12 percent on \n     health insurance premiums. Even more important, some 900,000 \n     uninsured folks would finally get coverage.\n       Hey, sounds like a plan. Blanche Lincoln's bill, meanwhile, \n     sounds like an expensive, bureaucratic pain in the \n     pocketbook.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to have you see the small business \norganizations that are supporting the Enzi-Nelson bill. There are a \ncouple of hundred of them here--12 million employers, 80 million \nworkers.\n  I would like for you to see the small business organizations that are \nsupporting the Durbin-Lincoln bill. Oh, there are two. OK.\n  I want to share a letter from the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners as well. They are writing in response to our May 2 \nrequest for a review of S. 2510 Small Employers Health Benefits Program \nsponsored by Senators Durbin and Lincoln.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Chair, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Enzi: We are writing in response to your May \n     2, 2006, request for our review of S. 2510, the Small \n     Employers Health Benefits Program Act, sponsored by Senators \n     Durbin and Lincoln.\n       The authors of S. 2510 sought the input of the NAIC when \n     drafting their bill and we appreciate their willingness to \n     work with and consider the views of insurance regulators. \n     Like your bill, S. 1955, the Durbin/Lincoln bill does not \n     include the option of self-funded association plans, instead \n     requiring coverage to be purchased from carriers that are \n     licensed in and regulated by the states. This is a \n     significant improvement over association health plan \n     legislation, such as S. 406. The bill would also preserve \n     state rating rules and benefit mandates, thus maintaining \n     state authority over health insurance regulatory policy.\n       We are concerned, however, about the practical impact this \n     legislation would have. S. 2510 creates an unlevel playing \n     field by requiring plans sold through the Small Employer \n     Health Benefit Plan (SEHBP) to meet different rating \n     standards than those required of plans not sold through the \n     SEHBP. By setting different rules for different carriers, S. \n     2510 could create an unworkable market in some states.\n       For example, if state law allows carriers in the general \n     market to charge small employers with healthier, younger \n     workers significantly less, and the federal law requires \n     carriers in the SEHBP to have only a modest variation in \n     rates, the SEHBP carriers will be selected against. In fact, \n     few carriers would want to participate in this program in \n     states with such rating disparity.\n       S. 2510 does attempt to ameliorate this problem by \n     providing subsidies for those that participate in the SEHBP. \n     We agree that these subsidies will help, but they are not \n     sufficient. We believe that states are best suited to \n     establish rating rules for all carriers--creating two sets of \n     rules would be harmful to the workings of the small group \n     markets. This could also limit the ability of states to \n     develop innovative programs to address the growing health \n     care crisis.\n       Finally, both S. 2510 and S. 1955 will not affect the \n     underlying and primary causes of skyrocketing health care \n     costs that are making health insurance increasingly \n     unaffordable for millions of Americans. However, we do \n     applaud you and Senators Durbin and Lincoln for your efforts \n     and we hope our dialogue will continue and yield real \n     solutions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Catherine J. Weatherford,\n       Executive Vice President and CEO;\n     Alessandro Iuppa,\n       Superintendent of Insurance, State of Maine, NAIC \n     President;\n     Walter Bell,\n       Commissioner of Insurance, State of Alabama, NAIC \n     President-Elect.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. The experts on S. 2510, the Durbin bill, from the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners, write:\n\n       S. 2510 creates an unlevel playing field . . . could create \n     an unworkable market in some states. . . . Few carriers would \n     want to participate in this program. . . .\n\n  Again, people can read the entire letter, and I am sure they will \nfind that very enlightening. There is a lot more detail there.\n  Last, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter from the National \nAssociation of Health Underwriters printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4313]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 10, 2006.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Chairman, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Enzi: We're very pleased that the Senate will \n     spend this week working on important health issues. The \n     issues to be addressed are critical to the health of America.\n       One of the most important issues to be addressed this week \n     is health insurance market reform under S. 1955. Our members \n     work on a daily basis out in the real health insurance \n     markets of America. We are in a unique position to be able to \n     observe which markets work better than others and would like \n     to commend everyone who has worked so hard on this \n     legislation to produce an end product that will make health \n     insurance more affordable for small employers. S. 1955. has \n     been modeled to produce a competitive market and a level \n     playing field. Markets with these characteristics are always \n     the strongest and produce the most affordable products.\n       We are in particular pleased that reform did not go in the \n     direction of S. 2510, Small Employers Health Benefits Program \n     Act of 2006. Under the auspices of creating a more \n     competitive environment, S. 2510 creates the worst kind of \n     unlevel playing field by providing subsidies in the form of \n     reinsurance and a risk corridor only to health plans offered \n     in one purchasing vehicle within the small employer market. \n     It is very important that all plans operating within a \n     special market segment play by the same rules. This ensures \n     the financial integrity of all market players and results in \n     more product availability within that market. S. 2510 does \n     just the opposite. The subsidies it provides are not \n     available to plans that offer coverage in the small employer \n     market outside the purchasing pool and it would provide a \n     significant competitive advantage to carriers operating in \n     the pool, versus those that offer coverage outside the pool. \n     Under this anticompetition model, there would soon be very \n     little choice outside the pool as carriers would be forced to \n     exit a marketing environment where they could not possible \n     operate competitively. This would force more and more people \n     to purchase coverage within the pool, and the cost to \n     government for the subsidies would increase even more.\n       There is, of course, a reason for the subsidies. Rating \n     rules inside the pool would be considerably more restrictive \n     than they are in the majority of states today, so the pool \n     could not be competitive in many areas without the subsidies. \n     And although the subsidies are for a limited period of time, \n     the unlevel playing field created under this scenario would \n     likely result in no other coverage being available outside \n     the pool for consumers to select once the subsidies to plans \n     operating inside the pool stopped and costs returned to a \n     higher level. And although the subsidies would at that point \n     stop, the rating structure and other mandate provisions \n     inside the pool would continue and the cost of coverage would \n     be predictably high. The ultimate result would be an \n     increased number of people being priced out of coverage and \n     ultimately, more, rather than fewer people would be \n     uninsured.\n       We do appreciate the positive direction you've taken with \n     S. 1955, and the extreme efforts you've taken to listen to \n     everyone's concerns and respond in a reasonable way. My staff \n     and I look forward to working with you toward achieving \n     enactment of your bill. Please let us know how we can help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Janet Trautwein,\n                                 Executive Vice President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Again, it is a much more extensive letter. I hope people \nwill take the time to read the Record, but it is from the National \nAssociation of Health Underwriters. These are the experts on health \ninsurance. They look at this stuff all the time.\n  It says:\n\n       ``2510 creates the worst kind of unlevel playing field;'' \n     ``the cost of coverage would be predictably high;'' ``an \n     increased number of people being priced out of coverage;'' \n     and, ``Bottom line: More rather than fewer people would be \n     uninsured.''\n\n  That is the National Association of Health Underwriters.\n  I wish to have some time to go over the good comments, too. But I \nhave been joined on the floor by the majority whip. I will relinquish a \nfew minutes for him to say a few words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming. I \ncongratulate him for a superb job in crafting this important measure to \ndeal with what many of us think is one of the most pressing problems \nconfronting our country. I have talked to a lot of people in my State, \nand right up there with gas prices today, they raise the issue of \naffordability of health insurance.\n  I have heard from workers who fear that their employer may have to \ncut back on their coverage. I have met with employers who are concerned \nthat high health care costs prevent them from investing in their \nbusinesses and creating new jobs. It would be safe to say I am \nconfident that most if not all of our colleagues have had similar \nexperiences in their own States.\n  These are real concerns. In every sort of noon-time civic club \nengagement I have, this is the first thing people bring up. Health \npremiums have increased nearly three times the rate of inflation, and \nthe percentage of employers offering health care benefits continues to \ndecline.\n  This is a particular problem for our small employers and \nentrepreneurs. These are the people who create the majority of the new \njobs in our country. Sixty percent of the working uninsured--those \nAmericans who have jobs but don't have health insurance--are either \nself-employed or they are employed by small businesses.\n  The sad truth is, it is too darn expensive for many small businesses \nto provide health coverage to their employees in our country today.\n  There are a lot of reasons for this.\n  First, small businesses don't have as much negotiating clout with \ninsurers when they are negotiating premiums as large businesses do. It \nmakes sense. That leaves them stuck, of course, with higher costs.\n  Also, employees in small firms must absorb a larger share of their \nplan's administrative costs because there are fewer employees to share \nthose costs.\n  Third, small businesses must typically purchase care in the \nuncompetitive, expensive, small group market.\n  Add all of these factors up and small business health care costs \nbecome too expensive for many small businesses to afford.\n  Small business, as we all know, is the engine that drives the \nAmerican economy. We must allow them to band together so they can buy \nhealth insurance at lower costs so that our people and our economy can \nkeep moving full speed ahead. I commend the HELP Committee for \nreporting a bill that will do just that.\n  Finally, I commend Chairman Enzi who has done a magnificent job in \nmoving this legislation forward.\n  It addresses the unique challenges facing small businesses by \nallowing them to join together across State lines to offer insurance to \ntheir employees. This will give them the needed purchasing power to get \na better deal on insurance policies.\n  Enacting the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and \nAffordability Act will address many of these problems all at once. It \nwill reduce health care premiums. It will increase the number of \nAmericans with insurance. It will reduce the Medicaid rolls. And, most \nimportantly, while doing all of this, the bill will not increase the \nburden on the taxpayers.\n  That is not just my opinion; these are the findings of the \nnonpartisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office. Their cost \nestimate for S. 1955 shows that the bill will reduce health care \npremiums in the small group market by 2 to 3 percent. That is important \nbecause we know that with every 1-percent change in premiums, 200,000 \nto 300,000 Americans are able to afford insurance.\n  So do the math. According to the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates, 700,000 Americans who would be uninsured under current law--\nwho are currently uninsured--would be covered under the Enzi proposal; \n700,000 Americans who would be uninsured under current law, would be \ninsured under Chairman Enzi's proposal.\n  By helping small businesses expand coverage for their employees, CBO \nestimates that 135,000 Americans, who without the Enzi bill would be on \nMedicaid, would now receive private insurance under the Enzi bill. \nClearly, this is the way to go.\n  Most importantly, and unlike the Democrats' alternative, the bill \naccomplishes this without increasing the burden on the Federal \ntaxpayers. In fact, the Enzi-Nelson bill will save the taxpayers $3 \nbillion over the next 10 years. Nearly 1 million Americans get better \nhealth coverage, and the taxpayers will save the $3 billion I referred \nto over the next 10 years. This legislation is good, strong medicine.\n  My colleagues across the aisle have called the plight of small \nbusiness a ``distraction.'' But this situation that affects the \neconomic engine of our country--the small businesses--is a real \nproblem, not a distraction, and the problem is not getting better on \nits own. It ought to be addressed.\n\n[[Page S4314]]\n\n  In 4 of the past 5 years, small businesses paid double-digit \nincreases each year in health insurance premiums. At that rate, more \nand more employers will be forced to scale back or drop coverage \naltogether for their employees. The Enzi bill is the first step in \nrighting that crisis.\n  Again, I commend the HELP Committee for reporting the bill that \naddresses the challenges facing small businesses.\n  I also note the tremendous contribution made throughout this process \nby Senator Talent, who has been a tireless advocate for small business \nhealth plans during his tenure in the House and during his 4 years here \nin the Senate.\n  This is an important piece of legislation that will address a very \nsignificant problem facing many of our small businesses--the high cost \nof health insurance.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote to invoke cloture and to support the \nEnzi bill. It would be an important step in the right direction for \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank Senator McConnell. I appreciate all \nof his effort and help. I appreciate the Senator bringing up Senator \nTalent. I need to mention Senator Snowe as well. They were the original \nsponsors of associated health plans on this side. They asked for a \nhearing. We held a hearing. After the hearing, people on my committee \nwere saying, Golly, this is a problem for small business. What can we \ndo to solve it?\n  It was also obvious from the discussion that there were some \ndifficulties with the true AHP approach which we modified in the \nmeantime. That is how we got to the position we are now in.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for one \nquestion, I have heard the Senator talk about the process by which he \ndeveloped this legislation. Does he have any idea how many hours he \nspent consulting with the various entities across America that care \nabout this and trying to move this legislation to this point?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I don't have any idea. I spent a lot of \nhours and my staff people spent a lot more hours. Senator Nelson's \nstaff and Senator Burns' staff worked on this for so long that I \nactually thought maybe their staff people worked for me, too.\n  I was pleased spending days on end and sitting down, understanding \nall of the parts of this and getting it to work.\n  Another important part of this, Senator Durbin asked me to talk to \nhim about his plan. I made an appointment that same day and met with \nSenator Durbin and Senator Lincoln. We tried to work some of the \nprinciples which they had into this format. Eventually, we were kind of \ninvited to leave by staff. We need to resolve more of that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to the chairman that this has \nbeen a laborious and meticulous effort on his part. He has headed this \nup, and he has led us in an extraordinary way, and I, on behalf of all \nMembers of the Senate, commend him for this accomplishment.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, as an accountant I have to remind people that this \nbill is not a case of subtraction. This insurance plan is an addition. \nIt will bring additional insurance to people. There are 27 million \npeople out there who are uninsured. This will bring a number of them \ninto the market. It will also allow people who are already insured to \nincrease the amount of insurance which they have because they will be \nable to save some dollars. I am sure they will put that back into \ninsurance and into more benefits for people. So it is an addition, not \na subtraction, and it will bring in newly insured people.\n  One of the things I ask people is, when you go to the dry cleaners \ntonight to pick up your laundry, can you look that person in the eye \nand say, I don't think you deserve health insurance because you might \nnot demand enough for yourself? So I am going to save you from \nyourself. Can you say to the mom and pop who are running the business \ndown the street from your home, You don't deserve health insurance?\n  As you go home today, as you leave the Hill, think about the people \naround you, the regular people, the cab driver, the worker at the dry \ncleaner, the person at the neighborhood restaurant, all of those people \nwho often you may not notice, the real people who make the world \noperate. Many of them do not have any insurance. Some may even own the \nlittle business around the corner and still are not able to have \ninsurance. We always assume that if people own a business, they make a \nlot of money. There are times that the employees make a lot more than \nthe owner of the business. They always have to pay themselves last.\n  As Senator Burns said, when he was in business he provided health \ncare to his employees, but he couldn't afford it for himself and his \nwife. But you do that to keep employees. I am not talking about deluxe \ninsurance, I am talking about any insurance.\n  When people get the kinds of screenings that they would like to have, \nor even get the screenings they would like to have, and then find out \nthere is a problem, if they don't have any insurance, they can't get \nanything done unless they pay for it.\n  We are not talking about the employees at the big chain hotels or the \nbig chain restaurants. We are not even talking about the employees at \nWal-Mart. We already said to them you can form whatever kind of benefit \npackage you want. You do not have to answer to any State. You don't \nhave to have review or oversight by the insurance commissioners.\n  Those are all things we provide for in our bill. You don't have to \nmeet any State requirement. So instead of 35-percent administrative \ncosts, you only pay 8-percent administrative costs. I am not talking \nabout deluxe insurance, I am talking about any insurance.\n  Right now in several States, there is only deluxe insurance. Did you \nknow that in some States there may be only one insurance provider \nbecause others have been driven out of the market?\n  I hope people will take a close look at this bill. I hope the other \nside will offer some amendments which are relevant to this bill and let \nus work through the bill. I hope, if the only way we can maintain \ngermaneness is through cloture, that they will join in cloture because \nthere are thousands of businesses out there that need insurance. They \nneed hope. They want to ensure their employees. Think about that--27 \nmillion uninsured.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while he is still on the floor, I say to \nmy colleague from Wyoming, I think from all of us, I thank him for \ntaking an earlier position on the health plan bill that passed the \nHouse. In my view, and I think in the view of lot of us, it was badly \nflawed. Thanks for the Senator's efforts over an extended period of \ntime, along with our colleague, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, to take \nthat product and make it better, and for your willingness to work I \nthink in conjunction with Senator Snowe to improve on it further, to be \nresponsive to the concerns that a lot of us are raising, I wanted to go \non the record.\n  As I said yesterday--and I will say it in front of my colleague--I \nfind that he and Senator Nelson of Nebraska are two of the most \nthoughtful Members we have in the Senate. It is a pleasure working with \nyou.\n  One of the disappointments that I find around here is sometimes even \nwhen we appear to agree on things, it is hard to get anything done. In \nthis case, there appears to be pretty good agreement that if we could \nsomehow find a way to harness market forces, we could bring down health \ncare costs for small business and their employees and find a way to \npool the purchasing power of those small businesses and our employees \ncould maybe bring down health care costs and get a better selection of \noptions from which to choose.\n  There has been a fair amount of discussion today and the days leading \nup to this debate over mandated coverage that certain States offer. I \nwill give an example of one State in our experience with respect to \nmandates.\n  Before I came here, in my last job I was Governor of Delaware for 8 \nyears. Roughly 10 or 12 years ago we learned, to our alarm and dismay, \nthat Delaware had the highest rate of cancer mortality in the country. \nWe also learned at the same time that while we had the highest rate of \ncancer mortality in the country, we did not have\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\nthe highest rate of cancer incidence. In fact, we were at number 20 or \nso.\n  We looked at those numbers and sort of scratched our head about them \nto figure out why we were No. 1 in cancer mortality--which is the last \nplace you want to be--and number 20 or so with respect to the incidence \nof cancer.\n  We pulled in some people a lot smarter than me to look over those \nresults and asked: What is going on here? Why the high cancer mortality \nnumber, particularly in light of the fact that cancer incidence is more \nlike the middle of the pack?\n  After assessing the situation for a while, they said: We conclude--\nand we are fairly sure of this--the problem is, in your State, in \nDelaware, you do not do a very good job of early detection and \ntreatment of cancer. If you want to bring down your cancer mortality \nnumber to be closer to your cancer incidence number, you have to do a \nbetter job of early detection and treatment.\n  We took that charge seriously. We went to work in three areas: The \nfirst of those, Delaware at the time, was one of the higher ranking \nStates in terms of incidence of smoking, tobacco usage. We said one of \nthe things we want to do is reduce the use of tobacco products. We \ndecided to start with young people to reduce the likelihood young \npeople will start smoking and continue to smoke. We made it more \ndifficult for them to have access to tobacco products. We also reduced \nthe opportunities for people to smoke indoors, an effort that continued \nunder my successor.\n  The second thing we did was, with respect to expanding the \nopportunity for people to find a health care home by expanding \nopportunities for people to participate in Medicaid and the SCHIP \nProgram for young children, partnership between the State of Delaware \nand the Federal Government as other States participated, too.\n  The third thing we decided to do was to say maybe we ought to have \nhealth insurance plans in our State offer as part of their package \nscreening for certain kinds of cancer. For example, mammography \nscreening for breast cancer, colorectal screening, cervical cancer \nscreening, and a couple of others. We did all those things roughly 10 \nyears or so ago. Every year we have had an opportunity to find out how \nwe are doing with respect to cancer mortality and cancer incidence.\n  I have a chart. Delaware is small, so rather than use 1 year's \nnumbers we look at 5 years. We have a 5-year rolling average. We went \nback to 1989 to 1993, when Delaware was No. 1 in cancer mortality. In \nthe next 5-year period, 1990 to 1994, we were No. 1. In 1992 to 1996 we \nwere No. 1, and so on. During the 1990s and into the decade we start \nout No. 1. We were the first State to ratify the constitution and our \nState slogan, which is ``We are the first State.'' We like to think it \nis good to be first. This is one thing we do not want to be first in.\n\n  The State that was No. 1 in cancer mortality for too many years \nstarted to drop by 1997 when we fell down to No. 2, and we continued to \ndrop so that by the year 2000 we were down to No. 5.\n  I am happy to report standing before the Senate today that in the \nmost recent numbers which I think run up through 2003, we dropped out \nof the top 5. We might still be in the top 10, but we know we are not \nin the top 5, and certainly not No. 1. We are heading in the right \ndirection. I will not be happy until we are No. 50.\n  I would like my colleagues to consider that all of our States are \ndifferent. Delaware is different. Wyoming is different from Oklahoma. \nWe all have different priorities. We had a real problem in Delaware. We \nstill have a significant concern with respect to cancer mortality. We \ndeveloped a good game plan and we implemented that game plan. And lo \nand behold, it is working. It is actually working. We want to make sure \nit continues to work.\n  Reducing cancer mortality is like the Navy guys changing the course \nof an aircraft carrier, turning an aircraft carrier. The same is true \nas we try to reduce cancer mortality. It is a slow process. It is not \nan easy process. It takes time. If you stick with it, you can turn \naircraft carriers. You also can bring down cancer mortality numbers.\n  How does this relate to the debate today? It relates because an \nearlier version of the association health plan legislation passed by \nthe House any number of times does not let us do in Delaware what has \nproven to be successful in reducing cancer mortality. Even with the \nefforts of Senator Enzi and Senator Nelson, as this bill came to the \nfloor, it did not let us continue in Delaware requiring the screenings \nfor mammography, screenings in colorectal, prostate, and cervical \ncancer. It does not help us do those things.\n  With the amendment that may be offered or suggested by Senator Snowe, \nwe can do some of this stuff, not all of it but we can do some of it. \nParticularly the breast cancer screenings would be allowed to continue, \nmaybe one of the others.\n  The reason I bring this up, I want to keep in mind that States are \ndifferent. What we have focused on in Delaware is what works--what \nworks to reduce unemployment, what works to improve student outcomes, \nwhat works to get people off of welfare roles, what works in a variety \nof things. This is a multipronged approach that worked in reducing \ncancer mortality.\n  Let me talk more about the Enzi-Nelson preliminarily with respect to \nthe Lincoln-Durbin proposal. They actually share some things in common, \nas I said earlier. They both say: Health care costs are a major problem \nin this country. They are a problem for little businesses; they are a \nproblem for big businesses.\n  As we watch my generation aging and look to the future, when the \nboomers are in full retirement--and I might add, the generation of the \nPresiding Officer is in full retirement--we will see Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security which today account for roughly 8 percent \nof gross domestic production, by the time our generation is in full \nretirement, 25 or 30 years, I am told that Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security may well consume something like 16 percent of gross \ndomestic production. The amount of spending for those three programs \nalone is roughly equal to 16 percent of our gross domestic production \nas a country.\n  If you look back over the history of our country, in the last 50 \nyears or so we spend as a percentage of gross domestic product \nsomething like 18 or 19 percent of gross domestic production to run the \nwhole Government. If we are looking at 25 years or 30 years down the \nline where we are spending 16 percent of gross domestic production just \nto run three programs, with nothing for the environment, nothing for \nhousing, nothing for defense, nothing for homeland security, nothing \nfor education, that is a scary prospect.\n  So the concerns we have about finding a way to constrain the growth \nof health care costs are not just a concern of small or large business \nbut a great concern for those in the public sector who worry about how \nto continue to fund and offer benefits through Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Senator Enzi took a few minutes to talk about the Durbin-Lincoln \nproposal. The proposals are similar in a couple of respects: One, they \nsay rising health care costs are a major concern. They are a concern \nnot just for government, for big business, but a concern to small \nbusinesses.\n  Wouldn't it be great if we could find a way to somehow combine the \npurchasing power of a lot of small employers across the country and \ntheir employees, much as we do for Federal employees? All Federal \nemployees do not work for one employer. We work for hundreds of \nagencies. The Senate is an agency. The House is an agency. We have the \ncourts around here that are separate courts and agencies.\n\n  Throughout the country we are, in a way, sort of like small \nbusinesses. We talk about being three branches of Government, but we \nactually are, in a sense, small employers. There are big employers \namong us, bigger agencies, such as Defense, but there are a lot of \nsmall agencies that are much like a small employer.\n  What we have done to be able to constrain the growth of health care \ncosts for Federal employees is to find a way, working with the Office \nof Personnel Management, to pool our purchasing power, to get a whole \nlot of health insurance products available to be offered to us, to give \nus the opportunity to shop among them and figure out what works for \neach of us best, what we can afford, the kind of benefits we are \nlooking for, and then we can pick\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\nand choose. We end up with a great cross section of product to choose \nfrom. Given the kind of purchasing power we have, we are able to \nconstrain the cost of coverage. We have to pay something, I think it is \nabout 25 percent of the cost of our coverage. But it is, frankly, a lot \nlower premium than otherwise it would be if we did not have the \npurchasing power pool.\n  When you add active Federal employees and Federal retirees, you add \nin all the families, we are talking about a lot of people, maybe as \nmany as 6, 7, 8 million people, and it gives us a chance to have a real \nimpact on what is available in terms of coverage and how much that \ncoverage is going to cost.\n  Senator Enzi raised a question about the cost of the Lincoln-Durbin \nplan. The Lincoln-Durbin plan is different from where it was initially \nintroduced, as I understood it. There is a tax break in their plan from \nwhich the cost arises.\n  He mentioned the cost over 10 years as much as $50 or $60 billion. It \nis a tax cut for smaller businesses that offer coverage for their \nemployees. The reason there is a cost associated with the Durbin-\nLincoln plan is because of that tax cut. Ironically, some of my \ncolleagues have suggested that is one of the few times they recall our \nRepublican friends being opposed to a tax cut. I know there are tax \ncuts they are opposed to, but that is the reason there is this cost. It \nis considerable.\n  In the conversation we had earlier this afternoon, I was sharing with \nmy friend, Senator Enzi, it involves Senator Lincoln, myself, Senator \nSalazar of Colorado, and a number of folks from the business community \nwho were gathered around just to have a good discussion about the \nproblems we face in trying to look for some common ground.\n  I said to Senator Enzi when I came to the Senate a bit ago, we had a \nside bar conversation while another colleague was speaking. It is too \nbad that conversation we had with the business community in Senator \nLincoln's conference, too bad we did not have that 12 months ago or 12 \nweeks ago. He shared with me a conversation that occurred maybe 9 \nmonths or so ago that involved him and some of my colleagues on this \nsubject.\n  Senator Enzi is good, as are Senators Durbin and Lincoln, in reaching \nout to the other side and trying to find common ground. We need to find \ncommon ground. I remain convinced I am one of the people who, like \nSenator Enzi, sees the glass half full even when it is almost dry. As \nto this issue today, I think the glass is at least half full.\n  I cannot help but think, given the good will on both sides, that if \nguys like me and gals like Senator Lincoln and guys like Senators \nNelson and Enzi and Durbin put it in their minds, we could find a way \nto further reduce the differences between our respective proposals.\n  I do not know what is going to happen when we vote. I guess we are \ngoing to vote on cloture tomorrow, I am told. I am not sure what is \ngoing to happen. I don't know if the debate will basically continue or, \nbecause of that, sort of end for now. If it does, I hope the discussion \nactually will begin in earnest, and discussion, certainly, with the \nprincipals on both sides who have interests in this issue, and that out \nof that discussion we come to a more satisfactory resolution.\n  One of the problems we have on our side--and I think Senator Enzi has \nheard this before--is sometimes, even when we pass what we think is a \npretty good bill in the Senate, and we go to conference with a much \ndifferent bill from our friends in the House, when the conference is \ncreated between the House and the Senate, we, as Democrats, are not \nalways full participants in those conferences, and what comes out at \nthe end of the day does not look a whole lot like what we passed in the \nSenate, or at least not enough. That is going to be a concern. And I \njust need to say that.\n  But having said that, we will cast our votes tomorrow and see what \nhappens with respect to them. But I would say to my friend Senator \nEnzi, my hope is that if we do not come to resolution and this is an \nissue that continues to be outstanding. It is too important just to let \nit die. I hope we will have an opportunity--whether it is tomorrow or \nnext week or the weeks after that--to find a common ground and get \nsomething done.\n  Mr. President, I brought these charts. We might as well use them. \nActually, I think for a guy from Delaware they are actually pretty \ninteresting. I do not know what these numbers look like in Wyoming. But \nwhen you look at the leading causes of death in my State--this chart \ngoes back to about, oh, Lord, a dozen years or so. In the early part of \nthe 1990s, about 32 percent of the folks who died in our State died \nfrom heart disease, about 26 percent died from cancer, 6 percent died \nfrom strokes, 4 percent died from chronic lower respiratory disease, 4 \npercent died from accidents, and 3 percent died from diabetes, and 25 \npercent died from ``all others.''\n  Keep in mind, in the early 1990s, cancer was right around 26 percent, \nheart disease was 32 percent.\n  Let's see what it looked like a decade later. Heart disease was at 32 \npercent, now it is down to 29 percent; and cancer, which was at 26 \npercent, is now down to 24 percent. The rest are pretty much the same, \nalthough ``all other'' is gaining. In fact, ``all other'' is in first \nplace now, whatever ``all other'' is.\n  We are real pleased to see the drop in the number of cancer deaths. \nDoes that sound like a lot over a 10-year period of time, to drop from \n26 percent down to 24 percent? It is not. But as I said earlier, it is \na little bit like changing that aircraft carrier. The numbers have \ndropped. We are convinced we are doing something right, and we want to \ncontinue what seems to be working.\n  I have a couple of other charts, and then I will close. This is a \nchart that goes back to the beginning of the 1980s--1980 to 1984--and \nup to 2002. The red numbers are the cancer mortality rates for the \ncountry, and the numbers above are cancer mortality rates for Delaware, \nstarting in the early 1980s and going to the early part of this decade.\n  As you can see, the gap by around 1990--the early 1990s--the gap \nright here, was pretty large, back here, but it is even larger here. \nThat is when we started doing something different, changing up our game \nplan in Delaware. And we are still above the national average here, but \nit is about half of what it was a decade or so ago. So we are convinced \nwe are on the right path.\n  One more chart. My staff thinks this is not a very good chart, and \nmaybe it is not. I kind of like it. Let's see if I can get it straight. \nWe look here at the percentage of the reduction in cancers. It dropped \nbetween the early 1990s and the early part of this decade. The \nmortality rate of all cancers in Delaware went down by about 13 \npercent--a drop in all cancers.\n  The cancer mortality rate in the United States during the same period \nwent down about 7 or 8 percent. The drop in the lung cancer mortality \nrate in Delaware, over the last decade, was, again, by about 13 \npercent. In the country, it went down by about 5 percent, in this same \nperiod of time. Colorectal deaths went down in our State by over 15 \npercent over that 10-year period of time, and down about 12 percent in \nthe country. Breast cancer deaths in Delaware went down, in the last \ndecade or so, by about almost 20 percent. In the country, it went down \nby about 12 or 13 percent.\n  And for guys like us--Senator Enzi and my colleague, the Presiding \nOfficer--this is a real attention getter. For prostate cancer, the \nmortality rate in our State, in the last decade, went down by almost 50 \npercent, in Delaware, as compared to the rest of the country, which was \nabout half that, roughly 25 percent.\n  I think that is a pretty good chart, and I am glad it was made up for \nus to look at.\n  The point I want to make is, actually sometimes we have these \nmandates, along with other things I mentioned earlier, and some \npositive things do happen in our respective States.\n  We are pleased with the progress we have made, and we have a long way \nto go in Delaware. We want to make sure we have the tools to be able to \ncontinue in that vein.\n  I have said my piece. I look forward to seeing how the smoke clears \nand what things will look like after tomorrow. We will just take it \nfrom there.\n  I yield back my time. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will not be very long. I will be very \nbrief. I\n\n[[Page S4317]]\n\nwant to speak about the bill that the Presiding Officer, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, has brought forth from the HELP Committee.\n  I have the honor of serving with the chairman on the HELP Committee. \nI think he has done a great job crafting this bill, which will offer \nmore people the ability to afford health insurance in America.\n  We have heard reports about how many uninsured Americans are in our \ncountry today. The fundamental point is that a lot of Americans simply \ncannot afford to buy health insurance. And, many uninsured Americans \nare employed by small businesses. I have built, owned, and operated two \nanimal hospitals, veterinary hospitals. As a small business owner, it \nis very difficult to afford to buy health insurance, not only for \nyourself, but, obviously, for your employees. One of the reasons it is \ndifficult to buy health insurance relates to purchasing power. When you \nhave a small number of people, it is difficult to go to insurance \ncompanies and negotiate effectively for good prices. If you have 20 \nemployees versus a company that has 20,000 employees, the company with \n20,000 employees has a lot more buying power and, therefore, can \nnegotiate prices down more effectively than the smaller company.\n  The bill before us today establishes small business health plans, \nwhich will allow small businesses, such as the veterinarians, the \nrestaurant owners, and the physical therapists to band together through \ntheir associations, and negotiate for health care coverage at prices \nthey can afford. What this means is that a lot of people who are \ncurrently uninsured can become part of the insurance market. There is \nalso a side benefit for the people who already have health insurance. A \nlot of people who are currently uninsured are young, healthy people who \nhappen to want some type of health insurance coverage. If we bring \nthese individuals into the health insurance market, they will help \nspread out the risk, which lowers costs for everyone else.\n  Now, we have heard criticism from the other side of the aisle saying \nthat we are not maintaining the mandates that a lot of States have put \nforward. Opponents say that some people are going to be without \ncoverage for mammograms, cancer treatments, and other services.\n  These same people today have no health insurance coverage \nwhatsoever--isn't basic coverage better than no coverage at all? We \nwould love to offer and be able to afford to offer everyone every type \nof service possible. But the reality is that a lot of people cannot \nafford health insurance plans today because insurance coverage has \nbecome too expensive. One of the reasons for this is that small \nbusinesses cannot pool together across state lines. Another reason has \nto do with mandates.\n  We talk about a lot of different proposals that can lower the cost of \nhealth care for hard-working Americans. Everybody campaigns and tells \ntheir constituents: We have to do something about the high cost of \nhealth care. We must do something. Let's act.\n  We have an opportunity to act now in the Senate. There is a good bill \nbefore us. We need to act on this bill so that uninsured Americans can \ncome into the insurance market.\n  This bill is estimated, by an actuarial firm, to lower the cost of \nhealth insurance for small employers by as much as 12 percent. This is \na significant number. Every dollar you lower the cost of health \ninsurance makes more and more people able to afford it.\n  It is time for us to enact legislation that is actually going to be \ngood for the American people, a proposal that will allow more people to \nbe able to afford health care coverage.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us today goes a long way toward making \nhealth insurance more affordable for small business owners and \nemployees. I encourage this Senate to get behind this legislation. \nLet's move it forward, work out the legislative differences with the \nHouse, and send a bill to the President that will help Americans afford \nhealth care insurance today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, thank you for taking my \nstead in the Chair this evening so I could participate in this debate. \nI have been in the Chair 2 hours and 30 minutes and have heard quite a \nrange of things.\n  Health care is a problem that affects the whole country today. We are \ngoing to spend in our Nation $2.3 trillion this year. The largest \namount of money we are going to spend on anything in our country, we \nare going to spend on health care, and one out of every three dollars \nwe spend does not help anybody get well.\n  We ought to ask ourselves--with 45 million people truly not covered \nin an insurance product, with the cost of health care rising double \ndigits every year, with the cost of drugs skyrocketing, with the cost \nof hospitalization, emergency care skyrocketing--how is it we are \nspending all this money, with $1 out of every $3 not helping somebody \nget well, and costs are going through the roof?\n  It is because we have some real structural problems. This bill is \nmeant to address a small portion of that. It is not the end-all, \nanswer-all to our problems in health care. We all realize that. But \nthis is something we can do in the short term that will make available \nan opportunity for costs to be controlled in a small area of our \neconomy that will have impact and will create accessibility.\n  I would say we all in this body want everybody to have access to \nhealth care. The question is, Who pays for it? Right now, in terms of \nMedicare, our grandchildren are paying for it because it ran a $120 \nbillion deficit last year. In other words, we borrowed $120 billion to \nrun Medicare last year because that is the amount of money we did not \nhave coming in from Medicare premiums.\n  The whole question on how we address health care is going to be: How \ndo we get a better system that will give more people access, that does \nnot waste that $1 out of $3? That is what we have to be concerned with. \nWe have the brains, we have the science, we have the facilities, but \nsomething is wrong. What is wrong is there is not a competitive system \nout there where we allocate scarce resources based on quality and value \nand price.\n  This bill will move a little bit in that direction. There are going \nto be a lot of areas where we move. The one thing I have heard from the \nother side that I agree with today is, we ought to be emphasizing \nprevention. I agree with that 100 percent.\n  We have 19 different agencies in the Federal Government that have \nsomething to do with prevention. We are going to be introducing a bill \nthat pulls all those together into one and has a leader who is \nemphasizing prevention and what we can teach the American people about \nsaving money, preventive health care. As grandma used to say: An ounce \nof prevention is worth a pound of cure. And it works every time.\n  We know we can prevent diabetes. We can stop 50 percent of diabetes \njust with education, but we don't have it. We are wasting resources and \nduplicating resources. We have opportunity costs from programs that are \ndesigned to do it and don't do it well. Others do it much better, but \nwe are still funding the ones that don't do it well. There are lots of \nproblems we have.\n  I want the American people to understand that the choice that has \nbeen outlined by those who oppose this bill today isn't a choice of \nwhether we have to have mandates. It is a choice of somebody who has no \ncare now, no mandate, versus getting some care. If we do our job on \nprevention, then we will be educating the American people. But the \nultimate health care responsibility in this country isn't the Congress. \nIt isn't the States. It is the individuals who make choices about what \nis going to impact their lives and what value they want on their health \ncare. That is why HSAs, although they have been blocked, need to be \nexpanded vastly. They need to be funded better. They need to have an \napplication for chronic care, and they need to have a tax deductibility \nto bring you up to the level of that so that we put everybody's skin in \nthe game, so you know you are going to make a choice based on what is \nvaluable to you.\n  Everywhere else in this country, we have trusted markets to allocate \nscarce resources. We are a little timid about how they are doing it in \noil, but the fact is, the market is scarce, and the price is up. As \nsoon as either demand decreases or supply increases,\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\nthe price will come back down, or some other form of energy is going to \nbe there to supply it, such as agrifuels.\n  We have to trust the market to help us because we can't afford what \nwe have promised. We can't afford what we promised in Medicaid, in \nMedicare. The money is not going to be there in 10 years. It is going \nto start winnowing away. So what are we to do? Continue to create a \ncharade for the American people that says yes, we can, or start with \none small step with this bill which offers availability through group \npurchasing, expanded purchasing power, lowering the overall risk to a \nmillion people? Why would we not want to do that?\n  Is it perfect? No. There isn't a bill we pass that is perfect. But \nthis is a step in the right direction, although it does walk over some \nState mandates, I agree. But the problem is, Medicaid walks over State \nmandates every day. Medicare walks over State mandates every day. They \nset a mandate.\n  We have two choices in health care: the Government is going to run it \nall, or we go to the private sector where we really trust the market to \nallocate and protect those who need the help, those who can't help \nthemselves. Those are the only two choices we have on health care. If \nyou think we have problems now, wait until the Government runs it all.\n  I am a physician. I have practiced since 1983. That is 23 years. I \nhave delivered 4,000 babies. I have done every kind of operation you \ncan think of. I have seen a system decline based on how insurance has \nbeen applied to it and copying the mandates of the Federal Government. \nSo we are in a mess on health care. Let's get out of the mess. Let's \nstart with this, but let's don't stop there. Let's start with \nprevention. Let's make sure there is competition in the pharmaceutical \nindustry. We don't have it.\n  As a practicing physician, there is no competition in the \npharmaceutical industry. Drugs that do exactly the same thing and are \npriced the same way, nobody wants an increased market share. The \nFederal Trade Commission ought to be asking why. Why don't they want \nincreased market share? I believe there is collusion on sharing of \nmarkets in the pharmaceutical industry so that they can keep the prices \nhigh. We need worldwide competition on pharmaceuticals. If we will do \nthat, we will get a lot of bang for our buck.\n  There is even collusion when it comes to the generics. The FDA has \ncreated this wonderful system which enhances no competition for 6 \nmonths to 18 months for the first person who comes out with a generic. \nWhat is that all about? That is taking away from the market.\n  There are lots of problems, but this is a good start. It is not \nperfect. Is it as good as we can get? It probably is right now. But it \nstarts us down the path on what we need to do to fix health care in \nthis country. That is competition.\n  We need transparency. We have seen recently hospitals not wanting to \ngive their rates, doctors not wanting to give rates, Medicare not \nwanting to publish rates. Why not? Let people know what they are \nsupposed to be getting charged. Let's have a little open sunshine on \nthe health care industry.\n  Let's talk about the 19 percent of every dollar that goes into the \nhealth insurance industry that never goes to help anybody get well. \nLet's talk about that. Let's create real competition in the health \ninsurance industry. The more people get into it, the more competition \nwe will have.\n  I thank the Senator for filling in for me so I could take the time to \naddress the Senate. Our goal is making sure everybody has access to \ncare and doing it in a way that our children can afford to pay for it \nbecause we are not paying for it today. We need to be mindful of that \nas we make those decisions. This bill starts with that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, as you spoke on this bill, you inspired me \nto come back over for another opportunity to talk. To put in context \nwhy we are here, you have to talk about where we have been this week. \nWe started this week focused on exactly what you raised, and that was \nthe inflation factors that go into health care.\n  On Monday, we were slated to consider two different proposals. One \nwas a proposal that limited the liability that all medical \nprofessionals have, and we have seen liability premiums rise at a rate \nthat is unsustainable for doctors across the country. That bill was \nquickly questioned as to whether we would bring it to the floor. Some \nargued that there was no need to; it is not a problem. We were forced \nto have a vote on whether we could proceed to consider the bill. We \ndidn't vote on the bill. We didn't offer amendments on the bill. We had \na vote on whether we could proceed, which requires 60 Members of the \nSenate to support. We didn't get 60 votes. The American people didn't \nget cost reductions because some in this body chose not to extend the \nprivilege of debate and the voice of the American people in the \namendment process into that bill.\n  We turned around and we introduced another bill. The bill's coverage \napplied to those specialists who are OB/GYNs; in other words, \nindividuals who deliver babies, something that is vital in this \ncountry.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is, in fact, an OB/GYN. He delivers \nbabies. He delivered babies throughout his career in the House of \nRepresentatives. He would leave the House, he would go home and deliver \nbabies on the weekends so that he could keep his practice alive. He \ndoesn't have the luxury now in the Senate. That is a shame because he \nwas good.\n  There are communities all across this country that have lost their \nOB/GYNs, not because they became U.S. Senators but because they can't \nafford liability insurance anymore. They have been forced to leave \nrural America and go to urban America where they are under the umbrella \nof coverage of a large medical institution, in all likelihood \naffiliated with an academic institution.\n  What happened on Monday night when we took up liability limitations \nfor those across this country who deliver babies? We didn't get the \nopportunity to debate it. We didn't get the opportunity to amend it. We \nhad a motion we had to vote on to proceed. Because 60 Senators didn't \nagree to move forward, that died a quick death. Two bills that \naddressed substantive ways to cut the cost of health care died in a \nmatter of 1 hour on the Senate floor because people didn't think it was \nimportant enough to address things that are inflationary to the cost of \nhealth care.\n  I said shortly after that I was going to come back to the floor \nbecause I thought it was important for my colleagues on the Senate \nfloor and people in the gallery and across the country to hear real \nstories from real Americans.\n  In North Carolina, we have a lot of people who are suffering today \nbecause they lack insurance. So the third part of Health Care Week is \nto take up a bill that allows small businesses--really the heart and \nsoul of America--to purchase as associations, as groups, to negotiate \nen masse because they don't get the luxury of the benefits of large \ncorporations to leverage the cost of health insurance. For that reason, \nmany small businesses today can't afford to provide health care and to \nkeep the doors open of their businesses. So they choose to hire folks \nand to employ them and to pay them but not to extend health care \nbenefits. Those are numbers that are counted in the national uninsured \npopulation.\n  In North Carolina, we have 671,000 small businesses. Small businesses \nmake up 98 percent of the firms in North Carolina. Women-owned small \nbusinesses have increased 24 percent since 1997. Hispanic-owned small \nbusinesses have increased 24 percent since 1997; Black-owned small \nbusinesses, 31 percent; Asian small businesses, 74 percent. Are they \nany better off because of the categories they are in to provide health \ninsurance for their employees? No, because they are caught in the same \nproblem. They don't employ enough people to negotiate like the larger \ncorporations.\n  In North Carolina, there are 1.3 million uninsured individuals, and \n900,000\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\nof those uninsured individuals are in families or on their own with one \nfull-time worker. One full-time worker is in that house either with a \nfamily or is the individual in the house. The opportunity with this one \nbill is that we will have 900,000 people who potentially have the \nopportunity for the first time to be covered by health insurance.\n  Many run to this floor, and they talk about what we need to do as a \nCongress. They don't really mean we need to pass legislation that \ncreates an affordable health care bill. What they mean is they would \nlike for the Federal Government, through taxpayer funding, to produce a \nbenefit we pay for for anybody who is without health care.\n  I think we have the right approach. The right approach is to make \nsure that small businesses can band together, that they can negotiate \nwith the private insurance market, that they can offer a benefit, for \nthe first time for many of them, to their employees, and the retention \nof their employees is better because that benefit is now extended.\n  Do you realize that the most expensive benefit that is offered by a \nbusiness today is health care? It is not retirement, not any of the \nthings that historically we have looked at. The health care benefit is \nthe single most important thing.\n  I heard the Presiding Officer talk about the future and the fact that \nour children are the ones paying for Medicare today.\n  That is, in fact, right. Three things control our competitiveness in \nthe world, and they are health care, energy, and labor. But I guarantee \nyou, when we bring up energy, we are going to be blocked from \nproceeding because we will try to bring down gas prices and try to come \nup with things that bring stability in energy. Some would rather see \nnothing happen on the Senate floor.\n  I have an individual who is in the appraisal business in North \nCarolina who wrote to me and said that small businesses need help with \ninsurance. That is in big letters. He says he is now paying $986 per \nmonth for his wife and himself. This is for only 60 percent coverage \nand a $2,500 deductible. He says he knows people with group insurance \npaying $600 for 80 percent coverage and a $250 deductible, and many of \nthose have dental insurance as well. He said his policy provides none. \n``Please help me out.''\n  This came from a store owner, and it says that as a small business \nowner, it is important to enable some economy of scale in allowing \nfranchises to obtain more affordable health insurance.\n  The economies of scale is exactly what we are on the Senate floor to \ndebate. I might add at this time that this debate really didn't start \nuntil several hours ago because on the third bill--this bill--we had to \nvote on a motion to proceed, which we won this time, and we had to \ndelay some 30 hours before we could engage in the amendment process and \ngeneral debate.\n  This comes from an individual from Hickory, NC. She said that as a \nparent and an employer, she knows the importance of having affordable \ninsurance and the financial devastation that occurs when you have no \ncoverage. Unfortunately, there has to be a tradeoff. She says she has \nonly one of two options to keep her doors open: either her employees \nhave no insurance or they receive a livable wage. When there are no \nviable alternatives for employers to purchase reasonably priced \ninsurance, the losers are her employees.\n  What are we here debating? We are debating a change from today's \npolicy. What is the choice employees of small business have today? It \nis a choice between nothing and nothing. That is unacceptable. That is \nwhy the chairman, Chairman Enzi, has worked so hard to carefully craft \na bill that doesn't bypass those who are charged today with regulating \ninsurance, every State insurance commissioner. But it incorporates them \nfully and allows products that can be created that, for once, are \naffordable. Sure, they don't have all the bells and whistles. They \ndon't cover the full scope of coverage that every insurance product has \ntoday. But when your options are nothing and nothing, isn't it \nreasonable to believe that we can have a debate about creating \nsomething and nothing? Isn't that, in fact, why we are here?\n  In South Carolina, there is a textile company, a small business owner \nin Greenville who says that providing health insurance is becoming an \nunbearable hardship for small businesses such as hers. She is a widow, \nself-employed, and her health insurance is an expense she can hardly \nafford. Like many of her employees, she has a $5,000 deductible, and \nher monthly premium constantly increases 35 to 40 percent every 6 \nmonths. Most would say that is impossible, but I have her name and her \naddress, I have the city in which she lives, and I have her company \nname. She wrote to me.\n  It is individuals who are turning to the U.S. Senate now. The House \npassed it. They are saying: Please produce something for us.\n  Here is one from Alabama. It is not all North Carolina. This is an \nowner of a nursing services company who said that the cost to cover one \nemployee is $225 a month, and it is $617 for full family coverage, \nwhich is up 6 percent over last year. She recently lost a long-term \nemployee to a larger company because that company could afford to pay \n100 percent of the employee's health care costs. She thinks it is \nsimply unfair that we don't do anything.\n  Janice is from Kentucky. She is the owner of an elevator company. She \nwas hit with an astonishing 60-percent increase in health care premiums \nin 2002. There are a lot of similarities in the last letter. Some might \nhave thought that is impossible. It is not.\n  Here is another one. Some of this increase in cost was passed down to \nemployees because her company simply could not absorb all of the costs. \nIf this trend continues, which she fully expects, they will have to \ndrop the coverage she has provided for employees for years.\n  The writing is on the wall. We need to do something to relieve the \npressure for small business in America or the uninsured rolls will \nincrease. The rolls will not decrease because these small business \nowners cannot afford to continue to supply health care as a benefit.\n  Here is one from Mississippi. As a new small business owner in \nMississippi, he finds it harder every day to make sense of why he pays \nthree times as much for family health insurance as he paid when he \nworked in the same industry for a large company. He says there needs to \nbe a way for his company to offer his employees similar high-value \nhealth insurance that he was offered when working with the big guys at \na reasonable rate. Small businesses are at an immediate disadvantage \nsimply because they are small, he said.\n  I talked earlier today about my election to the House of \nRepresentatives, when the Presiding Officer and I came in. I came from \nwhat I considered to be a small business, but it was over 50 people. We \nhad adequate health care. I paid 25 percent, and the company paid 75 \npercent. I got to Washington as a Member of Congress. I found that my \nchoices for health care increased in number, but I thought it was \nprobably most prudent to choose, in fact, the same plan I had in the \nprivate sector, the same company, the same plan. I paid the same 25 \npercent, the Government paid the same 75 percent. What was the one \ndifference? The one difference, now that I was part of 2 million people \nwho worked for the Federal Government, was that my premium went up $50.\n\n  You see, there are some that will argue that the only way to solve \nthe health care crisis in America is to have the Government take it \nover. If you want to solve small businesses' problems, let the \nGovernment negotiate a health care plan for them. Well, my experience \nwith the Government negotiating health care is that it costs me more \nmoney. I would be willing to bet that most will find that to be the \ncase. Incredibly, nobody is calling my office saying: I wish you guys \nwould negotiate for me, or I wish the Government would take this over. \nDon't provide me choices, just give me one. I don't want to choose.\n  This is from Larry in Mississippi, who owns a small company. He has \nlittle buying power and few affordable options for health care. It is \nsimilar to what has happened in so many States, where one insurer \ncontrols more than 75 percent of the small-group market. This lack of \ncompetition resulted in an 80-percent increase in the last 2 years for \nhis John Deere dealership.\n  I will tell you what, if there is anybody I would work hard for to \nfind him\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\na deal on health insurance, it is a John Deere dealership. He increased \nthe deductible from $250 to $2,500. He says that if he doesn't receive \nrelief soon, he will be forced to drop all insurance coverage or lose \nhis business. So he has an option: He can close the door, and everybody \nwho works for him would be out of business.\n  You see, we are here because today the choice that small businesses \nand their employees have is a choice between nothing and nothing. All \nwe are here to do is to suggest that we engage in this bill and that we \nhave an up-or-down vote about something. Nobody will see this as a \nsilver bullet that solves the health care crisis, as the Presiding \nOfficer said earlier. That will take a much more in-depth engagement, a \nmuch more difficult debate on the Senate floor. We really will bring in \nthe experts as we try to provide the changes that are needed so our \nchildren have the same benefits we have. But it doesn't make me too \noptimistic if we cannot solve this simple thing that so many small \nbusinesses are experiencing today.\n  Here is one from Virginia, not too far from us. The owner of a small \nindustrial service firm is facing a crisis trying to provide health \ninsurance for employees. His small business, with 20 employees, has \nstruggled for the past 10 years to provide a health benefit plan. He \nhas been able to continue to provide this insurance only by reducing \ncoverage, raising individual office fees, and asking his employees to \npay a higher share of the monthly premium. Underwriting penalties for \nsmall groups and rising medical costs and increasing mandates from \ngovernment are collectively squeezing his small business to the point \nwhere meaningful health coverage will simply not be affordable.\n  I thought our job was to try to bring more people under the umbrella \nof coverage. I thought that was the objective, to try to create new \nproducts, create more affordable products, make sure that health care \nis not just more affordable but more accessible.\n  Here we are on the Senate floor with one of the most carefully \ncrafted bills I have ever seen--a bill that a group of actuaries from a \nwell-respected firm found would reduce health insurance costs for small \nbusiness by 12 percent in today's dollars. That is $1,000 per employee. \nIs somebody in this institution telling me that small business \nemployees across the country don't want to save $1,000 or that they \ndon't want to have the opportunity to have less of their out-of-pocket \nmoney go to health care coverage or that we should ignore a well-\nrespected actuary?\n  By the way, the actuary also found that S. 1955 would reduce the \nnumber of workers who are uninsured by about 8 percent, or 1 million \npeople. This would automatically bring a million people under the \numbrella of coverage. That hits home to me because I have 1.3 million \nuninsured in North Carolina. I have 1.3 million uninsured individuals, \nand 17 percent of North Carolina's population is uninsured today; 16 \npercent are uninsured nationally in this country.\n  Do you realize that only 205,000 of those 1.3 million uninsured are \npart-time workers? There is this belief that that number includes all \npart-time workers. If we could just make sure Wal-Mart supplied health \ninsurance, this would all be over. No. The majority of mine--1.1 \nmillion--in all likelihood work for small businesses. They are \nuninsured. And 900,000 of them certainly are in a family where they \ncould have a chance at health care coverage if, in fact, we pass this \nbill.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has also looked at the bill, and they \nfound similar numbers of newly uninsured Americans. If S. 1955 were \nsigned into law, CBO estimates that nearly 750,000 more people would \nhave private health insurance than under current law. I guess that is \nthe key. I guess some don't want there to be private health insurance. \nWhen we leave the marketplace alone, when we set it up so it is fair, \nit is amazing what competition does.\n  As a gentleman from Mississippi said, when one company controls 75 \npercent, where is my negotiation point? We are talking about letting \nnational associations band together. We are talking about potentially \nshopping for national coverage, with national firms, but letting the \nState insurance commissioner regulate the product. I am not sure there \nis a downside to that, unless the downside is that we have now brought \nmore individuals under the umbrella of coverage and this issue begins \nto diminish from a standpoint of the politics that comes along with \nhealth care.\n  Mr. President, I am going to end for the evening. I will not end for \nthe debate, though. I still continue to get letters into my office that \nare real stories about real people. I think many times real people are \nforgotten on the floor. We get so wrapped up in the debate of issues \nthat we forget that everything we do here affects somebody in this \ncountry or in the world.\n  Each time we stop long enough--maybe this weekend; I am not sure we \nwill finish this bill this week; I hope we do--we figure out who these \nuninsured are. Maybe everybody will take an opportunity to go to a \nsmall business if they haven't visited one in their State, and they can \nask those small business owners: What is the health care market like \nfor your employees? I have a feeling what they are going to hear is \nwhat I have shared with you from real businesses, real owners about \nreal people who can't afford what is available to them today.\n  There are in North Carolina 671,000 small businesses that desperately \nwant a choice of something. Today all they have is nothing versus \nnothing. Their employees have nothing or nothing. Not a very good \nchoice.\n  I am glad we are on this bill. I am glad the 30 hours is over. I \ncommend Chairman Enzi for legislation that is incredibly well crafted. \nIt is focused exactly where it needs to be, and that is to make sure \nplans are not cherry-picking, to make sure that regardless of the money \nthat is available, there is a health care option so an employer and \ntheir employees can decide whether it is, in fact, affordable.\n  At the end of the day, it is my hope that Members of this very \nhistoric institution will remember the folks back home who sent them \nhere, that they will remember the next generation we are obligated to \nrepresent, that we have an obligation today to make sure individuals \nwho want to be covered have an affordable option to be covered, to make \nsure we fix some of the problems so the next generation, our kids, \ndon't fight the same challenges we fight today.\n  I am convinced this debate will continue, and at the end of the day, \nI am convinced the American people will win regardless of what the \nintent is of some in this institution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, something is wrong when 45 million \nAmericans, 8 out of 10 of them in working families, cannot afford \naccess to quality health insurance. This past weekend I met a woman in \nDes Moines who has been without health insurance for herself and her \ndaughter since her husband died several years ago. She works hard as an \nadministrative assistant in a small law office. She lives, like many \nIowans, from paycheck to paycheck. She cannot afford private health \ninsurance and she makes too much money to qualify for the State's \nChildren's Health Insurance Program or Medicaid. This has consequences. \nShe has not had any screenings or preventive care in years. Her \ndaughter does not go to the doctor regularly, despite the fact that \ntheir family has a long history of diabetes and cancer. She knows she \nis at risk but cannot do anything about it. What happens to her if she \ngets sick?\n  Many people believe the United States has the best health care system \nin the world--the best treatments, the best medical technology, the \nbest pharmaceuticals. But this is a cruel joke to the uninsured, \nincluding more than 8 million children, because they are forced to make \ndo with substandard care or none at all. The result is a paradox. The \nUnited States has a world-class health care system, but we fall behind \nmost industrialized countries when our general health outcomes are\n\n[[Page S4321]]\n\nmeasured. In 2000, the World Health Organization ranked our health care \nsystem 37th in outcomes that our health system provides. Just this \nweek, CNN reported a new study which found that the U.S. ranked next to \nlast in infant mortality among industrialized countries.\n  Bear in mind again that health insurance is not just about seeing a \ndoctor when you are sick; it is about prevention as well. If you have \ninsurance, you are more likely to have a relationship with a doctor or \nhealth care specialist who knows you and your health history. You are \nmore likely to have access to preventive care so that chronic disease \ncan be prevented in the first place. Without health care coverage, \nminor illnesses turn into major ones and small incidents turn into \nchronic conditions. Once this happens, it becomes almost impossible to \nafford quality health insurance without restrictions on benefits.\n  That is why this debate is so important. This week we are considering \na major overhaul of the insurance system in an effort to help provide \nhealth care coverage to small business owners and their employees. I \napplaud the goal, but this particular legislation before us now is \nsorely lacking and will not provide access to quality health care at \naffordable prices.\n  I oppose the bill before us for the following reasons:\n  First, the bill eliminates consumer protections found in current \nState regulations, including in Iowa. In Iowa, under the bill, 840,000 \nconsumers would lose coverage for diabetes testing supplies and \neducation, emergency services, mammography screenings, State mental \nhealth parity, and well child care. They would also lose guaranteed \naccess to dentists, nurses, nurse practitioners, and other providers. \nIowa does not have a laundry list of coverage services. Iowa State \nregulations guarantee quality insurance. But S. 1955 would do away with \nthe compromises that were worked out at the State level to guarantee \nquality.\n  Secondly, the supporters of this bill argue that the bill would lower \ninsurance premiums for small businesses. What they don't tell you is \nthat it comes at a cost. Many people, especially those who are older \nand sicker, would see their insurance premiums increase under the \nlegislation, even with the changes found in the managers' amendment. \nCBO found that insurers will charge significantly higher premiums to \nthose who are sicker, older, and otherwise less favorable to insurance \ncompanies. They will do this in order to reduce health insurance \npremiums for small firms with workers who have relatively low expected \ncosts for health care. Imagine the shock of business owners all across \nAmerica, including many I have met with recently in Iowa, when they are \nbilled for the first insurance premiums under the new bill.\n  So keep in mind, of course, you can always get cheaper insurance, but \nwhat does it cover, at what cost, and what are the premiums going to be \nfor the person who is covered?\n  Third, and importantly, this bill would undermine State efforts to \nguarantee coverage for preventive services. As I have often said many \ntimes, we don't have a health care system in America, we have a sick \ncare system. If you are sick, you get care. But we spend precious \nlittle money and we have very few incentives for keeping people out of \nthe hospital, keeping them out of the doctors' offices, and keeping \nthem healthy in the first place. This bill would make it worse. In \nshort order, insurers would offer stripped-down policies that do not \ncover preventive services. The result would be the elimination, as I \nsaid, of cancer screenings, well child care, mental health services, \naccess to certain physicians or nurses or other providers such as \nchiropractors, for example, who might give you good care and keep you \nfrom getting a chronic condition, something that might cause you to \nhave an operation in the first place. So importantly, this would mean \nelimination of benefits for everyone, not just small business.\n  Americans should have access to quality, affordable health care \ncoverage. Coverage that is stripped down is not sufficient, and we \nshouldn't settle for it. People's lives, their livelihoods, their \nability to contribute to society will all be undermined if they are not \nhealthy.\n  I met with small business leaders in Iowa. Of course they want relief \nfrom high insurance premiums or from not even being able to get \npolicies at all for their workers. We all do. Small business is the \nbackbone of my State. And they need--they need--to have some kind of \ninsurance coverage for their workers. With regard to this bill, what I \nhave said to them is, don't think it is this bill or nothing. I also \nask them: Are you willing to lose access to quality health insurance? \nJust check with the American Cancer Society. We have cancer societies \nin our small towns and communities all over America. People who run \nsmall businesses contribute heavily to our local cancer societies. But \nhere is what the American Cancer Society said:\n\n       In one stroke, this bill would erase all that state \n     legislatures have done to prevent and more effectively treat \n     cancer by ensuring access to life-saving screenings for \n     breast, colon, and prostate cancer, cancer specialists \n     coverage for evidence based off label drug use, clinical \n     trials, and proven smoking cessation services.\n\n  That is from the American Cancer Society about this bill.\n  I ask all my friends; I ask anyone who has had a history of cancer in \ntheir families: Would you want insurance that doesn't cover screenings \nfor breast cancer or colon cancer or prostate cancer?\n  How about the American Diabetes Association. We know that diabetes is \nhitting people younger and younger all the time. We have to do \nsomething to prevent diabetes. But here is what the American Diabetes \nAssociation said about this bill:\n\n       We must ask ourselves how people with diabetes will be able \n     to pay for a disease that costs an average of $13,243 per \n     person to manage. Unfortunately, it will be our emergency \n     rooms and Medicaid system that are forced to pay.\n\n  I ask my friends who are diabetic or who have family members with \ndiabetes: Would you want insurance that doesn't cover diabetes-related \nservices?\n  Those are just two examples, but there are many others. So, again, it \nis not this bill or nothing. There is a better option out there that \nwill guarantee coverage for these services and at the same time provide \nsmall business access to quality insurance.\n  One realistic solution that I support would be to give small \nbusinesses the option of joining a program modeled after the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program. That is the program that covers us \nhere and we love it, believe me. All Senators, all Congressmen, Supreme \nCourt Justices, all our Post Office people--anybody who has anything to \ndo with the Federal Government belongs to the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Program. It is great coverage. Why shouldn't small businesses \nhave access to the same kind of program we have?\n  That is why I have joined with Senators Durbin and Lincoln to \nintroduce S. 2510, the Small Business Health Benefits Plan. Here is why \nthis bill is superior to the bill we have before us:\n  First, it would create a larger purchasing pool, a nationwide pool, \nrather than the fragmented pools that will be created under S. 1955. A \nnational pool would reduce insurance rates for everyone.\n  A few years ago, before I came to this place, I sold insurance. There \nis a principle in insurance that we all know: The more people in the \npool, the cheaper it is for everybody. It is one of the fundamental \nprinciples of insurance. The more people in the pool, cheaper it is for \neveryone. So you want a big pool when you are dealing with health care.\n  S. 1955, the bill before us, sets up thousands and thousands of small \npools. But the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan is one big pool. \nSo if you have that national pool, insurers will be able to offer a \nrange of plans such as we have now. Every year we have open season and \nI can choose from--I don't know, I didn't count last time--maybe about \n18 different plans. But the Office of Personnel Management would \nnegotiate the rates and benefits offered under the plans.\n  Should they do that? OPM has been negotiating with private plans for \ndecades. They have consistently negotiated better rates for Federal \nemployees than have been achieved in the non-Federal market.\n  All the Senators here, all those who love the free market system--you \nwill hear speech after speech praising the\n\n[[Page S4322]]\n\nfree market system, but everyone here belongs to the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefit Plan, and OPM is the one that manages the rates and \nnegotiates the rates in these plans. As I said, they are better than \nanything that has ever been achieved in the non-Federal market.\n  Second, our bill offers a tax credit to small employers that would \nhelp offset the cost of premiums for employees if they make $25,000 a \nyear or less. S. 1955 doesn't do this. There are no tax breaks for \nsmall businesses in S. 1955. There are more than 26 million Americans \nmaking $25,000 or less working in small businesses. Of those, 12 \nmillion, or 40 percent, are totally uninsured. That is what we want to \nget at.\n  I will be glad to go to any small business with those who are \nadvocating S. 1955. We will take S. 2510 and we will take S. 1955, we \nwill lay it out there and let the small business owner decide which one \nthey would want to have. I would love to see that happen. I tell you I \nknow what would happen: They would pick S. 2510, the one I am talking \nabout, the one that would give them a tax break for covering and would \nprovide quality insurance.\n  Third, our bill does not preempt State consumer protection laws. S. \n1955, the bill before us, would do away with the guarantees I \ndiscussed, the guarantees of preventive services such as breast cancer \nscreening, mammography, cancer, prostate screening, things such as \nthat. By contrast, our bill would keep State insurance laws where they \nare. The insurance would cover mammograms, cervical cancer screening, \ndiabetes testing supplies, immunizations, and on and on.\n  If you are a small businessperson and you happen to be watching this \nsession and you are listening to my remarks, you are probably saying: \nSenator Harkin, that all sounds good. Why don't you get S. 2510, the \nbill you are talking about, up for a vote?\n  Welcome to the unreal world of the Senate, when we are not allowed to \ndo things such as that. We have S. 1955. The majority leader has, if \nyou will pardon the expression, filled the tree. That is sort of \ngobbledygook around this place which means they have blocked us from \noffering any amendments, and then we are supposed to vote on cloture on \nthe bill, which means debate comes to an end on the bill and you can't \nfile anything that is not germane.\n  Tomorrow night we are going to be asked to vote for cloture on it? I \nam not going to vote for cloture on that. If you want to have an open \nHealth Week here and you want to bring out S. 1955, leave it wide open \nso we can offer S. 2510 and we can have a debate on it and have up-or-\ndown votes. I am all for that. I think the small business community in \nAmerica ought to know that we are not being allowed to bring up our \nbill for amendment and discussion. I think our bill would pass. I think \nthe small business community would support it.\n\n  But as I have understood, being out in Iowa last weekend and as I \ntalked with small business owners, they have sort of been led to \nbelieve it is S. 1955 or nothing. And of course they will take S. 1955. \nIf I thought that was all there was, I would probably take it, too. But \nthat is not the option before us. We have better options than S. 1955. \nWe have the option of S. 2510, the bill I spoke about, introduced by \nSenator Durbin and Senator Lincoln.\n  Again, it is unfortunate--not for us. It is not unfortunate for us. \nWe have great health care coverage. We have great health care coverage. \nIt is not unfortunate for us but unfortunate for the small business \nowners and the 25 million Americans who work for small businesses--12 \nmillion who do not have any insurance at all. This is what is \nunfortunate. It is unfortunate that this bill has been brought up in a \nway that makes it impossible for our side to amend it.\n  Besides getting a vote on our bill, I was prepared to offer a series \nof amendments that focused on preventive care. I think if we are going \nto have a Health Week and we are going to have a bill, I want to start \nfocusing on preventive care. We know it saves money. But we can't do \nthat, either.\n  Count me as one who will not vote for cloture on this bill tomorrow, \nbut count me as one who wants to have an open debate and amendment on a \nhealth insurance program that will be beneficial to our small \nbusinesses. I am sorry we are not going to be able to do it now.\n  Again, we are supposed to have a Health Week. Yet tomorrow I guess we \nwill take all day tomorrow talking about the tax reconciliation bill, \nand then we are not going to be here Friday. What kind of Health Week \nis this? What kind of Health Week is it when we are not allowed to \noffer amendments and debate preventive health care, offer a different \nbill for the one before us?\n  I think the small business owners of America now know what is going \non. I have heard from some who basically have been supportive of S. \n1955 and they are backing off of it. They are saying no, we would \nrather have your bill, we would rather have the one that provides us \nwith some tax credits so we can go out and join a bigger pool like the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Program; so we can join a big pool and \nwe can have preventive services; we can have the State mandates that \nare there now that cover quality. They would rather have that bill.\n  But I am sorry we probably will not be able to get it done this year \nand I think, as I said, that is not just unfortunate for us--heck, we \nhave the best health care coverage. We have great health care coverage. \nThe health coverage we have ought to be available to every American out \nthere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, one of the difficulties around here is the \nprocess we have to use. Another one is that nobody listens to anybody's \ndebate. We have covered this in some detail earlier today, that \nrelevant amendments would be accepted. The Durbin-Lincoln bill ought to \nbe voted on. But it should not be voted on and then S. 1955 precluded \nfrom getting a vote. That is one of the possibilities in the \norganization and the rules that we have around here, that we could wind \nup voting on that one and skipping the vote on S. 1955 and saying: \nLook, all these people voted against that; that means they don't like \nhealth care for small business. But they wouldn't have gotten to vote \nfor the one that they might have liked.\n  I went through a number of the reasons why S. 2510 has some problems. \nI object to people saying we ought to give everybody the same health \ncare the Senators have. We ought to give them better health care than \nthe Senators have. The only problem is we can't do either of those \nthings. The bill that is on the floor by Durbin-Lincoln doesn't do \neither of those things. It is a different plan that uses kind of the \nsame structure so we build the same kind of bureaucracy, except a lot \nbigger bureaucracy to handle all the people in America, and it limits \nall of the pools to each State because they will have to meet all of \nthe mandates of each of those States instead of what we have in the \nFederal plan which is a national level of mandates.\n  We have our own level of mandates. We don't go by what the States do. \nBut that is not what is in that bill. In that bill they would still \nhave to go State by State, and if you go State by State, you can't form \nthe kinds of pools that we need to be able to have the clout to \nnegotiate a better price and to bring around the administration.\n  People say you want to get rid of mandates so that will save money. \nNo. Every experiment, every minilab that has happened out there where \nsmall business people have been given the opportunity to band together \nand to do something, they have covered those mandates. They didn't give \nthose mandates up.\n  How do you save money with this thing? Small businesses pay 35 \npercent for their administration. Big business, which we already \nexcluded from all mandates, we excluded them from Federal control, we \nexcluded them from State oversight and consumer protection, which is in \nmy bill--it still has the State oversight and consumer protection in \nthere--we gave the big businesses the wave on all of those things. They \nstill kept the mandates. But where they saved the money is in \nadministration. It costs them 8 percent to administer their plans. So \n35 percent minus 8 percent means they save 27 percent over what a small \nbusinessman will do. And every 1 percent we can save on insurance \nbrings 200,000 to 300,00 people back into the market.\n\n[[Page S4323]]\n\nThat is why we want to have associations to be able to offer plans \nunder State consumer protection, under the insurance commissioner's \noversight.\n  But with some kind of a blended plan, they can cross State lines and \nhave a uniform package, and they can have a big enough group so they \ncan negotiate. That is what 1955 is about. We need to have a vote on \nthat as well.\n  As far as mandates, Senator Snowe is putting in a bill that will \ncover those basic things people are talking about.\n  The letter that the Senator read from--the American Diabetes \nAssociation--I talked about that a little bit earlier today. One of the \ndifficulties we had in trying to do something with diabetes is that 42 \nStates--it may even be 47 States--are doing something with diabetes, \nbut no two do it alike.\n  Again, how do you blend across State boundaries unless you can get \nsome kind of basic package? I know they will cover diabetes. Under the \nSnowe amendment, they will for sure.\n  The distressing part of their letter was, no matter what changes are \nmade to the Enzi bill, defeat it. That is not a very reasonable \napproach by any disease group. That means that if I have an amendment \nthat said find out everything that is done for diabetes and do \neverything for diabetes that is done anywhere, they would still be \nsuggesting voting against my bill. I don't think that is a reasonable \napproach by any group.\n  The American Cancer Society wrote pretty much the same letter and \nsaid pretty much the same thing.\n  We are not trying to subtract, we are trying to add. We want people \nwho are uninsured to come into the market, and we want people who \nalready have insurance to be able to get more and better insurance for \nthe same dollar. That is what employers are able to afford. We are \ntrying to come up with a system such as that.\n  The only thing about filling the tree--which I agree with the Senator \nis gobbledygook--the only thing with that is to stick to small business \nhealth insurance.\n  There are another dozen things on insurance and health care that we \nought to be debating. Each of them would take about 3 weeks to debate. \nAt this point in the season, we are not going to get 3 weeks to debate \nanything. I am lucky to put together a few days to be able to talk \nabout this. I hope to make more progress on that.\n  I have been working hard with everybody to try to come up with some \nkind of mechanism that will work. That is where we are on the bill. If \nwe could do the things that are relevant to this, or also germane after \ncloture, then we could stay on the bill a little longer and keep \nworking on it. If we don't get cloture, we are probably done with this \ndiscussion for the whole year. That will probably be the end of health \ncare for the year. People have to keep that in mind when they are \nvoting on cloture.\n  Even individual mandates can be brought up one at a time and put into \nthe thing, or at least be voted on. The desire is not to keep votes \nfrom happening but to stick to small business health plans.\n  These folks have been asking us for 15 years for a change and some \nway to handle it. They have been encouraged several times because eight \ntimes the House has passed the association health plan. That was very \nexciting for them. They said I think we can get it. It never made it \nout of committee on the Senate side because there are some problems \nwith the basic plan that the House passed.\n  When I got this chairmanship, I said we are going to do something to \nchange this. We are going to find out what the objections are and see \nif there isn't a way to get something done that will get relief for the \nsmall businessman. The insurance companies were convinced that we were \ngoing to do something, so they sat down with me. The insurance \ncommissioners had concerns, and they have always been one of the \nstakeholders. They sat down with me, and they had their representatives \nsit down with us days on end to work on some kind of a compromise. This \nis one.\n  Nobody is raving about it except the small businesses because they \nsee it as an answer--not the final answer, not the total answer, but an \nanswer--that moves closer to what they can afford to do. Again, it \nisn't by cutting mandates.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. He is a gentleman, and a good friend. I know he is \nserious about this because he is a small business owner himself.\n  As I said earlier--and I want to make sure we are clear--that under \nthis gobbledygook, the filling of the tree--no one understands what we \nare talking about out there--because of the way the bill is laid down, \nthe majority leader, under the rules of the Senate, today offered \namendments to the bill so that we can't offer amendments. There is no \nway we can now offer amendments. If cloture is invoked tomorrow, then \nwe have 30 hours on the bill, and that tree could stay filled. So we \ncan never offer an amendment to this bill. We would then have a final \nvote on S. 1955 without being able to offer any amendments. Is that not \nso?\n  Mr. ENZI. Not quite.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Inform me.\n  Mr. ENZI. Even during the course of today and any other debate we \nhave on this bill, we have said if there is a relevant amendment, we \nwould consider taking that up and voting on it. One exception we have \non that is the difficulty with Durbin-Lincoln. If we vote on that, that \nmight be the only vote we ever get because the other side can block any \nfurther votes from happening because you would have to have unanimous \nconsent to have a vote. So we would be blocked from ever having a vote \non our bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is the problem with this whole cloture process. Why \ndidn't we try to reach a time agreement and an agreement on how many \namendments would be offered? As I understand it, our side was willing \nto do that. Then we would not have this problem of cloture where we are \nprecluded then from offering amendments.\n\n  As the Senator pointed out, if S. 2510 is offered, I don't know what \nwould happen after that. The Senator said it wouldn't be offered. This \nwhole thing with the cloture has screwed up everything.\n  Mr. ENZI. No, I wasn't suggesting that S. 2510 would pass. I was \nsaying that a lot of Democrats would vote for it and it would fail. \nThen there will be no further votes on it. You folks could all say we \nvoted for small business and the Republicans didn't vote for small \nbusiness. It would be because the Republicans wanted S. 1955 with a few \namendments which can be offered by both sides. That would happen \npostcloture. The only thing that happens postcloture is amendments have \nto be germane. That means they actually would have to apply to the \nbill. The Durbin-Lincoln bill is germane. Many of the things people \ntalked about would be germane. What wouldn't be germane are some of the \nlong-term debates and things people would like to do, namely the stem \ncell debate which we are going to have a debate on. They promised a \nvote on it. We don't know how much debate there would be with that; \nprescription drugs, Part D, and those would not be germane to the bill. \nEach of those would take about 3 weeks to debate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, I think if agreements were made with \nthis side and the other side, we could agree on time limits and \nstructures without having this on us.\n  I also say to my friend, I think we should take 3 weeks to debate \nhealth care. We have been wasting so much time around here doing \nnothing. Now tomorrow we have tax reconciliation. So my friend from \nWyoming is getting a day cut out of his deal. I think we ought to take \n3 weeks to debate health care around here. It wouldn't bother me any.\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator certainly is not the only one. I would love to \nhave a lot of time. We have had a lot of bills that came out of \ncommittee already that could be brought up. We have some more that are \ngoing to come out next Tuesday. A lot of those I think would pass here \nby unanimous consent. I would love to have some agreement. The Senator \nknows how hard it is to get 1 week around here. We spent 3 days getting \ncloture to proceed. That is to proceed; that wasn't to actually do any \nvotes on the bill. So we were offered the moment, but between the two \nsides we didn't get the moment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask my friend, what was the vote on the motion to \nproceed?\n  Mr. ENZI. It was 98 to 2.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then there was no problem with that.\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. If there was no problem with it, why did we have to wait 3 \ndays to get the vote?\n  Mr. HARKIN. We didn't have to wait 3 days to get the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am talking about time limits and that sort of thing. \nThose requests were made between leaders to come up with some tight \ntime agreements. It is beyond my pay grade.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is beyond my pay grade, too. I wasn't involved in \nthat.\n  Mr. ENZI. There were a lot negotiations to try to stick to small \nbusiness and have some kind of a mechanism where the votes from both \nsides could be done. But there was not any agreement on that, so we are \nstuck in this kind of a situation where small business may be penalized \nonce again.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is a shame.\n  Mr. ENZI. If we get cloture, we could have a lot of debate on the \nsmall business stuff, not all of other ones. If we could get in a \nsituation where we started doing these things a little quicker, with \nmore time agreements, some of the more difficult ones could probably \nget some floor time. I am for that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If we get cloture, we have 30 hours. Every Senator gets \none 1 to speak. That is putting handcuffs on people; 30 hours, run the \nclock out. One person can get up and offer an amendment and that could \nbe the only amendment we would have for that 30 hours. That is the way \nthings work under cloture. It is not a good way to proceed. I think \nthat is why some of us are upset. We want to help small business. I \nthink there is a fair debate to be had between S. 1955 and S. 2510, \nwith amendments. But somehow we are told that we are going to do this \nin 1 week. Monday is shot. We didn't do anything Monday. We had two \nvotes Monday night. Tuesday, Wednesday, and then Thursday, tomorrow, is \ntax reconciliation. Health Week is 2 days. I don't think that is fair \nto small business, either. I think it is worth taking a couple of weeks \naround here to do it, and to do it right.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am with the Senator.\n  Yes, it would be nice if we could wrap up something for small \nbusiness. I think there is a plan there. I think there is a way to get \nthere. I don't think it is going to happen without the cooperation of \nboth sides in either coming to some time agreements or passing cloture.\n  We will have to wait and see what happens. I would wait until the end \nof next week to have a vote on either of them as long as we can do \namendments. And I am excited about doing amendments. There are always \nperfecting things. No bill is perfect when we finish it. Even after \nconference it is never perfect. But it is usually much better than when \nwe started. We need to have that process.\n  I thank everyone for their participation today.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to speak today about the Medicare \nPrescription Drug Program. I opposed the final version of the \nlegislation that created the Part D drug benefit, the Medicare \nModernization Act, because I believed that it would not provide \nadequate relief for Medicare beneficiaries. I was concerned about the \nstructure of the program, and worried that it would negatively affect \nWisconsinites and other Americans who must quickly and affordably \naccess prescription drugs. I have been trying to fix some of these \nproblems since the program was enacted, but supporters of the program \nhave been unwilling to consider these reforms. Instead, they have \nallowed these problems to remain, and the results, since the benefit \nwas implemented in January, have been disastrous.\n  I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites who found the \nprescription drug plan enrollment process exceedingly confusing. Many \npeople had difficulty finding a plan that would cover their \nprescriptions, while others could not get through to Medicare \nrepresentatives to ask questions about the enrollment process. There \nhave been breakdowns in the entire information process, and these \nfailures by the insurance companies and the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services have sometimes completely blocked beneficiaries from \naccessing essential medications such as insulin, antipsychotics, and \neven immunosuppressants.\n  We can't afford to wait any longer in improving the Part D program so \nthat it can better serve its beneficiaries. We need to minimize the \nnegative effects of Part D's implementation problems and high costs. As \npart of this effort, I strongly support S. 1841, Senator Bill Nelson's, \nMedicare Informed Choice Act. This plan would allow beneficiaries extra \ntime to navigate this confusing system by extending the enrollment \nperiod through the end of 2006. In addition, it would allow a one-time \npenalty-free change of programs for beneficiaries who have made a \nmistake in choosing their prescription drug plan.\n  Supporters of the Medicare prescription drug benefit have touted it \nas the vehicle that would supply affordable, easily accessible \nprescription drugs for seniors. The program has so far fallen far short \nof that goal. The outcry that I have heard from pharmacists, \nbeneficiaries, and health care providers over the past couple months \nmakes clear that the implementation of the program has been a disaster. \nThis program has not provided either affordable or easily accessed \ndrugs to many Medicare beneficiaries. Instead it has presented \nproviders and beneficiaries with frustration, confusion, expensive \nmedications, and sometimes no medications at all. It is unacceptable \nfor individuals to go without life saving medications. Yet this is what \nhas been happening in Wisconsin and across the country since this \nprogram commenced.\n  Since the beginning of January, I have received panicked phone calls \nfrom people in my State saying they were unable to receive drugs that \nthey had been routinely getting at their pharmacy every other month. At \nthe same time as I was hearing from people suffering from pain because \nthey did not receive their pain medications, I read press releases from \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid that expressed satisfaction with \nthe launch of the program, and boasted of the millions of participants \nin the program. There may be millions participating in the program, but \ntoo many of them cannot receive their drugs and too many pharmacists \nare unable to comply with the complicated regulations in the program. \nCMS should be focusing its efforts on addressing this emergency rather \nthan disseminating public relations messages.\n  I have written Secretary Leavitt and Dr. McClellan repeatedly to \nexpress my concerns about Medicare Part D, including the approaching \ndeadline. I hope that the administration will soon realize that it \ncannot continue to ignore these problems or hope they go away on their \nown, and that significant changes in the program are needed to better \nserve beneficiaries. I think it is time that CMS remember who this plan \nis supposed to serve: the people, not the drug and insurance companies.\n  We cannot sustain a great nation if we do not care for our elderly, \nsick, disabled, and home-bound. These are the people this drug plan is \nsupposed to be serving, but they have been dismally let down. Let us \nmake a simple change to the drug plan that will provide immense help to \nthis group--extend the May 15 deadline. I urge the majority leader to \nbring up S. 1841 for a vote before the deadline passes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, over the past year and a half, I have spent \na few days every month holding townhall meetings around my home State \nof Illinois. I have now done almost 50 of these in cities and towns all \nover the State.\n  After I give a short presentation, I open the floor to questions from \nthe audience. And without fail, one of the first questions asked at \nevery townhall is about health care. Too many hard-working Americans \ncan't afford their medical bills or health insurance premiums. Too many \nemployers are finding it difficult to offer the coverage their \nemployees need. And sadly, too many people in the world's wealthiest \ncountry have no insurance at all.\n  When Senator Frist declared the second week in May as ``Health \nWeek,'' I naively assumed that maybe, just maybe, we would actually \nbegin a real discussion about health care in the United States. I \nthought we would talk about serious and meaningful ways to address the \nhealth care problems faced by average Americans--important problems \nlike: the 45 million Americans without health insurance; the worsening \nepidemic of chronic diseases, including asthma, obesity, and diabetes; \nthe persistent and pervasive problems with patient safety and health\n\n[[Page S4325]]\n\ncare quality; or the status of emergency and pandemic avian flu \npreparedness.\n  I know that I am not the only Senator who has been disappointed. A \nnumber of my Democratic colleagues have mentioned other pressing, \ncritical issues on the floor this week, including stem cells, the \nlooming enrollment deadline for Medicare Part D, and drug importation.\n  Yet so far we have had only a sham discussion on medical malpractice, \nrevisiting the same old bills that have been rejected in the past that \ndo not represent any real attempt to compromise and find solutions to \nthe problems that many of our doctors and patients face.\n  And now, the Senate has turned its attention to the Enzi small \nbusiness health plan. I know that small businesses need help in \nproviding health care coverage to their employees. Small businesses are \npaying the price for this Congress's refusal to seriously embrace \ncomprehensive health care reform, to expand coverage and contain costs.\n  Yet this bill is not the solution, and it is not part of a solution. \nIn fact, some have described it as the antisolution.\n  In my opinion, any health coverage reform bill that passes the \nCongress should meet, at a minimum, three criteria: First, it may sound \ncrazy, but I think a health coverage bill should actually expand \ncoverage. The Enzi bill has been estimated to expand coverage to less \nthan 1 million of the 45 million uninsured Americans. This is \nlaughable.\n  In fact, some States will actually see an increase in the number of \nuninsured. In New York, for instance, 28,000 people could lose their \nhealth insurance coverage because of this bill.\n  Second, a good health reform bill should ensure comprehensive, \nquality health care. Over 200 health professional and patient advocacy \ngroups have expressed their opposition to this bill, because it will \npromote health plans that won't offer the basic health care services \nthat we all depend upon and take for granted, such as maternity care, \nmental health services, diabetes care, dental care, and so forth.\n  I have rarely seen such a large number of groups come together as \nswiftly, as vociferously, and as united as these groups have been \nagainst this bill.\n  Third, a good health reform bill should have a positive effect on the \nhealth insurance market. Will the market be stabilized and \nstrengthened, or will it be weakened and fragmented? Again, the Enzi \nbill does not pass muster. Over 40 attorneys general have expressed \nserious concerns about this bill's preemption of State protections and \nlaws and its restrictions on State oversight and regulation.\n  This so-called health week makes a mockery of the efforts of those \nwho are working to achieve real health care reform. While we in \nCongress are squandering precious time on this bill, our States are \nmoving ahead, exerting leadership because Congress has failed to act.\n  Illinois is in the process of implementing a program called All Kids, \nwhich will ensure that every child in the State is covered by health \ninsurance. And we all know that Massachusetts just passed a sweeping, \nuniversal health coverage bill, negotiated and passed in bipartisan \nfashion.\n  In contrast, the last major health insurance reform passed by \nCongress was in 1997, when the SCHIP program was created. Even though \nthe number of uninsured has continued to rise, almost 10 years have \ngone by without a serious congressional effort to address this crisis.\n  This is wrong. The Durbin-Lincoln amendment, which I have \ncosponsored, is a good example of how we can meaningfully expand health \ncoverage without sacrificing the quality of care received.\n  The central tenet of the amendment is that small business employees \nshould have access to the same health insurance coverage that members \nof Congress and other Federal employees receive themselves.\n  The health care problems facing our country are serious ones, and the \nsolutions will not be easy. But we need to have a serious debate about \nthis issue--a debate that addresses the whole problem and isn't just \nabout scoring political points in an election year.\n  The American people expect as much, and I hope this failed attempt at \na ``health week'' is not the last chance we will have to talk about an \nissue that is the chief financial concern of millions upon millions of \npeople in this country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for all of the recent talk from the \nmajority about up-or-down votes, and allegations of Democratic \nobstruction on amendments, I find it astounding that the Republican \nmajority has locked up Senator Enzi's bill and will not allow \namendments to be offered. We now face exactly the type of obstruction \nthe majority has decried so loudly. On a bill for which Senator Enzi \nhas urged full debate, the Republican majority has now decided the \nSenate and the American people we represent should not get the benefit \nof the full legislative process. For example, I am being prohibited \nfrom offering an amendment to help prevent medical malpractice insurers \nfrom bid rigging, price fixing, and other anticompetitive behavior that \nhurts doctors and patients. For another, we are prohibited from \noffering an amendment to extend the arbitrary deadline for seniors to \nsign up for prescription drug benefits without a penalty. Why not \nprovide our seniors more time and assistance in examining the \nprescription drug provisions that have frustrated so many? Seniors did \nnot grow up in the computer age and many are not trained accountants \nwho can sift through the confusion. They should not be penalized by an \narbitrary cutoff date which could easily be extended.\n  This week, the Senate has already refused to proceed to legislation \nthat would have abridged our citizens' access to justice when they are \ninjured by medical errors. Those bills purported to lower medical \nmalpractice insurance costs when, in fact, it is not payouts that have \nled to rising insurance premiums. The Senate has done the right thing \nby rejecting these bills once again.\n  The debate that preceded the votes demonstrated that capping medical \nmalpractice awards is not the way to lower insurance premiums, which we \nall agree are unfair to the men and women who devote their lives to the \ncare of others. There can be no disagreement that exorbitant insurance \ncosts make it harder for medical professionals to do their jobs. Health \ncare providers, like all Americans, deserve fair treatment in the \nmarketplace. We also know that the insurance marketplace is unique, \nbecause unlike other business interests, insurers are not subject to \nsome of the most important Federal antitrust laws.\n  High malpractice insurance premiums are not the result of malpractice \nlawsuit verdicts. This myth has been repeatedly discredited. They are \nthe result of investment decisions by the insurance companies and of \nbusiness models geared toward ever-increasing profits. But an insurer \nthat has made a bad investment, or that has experienced the same \ndisappointments from Wall Street that so many Americans have, should \nnot be able to recoup its losses from the doctors it insures. The \ninsurance industry should have to bear the burdens of its own business \nmodel, just as the other businesses in the economy do.\n  High malpractice premiums for doctors can occur because there is \nnothing stopping insurers in a soft market from collectively raising \nrates and stifling competition. Any other business would be prohibited \nfrom this activity, and I have heard no arguments as to why the \ninsurance industry should be treated differently. The insurance \nindustry is special because it is exempt from most Federal antitrust \nlaws. The McCarran-Ferguson Act permits insurance companies to operate \nwithout being subject to those laws, and our Nation's physicians and \ntheir patients have been the worse off for it. Using their exemption, \ninsurers can collude to set rates, resulting in higher premiums than \ntrue competition would achieve--and because of this exemption, \nenforcement officials cannot investigate any such collusion. If \nCongress is serious about controlling rising premiums, we must \nobjectively limit this broad exemption in the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n  The amendment I wanted to propose modifies the McCarran-Ferguson Act \nwith respect to medical malpractice insurance, and only for the most \npernicious antitrust offenses: Price fixing, bid rigging, and market \nallocations.\n\n[[Page S4326]]\n\nOnly those anticompetitive practices that most certainly will affect \npremiums are addressed. I am hard pressed to imagine how anyone could \nobject to a prohibition on insurance carriers' fixing prices or \ndividing territories.\n  After all, the rest of our Nation's industries manage either to abide \nby these laws or suffer the consequences. If medical malpractice \ninsurers are certain that malpractice lawsuits drive their rates, then \nthere should be no reason to object to bringing their business within \nthe reach of the same Federal laws that apply to all others.\n  Many State insurance commissioners police the industry well within \nthe power they are accorded in their own laws, and some States have \nantitrust laws of their own that could cover some anticompetitive \nactivities in the insurance industry. My proposal, which I wanted to \noffer, is a scalpel, not a saw. It would not affect regulation of \ninsurance by State insurance commissioners and other State regulators.\n  But there is no reason to perpetuate a system in which Federal \nenforcers are precluded from prosecuting the most harmful antitrust \nviolations just because they are committed by insurance companies.\n  This amendment is a carefully tailored solution to one critical \naspect of the problem of excessive medical malpractice insurance rates. \nI am sorry that I was stopped by the Republican leadership and could \nnot offer this narrowly drawn legislation as a positive step towards \nimproving the American health care system, which would help ensure that \ndoctors and patients are treated fairly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate is currently considering \nlegislation proposed by Senator Enzi that would profoundly change \nhealth care coverage. The proposal has been modified from the version \napproved by our committee.\n  It is important for the Senate to understand fully the impact that \nthis legislation would have on millions of Americans. I have requested \nan analysis of this modified proposal from Professor Mila Kofman of the \nGeorgetown University Health Policy Institute.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this analysis printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Georgetown University,\n\n                                                     May 10, 2006.\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This is a response to your request \n     for an analysis of the proposed rating structure in the \n     Manager's Amendment to S. 1955. This also addresses your \n     question on how the proposed amendment compares with the \n     current NAIC model law on small group rating:.\n       In general, the proposed Manager's Amendment would not \n     improve the bill. Under the new proposed rating structure \n     there would be no new protections for consumers and a \n     significant loss of existing state-based protections in the \n     area of premiums. This loss of protections will adversely \n     impact people with medical needs, older workers, and women of \n     child-bearing years. This will also have a negative impact on \n     ``micro'' groups (employers with fewer than 10 employees) \n     because insurers will be allowed to charge these groups \n     higher rates solely on the basis of the employer's size.\n       Here is a brief summary of how the proposed amendment would \n     work:\n       Associations: The amendment clarifies that associations \n     certified as small business health plans (by the U.S. \n     Department of Labor under Title I of the bill) would enjoy a \n     complete carve-out from small group rating state pools in \n     both adopting and non-adopting states. Each certified \n     association would be allowed to have their own premium rate \n     not tied to the rest of the small group market. This would \n     segment the small group market. Assuming associations attract \n     healthy businesses (there are many ways that the bill would \n     allow associations to ``cherry-pick'' healthy people), any \n     restrictions on rates in the rest of the small group market \n     would be undermined. Rates between association coverage and \n     coverage outside the association could vary broadly. For a \n     discussion of this, please see attached paper ``Health \n     Insurance Regulation by States and the Federal Government: A \n     Review of Current Approaches and Proposals for Change.''\n       In adopting states, the bill clarifies that premiums within \n     an association may vary using the same standards that would \n     apply in small group market (see discussion below). This \n     would be at least 500 percent variation in rates for \n     businesses covered by the association or if the state allows, \n     variations in rates could be even greater.\n       In non-adopting states, it is unclear whether the rating \n     standards in the bill would even apply. If they apply. then a \n     variation in premiums of 500 percent would be allowed for \n     businesses covered by an association (so some employers would \n     pay 5 times more than others for the same coverage within an \n     association).\n       Small group market: In adopting states, insurers are \n     required to vary rates by at least 500 percent (called \n     ``total variation limit''). This means that states can allow \n     insurers to have greater variations in rates. Using age. \n     health, claims. and duration factors. variations of at least \n     300% are required. Note that insurers must use age, health, \n     or both and may use duration and claims experience. The \n     option is given to insurers. If a state wants to adopt this \n     approach and become an ``adopting state.'' it must allow \n     insurers to use age and health. This requirement essentially \n     eliminates community rating and adjusted community rating by \n     allowing insurers to adjust rates based on health. Allowable \n     factors included in the 500 percent minimum required \n     variation are: industry. geography. group size, participation \n     rate, class of business. and wellness programs. Note that \n     gender is not listed. The bill is unclear whether gender \n     rating is prohibited or is added to the 500 percent \n     variation.\n       At renewal, the same rules would apply. This means that \n     premiums may increase at least by 500 percent if a smaIl \n     business has high claims the year before.\n       In non-adopting states (generally states with greater \n     protections for consumers). the language in the bill is \n     ambiguous. The proposal says ``The plan may not vary premium \n     rates by more than 500 percent].'' The term ``plan'' is not \n     defined. If the term ``plan'' means an ``insurer,'' then one \n     possible interpretation is that premium variations are \n     limited to 500 percent (if insurers chose to follow this new \n     tederal standard). What is clear. however, is that adjusted \n     community rating and pure community rating would be \n     preempted.\n       Renewal rates would limited to trend plus 15 percent to \n     reflect claims of small business.\n       Importantly, in non-adopting states insurers would have a \n     choice of whether to follow a state's existing laws or the \n     new federal one. As a way of example, in DC, which has no \n     rating laws, assuming DC chooses not to adopt the bill's \n     rating structure and is therefore a non-adopting state. \n     Insurers are not likely to use the rating restrictions in the \n     bill.\n       The proposed rating structure varies significantly from the \n     NAIC model law for small business health insurance premiums. \n     By way of background. the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners (NAIC) in the early 1990's adopted and since \n     replaced a model law that provided for rate bands that permit \n     premium variation up to 200 percent based on health status. \n     The old model, which is the basis for the original bill, \n     allowed further premium variation based on age, gender, \n     industry, small business group size, geography, and family \n     composition. Rates based on adjustments for these factors had \n     to be actuarially justified but were not limited except for \n     industry, which was limited to a 15 percent variation. The \n     old NAIC model act permitted a wide variation in rates, \n     allowing for a price difference of 26 to 1, or more. This \n     means that for the same policy an insurer could charge a \n     business or a person $100 per month or $2600 per month \n     depending on risk and other factors. Higher rates under the \n     model would be permitted as long as there was actuarial \n     evidence to support wider variations.\n       Shortly after adopting its original model with rate bands, \n     the NAIC replaced it with a model law for small groups that \n     requires adjusted community rating, prohibiting premium \n     surcharges based on health or other risk characteristics \n     (like claims experience and durational rating). The current \n     NAlC model act limits premium surcharges based on age to 200 \n     percent; it prohihits insurers from varying small group \n     premiums based on gender of people in the group or an \n     employer's size. Today 12 states follow the current NAlC \n     model act. Ten states require all insurers to use community \n     rating or adjusted community rating for all small group \n     policies. Two others, Michigan and Pennsylvania, require Blue \n     Cross Blue Shield plans (their largest insurers) and HMOs to \n     use adjusted community rating. The proposed amendment would \n     preempt these state rating protections.\n       Please let me know if you need additional information. \n     Thank you for the opportunity to address your questions.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Mila Kofman, J.D.,\n                                     Associate Research Professor.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss \nwhy I made the difficult decision to vote against H.R. 4939, the \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War \non Terror, and Hurricane Recovery.\n  The United States is involved in operations overseas while dealing \nwith natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. On May 4, \n2006, I voted against a $109 billion spending bill that was $17 billion \nmore than what the President originally requested. Of course, on \noccasion, times call for emergency spending, but this bill goes far \nbeyond what anyone would call emergency spending.\n  Many items in this bill do not constitute ``emergency'' spending. The \nbill would funnel millions of dollars to a road in Hawaii, millions of \ndollars in grants for research not related to emergencies, and still \nmillions more to subsidize the volunteer work program AmeriCorps. Are \nthese projects necessary? Possibly, but they are not an ``emergency.'' \nThese spending proposals should go through the annual authorization and \nappropriations process. Congress must tighten the definition of what \nqualifies as an emergency. The use of supplemental spending bills must \nbe saved for the true emergencies. True emergency funding is being \nbogged down with nonessential projects that have no business being in \nan emergency supplemental spending bill.\n  We must not saddle our children, their children, and their children's \nchildren with debt that we incurred because we did not properly \nrestrain our spending. My very first speech in the Senate Chamber was \non the need for a balanced budget. In 1997, I said that the Federal \nGovernment must learn to live within its means. Without any restraint \non spending, we are simply adding onto our Nation's enormous debt. \nUnfortunately, this is still true today.\n  I recently visited American troops stationed in Kuwait. I always have \nand will continue to support our troops. I appreciate the sacrifices \nthey make and the sacrifices of the families, friends, businesses and \ncommunities they leave behind.\n  Our American service men and women should have the financial \nresources they need to fight this crucial war on terror. This bill \nshould be about voting to provide financial stability that allows the \nU.S. Government to support our troops and our veterans into the future. \nIt is unfortunate that other nonemergency spending projects made their \nway into an important bill that included vital funding for our troops. \nI wish that the Senate would have followed the President's proposal and \nonly included funding for real emergencies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4327-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4327-S4328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Lance Corporal Stephen R. Bixler\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to LCpl \nStephen R. Bixler of Suffield, CT.\n  Corporal Bixler, a member of the 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, 2nd \nMarine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, NC, was \nkilled in action on May 4 while conducting combat operations against \nenemy forces in Anbar Province, Iraq. He was struck while on foot \npatrol by an improvised explosive device on his second tour of duty in \nIraq. Corporal Bixler is fondly remembered as a quiet but strong leader \nwith strength of character and self-assurance unusual for someone of \nhis age. As an Eagle Scout and former senior patrol leader in his Boy \nScout troop, Corporal Bixler enjoyed helping others. He joined the \nMarines shortly after graduating from Suffield High School in 2003 and \nserved in Haiti prior to his tour in Iraq. He was well received and \nrespected when he proudly visited his high school, where he had been \nadmired as he excelled at academics and athletics, to talk to students \nabout his experiences. He was a true patriot and defender of our great \nNation's principles of freedom of justice. Corporal Bixler served as an \nexample of the potent American spirit, which permeates this Nation's \nhistory.\n  I am both proud and grateful that we have the kind of defender \nexemplified by Corporal Bixler serving in the Persian Gulf. Our Nation \nextends its heartfelt condolences to his family. To his father, \nRichard, his mother, Linda, and sister, Sandra, we extend our profound \ngratitude for sharing this outstanding Marine with us, and we offer our \nprayers and support.\n\n\n                        Staff Sergeant Mark Wall\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \ntruly brave American who has passed away while defending our country. \nSSG Mark Wall died April 27, 2006, in Mosul, Iraq, where he was serving \nhis country as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Staff Sergeant Wall was \nassigned to C Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry regiment in Fort \nWainwright, AK. He was deployed to Iraq in August of 2005 and served \nnear Mosul. I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to his \nparents, Arthur and Helen Wall, his two brothers and his sister.\n\n[[Page S4328]]\n\n  Mark Wall graduated from Alden High School in 1997 where he \nparticipated in basketball, football, track, chorus, and band. He was a \nBoy Scout, attaining the rank of Eagle Scout in 1997. He also \nparticipated in 4-H, garden and photography projects, and FFA. Staff \nSergeant Wall joined the Iowa National Guard in February of 1997. He \nattended classes at Ellsworth Community College studying agricultural \nbusiness and worked as an electrician's helper before joining the \nActive-Duty Army in May of 2000.\n  I understand that Mark had a passion for the outdoors and took \nadvantage of that passion while he was in Alaska, prospecting for gold, \nhiking, fishing, and skiing.\n  I would like to again give my condolences to the family of SSG Mark \nWall. He served his country with pride and passion, and we are all \nsaddened by his loss. I would like my colleagues in the Senate to take \na moment and remember the life of Mark Wall and remember the tremendous \nsacrifice he gave for us and our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4328-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SITUATION IN DARFUR\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join the American public and the \ninternational community in congratulating the signatories of the recent \npeace agreement signed in Abuja, Nigeria on May 5, 2006. I hope that \nthis peace agreement marks a dramatic turning point in bringing about a \nsolution to the genocidal conflict that has ravaged the Darfur region \nof Sudan. The administration deserves to be commended for getting the \nSudanese government and the Sudan Liberation Army to the table and for \nmaintaining a commitment to completing this peace process. This does \nnot mean, however, that we or the international community can return to \ncomplacency, satisfied that we have done our part. Quite the contrary.\n  At this point, it is essential that the peace agreement be expanded \nto include those parties that have not yet signed. Those without a \nstake in the current political power and wealth sharing agreements will \nhave few incentives to help build peace in the region, and will most \nlikely be spoilers to the peace agreement. These parties must be \nencouraged to join and abide by the accord. Additionally, it is \ncritical that the international community, working with the African \nUnion, the United Nations, and regional partners, develop a \ncomprehensive strategy to ensure that the peace agreement is \nimplemented and adhered to by both the Government of Sudan and the \nSudan Liberation Army. The Darfur region is facing an extremely fragile \nperiod. Now is the time to show international resolve for quelling the \nremaining instability throughout the region and for kick-starting all \nof the elements of the peace agreement. We must also move quickly to \ninstitute and strengthen mechanisms and systems to ensure that the \nparties to not backslide in to full-scale conflict.\n  In addition, we must strengthen the peacekeeping capabilities of the \nAfrican Union and ensure that it has the capacity to help monitor and \nenforce the peace agreement. The African Union has worked hard to \nexecute its broad and far-reaching mandate with limited resources and \nexperience, and it will need support to be a contributor to \nestablishing a lasting peace in the region. We must also work to \nintroduce a United Nations peacekeeping mission into the region as \nquickly as possible. I applaud President Bush's decision to send \nSecretary Rice to the United Nations to seek a resolution authorizing a \nU.N. peacekeeping force in Darfur. I supported the recent amendment to \nthe fiscal year 2006 emergency supplemental appropriations bill adding \n$60 million to fund a U.N. peacekeeping force in Darfur, matching \nsimilar legislation in the House. With this clear message of support \nfrom the U.S. Congress, it is now up to the administration to work with \nour friends and allies at the U.N. to reach agreement on a resolution \nauthorizing a peacekeeping force, and exert robust diplomatic pressure \non those who would try to block it.\n  We must not forget the massive humanitarian tragedy that is still \nunfolding. Even as the peace deal was being finalized, the U.N. World \nFood Program, WFP, announced that it would have to cut rations by over \n50 percent in Darfur beginning in May. Many of the over 2 million \nrefugees who have been forced from their homes and their livelihood are \non the brink of starvation, and this already massive tragedy could yet \ntake an even more devastating turn. Systematic gender-based violence \nagainst women and girls continues unabated and basic safety and \nsecurity continue to be denied to Darfurians. Humanitarian \norganizations trying to work in the region face increasing difficulties \nin fulfilling their mission, and safe areas have diminished to \nunprecedented levels. The situation, in short, remains disastrous and \nthe lives and well-being of millions hang in the balance. If anything, \nwe must increase our efforts to protect the region most vulnerable, and \nto support Darfurians in this fragile period. Failure to do so could \nhave a negative impact on the peace agreement.\n  Looking ahead to the implementation of the peace agreement and to \nestablishing peace in the region, it will be critically important to \naddress the crimes against humanity that have been committed, and to \ntake a stand against the cycle of impunity and injustice that we have \nseen occur over the last 3 years. Those who commit crimes against \nhumanity must know that the world is watching, and that they will be \nheld accountable for their actions.\n  In conclusion, we have reasons to be optimistic. We must not ignore, \nhowever, the fact that now the hard work begins.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4328-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4328-S4329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A MONTANA VISIT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today and announce a \nhistoric event in my home State. For only the second time in the \nhistory of Montana, our great State will welcome the President of \nIreland. President Mary McAleese has displayed courage, intellect, \ndetermination, and passion as she has guided her country for nearly a \ndecade. During this time her country has experienced unprecedented \ngrowth, quickly rising to the upper echelons of nations.\n  President McAleese will make an inaugural pilgrimage to a city whose \nhistory has been intimately tied with Ireland's for more than a \ncentury. In 1882, a lone Irish immigrant, driven by the work ethic \ninstilled in his homeland and his desire to succeed, made a discovery \nthat would forever change the face of Montana, the West, and America. \nThe city was Butte, MT, and the man was Marcus Daly. Three hundred feet \ninto the belly of the Earth, Daly set off an explosion that unearthed a \nrevolution. Before his amazed eyes lay one of the riches veins of \ncopper the world had every seen, and with it the unknowing hopes of \nmillions of Irish immigrants.\n  Butte, and its neighbor to the northwest Anaconda, quickly became \nthriving metropolises turning these mining communities into a virtual \nmosaic of nationalities and ethnicities. When walking down the street, \none could hear the chatter of Eastern Europeans, smell cooking from the \nMiddle East, or view native dress from Scandinavia. But above all was \nthe voice of the Irish. The Irish made Butte their own, easing their \nlonging for their native Eire by molding the city to reflect the land \nfrom their past. The streets were vibrant with festivities straight \nfrom the homeland; these hard-working immigrants, ranging in \nprofessions from doctors to lawyers to miners and gandy dancers, \npopulated this young bustling city and gave it the feel of an island \nthousands of miles away.\n  As the years passed, the pride of the Irish continued to ring strong, \nand with it the city of Butte. Butte quickly became the heart of \nMontana, and shaped the figures whose names would forever be remembered \nin the lore of our State. Names like Mike Mansfield and Burton Wheeler \nwill be etched in the hearts and minds of Montanans for many years to \ncome, and with them the tradition of the Irish.\n  Today, Butte remains a vibrant city, as the new generation of Irish-\nAmericans listen to the whispers of their ancestors and continues to \nuphold the proud tradition of being Butte Irish. With the same values \nthat turned this sleepy community into the heartbeat of the West, the \npeople of Butte continue to thrive and the city remains as strong as \nthe immigrants who first settled it.\n  As President McAleese is embraced by the spirit of this magnificent \ncity and by the residents who carry on the\n\n[[Page S4329]]\n\nproud tradition of hailing from Butte, I say: may the road rise to meet \nyou, may the wind be always at your back, may the sun shine warm upon \nyour face, the rains fall soft upon your fields and, until we meet \nagain, may God hold you in the palm of His hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4329-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE HONORABLE STEPHEN M. McNAMEE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today to \nhonor a respected jurist and dedicated public servant upon the occasion \nof his stepping down as the Chief Judge of the United States District \nCourt for the District of Arizona.\n  The Honorable Stephen M. McNamee earned his bachelor of arts in \nhistory from the University of Cincinnati in 1964. He received his \nmaster of arts degree in 1967 and his juris doctor degree in 1969 from \nthe University of Arizona.\n  Judge McNamee began his professional career as an assistant U.S. \nattorney, a position he held from 1971 to 1985. During that time, he \nwas chief of the civil division in Tucson, chief assistant U.S. \nattorney, and first assistant U.S. attorney.\n  In 1985, President Reagan appointed him U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Arizona. He made prosecuting violent crime within the 21 \nNative American communities in Arizona a top priority, particularly the \nprosecution of those who victimize Native American children. He also \nimplemented model collection procedures for fines and penalty \nassessments of Federal defendants--the source of funding for the entire \nVictims of Crime Act program. Additionally, he testified before \ncongressional committees on behalf of the Department of Justice \nregarding a variety of issues from terrorist threats to the southwest \nborder, to child abuse and neglect on Indian reservations, to theft of \nIndian artifacts from archeological sites, to the reauthorization of \nthe Victims of Crimes Act of 1984. At the behest of Attorney General \nRichard Thornburgh, he helped organize the first major conference to \nbring together American and Mexican criminal justice officials.\n  In 1990, he was appointed to the Federal bench by President George \nH.W. Bush, and in that capacity he developed a similar program to bring \nMexican and U.S. Federal judges together to learn about each other's \nprocesses and procedures. As the chief judge of the District of \nArizona, Judge McNamee managed a burgeoning docket. Since 1999, the \nfiling of criminal cases went up 80 percent and civil case filings went \nup 59 percent. Nevertheless, under his leadership, the number of cases \npending for 3 years or more has declined nearly 20 percent.\n  Judge McNamee has been an active liaison to Congress for the \nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts and the Federal \njudiciary. He was appointed to the board of directors of the Federal \nJudges Association and has served on several Ninth Circuit and District \nof Arizona committees addressing a wide range of issues, from capital \ncases to racial, religious, and ethnic fairness to security issues.\n  As a distinguished member of the community, Judge McNamee has been \nthe recipient of almost two dozen international, national, and State \ncommendations and awards. He exemplifies the highest standards that we \nhave come to expect from our judiciary, and we thank him for his \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4329-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4329-S4330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GREEN MOUNTAIN COFFEE ROASTERS: TOP CORPORATE CITIZEN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate \nMr. Bob Stiller, president and chief executive officer, and the 600 \nemployees of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters on their selection as the \nNation's top corporate citizen by Business Ethics Magazine. In the best \ntraditions of Vermont, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is about more \nthan making a profit--they are about fostering a strong commitment to \ncorporate social responsibility.\n  Through the company's support of organizations like the Rainforest \nAlliance, a non profit dedicated to protecting ecosystems, and Coffee \nKids, an international nonprofit seeking to improve the quality of life \nfor children and families in coffee-growing communities, Green Mountain \nCoffee Roasters has been a pioneer in the fair trade coffee movement. \nThe company has also taken its socially responsible mission into the \nhalls of our government, when, in 2002, Green Mountain formed a joint \nalliance with the U.S. Agency for International Development aimed at \nimproving the livelihoods for those in improvised coffee growing \nregions.\n  Green Mountain has maintained these strong corporate ethics while \ncontinuing to build a robust earnings record. In 2005, the company \nreported revenue of $161.5 million, with net income of $9 million, a \n15-percent increase over the year prior. And in the first quarter of \nfiscal year 2006, Green Mountain's fair trade coffee represented 26-\npercent of total sales, an increase of 68-percent compared to the same \nperiod last year.\n  I commend this outstanding Vermont company and ask unanimous consent \nthat the Business Ethics article naming Green Mountain Coffee Roasters \nas the Nation's top corporate citizen be printed in the Record, along \nwith a recent editorial from the Burlington Free Press.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From Business Ethics Magazine, Spring 2006]\n\n100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2006--Celebrating Companies that excel \n               at serving a Variety of Stakeholders Well\n\n       ``We take them coffee picking, and they do some hand \n     sorting of beans in the hot sun,'' says Winston Rost, Green \n     Mountain Coffee Roaster's director of coffee appreciation, \n     describing the annual trip he leads of a dozen employees, \n     visiting coffee-growing cooperatives in Vera Cruz and Oaxaca, \n     Mexico. With a newfound appreciation for how hard the work \n     is, some roasters say they'll never spill another bean again, \n     Rost adds. This kind of attention to the human element of \n     business offers a hint at why Green Mountain Coffee of \n     Waterbury, Vt., is No. 1 this year on the list of the 100 \n     Best Corporate Citizens.\n       Since its founding in 1981, the company has been socially \n     and environmentally active, ``but it wasn't all that \n     extensive or organized at first,'' recalls CEO Bob Stiller. \n     Green Mountain upped the ante in 1989 when it formed an \n     environmental committee and created a rainforest nut coffee \n     to support the Rainforest Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to \n     protecting ecosystems. The company has grown increasingly \n     active in the countries where coffee is grown and has been a \n     pioneer in the fair trade movement, which pays coffee growers \n     stable, fair prices. But the biggest change came in the early \n     1990s when the company began sending its employees on trips \n     to see where the coffee is grown. Many employees ``said it \n     changed their lives,'' Stiller adds.\n       Green Mountain, with 600 employees, saw 2005 revenue of \n     $161.5 million with net income of $9 million, a 15 percent \n     increase over the year prior. Since 1988, it has donated more \n     than $500,000 to Coffee Kids, an international nonprofit \n     seeking to improve the quality of life for children and \n     families in coffee-growing communities. Through the Coffee \n     Kids program, the company supports a micro-lending facility \n     in Huatusco, Mexico and a sustainable sanitation system in \n     Cosaulan, Mexico. It also has provided financial support to \n     the FomCafe cooperative's quality control training program, \n     which helps farmers earn higher profits for coffee.\n       In 2006 Green Mountain will release its first corporate \n     responsibility report. ``We are focusing on measurement so we \n     can understand the economic and social impact of the company \n     and create indices so we can better focus those efforts,'' \n     Stiller says. ``Just the process of getting all that \n     information in one place is valuable,'' notes Michael Dupee, \n     vice president of corporate social responsibility. ``It makes \n     you think about and gain insight into what's working and \n     what's not, so even if you never published anything, it's \n     worthwhile.''\n       In 2004 the company expanded from one executive in social \n     responsibility to three. Besides Dupee's position, there is a \n     director of sustainable coffee and a vice president of \n     environmental affairs. Some 45 percent of Green Mountain's \n     coffee is purchased farmer-direct, which cuts out the share \n     middle men take. And 20 percent of coffee sold is certified \n     fair trade, which incorporates principles of environmental \n     sustainability and respect for cultural identity, while \n     guaranteeing growers minimums of $1.26 per pound when \n     commodity prices might be far lower. Consumer interest in \n     fair trade is growing, Stiller says, ``because through their \n     purchases they are wanting to make a difference in the lives \n     of growers.''\n       Efforts like these have earned Green Mountain a spot in the \n     top 10 on Business Ethics' list for four years running. Its \n     meticulous attention to corporate social responsibility \n     conveys well what the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list is \n     about. The best-managed firms today--in this era when \n     societal expectations of business are rising--can no longer \n     focus solely on stockholder return. Companies that aim to \n     prosper over the long term also emphasize good jobs for \n     employees, environmental sustainability, healthy community \n     relations, and great products for customers.\n\n[[Page S4330]]\n\n       Seeking to put numerical ratings on service to these \n     various stakeholder groups, the 100 Best Corporate Citizens \n     list uses data provided by KLD Research & Analytics of \n     Boston. It employs statistical analysis to identify those \n     major public U.S. companies that excel at serving a variety \n     of stakeholders well, using eight measures of service: \n     stockholders, community, governance, diversity, employees, \n     environment, human rights, and product.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 29, 2006]\n\n               Waterbury Coffee Firm Deserves High Praise\n\n       Vermont should take pride in the accomplishments of Green \n     Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc., the Waterbury company named \n     the nation's top corporate citizen by Business Ethics \n     magazine.\n       For this company, which employs 600 people, the human \n     dimension clearly matters. Employees, the local community and \n     coffee workers in far-away places have benefited from Green \n     Mountain Coffee's refreshing divergence from the standard of \n     bottom-line business.\n       In its annual ``100 Best Corporate Citizens,'' Business \n     Ethics magazine praised Green Mountain Coffee for its \n     corporate social responsibility, in particular its commitment \n     to fair trade, a Free Press story said. Fair trade ensures \n     coffee growers are paid fairly with a guaranteed minimum \n     price. Sales of the company's fair trade coffee have done \n     extremely well, especially with a lucrative deal signed last \n     fall with McDonald's restaurants in the Northeast.\n       Not only are the company's ethics admirable, Green Mountain \n     also makes money--a winning combination that other businesses \n     should heed for long-term success.\n       Within the organization, employees receive a firsthand \n     education on the product they handle. Every year, a group of \n     U.S. workers travel to coffee-growing areas in Mexico to \n     experience the hard labor of picking and sorting beans. \n     According to the magazine's Web site, the annual trips have \n     given these employees a real appreciation of the work done in \n     Mexico. It can be a life-changing experience.\n       The magazine, which has compiled the corporate citizens' \n     list for seven years, has included Green Mountain Coffee in \n     four of those years, including a second place last year. \n     Chittenden Corp. was the only other Vermont business on the \n     list, coming in at 26th place.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable science teacher, Jane Hunn, from Tippecanoe Valley Middle \nSchool in Akron. Last week, Jane was honored with the 2005 Presidential \nAward for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, the Nation's \nhighest honor for teaching in these fields.\n  Jane is the only winner from Indiana and one of just 100 middle and \nhigh school teachers nationwide to receive this prestigious award. This \naward is an extraordinary honor to Jane. It recognizes her hard work \nand dedication to her students and their academic achievement.\n  Now more than ever, education is the key to greater personal \nopportunity. Here in Washington, I have fought to ensure that education \nis available and accessible to all our Nation's students. However, the \nreal, heroic work is done on the ground, in our schools, by teachers \nlike Jane.\n  Jane has concentrated on including hands-on learning in her classroom \nas a way to challenge and inspire her students. In her own words, she \n``would much rather put the students in the active role of discoverers \nthan be the fountain of knowledge. They really own their discoveries \nwhen they do activities and put together their own findings.'' By \nallowing them to take an active role in their own education, Jane has \nmade science accessible to every student regardless of his or her \nlearning ability.\n  Through countless hours of work both inside and outside the \nclassroom, Jane has demonstrated her commitment to ensuring the success \nof future generations and to encouraging the curiosity and development \nof our Hoosier youth. I am sure that hundreds of Akron students both \npast and present, along with their families, join me in expressing my \nsincere gratitude for her efforts.\n  On behalf of the State of Indiana, I thank Jane for her dedication to \nher profession and our young people, and I am proud to enter her name \nin the Congressional Record of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4330-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AWARD TO DR.

Feldheym Award was established to pay tribute to those \nmembers of Congregation Emanu El who have conspicuously and \nexceptionally reflected Rabbi Feldheym's qualities of love for and \nloyalty to the synagogue, service to the community, and the personal \ntraits of humility, loving kindness, care, and love. Dr. Gold receives \nthis award as part of the ceremonies marking the 115th anniversary of \nthe founding of the congregation.\n  Dr. Philip M.

He served as secretary, second vice-president, \nvice-president, and, from 2000 until 2002, he served as the president \nof the congregation.\n  During his remarkable tenure with Congregation Emanu El, Dr. Gold has \nmasterfully guided it through a period of leadership change. He has \nbeen an inspirational leader of the congregation with a deep love for \nJudaism, participation in worship and education, and an exemplary \ncommitment to Jewish values and their application to contemporary \nsociety.\n  In addition to his immense contributions to Congregation Emanu El, \nDr. Gold is a highly respected physician and teacher, and he has been \nrecognized by his colleagues as a leader in the field of medicine. He \nhas served as the president of various medical organizations, and he \nhas received numerous awards for his work and achievements.\n  As his family, colleagues, patients, and fellow congregants would \nattest, Dr. Philip M.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of North Augusta, SC. Preceded by the settlements of \nHamburg and Campbelltown, North Augusta was founded on the north bank \nof the Savannah River in 1892 by James U. Jackson, whose development \ncompany planned the city's original layout. Officially chartered a town \non April 11, 1906, North Augusta remained small and mostly residential \nuntil the early 1950s when the Savannah River Site was built. \nThereafter, the town tripled in size, becoming a city. During the next \nhalf century, as new subdivisions were constructed around the city, \ncommercial development flourished. Today, North Augusta is known for \nits first-class recreational facilities, community league sports teams, \nand caring people. It is a city that prides itself on responsive \ngovernment and a strong sense of community. With a healthy respect for \nits past, an emerging riverfront, and careful growth, the city's future \nis bright.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4330-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4330-S4331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S4331]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4330-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4330-S4331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S4331]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4331-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4331-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    ENROLLED JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  At 10:22 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled joint resolution:\n\n       H.J.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to funding fully the Select Michigan Agriculture \n     Program through the United States Department of Agriculture; \n     to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 181\n\n       Whereas, the Michigan Department of Agriculture introduced \n     the Select Michigan campaign in the Grand Rapids area to \n     encourage Michigan residents to purchase locally grown and \n     produced foods. Recently expanded to the Detroit area, the \n     program uses posters, banners, and stickers in Michigan \n     grocery stores and farmers' markets to identify locally grown \n     food products. Since 2001, the Select Michigan program has \n     highlighted the numerous Michigan-grown products available in \n     the state, including apples, asparagus, blueberries, \n     cherries, chestnuts, corn, dry beans, honey, maple syrup, \n     peaches, and strawberries; and\n       Whereas, access to fresh and nutritious food products is \n     vital to the health and well-being of Michigan residents. \n     Michigan farms, which are second in the nation in the \n     diversity of agricultural products grown, provide residents \n     with a wide variety of locally grown fruits and vegetables. \n     Identifying and marketing these products to the local \n     population enables residents to support Michigan's \n     agricultural industry, which contributes significantly to \n     Michigan's economic well-being. The impact of Michigan's \n     agriculture on our economy is estimated to be $60.1 billion \n     annually and growing; and\n       Whereas, in 2001, a one-time block grant of $3.75 million \n     from the United States Department of Agriculture provided \n     support to launch the Select Michigan program. The program is \n     able to continue due to a unique funding partnership \n     involving the private sector and the federal government. \n     However, to ensure all Michigan residents have access to \n     fresh and nutritious locally grown food products and allow \n     the Select Michigan program to expand to encompass the state, \n     full funding of this program by the federal government is \n     necessary: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives. That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to fund fully \n     the Select Michigan agricultural program through the United \n     States Department of Agriculture; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-293. A concurrent memorial adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Arizona \n     relative to enacting a 2007 Farm Bill that is supportive of \n     the specialty crop industry; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2001\n\n       Whereas, the fruit, vegetable and tree nut production in \n     the United S1ates accounts for $35 billion in farmgate value, \n     or 33 percent of farm cash receipts, and with the addition of \n     nursery and greenhouse production, overall specialty crops \n     account for 51 percent of farmgate value; and\n       Whereas, in Arizona, fruit, vegetable and tree nut \n     production represents a $1 billion industry representing over \n     35 percent of Arizona's farm cash receipts; and\n       Whereas, the fruit, vegetable and tree nut industry is a \n     critical and growing component of United States agriculture, \n     deserving of full and equal consideration as other \n     agricultural sectors in the Farm Bill; and\n       Whereas, the fruit, vegetable and tree nut industry does \n     not seek direct program payments to growers, but rather \n     places its emphasis on building the long-term competitiveness \n     and sustainabi1ity of United States fruit and vegetable \n     production; and\n       Whereas, government investment in the competitiveness and \n     sustainability of the United States fruit and vegetable \n     industry will produce a strong return on investment for all \n     of America, not just farmers, by expanding access and \n     availability of safe, wholesome, healthy and affordable \n     fruits and vegetables. The Farm Bill will be a critical \n     component in reaching the mandate of doubling fruit and \n     vegetable consumption called for in the USDA/HHS 2005 Dietary \n     Guidelines; and\n       Whereas, with the government's mandate that domestic \n     producers meet the very highest standards in environmental \n     regulation, labor and other areas comes the responsibility to \n     help those producers achieve cost-effective compliance \n     through government investment in this agriculture industry to \n     create a fair, level playing field with international \n     competitors who do not face the regulatory burdens of United \n     States producers; and\n       Whereas, without appropriate assistance, United States \n     fruit, vegetable and tree nut production will relocate to \n     less restrictive foreign growing areas; and\n\n[[Page S4332]]\n\n       Whereas, a thriving and competitive United States fruit, \n     vegetable and tree nut industry will support strong growth in \n     export markets and improve our agricultural balance of trade \n     in order to realize the goal of increasing exports; and\n       Whereas, it is critical that federal policy and resources \n     support efforts to remove the many existing international \n     trade barriers that continue to block United States fruit, \n     vegetable and tree nut exports. Wherefore your memorialist, \n     the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the \n     Senate concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress recognize the importance \n     of the specialty crop industry in the development of the 2007 \n     Farm Bill.\n       2. That the United States Congress support the priorities \n     of the specialty crop industry in the 2007 Farm Bill.\n       3. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM--294. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to memorializing the Secretary of \n     the Navy to honor the gift of 1,000 acres known as the \n     Brunswick Commons bestowed in 1719 by Pejepscot Proprietors \n     to the Town of Brunswick forever and return it to the town at \n     no cost; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the Members of the One Hundred and \n     Twenty-second Legislature of the State of Maine now assembled \n     in the Second Regular Session, most respectfully present and \n     petition the Honorable Gordon R. England, the Secretary of \n     the Navy, as follows:\n       Whereas, nearly 300 years ago, in 1719, the Pejepscot \n     Proprietors donated 1,000 acres of land in the township of \n     Brunswick to be laid out as a ``general perpetual commonage \n     to ye town of Brunswick forever''; and\n       Whereas, the Town of Brunswick accepted the gift in 1774 \n     and laid out the 1,000 acres that would come to be known as \n     Brunswick Commons. In 1783 a deed was conveyed to the town \n     selectmen, and the land became property of the town forever; \n     and\n       Whereas, an 1816 survey was recommended by the Town Commons \n     committee as the correct survey of the land, and in 1891 \n     granite monuments were placed to mark the boundaries of the \n     deeded land; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government took the majority of \n     Brunswick Commons to build the Brunswick Naval Air Station, \n     which served this nation well during World War II. Five of \n     the original granite markers of the Brunswick Commons are \n     within the boundary of the current base; and\n       Whereas, the base was deactivated after World War II in \n     1946 and recommissioned in 1951 and has been active since \n     that date, providing support to the United States military as \n     a vital part of America's defense system; and\n       Whereas, Brunswick Naval Air Station was targeted for \n     decommissioning in the latest round of federal base closings, \n     with the direction that the base be sold to the highest \n     bidder instead of returning the land to its original use as \n     described by deed; and\n       Whereas, the original deed clearly meant for this land to \n     be for the common good of the Town of Brunswick and, while \n     the subsequent use of the land for Brunswick Naval Air \n     Station was important for our national security, the Town of \n     Brunswick and the people of Maine feel strongly that, since \n     the Federal Government no longer has need of this land, it \n     should be returned to its original source; and\n       Whereas, the Town of Brunswick declared in 1968 the full \n     1,000 acres of the Brunswick Commons to be an Historic \n     Landmark, and the Town of Brunswick and the people of the \n     State of Maine seek to make the original Brunswick Commons \n     whole again, at no cost to the Town of Brunswick: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, on behalf of the \n     people we represent, respectfully urge and request that \n     Secretary England do all in his power to see that the land \n     deeded to the people of Brunswick be returned to the people \n     of Brunswick at no cost, now that the Federal Government no \n     longer wants this historical tract of land; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable Gordon R.

Puget Sound \n     ought to be strictly protected; its resources ought not to be \n     threatened. Since tanker accidents are directly related to \n     the amount of tanker traffic, there should not be an \n     expansion of traffic over what now presently exists.'';\n       Whereas, the Magnuson Amendment has protected Puget Sound \n     waters from oil spill risks for twenty-eight years by \n     limiting the amount of oil delivered to Washington refineries \n     by tanker to the quantity used by Washington consumers; and\n       Whereas, the Washington State Department of Ecology \n     reported in 2004 that approximately six hundred tankers a \n     year\n\n[[Page S4333]]\n\n     enter Washington waters, and additional tanker traffic would \n     significantly increase the likelihood of oil spills in Puget \n     Sound; and\n       Whereas, the Magnuson Amendment has effectively limited \n     tankers headed for refineries at Anacortes and Cherry Point \n     near Ferndale by prohibiting federal agencies from issuing \n     permits for the construction or expansion of dock or related \n     facilities unless that expansion was necessary to meet \n     increased Washington state demand;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     section 5 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (33 \n     U.S.C.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to encouraging expansion of existing, or the \n     construction of new petroleum refineries in the United States \n     and to urging the petroleum industry to construct new \n     refineries to meet our increasing energy needs; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 67\n\n       Whereas, the price of petroleum products has been rising \n     out of control. Currently, the world crude oil price remains \n     near 60 dollars a barrel, practically 30 dollars more than \n     this time last year. Additionally, the national average price \n     of regular gasoline is about 38 cents per gallon more than \n     last year and diesel is almost 54 cents per gallon more than \n     this time last year; and\n       Whereas, there has not been a new oil refinery built in the \n     United States in nearly 30 years. Yet, in the intervening \n     years, the total energy demand in the United States has grown \n     by about 40 percent. According to the United States Energy \n     Information Administration, the projected petroleum demand \n     between 2003 and 2025 will increase by 30 percent. We need to \n     plan for our future energy needs by incorporating new \n     petroleum refineries into the United States' overall energy \n     policy; and\n       Whereas, recent major investments in the Marathon Refinery \n     located in the City of Detroit, Michigan's only refinery, \n     will increase the output by about 28 percent, from 74,000 \n     barrels per day to over 102,000 barrels per day. Securing \n     Marathon's investment of $300 million was made possible \n     through the collaborative efforts of Marathon, the city of \n     Detroit, and the state of Michigan. Marathon's commitment to \n     Michigan and the collaboration with the city and state to \n     create a renaissance zone encompassing the refinery \n     illustrates the type of creative solutions that can be used \n     to promote the construction of new refineries; and\n       Whereas, constructing new refineries would also create new \n     jobs and increase gasoline, fuels, and distillate output--all \n     vital components of strengthening our economy. Michigan is \n     well placed to locate a new refinery due to our proximity \n     with Canada, this country's largest source of imported \n     petroleum. Moreover, Michigan's highly skilled labor force \n     could adapt to employment in the refinery industry; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to establish a \n     national energy policy that promotes the expansion of \n     existing or construction of new petroleum refineries in the \n     United States. We also urge the leaders of the petroleum \n     industry to construct new refineries to meet our increasing \n     energy needs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That it is our intention to work with local \n     governments to identify appropriate locations for new \n     refineries in Michigan communities that have a recognized \n     commitment to job growth and this industry; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department \n     of Energy, the Michigan Petroleum Institute, and the American \n     Petroleum Industries of Michigan.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-300.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to \n     immediately close the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and to \n     request that the Louisiana congressional delegation file the \n     necessary legislation to accomplish this closure; to the\n\n[[Page S4334]]\n\n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO), a \n     seventy-six-mile-long, man-made navigational channel which \n     connects the Gulf of Mexico to the Port of New Orleans, was \n     authorized by the United States Congress under the Rivers and \n     Harbors Act of 1956 as a channel with a surface width of six \n     hundred fifty feet, a bottom width of five hundred feet, and \n     a depth of thirty-six feet, and it opened in 1965; and\n       Whereas, since MRGO was completed, the United States Army \n     Corps of Engineers estimates that the area has lost nearly \n     three thousand two hundred acres of fresh and intermediate \n     marsh, more than ten thousand three hundred acres of brackish \n     marsh, four thousand two hundred acres of saline marsh, and \n     one thousand five hundred acres of cypress swamps and levee \n     forests in addition to major habitat alterations due to \n     saltwater intrusion from the loss of the marshes, which has \n     resulted in dramatic declines in waterfowl and quadruped use \n     of the marshes; and\n       Whereas, the costs of maintaining MRGO rise each year, with \n     the cost of dredging now over twenty-five million dollars \n     annually, or more than thirteen thousand dollars for each \n     vessel-passage, in addition to the expenditure of millions \n     for shoreline stabilization and marsh protection projects, \n     with an anticipated cost increase of fifty-two percent \n     between 1995 and 2005; and\n       Whereas, concerns about the environmental impact have \n     increased through the years as evidenced by the fact that in \n     1998 the ``Coast 2050 Report'' contained closure of MRGO \n     among the consensus recommendations, and the technical \n     committee of the Coastal Wetland Planning, Preservation and \n     Restoration Act Task Force listed closure as one of the \n     highest-ranked strategies for coastal restoration; and\n       Whereas, in 1998 the St. Bernard Police Jury voted \n     unanimously to request closure of the waterway because of \n     fears that the dramatic loss of coastal wetlands and marshes \n     caused by MRGO exposed the parish and the communities in the \n     parish to much more severe impacts from the hurricanes and \n     tropical storms that regularly occur in the Gulf of Mexico; \n     and\n       Whereas, those concerns were echoed and amplified by \n     scientists, engineers, and citizens throughout the region as \n     reflected in requests from the Louisiana Legislature to \n     congress in 1999 (SCR No. 266) and again in 2004 (HCR No. 35 \n     and HCR No. 68) to close the waterway, and indeed, those \n     concerns proved true in an extremely dramatic fashion on \n     August 29, 2005, when Hurricane Katrina struck Louisiana's \n     coast with a tidal surge well in excess of twenty feet; and\n       Whereas, there is a growing consensus that the flooding \n     that occurred in St. Bernard Parish, New Orleans East, and \n     the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans was a result of storm \n     surge that flowed up MRGO to the point where it converges \n     with the Intracoastal Waterway and that the confluence \n     created a funnel that directed the storm surge into the New \n     Orleans Industrial Canal, where it overtopped the levees \n     along MRGO and the Industrial Canal and eventually breached \n     the levees and flooded into the neighborhoods that lie close \n     to those three waterways, resulting in more than eleven \n     hundred deaths in the Greater New Orleans area, including one \n     hundred twenty-eight deaths in St. Bernard Parish, destroying \n     over twenty-four thousand homes, and rendering more than \n     sixty-seven thousand residents of St. Bernard Parish and \n     uncounted numbers in New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth \n     Ward of New Orleans homeless, without possessions, and \n     unemployed; and\n       Whereas, in addition to destroying homes, the flood waters \n     washed away churches and other places of worship, schools, \n     businesses, community centers, recreational facilities, \n     utility and transportation infrastructure, in short the very \n     fabric of society was decimated in these communities; and\n       Whereas, only three weeks later, on September 24, 2005, \n     storm waters from Hurricane Rita surged up MRGO and caused \n     additional flooding in St. Bernard Parish, New Orleans East, \n     and the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, exacerbating the \n     traumatic losses in that area; and\n       Whereas, since the two hurricanes caused such widespread \n     damage in St. Bernard Parish and New Orleans, congress has \n     declined to appropriate further funds for dredging MRGO; and\n       Whereas, some engineers have opined that the current base \n     along MRGO was damaged to the point that it will not support \n     a Category 3 levee in the future; and\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has \n     stated that it has no authorization from congress to close \n     the waterway or to fill the waterway to allow for the \n     development of marshes and wetlands; and\n       Whereas, as the only entity which can authorize the \n     waterway to be closed and which can enable the \n     reestablishment of our essential coastal wetlands, the United \n     States Congress must come to the aid of the citizens of \n     Louisiana, particularly those of St. Bernard Parish and New \n     Orleans by authorizing the immediate closure of MRGO; and\n       Whereas it is the responsibility of the Louisiana \n     delegation to file the necessary legislation to accomplish \n     the immediate closure of MRGO: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to immediately close the Mississippi River \n     Gulf Outlet: and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     urge and request the Louisiana congressional delegation to \n     file the legislation necessary to accomplish this closure: \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-302.

that certain Federal laws, notably the ``Solid \n     Waste Disposal Act,'' should apply to the operation of these \n     facilities; that [,unfortunately,] a broad-reaching Federal \n     railroad statute [forbids] has been interpreted by some \n     courts as forbidding environmental regulatory agencies from \n     overseeing the safe handling of trash at these sites; and \n     that these unintended consequences require the attention of \n     and swift action by the United States Congress in enacting S. \n     1607, the ``Solid Waste Environmental Regulation \n     Clarification Affecting Railroads Act of 2005''; and\n       Whereas, the Federal railroad law in question was enacted \n     most recently in the ``Interstate Commerce Commission \n     Termination Act of 1995'' to protect the operation of \n     interstate rail service; that this law grants literally \n     ``exclusive'' jurisdiction over rail transportation, and \n     activities incident thereto, to the Federal Surface \n     Transportation Board; that the Board is limited to only a \n     passive role in ensuring that rail facilities are operated \n     with minimal detriment to the public health and safety; and \n     that these sites require active environmental regulation in \n     the same manner that Federal and State environmental \n     regulatory agencies regulate the operation of conventional \n     solid waste handling, processing, transfer and disposal \n     facilities; and\n       Whereas, the recent proliferation of solid waste rail \n     transfer facilities has affected the ability of State and \n     local governments in New Jersey and elsewhere to engage in \n     environmentally sound long-term solid waste management \n     planning and enforcement; and that, nevertheless, these \n     agencies are still responsible for responding to accidents \n     and incidents occurring at these facilities; and\n       Whereas, the [State] New Jersey Department of Environmental \n     Protection (DEP) fined New York Susquehanna and Western \n     (NYS) Railway Corporation $2.5 million for environmental \n     violations associated with the operation of five solid waste \n     transfer sites in North Bergen; that as a result. of seven \n     investigations conducted from November 2004 to July 2005, DEP \n     determined that NYS illegally operates five sites which \n     load solid waste from trucks to rail cars; that one of the \n     sites handles bulk shipments of soil and other State \n     regulated waste associated with specific site remediation \n     projects, while the remaining sites are open dumps that \n     handle construction and demolition waste; and that DEP \n     [cites] cited NYS with violating New Jersey's solid \n     waste and air pollution laws at all five sites by loading \n     solid and hazardous waste materials outdoors, failing to \n     regularly clean areas in which solid waste is handled and \n     failing to contain, collect and dispose of wastewater; and \n     that the District Court of New Jersey based on the Federal \n     railroad law has temporarily restrained DEP from enforcing \n     its solid waste regulations; and\n       Whereas, in addition, DEP cited NYS for spilling \n     hazardous waste, failing to contain litter and debris, and \n     accumulating unprocessed waste in the area surrounding the \n     facilities; that NYS also failed to control insects and \n     rodents and emitted odor, dust and solid waste particles into \n     the outdoor atmosphere in quantities resulting in air \n     pollution; and that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it has \n     been argued that Federal railroad law preempts enforcement \n     actions such as this, even though the Surface Transportation \n     Board has never [clarified whether it even has] asserted \n     jurisdiction over the processing and sorting of solid waste \n     at a rail facility; and\n       Whereas, constructing a transfer station in a former \n     junkyard site in Elwood, a hamlet in Mullica Township, \n     Atlantic County, a proposal by the Southern Railroad of New \n     Jersey, is being resisted for health and safety reasons and \n     challenged by the Pinelands Commission to respect \n     requirements and protections accorded the Pinelands National \n     Reserve under Federal and State statutes; and the District \n     Court of New Jersey has granted the State of New Jersey a \n     preliminary injunction. ordering that the Pinelands \n     Commission has jurisdiction over the proposed construction; \n     and\n       Whereas, the enactment of S. 1607 would ensure that \n     Congress' intent was not to subvert the policies of the \n     ``Solid Waste Disposal Act'' and other Federal and State \n     environmental laws covering the handling of garbage; and that \n     this bill's underlying purpose is to clarify that the true \n     intent of Congress\n\n[[Page S4335]]\n\n     in passing the solid waste law and the ``Interstate Commerce \n     Commission Termination Act of 1995'' is to ensure that these \n     laws work in tandem to provide for a robust, environmentally \n     responsible rail system: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. This Senate Resolution memorializes Congress to enact S. \n     1607, the ``Solid Waste Environmental Regulation \n     Clarification Affecting Railroads Act of 2005,'' in order to \n     address the unregulated sorting and processing of waste \n     materials at rail facilities.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the President of the Senate and attested by the Secretary \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to the Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the majority and minority leaders of the \n     United States Senate and the United States House of \n     Representatives, and each member of Congress elected from \n     this State.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-303. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to enacting the ``Kidney Care \n     Quality Improvement Act of 2005; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4023\n\n       Whereas, four hundred thousand Americans have irreversible \n     kidney failure, a condition called ``End Stage Renal \n     Disease'' (ESRD). ESRD is fatal unless a patient receives \n     either dialysis or kidney transplantation. Since \n     transplantation is limited due to the shortage of donor \n     organs, seventy-five percent of ESRD patients must undergo \n     regular and on-going dialysis treatment for the rest of their \n     lives. In Washington State approximately 16,000 residents \n     have ESRD; and\n       Whereas, today's ESRD patients are older and sicker due \n     primarily to the aging of the population, and the growing \n     incidence of diabetes and high blood pressure, fueled by the \n     obesity epidemic. ESRD disproportionately impacts African-\n     American and Hispanic individuals; and\n       Whereas, most patients with ESRD lack access to education \n     programs about their disease that would allow them to make \n     informed choices about their treatment and learn important \n     self-management skills to improve their quality of life; and\n       Whereas, according to the most recent data available, less \n     than one percent of all ESRD patients use home dialysis \n     because of the barriers patients face in accessing this \n     option. Home dialysis can improve a patient's quality of life \n     by allowing him or her to remain employed and participate in \n     other activities that promote well-being; and\n       Whereas, there is no coordinated effort between federal and \n     state governments, health care professionals, dialysis \n     providers, educators, patient advocates to develop programs \n     to identify members of high-risk populations and develop \n     culturally appropriate community-based approaches for \n     improving the treatment of chronic kidney disease, which \n     would lead to fewer cases of ESRD; and\n       Whereas, since 1972, Congress made a commitment to ESRD \n     patients by providing coverage for the lifesaving therapy and \n     dialysis, through the Medicare program. Medicare provides for \n     the care of approximately seventy-five percent of patients \n     receiving dialysis. Improvements are needed to continue to \n     ensure access to high quality treatment for ESRD patients. \n     Better care for patients means a better quality of life, \n     improved rehabilitation, fewer medications, and fewer \n     hospitalizations; and\n       Whereas, the rate paid by Medicare for ESRD services is the \n     only Medicare prospective payment system without an annual \n     update mechanism to adjust for increases. This means \n     providers must ask Congress for increases rather than relying \n     on the Department of Health and Human Services to make \n     routine, data-driven decisions on payment adequacy. In the \n     past twelve years, there have been only two increases in the \n     ESRD composite rate, totaling 3.6 percent, to cover \n     inflation, new technologies, and other costs, such as nurses' \n     salaries. When adjusted for inflation, the average Medicare \n     payment for dialysis treatment has been reduced from $138 in \n     1973 to $38 in 2000. The program is no longer sustainable \n     under the current reimbursement structure;\n       Now, therefore, your Memorialists respectfully request that \n     the United States House of Representatives and the United \n     States Senate enact H.R. 1298 and S. 635, known as the \n     ``Kidney Care Quality Act of 2005.'' The Act will modernize \n     and update treatment of ESRD by adding Medicare coverage for \n     kidney disease patient education services, improve the home \n     dialysis benefit, and provide for an annual update for the \n     Medicare ESRD composite rate. A demonstration project for an \n     outcomes-based ESRD reimbursement system, as well as a study \n     of barriers to accessing the home dialysis benefit, will lead \n     to future improvements in delivery of care. A chronic kidney \n     disease demonstration project will increase public awareness \n     about the disease, with the goal of lowering the number of \n     persons who will need kidney dialysis: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-304. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to the ``Diabetes Self-\n     Management Training Act''; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4038\n\n       Whereas, diabetes is now widely recognized as one of the \n     top public health threats facing our nation today and affects \n     more than 18 million Americans. In 2002, diabetes accounted \n     for 132 billion dollars in direct and indirect health care \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, diabetes now affects nearly 1.4 million Washington \n     residents: Over 298,000 people in Washington have been \n     diagnosed with diabetes; over 126,000 people have undiagnosed \n     diabetes; and over 963,000 people have prediabetes; and\n       Whereas, people who have diabetes need skills to manage \n     their diabetes and skills to help them stay active in their \n     lives. This training is central to diabetes prevention and \n     care; and\n       Whereas, chronic disease self-management programs have a \n     proven success rate, allowing persons with diabetes to better \n     control their diabetes; and\n       Whereas, persons living with diabetes who are properly \n     trained with self-management skills are better able to \n     prevent the deadly complications of diabetes, which can \n     include heart disease, stroke, blindness, lower extremity \n     amputation, and kidney failure; and\n       Whereas, certified diabetes educators are highly trained \n     multidisciplinary health care professionals dedicated to \n     delivering quality diabetes self-management training; and\n       Whereas, evidence has shown that access to a certified \n     diabetes educator improves the management of diabetes, a \n     chronic illness that requries a high level of maintenance; \n     and\n       Whereas, certified diabetes educators teach people with \n     diabetes how to maintain the daily rigors of diet, exercise, \n     meal planning, medication monitoring, healthy coping skills, \n     and other factors necessary to control the disease; and\n       Whereas, certified diabetes educators are also on the front \n     line of the efforts to promote prevention of diabetes; and\n       Whereas, Congress recognized the value of diabetes self-\n     management training when it began covering the benefit in the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997. At that time, most certified \n     diabetes educators worked in a hospital setting and were able \n     to bill Medicare for their services through the hospital's \n     provider number. Unfortunately, during these tough economic \n     times, hospitals are closing their diabetes education \n     programs at a rate of two to five per month. This leaves \n     diabetes educators without an avenue to provide or bill for \n     diabetes education--services which are desperately needed to \n     keep up with the growing number of people diagnosed with \n     diabetes each day; and\n       Whereas, certified diabetes educators have received \n     extensive training in diabetes management. They have met all \n     criteria for initial certification, including a prerequisite \n     qualifying professional credential in a specified health care \n     profession, have professional practice experience in diabetes \n     self-management training that includes one thousand hours of \n     diabetes teaching, have passed a national examination offered \n     by a certifying body recognized as entitled to grant \n     certification to diabetes educators, and are required to \n     renew the certification every five years;\n       Now, therefore, your Memorialists respectfully request that \n     the United States House of Representatives and the United \n     States Senate enact Senate Bill 626 and House Bill 3612, \n     known as the ``Diabetes Self-Management Training Act.'' The \n     Act will increase access to diabetes care by adding certified \n     diabetes educators to the current list of Medicare providers, \n     thereby making certified diabetes educators billable \n     providers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-305. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to reviewing and considering eliminating provisions \n     of law which reduce social security benefits for those \n     receiving benefits from federal, state, or local government \n     retirement systems; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 63\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal and \n     survivor social security benefit, and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned social \n     security benefit for persons who also receive federal, state, \n     or local retirement; and\n       Whereas, the intent of congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, and local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same social security benefit as a worker who \n     had worked only in employment covered by social security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of congress in enacting these \n     reduction provisions was to provide a disincentive for public \n     employees to receive two pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving federal, state, or\n\n[[Page S4336]]\n\n     local government retirement benefits who would also be \n     entitled to a social security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     social security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement benefit \n     received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases completely \n     eliminating the social security benefit; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement benefits, in \n     addition to working in covered employment and paying into the \n     social security system; and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned social security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce social security benefits for such persons by as much \n     as one-half of the uncovered public retirement benefits \n     earned; and\n       Whereas, because of these calculation characteristics, the \n     GPO and WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on \n     employees working in lower-wage government jobs, like \n     policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, these provisions also have a greater adverse \n     effect on women than on men because of the gender differences \n     in salary that continue to plague our nation; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of her citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     GPO and WEP social security benefit reductions and to \n     consider eliminating them; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation and to the school boards of Beauregard, Calcasieu, \n     Rapides, and Vernon parishes.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-306. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Illinois relative to enacting a \n     prescription drug benefit for senior citizens that is run by \n     the Medicare program itself; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 630\n\n       Whereas, the Medicare prescription drug benefit enacted in \n     2003 took effect January 1, 2006, in the form of competing \n     ``Medicare Part D'' plans sold by private insurance \n     companies; and\n       Whereas, senior citizens are choosing from a wide array of \n     private plans in each geographic area, with a confusing \n     variety of designs and formularies; and\n       Whereas, the law states that a Medicare plan's formulary \n     must cover just one brand-name drug and one generic drug in \n     each therapeutic category--a minimal requirement that will \n     make it difficult for an older person to find all the drugs \n     he/she takes in a single plan; and\n       Whereas, the drug plans will be allowed to switch the drugs \n     in their formularies on a regular basis, making it likely \n     that many seniors will sign up for a plan that covers a drug \n     they take, only to find out a few months later that the drug \n     is no longer covered by their plan; and\n       Whereas, the drug plans will bargain with the drug \n     companies for lower prices, but instead of being required to \n     pass the discounts on to seniors, they will be allowed to use \n     the savings for advertising and overhead costs, or to \n     increase their profits; and\n       Whereas, private drug plans will be unable to bargain \n     effectively, because the Medicare market will be divided \n     among hundreds of plans, diminishing the negotiating power of \n     the huge Medicare population; and\n       Whereas, a drug benefit that's run by the Medicare program \n     itself, rather than private insurance, could be given the \n     authority to negotiate prices on behalf of all 44 million \n     beneficiaries--resulting in enormous buying power and the \n     ability to get the lowest prices possible; and\n       Whereas, this was born out by a recent study conducted by \n     Families USA (September 2005), which found that the lowest \n     drug prices negotiated by the private sponsors of the 2004/\n     2005 Medicare discount cards far exceeded the low prices \n     routinely negotiated by the Department of Veterans Affairs on \n     behalf of the nation's veteran population; and\n       Whereas, seniors would not only benefit by the lower prices \n     of a Medicare-run drug plan, but many would find a Medicare \n     choice much less confusing than having to choose the most \n     appropriate plan from among the dozens being marketed by \n     private insurers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Ninety-Fourth General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we call upon the \n     United States Congress to enact a drug benefit for senior \n     citizens that is run by the Medicare program itself; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, each member of the Illinois \n     Congressional delegation, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and the President of the United \n     States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-307.

Smith, has been introduced in the United \n     States House of Representatives and calls for the \n     consolidation of security, human rights, democracy, and \n     economic freedom in Ethiopia; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to enacting legislation to provide \n     additional funding for research in order to find a treatment \n     and a cure for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 616\n\n       Whereas, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is better \n     known as Lou Gehrig's disease; and\n       Whereas, ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease \n     characterized by degeneration of cell bodies of the lower \n     motor neurons in the gray matter of the anterior horns of the \n     spinal cord; and\n       Whereas, The initial symptom of ALS is weakness of the \n     skeletal muscles, especially those of the extremities; and\n       Whereas, as ALS progresses, the patient experiences \n     difficulty in swallowing, talking and breathing; and\n       Whereas, ALS eventually causes muscles to atrophy, and the \n     patient becomes a functional guadriplegic; and\n       Whereas, ALS does not affect a patient's mental capacity, \n     so a patient remains alert and aware of the loss of motor \n     functions and the inevitable outcome of continued \n     deterioration and death; and\n       Whereas, ALS occurs in adulthood, most commonly between the \n     ages of 40 and 70, with the peak age about 55, and affects \n     men two to three times more often than women; and\n       Whereas, More than 5,600 new ALS patients are diagnosed \n     annually; and\n       Whereas, It is estimated that 30,000 Americans may have ALS \n     at any given time; and\n       Whereas, On average, patients diagnosed with ALS survive \n     two to five years from the time of diagnosis; and\n       Whereas, Research indicates that military veterans are at a \n     50% or greater risk of developing ALS than those who have not \n     served in the military; and\n       Whereas, ALS has no known cause, prevention or cure; and\n       Whereas, ``Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Awareness \n     Month'' will increase public awareness of ALS patients' \n     circumstances, acknowledge the terrible impact this disease \n     has on patients and families and recognize the research for \n     treatment and cure of ALS; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania recognize the month of May 2006 \n     as ``Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Awareness Month'' in \n     Pennsylvania; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives urge the \n     President and Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to provide additional funding for ALS research; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the Vice President of \n     the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the members of Congress from Pennsylvania \n     and to the United States Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-309. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to remove \n     the TRIO programs Upward Bound and Talent Search from the \n     list of programs to be eliminated in the 2007 budget and to \n     memorialize congress to continue the funding of such \n     programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 24\n\n       Whereas, the term ``TRIO'' was coined by the late 1960s in \n     reference to a series of federal educational opportunity \n     programs created as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's \n     ``War on Poverty''; and\n       Whereas, funded under Title IV of the Higher Education Act \n     of 1965, the TRIO programs have expanded and improved over \n     the decades to provide a wide range of services to help \n     students overcome class-related, social, and cultural \n     barriers to higher education; and\n       Whereas, the president's 2007 budget proposal requests the \n     nationwide elimination of two TRIO programs, Upward Bound and \n     Talent Search; and\n       Whereas, Upward Bound, the goal of which is to increase the \n     rates at which participants enroll in and graduate from \n     postsecondary education institutions, provides vital support \n     to participants in their preparation for college entrance, \n     and serves high school students from low-income families, \n     high school students from families in which neither parent \n     holds a bachelor's degree, and low-income, first-generation \n     military veterans who are preparing to enter postsecondary \n     education; and\n       Whereas, Talent Search, the goal of which is to increase \n     the number of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who \n     complete high school and enroll in the postsecondary \n     educational institution of their choice, provides academic, \n     career, and financial counseling to its participants and \n     encourages them to graduate from high school and also serves \n     high school dropouts by encouraging them to complete their \n     education; and\n       Whereas, Upward Bound and Talent Search are two essential \n     programs that provide crucial services to students, such as \n     instruction in core curriculum subjects, academic advising, \n     tutorial services, mentoring programs, assistance in \n     completing college and financial aid applications, and \n     support in preparing for college entrance exams; and\n       Whereas, it is in the best interest of the Nation's \n     students that Upward Bound and Talent Search, two outstanding \n     TRIO programs, be continued because they have made, and will \n     continue to make, significant contributions toward the \n     improvement of education in the nation and toward ensuring \n     that as many students as possible receive every opportunity \n     afforded by a quality education in the United States of \n     America. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to remove the TRIO programs Upward Bound and \n     Talent Search from the list of programs to be eliminated in \n     the 2007 budget and does hereby memorialize congress to \n     continue the funding of such programs. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-310. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to ensure \n     that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers break up large federal \n     disaster recovery contracts in Louisiana so that small, \n     locally owned businesses can compete for and be awarded such \n     contracts; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the state of \n     Louisiana causing severe flooding and damage to the southern \n     part of the state that has threatened the safety and security \n     of the citizens of the affected areas of the state of \n     Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the destruction caused by these devastating storms \n     damaged public works, such as levees, bridges, and highways, \n     and spread debris over a wide area of the southern part of \n     the State; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the \n     United States Army Corps of Engineers have control over a \n     great percentage of the contracts to repair levees, remove \n     debris, and provide for transportation of trailers and other \n     important activities vital to the restoration and \n     revitalization of the affected areas of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, for the most part, these contracts have been \n     awarded to large companies with the result being that small \n     local companies have been shut out of the process; and\n       Whereas, it is likely that breaking up these large \n     contracts would make it more likely that smaller businesses \n     can be competitive in the bid process; and\n       Whereas, the awarding of contracts to smaller Louisiana \n     businesses would help to jump start Louisiana post-Katrina \n     economy and help the devastated areas and their people to \n     quicken the pace of recovery. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to ensure that the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency and the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers break up large federal disaster recovery contracts \n     in Louisiana so that small, locally owned businesses can \n     compete for and be awarded such contracts.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Illinois relative to supporting \n     the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act of 2005; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S4338]]\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 578\n\n       Whereas, the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act of \n     2005 (S. 1033 and H.R. 2330) would require the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to develop and implement a National \n     Strategy for Border Security, establish a H-5A essential \n     worker visa program for low-skilled workers, and exempt \n     immediate relatives of U.S. citizens from the annual cap on \n     family-sponsored immigrant visas; and\n       Whereas, the United States House of Representatives passed \n     H.R. 4437 that would criminalize the undocumented, their \n     employers, and asylum-seekers alike, tear apart families, and \n     needlessly devastate our economy; and\n       Whereas, the United States of America was founded by \n     immigrants who traveled from around the world to seek a \n     better life; and\n       Whereas, the United States has an undocumented population \n     of 11 million immigrants, including half a million in \n     Illinois; and\n       Whereas, Illinois immigrants fill key roles in our economy \n     such as paying taxes, including contributions to Social \n     Security that they cannot receive back, raising families, and \n     contributing to our schools, churches, neighborhoods, and \n     community; and\n       Whereas, our current immigration system contributes to long \n     backlogs, labor abuses, countless deaths on the border, and \n     vigilante violence and is in dire need of reform to meet the \n     challenges of the 21st century; and\n       Whereas, any comprehensive reform must involve a path to \n     citizenship for these hardworking immigrants, as well as \n     reunification of families and a safe and orderly process for \n     enabling willing immigrant workers to fill essential jobs in \n     our economy and ensure full labor rights; and\n       Whereas, the immigration initiative severely punishes \n     illegal employment practices while creating a path to earned \n     permanent legal states for individuals who have been working \n     in the United States, paying taxes, obeying the law, and \n     learning English, and protecting workers by ensuring the \n     right to change jobs, join a union, and report abusive \n     employment situations; and\n       Whereas, modernizing our antiquated and dysfunctional \n     immigration system will uphold our nation's basic values of \n     fairness, equal opportunity, and respect for the law; \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Ninety-Fourth General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we urge the Illinois \n     Congressional Delegation and all of Congress to support ``The \n     Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act of 2005'' (S. 1033 \n     and H.R. 2330), which allows every hardworking, law-abiding \n     individual to achieve the American Dream; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be delivered to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     Senate, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders of the House of Representatives, and each \n     member of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-312. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Illinois relative to a private \n     bill in the United States Congress that was introduced by \n     Congressman Bobby Rush in September 2005 on behalf of the La \n     Familia group; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 523\n\n       Whereas, United States citizen children throughout Illinois \n     and the nation are being separated from either their father \n     or mother because of our broken immigration laws; this causes \n     great emotional and financial harm to these children and \n     violates the right to family unity; and\n       Whereas, the thirty-five families, which come from nearly \n     all of the congressional districts in Illinois and are known \n     as La Familia Latina Unida (La Familia), represent families \n     separated, or threatened by the prospect of separation, by \n     the broken immigration laws and regulations that span the \n     State of Illinois; these individuals are mothers or fathers \n     of U.S. citizen children and are married, in most cases, to \n     U.S. citizen spouses; the hardship claimed in each case is \n     the hardship on these U.S. citizens that has occurred due to \n     the separation or imminent separation of their families; and\n       Whereas, these thirty-five families, including their one \n     hundred U.S. citizen children, have waged a courageous public \n     campaign on their own behalf and on behalf of similarly \n     affected families throughout the nation; the hardship faced \n     by these families is both economic and emotional; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 3856, a private bill in the United States \n     Congress, was introduced by Congressman Bobby Rush in \n     September of this year on behalf of the La Familia group; \n     this bill would confer legal status on the mothers or fathers \n     of these families and allow for their permanent unification; \n     and\n       Whereas, the immigration cases that are represented \n     encompass a range of human and legal situations that will be \n     highly instructive to the immigration debate in the U.S. \n     Senate; in many of these cases, the individuals have \n     presented themselves fully and completely through the process \n     dictated and have been denied because of the rule that \n     restricts travel to their country of origin in family \n     emergencies, even though they have fully presented themselves \n     in their required applications; and\n       Whereas, due to the difference in House and Senate rules \n     relating to private bills, the introduction of a companion \n     bill in the U.S. Senate will provide for the more immediate \n     security of these families and allow them to continue their \n     public testimony, a testimony vitally in the public interest \n     in the midst of the upcoming debate over reform of \n     immigration laws; and\n       Whereas, support for the private bill in the House and \n     Senate does not represent support for any particular \n     immigration reform bill; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Ninety-fourth General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we strongly recommend \n     passage of H.R. 3856 and the introduction of its companion in \n     the U.S. Senate; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we encourage the United States Congress to \n     take action on federal immigration reform, which would \n     provide for family unification as part of part of \n     comprehensive immigration reform; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     forwarded to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President pro tempore of the United \n     States Senate, and to each member of the Illinois \n     Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-313.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to providing funding to help states and \n     local communities clean up and address the disastrous\n\n[[Page S4339]]\n\n     effects of clandestine methamphetamine labs; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 101\n\n       Whereas, There is a meth epidemic in the United States, and \n     it is having a devastating effect on our country. Meth abuse \n     is causing social, economic, and environmental problems. \n     Children residing in homes with meth labs live in danger and \n     often suffer from neglect and abuse. Meth production costs \n     citizens and governments millions of dollars for a variety of \n     reasons, including law enforcement costs, drug treatment for \n     offenders, cleanup of production sites, and placement of \n     endangered children; and\n       Whereas, Meth labs leave behind a toxic mess of chemicals \n     and pose a significant danger to communities. The manufacture \n     of one pound of methamphetamine results in six pounds of \n     waste. These wastes include corrosive liquids, acid vapors, \n     heavy metals, solvents, and other harmful materials that can \n     disfigure skin or cause death. Hazardous materials from meth \n     labs are typically disposed of illegally and may cause severe \n     damage to the environment; and\n       Whereas, Between 1992 and 2004, the number of clandestine \n     meth lab-related cleanups increased from 394 to over 10,000 \n     nationwide. The cost of cleaning up clandestine labs in FY \n     2004 was approximately $17.8 million; and\n       Whereas, States and local governments are bearing the \n     burden of funding the cleanup efforts. Many local communities \n     are finding and seizing meth labs. The lab sites remain \n     dangerous to the public, however, because neither the state \n     or the local community has adequate funding to clean them up; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Combat Meth Act of 2005, which was recently \n     signed into law as a part of the USA Patriot Improvement and \n     Reauthorization Act of 2005, authorizes cleanup funding, but \n     only for areas designated ``Meth Hot Spots.'' The meth \n     epidemic is a national crisis, however, and scores of states \n     and local governments across the country are in dire need of \n     funding to help clean up clandestine labs; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to provide funding for meth lab cleanup that \n     is available to all states and local governments that are in \n     the midst of the meth epidemic; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-315.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nenhance the security of wastewater treatment works; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Wastewater \nTreatment Works Security Act of 2006. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by Senator Chafee, the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nFisheries, Wildife and Water and Senator Murkowski, an important and \ninfluential member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, \nEPW. The bill being proposed is similar to legislation, S. 1039, that \npassed the Committee on Environment and Public Works last Congress on a \nstrong bipartisan vote and a bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 413 to 2. Unfortunately, some of my \ncolleagues in the minority objected to bringing that important, \nbipartisan legislation to the floor. At an impasse with the close of \nthe 108th Congress, I asked the Government Accountability Office to \nsurvey the wastewater community in order to determine what steps \npublicly owned treatment works, POTWs, had taken to assess their \nsecurity and if need be, what steps they had taken to enhance security \nat their facilities.\n  In March 2006 we received GAO's report and the results confirm that \nthe approach advocated by the House of Representatives and by the EPW \nCommittee is the right approach. The Federal Government must work \ncooperatively with our counterparts at the state and local level to \nensure our nation's infrastructure is secure. GAO found that without a \nfederal requirement to do so, the overwhelming majority of the largest \nPOTWs have conducted or are in the process of conducting vulnerability \nassessments. They did not need a heavy handed federal mandate to do the \nright thing. Of those who have not and do not plan to do a \nvulnerability assessment, a majority believed they had taken sufficient \nother security measures or believed that by updating their Emergency \nResponse Plan the utility had a good understanding of its \nvulnerabilities.\n  While this is tremendous progress, it is important that all systems \nknow what their vulnerabilities are and take steps to mitigate them. \nThe legislation my colleagues Senator Chafee and Senator Murkowski and \nI introduce today builds upon the good work already taking place by \nworking in collaboration with the publicly owned treatment works. For \nthe few systems remaining who have not done an assessment, our bill \nprovides them an incentive to do so by authorizing funding. Further, \nonce these systems have completed their assessments and certified to \nEPA that they have done so, they can join their colleagues in seeking \ngrants to address some of the security problems identified in the \nassessments.\n  During Hurricane Katrina, we saw how important emergency response \nplans are and how valuable mutual aid agreements can be. Our bill \nallows funding for the development, expansion or upgrading of an \nemergency response plan as well as for the voluntary creation of a \nmutual aid agreement or participation in such an agreement.\n  The GAO also found that the majority facilities had actually made \nsignificant security improvements prior to the tragedy of September 11. \nOf the 206 who responded, 149 had vehicle gates; 174 had security \nfences; 160 had redundant power sources; 133 had redundant pumping \ndevices or collection bypass systems. Following September 11, 138 \nfacilities now have safeguards for on-site delivery of materials and \n112 have additional site lighting. It is important for all of my \ncolleagues to note how much progress these entities have taken to \nsecure their facilities and protect their communities.\n  The use of chlorine has been a topic of discussion for years. \nChlorine is by far the most effective disinfectant available and it is \nthe least expensive. During these times of aging systems, growing \nFederal regulations and limited resources, cost is an important\n\n[[Page S4341]]\n\nconsideration. In its January 2005 report on security at wastewater \nutilities, the GAO estimated it would cost a utility $12.5 million to \nswitch from chlorine to sodium hypochlorite. There are other \nconsiderations that must be considered as well, such as downstream \neffects of a chlorine alternative. For example, the switch from \nchlorine to chloramines in Washington, DC's drinking water system was \nfound to cause lead to leach out of service pipes and into the faucets \nof homes and businesses. Thus, decisions about chlorine must be fully \nevaluated and must be site specific. Many POTWs are already undergoing \nthese evaluations. After careful review of cost, technical feasibility \nand safety considerations, and without the presence of a Federal \nmandate on technology, 116 of the 206 largest POTWs do not use gaseous \nchlorine. According to the GAO report, another 20 plan to switch to a \ntechnology other than chlorine. To sum, nearly two-thirds of the \nnation's largest POTWs are not using chlorine. Those who continue to \nuse chlorine have taken steps to ensure the chlorine is secure.\n  While the GAO report found significant steps were being taken at the \nnation's largest wastewater utilities, the Office also found an area \nvery much in need of assistance. Each POTW has a collection system that \nconsists of the pipes to carry wastewater from homes and businesses to \nthe treatment works. These pipes are often large enough for an \nindividual to stand in and they provide an underground roadway beneath \nmost major cities. In its January 2005 report, 42 of the 50 experts on \nGAO's panel identified the collection system as the most vulnerable \nasset of a POTW. However, in discussions with engineers and utility \nmanagers, there remain many questions and obstacles on how to \neffectively secure a collection system. Therefore, our bill authorizes \na research program to identify how a collection system could be used in \na terrorist attack, how to identify potential chemicals or explosives \nthat could be placed in a collection system and how best to mitigate \nagainst these risks. Finally, our legislation asks EPA to examine the \nvarious drinking water technologies to determine how affordable and \neffective each is.\n  As GAO found, POTWs are taking the critical steps necessary to secure \ntheir facilities and develop appropriate response mechanisms in the \nevent of an attack or natural disaster. We at the Federal level must \ncontinue to work with them, not against them by imposing one-size-fits-\nall, heavyhanded unfunded Federal regulations. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in supporting this legislation and that we can finally \nenact wastewater security legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TALENT (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 2782. A bill to establish the National Institute of Food and \nAgriculture, to provide funding for the support of fundamental \nagricultural research of the highest quality, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Talent and I, along with a \ngroup of our colleagues, are introducing the National Institute of Food \nand Agriculture Act of 2006. In the 2002 farm bill, a research, \neducation and economics task force within the Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, was established to evaluate agricultural research. A \nkey recommendation of this task force was to create a National \nInstitute for Food and Agriculture, NIFA, within USDA in order to \nsupport fundamental agricultural research to ensure that American \nagriculture remains competitive now and in the future. This bill does \nexactly that. The NIFA would be a grant-making agency that funds food \nand agricultural research through a competitive, peer-reviewed process. \nThese funds would be in addition to, not as a substitute for, current \nresearch programs at USDA's Agricultural Research Service, ARS, and \nCooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, CSREES.\n  American agriculture must ensure that our Nation continues to produce \nsafe and nutritious food for an increasing population. Other challenges \nin the areas of food and agriculture are problems we are facing right \nnow: renewable energy, rural development, overweight and obesity, and \nenvironmental challenges. Investment in fundamental research remains \nour best hope to finding solutions to problems confronting American \nfarmers and consumers of food and agriculture products now and in the \nfuture. Our Nation's investment in research has produced remarkable \ntangible results in the medical field, but food and agricultural \nresearch lags far behind. USDA's task force noted that the amount of \nfunding designated for competitively awarded, peer-reviewed \nagricultural research grants is outpaced 100 to 1 by the National \nInstitutes of Health. Our entire Nation is reaping the benefits of past \nagricultural research, but more can be done, and research will become \nmuch more important in the future as we face increased globalization \nand competition from foreign markets. Increasing our investment in food \nand agriculture research is a necessity for the future of America's \nfood and agriculture industry and consumers alike.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Healthy Families Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Working Americans need to take time off for their own \n     health care needs or to perform essential caretaking \n     responsibilities for a wide range of family members, \n     including, among others, their children, spouse, parents, and \n     parents-in-law, and other children and adults for whom they \n     are caretakers.\n       (2) Health care needs include preventive health care, \n     diagnostic procedures, medical treatment, and recovery in \n     response to short- and long-term illnesses and injuries.\n       (3) Providing employees time off to tend to their own \n     health care needs ensures that they will be healthier in the \n     long run. Preventive care helps avoid illnesses and injuries \n     and routine medical care helps detect illnesses early and \n     shorten the duration of illnesses.\n       (4) When parents are available to care for their children \n     who become sick, children recover faster, more serious \n     illnesses are prevented, and children's overall mental and \n     physical health are improved. Parents who cannot afford to \n     miss work and must send children with a contagious illness to \n     child care or school contribute to the high rate of \n     infections in child care centers and schools.\n       (5) Providing paid sick leave improves public health by \n     reducing infectious disease. Policies that make it easier for \n     sick adults and children to be isolated at home reduce the \n     spread of infectious disease.\n       (6) Routine medical care results in savings by decreasing \n     medical costs by detecting and treating illness and injury \n     early, decreasing the need for emergency care. These savings \n     benefit public and private payers of health insurance, \n     including private businesses.\n       (7) The provision of individual and family sick leave by \n     large and small businesses, both here in the United States \n     and elsewhere, demonstrates that policy solutions are both \n     feasible and affordable in a competitive economy. Measures \n     that ensure that employees are both in good health themselves \n     and do not need to worry about unmet family health problems \n     help businesses by promoting productivity and reducing \n     employee turnover.\n       (8) The American Productivity Audit found that \n     presenteeism--the practice of employees coming to work \n     despite illness--costs $180,000,000,000 annually in lost \n     productivity. Studies in the Journal of Occupational and \n     Environmental Medicine, the Employee Benefit News, and the \n     Harvard Business Review show that presenteeism is a larger \n     productivity drain than either absenteeism or short-term \n     disability.\n       (9) The absence of sick leave has forced Americans to make \n     untenable choices between needed income and jobs on the one \n     hand and caring for their own and their family's health on \n     the other.\n       (10) The majority of middle income Americans lack paid \n     leave for self-care or to care for a family member. Low-\n     income Americans are significantly worse off. Of the poorest \n     families (the lowest quartile), 76 percent lack regular sick \n     leave. For families in the next 2 quartiles, 63 percent and \n     54 percent, respectively lack regular sick leave. Even in the \n     highest income quartile, 40 percent of families lack regular \n     sick leave. Less than \\1/2\\ of workers who have paid sick \n     leave can use it to care for ill children.\n       (11) It is in the national interest to ensure that \n     Americans from all demographic groups can care for their own \n     health and the health of their families while prospering at \n     work.\n       (12) Due to the nature of the roles of men and women in \n     society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking \n     often falls on women, and such responsibility affects the \n     working lives of women more than it affects the working lives \n     of men.\n       (13) Although women are still primarily responsible for \n     family caretaking, an increasing number of men are taking on \n     caretaking obligations, and men who request leave time for \n     caretaking purposes are often denied accommodation or \n     penalized because of stereotypes that caretaking is only \n     ``women's work''.\n       (14) Employers' reliance on persistent stereotypes about \n     the ``proper'' roles of both men and women in the workplace \n     and in the home--\n       (A) creates a cycle of discrimination that forces women to \n     continue to assume the role of primary family caregiver; and\n       (B) fosters stereotypical views among employers about \n     women's commitment to work and their value as employees.\n       (15) Employment standards that apply to only one gender \n     have serious potential for encouraging employers to \n     discriminate against employees and applicants for employment \n     who are of that gender.\n\n     SEC. _03. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to ensure that all working Americans can address their \n     own health needs and the health needs of their families by \n     requiring employers to provide a minimum level of paid sick \n     leave including leave for family care;\n       (2) to diminish public and private health care costs by \n     enabling workers to seek early and routine medical care for \n     themselves and their family members;\n       (3) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) \n     and (2) in a manner that is feasible for employers; and\n       (4) consistent with the provision of the 14th amendment to \n     the Constitution relating to equal protection of the laws, \n     and pursuant to Congress' power to enforce that provision \n     under section 5 of that amendment--\n       (A) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) \n     and (2) in a manner that minimizes the potential for \n     employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring \n     generally that leave is available for eligible medical \n     reasons on a gender-neutral basis; and\n       (B) to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for \n     women and men.\n\n     SEC. _04.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care spending in the United States has reached \n     15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United \n     States, yet 45,000,000 people, or 15.6 percent of the \n     population, remains uninsured.\n       (2) After nearly a decade of manageable increases in \n     commercial insurance premiums, many employers are now faced \n     with consecutive years of double digit premium increases.\n       (3) Purchasing cooperatives owned by participating \n     businesses are a proven method of achieving the bargaining \n     power necessary to manage the cost and quality of employer-\n     sponsored health plans and other employee benefits.\n       (4) The Employer Health Care Alliance Cooperative has \n     provided its members with health care purchasing power \n     through provider contracting, data collection, activities to \n     enhance quality improvements in the health care community, \n     and activities to promote employee health care consumerism.\n       (5) According to the National Business Coalition on Health, \n     there are nearly 80 employer-led coalitions across the United \n     States that collectively purchase health care, proactively \n     challenge high costs and the inefficient delivery of health \n     care, and share information on quality. These coalitions \n     represent more than 10,000 employers.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to build off \n     of successful local employer-led health insurance initiatives \n     by improving the value of their employees' health care.\n\n     SEC. __03.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 472 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 472) commemorating and acknowledging \n     the dedication and sacrifice made by the men and women who \n     have lost their lives while serving as law enforcement \n     officers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join in introducing a bipartisan \nresolution to designate May 15, 2006, as National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day.\n  This is the tenth year running that I have been involved in the \nintroduction of this resolution to keep alive in the memory of all \nAmericans the sacrifice and commitment of those law enforcement \nofficers who lost their lives serving their communities. For 8 years I \nintroduced this resolution with my old friend and our former colleague \nSenator Campbell, a former deputy sheriff who was a true leader on this \nissue. Now I have teamed with Senator Specter, another former \nprosecutor, in this worthy cause. We have all witnessed firsthand the \nrisks faced by law enforcement officers every day while they serve and \nprotect our communities.\n  I also want to thank each of our Nation's law enforcement officers \nfor their commitment to the safety and protection of their fellow \ncitizens. They are the real-life heroes; too many of whom too often \nmake the ultimate sacrifice. It is important to support and respect our \nstate and local police officers and all of our first responders.\n  Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who guard our communities \ndo so at great risk. Each year, one in 16 officers is assaulted, one in \n56 officers is injured, and one in 5,500 officers is killed in the line \nof duty in the United States every other day. After the hijacked planes \nhit the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 \npeace officers died while trying to ensure that their fellow citizens \nin those buildings got to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the \nhighest number of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in \nthe history of our country, and is a tragic reminder of how important \nit is for the Congress to provide all of the resources necessary to \nprotect officers in the line of duty.\n  In 2005, 156 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line \nof duty, well below the decade-long average of 169 deaths annually, and \na major drop from 2001 when a total of 237 officers were killed. A \nnumber of factors contributed to this reduction including better \nequipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\ntraining and advanced emergency medical care. And, in total, more than \n17,500 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  In the 108th Congress, we shepherded into law a number of measures to \nmake a difference in the lives of all police officers and the \ncommunities they serve. We improved the Justice Department's Public \nSafety Officers Benefits program by making law the Hometown Heroes \nSurvivors Benefits Act, P.L. No. 108-182: which allows survivors of \npublic safety officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or strokes while \nparticipating in nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activities \nto qualify for Federal survivor benefits.\n  We also enacted the Campbell-Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nAct, P.L. No. 108-372, which extends through FY 2007 the authorization \nof appropriations for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program. \nThis program helps State, tribal and local jurisdictions purchase armor \nvests for use by law enforcement officers.\n  Incredibly, President Bush has proposed significant cuts to the \nbulletproof vest program in his fiscal year 2007 budget proposal, but I \nwill work with other Senators to make sure the program is fully funded. \nBulletproof vests have saved the lives of thousands of officers and are \na fundamental line of defense that no officer should be without. I know \nI am not alone in calling for the Senate to fully fund the bulletproof \nvest program and I truly hope Senators will agree that it is critical \nthat we provide the funding authorized for this program. Hundreds of \nthousands of police officers are counting on us.\n  The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, which Senator Campbell and I \nchampioned in the Senate, was signed into law, P.L. No: 108-277. This \nmeasure established national measures of uniformity and consistency to \npermit trained and certified on-duty, off-duty or retired law \nenforcement officers to carry concealed firearms in most situations so \nthat they may respond immediately to crimes across State and other \njurisdictional lines, as well as to protect themselves and their \nfamilies from vindictive criminals.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the \nUnited States with the opportunity to honor the extraordinary service \nand sacrifice given year after year by our police forces. More than \n20,000 peace officers are expected to gather in Washington to join with \nthe families of their fallen comrades. I hope all Senators will join me \nin honoring their service by passing this important bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution \nintroduced by Senator Leahy and others to recognize May 15, 2006, as \n``Peace Officers Memorial Day. Peace Officers work tirelessly to \nprotect our society from criminals who would prey on the weak and \ninnocent. They are the front line in a battle for justice and the rule \nof law. They often are unheralded heroes, whose simple act of going to \nwork puts them in harm's way for our sake.\n  Tens of thousands of police officers were assaulted last year, and \nthat number is likely to be similar this year. It is important that we \ntake a moment to recognize the crucial service they provide.\n  Last year, 156 police officers were killed in the line of duty. \nJustice for the families of slain officers often comes slowly. I have \nintroduced legislation that would speed up the process for the most \nhardened of criminals, those who murder police men and women. The Law \nEnforcement Officers' Protection Act would guarantee tough punishment \nfor criminals who murder or assault police officers. Part of the \nlegislation is named after Dr. John B. Jamison, a Coconino County, AZ \nReserve Sheriffs Deputy who was slain while responding to a fellow \ndeputy's call for assistance. The killer fired 30 rounds from an \nassault rifle into Deputy Jamison's car, killing him before he could \nreach for his gun or even unbuckle his seatbelt. He is survived by two \nchildren. State courts completed their review of the killer's \nconviction and sentence in 1985. Federal courts then delayed the case \nfor an additional 15 years. One judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit even tried to postpone the killer's final execution \ndate on the alleged basis that that killer was wrongfully denied Sate \nfunds to investigate a rare neurological condition that his lawyer had \nlearned of while watching television. Deputy Jamison's killer \nultimately was executed in 2000--18 years after the crime occurred, and \n15 years after Federal habeas corpus proceedings began.\n  So as we recognize the sacrifice that peace officers make to protect \nus every day--to protect the streets on which we drive to work, protect \nthe neighborhoods where our children play, protect the stores where we \nshop, protect the very halls of government where I stand today--I urge \nmy colleagues to help protect the peace officers and bring justice to \nthe families of those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for the \nbenefit of the rest of us.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 472) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Res. 335, \nand the Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 335) honoring and \n     praising the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People on the occasion of its 97th anniversary.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. \nRes. 335, a concurrent resolution honoring and praising the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People for 97 years of \nchampioning the cause of equality in the United States.\n  At the dawn of the 20th century--almost 56 years after the end of the \nCivil War--African Americans were still denied the full rights of \ncitizenship. African Americans were forced to endure the daily \nhumiliation of economic exploitation and social segregation with almost \nno recourse. Racial tensions boiled over into riots and lynchings. It \nwas at this critical juncture in our nation's history that a group of \nconcerned citizens, answering freedom's call, gathered together to form \nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in New \nYork City.\n  Since its founding, the NAACP has fought for the social, political, \nand economic equality of all Americans and has sought to eliminate \nracial discrimination. And the NAACP has never wavered from its \ncommitment to nonviolence in achieving these goals.\n  In 1918, the NAACP successfully pressured President Wilson to \npublicly condemn lynching and continued to raise awareness about the \nhorrific crime. In 1930, the NAACP began its long history of protesting \njudicial nominees who oppose the advancement of civil rights, with the \nsuccessful defeat of John Parker to the Supreme Court. The NAACP fought \nfor, and ultimately achieved, desegregation of the military and other \nfederal government institutions. The NAACP was victorious in Buchanan \nvs. Warley, where the Supreme Court held that states cannot restrict \nand segregate residential districts. And of course, in the seminal case \nof Brown v. Board of Education, the NAACP successfully argued that the \n``separate, but equal'' doctrine is unconstitutional, thereby making \nsegregation in public schools illegal.\n  In the 1960s, the NAACP was a leader in the fight to eradicate Jim \nCrow laws and abolish segregation. And the NAACP was integral to the \npassage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, 1960, and 1964, the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Rights Act.\n  In short, the NAACP has been a catalyst for social change in this \ncountry, winning landmark court decisions and advocating for civil \nrights laws that have walked our nation closer to the promise of \nequality envisioned in our Constitution.\n  Notwithstanding its powerful voice and extraordinary accomplishments, \nwe must never forget that the NAACP works through the tireless efforts \nof its individual members, united around a common vision of justice and \nequality. During desperate times, legendary NAACP members such as \nThurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and Medger Evars made historic stands in \nservice of the movement of civil rights.\n  However, equally as important are the ``everyday'' contributions of \norganizers and activists. One example is Mary Burnett Talbert. \nOriginally a teacher in Little Rock, AR, Talbert eventually moved with \nher husband to Buffalo, NY, where she received an advanced degree. An \nactive member of her community, Talbert was one of the founders of the \nNAACP and later its director, vice president, and president. As \ndirector the NAACP's Anti-Lynching Campaign, Talbert traveled the \nNation giving speeches to black and white audiences. She once wrote \nthat ``By her peculiar position the colored woman has gained clear \npowers of observation and judgment--exactly the sort of powers which \nare today peculiarly necessary to the building of an ideal country.'' \nWith every public education campaign, every fight over a judicial \nnomination, and every lobbying effort to pass progressive legislation, \nthe NAACP takes us one step closer to the ``ideal country'' that Mary \nTalbert envisioned.\n  While the NAACP's mission is to fight for the rights of African \nAmericans, it has always been a multiracial and multicultural \norganization. Many of its founding members were white, including Oswald \nGarrison Villiard, Mary White Ovington, and Henry Moscowitz.\n  As we celebrate the accomplishments of the NAACP, we must also honor \nthe values upon which it was founded, for there is much work left to be \ndone, and the same tireless dedication and clarity of purpose will be \nrequired to continue onward.\n  Despite the last century of achievements, substantial racial \ndisparities persist in educational achievement, access to health care, \nand economic prosperity. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the tragic and \nenduring link between race and poverty in our country, as well as \nemphasized our nation's failure to care for those among us least able \nto provide for themselves. We must continue vigilantly to guard against \nthe resurgence of discriminatory practices that would deprive African \nAmericans of the most fundamental right of democracy--the right to \nvote. We must continue to work to guarantee that every citizen is able \nto vote and that every vote is counted. And this summer, we must \nreauthorize the Voting Rights Act.\n  The NAACP has always stood ready to face these and other challenges. \nNinety-seven years after a group of concerned citizens assembled in New \nYork around the common goal of creating a more just society, the \nNAACP's half million members continue to lead Freedom's march.\n  For the battles it has fought, and for the battles it has yet to \nfight, our nation is forever in debt to the NAACP.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record, without further intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Board of Education, the NAACP successfully argued that the \n``separate, but equal'' doctrine is unconstitutional, thereby making \nsegregation in public schools illegal.\n  In the 1960s, the NAACP was a leader in the fight to eradicate Jim \nCrow laws and abolish segregation. And the NAACP was integral to the \npassage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, 1960, and 1964, the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Rights Act.\n  In short, the NAACP has been a catalyst for social change in this \ncountry, winning landmark court decisions and advocating for civil \nrights laws that have walked our nation closer to the promise of \nequality envisioned in our Constitution.\n  Notwithstanding its powerful voice and extraordinary accomplishments, \nwe must never forget that the NAACP works through the tireless efforts \nof its individual members, united around a common vision of justice and \nequality. During desperate times, legendary NAACP members such as \nThurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and Medger Evars made historic stands in \nservice of the movement of civil rights.\n  However, equally as important are the ``everyday'' contributions of \norganizers and activists. One example is Mary Burnett Talbert. \nOriginally a teacher in Little Rock, AR, Talbert eventually moved with \nher husband to Buffalo, NY, where she received an advanced degree. An \nactive member of her community, Talbert was one of the founders of the \nNAACP and later its director, vice president, and president. As \ndirector the NAACP's Anti-Lynching Campaign, Talbert traveled the \nNation giving speeches to black and white audiences. She once wrote \nthat ``By her peculiar position the colored woman has gained clear \npowers of observation and judgment--exactly the sort of powers which \nare today peculiarly necessary to the building of an ideal country.'' \nWith every public education campaign, every fight over a judicial \nnomination, and every lobbying effort to pass progressive legislation, \nthe NAACP takes us one step closer to the ``ideal country'' that Mary \nTalbert envisioned.\n  While the NAACP's mission is to fight for the rights of African \nAmericans, it has always been a multiracial and multicultural \norganization. Many of its founding members were white, including Oswald \nGarrison Villiard, Mary White Ovington, and Henry Moscowitz.\n  As we celebrate the accomplishments of the NAACP, we must also honor \nthe values upon which it was founded, for there is much work left to be \ndone, and the same tireless dedication and clarity of purpose will be \nrequired to continue onward.\n  Despite the last century of achievements, substantial racial \ndisparities persist in educational achievement, access to health care, \nand economic prosperity. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the tragic and \nenduring link between race and poverty in our country, as well as \nemphasized our nation's failure to care for those among us least able \nto provide for themselves. We must continue vigilantly to guard against \nthe resurgence of discriminatory practices that would deprive African \nAmericans of the most fundamental right of democracy--the right to \nvote. We must continue to work to guarantee that every citizen is able \nto vote and that every vote is counted. And this summer, we must \nreauthorize the Voting Rights Act.\n  The NAACP has always stood ready to face these and other challenges. \nNinety-seven years after a group of concerned citizens assembled in New \nYork around the common goal of creating a more just society, the \nNAACP's half million members continue to lead Freedom's march.\n  For the battles it has fought, and for the battles it has yet to \nfight, our nation is forever in debt to the NAACP.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record, without further intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con.

Mr. President, what we have just seen happen is not \nsurprising, but it is disappointing. Health Care Week has come to an \nend in the Senate on Wednesday evening. We have decided we don't have \nthe time, interest, or inclination to take up other issues. It is a \ntake-it-or-leave-it situation. If we do not accept the Enzi bill, S. \n1955, now pending, nothing will be done on health care in the Senate.\n  It is no wonder to me the American people are cynical about this \nprocess. There are so many things we need to do. We are 5 days away \nfrom the deadline on Medicare prescription Part D. My best estimate is \n50 percent of the people we had hoped would enroll have not done it. \nThey are going to be penalized on May 15 up to 7 percent a year on \ntheir premium costs for the rest of their life. We have asked for an \nextension of time so they can make a choice. We have asked for an \nextension of time so seniors who have chosen the wrong plan can choose \nanother plan without penalty. Those are not unreasonable. We ask for \nextensions for people who file income tax without questions asked. To \ngive an extension to an elderly person struggling with 45 different \nchoices for the right prescription drug program is not unreasonable. It \nwould be compassionate. It is the decision of the Senate Republican \nleadership that we don't have the time or inclination to take up that \nissue.\n  I just asked the majority leader: What about stem cell research? Last \nJuly, he pledged support for stem cell research. The writing is on the \nwall: Another year will go by, and this Senate will not go on record on \nstem cell research.\n  While millions of Americans and their families are suffering from \ndiseases that could be directly impacted by this research, the Senate \ndoesn't have the time or the inclination to take up this issue. Is it \nany wonder that people are angry with the Congress as it is presently \nbeing conducted? Is it any wonder people are calling for significant \nchange, not only in the direction of this country but in the policies \nwe follow on Capitol Hill? We are going to break our necks to bring up \na tax bill before we leave this week to give tax benefits and tax cuts \nto the wealthiest people in America. We have to get that done, but we \ndon't have time to bring up stem cell research which could give hope \nand promise for cures and relief to millions of American families?\n  Where are our priorities? The priorities of this Republican-led \nCongress are priorities that do not reflect where America is today. The \nmotions we have just heard do not reflect that. To suggest that we \ndon't have time, for example, to even consider the reimportation of \ndrugs so that people struggling with fixed incomes can afford the drugs \nthey need to stay independent, be strong, stay alive--we don't have \ntime for that. No, we have to get on to a tax cut--a tax cut. Let me \ntell you what the tax cut is.\n  The tax cut which the Republicans want to force through here before \nwe leave this week--we have to break all records to make sure we get \nthis done--is a tax cut that will mean for people making less than \n$75,000 a year about on average $100 in tax relief. The good old $100 \ncheck is coming back at you, America, if you make less than $75,000 a \nyear; that is your tax cut; be prepared, party on. But if you happen to \nbe making $1 million a year, well, that is another story. This \nRepublican tax cut, which they just have to have, means about $42,000 \nless in taxes paid by someone making $1 million a year.\n  No time for drugs imported from Canada for people on fixed incomes \nwho can't afford what they need to stay alive, no time for stem cell \nresearch for the millions of families counting on us to push forward on \nmedical research to find cures and relief, no time to deal with \nMedicare prescription Part D when 7 or 8 million Americans, senior \ncitizens, are about to face penalties in 5 days, no time for that, but \nplenty of time for tax cuts. It tells the story. No wonder the people \nacross this country and even 30 of the Republicans are saying it is \ntime for a change on Capitol Hill. It is time for new leadership, new \ndirection, and new values. If this is the best we can do, to come up \nwith a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America and ignore the real \nneeds of small business and the elderly, to ignore the real needs of \nthose who are fighting for medical research to give them hope to live \nanother day, it is a sad outcome.\n\n  I started this day by praising Senator Enzi and I will end it by \ndoing the same. I respect him. I admire him. He brought an issue to the \nfloor that is a tough one--health care in America. And this debate is \nlong overdue. We have been waiting a long time to address an issue that \ntroubles families and businesses across this Nation. I thank Senator \nEnzi for his leadership in bringing this to the floor. But I have to \ntell you, what has happened today procedurally on the floor gives no \ncredit to that effort by Senator Enzi. Shutting down amendments, not \neven giving us a moment to raise these important issues, even with \nlimited time and limited debate, is unfair. And what a contrast. What a \ncontrast to the immigration bill where the Senator from Tennessee, the \nRepublican majority leader, has argued that we need every possible \namendment to be considered before it comes to a conclusion. Wide open; \nlet everybody bring what they want, whether they are for the bill or \nagainst it. But when it comes to health care, when it comes to what \ncounts, this man, who has made medicine his profession and his life \nbefore he came to the Senate, does not give us an opportunity to go \ninto the issues that are so important to people across America. It is a \nsad outcome for America, it is a sad outcome for the Senate. This \nSenate appears to be not only risk averse but work averse, and that is \na shame. It is time for a change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/10/senate-section/article/S4382-6", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4382-S4383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
