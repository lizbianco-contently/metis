Mr. President, I rise today in support of President \nBush's nomination of Judge John Roberts to serve as Chief Justice of \nthe United States.\n  It would be difficult to identify a jurist better qualified for our \nNation's highest Court than Judge John Roberts. He is a distinguished \njurist who enjoys broad bipartisan support.\n  There is good reason for this broad bipartisan support. Judge \nRoberts' sharp intellect and legal ability are beyond question. In \naddition, his humility, fairness, and open-minded approach to the \npractice of law have won him admirers from across the political \nspectrum.\n  During his career as a practicing attorney, Judge Roberts argued a \nvariety of positions in a number of high-profile cases and has \nrepresented criminal defendants, environmental interests, and the State \nof Hawaii in a dispute over legislation meant to favor native Hawaiians \nas a group.\n  During the 2001 landmark Microsoft antitrust case before the District \nof Columbia court, he argued on behalf of the Clinton Justice \nDepartment and a group of primarily Democratic State attorneys general \nthat several of Microsoft's business practices violated the Sherman \nAntitrust Act.\n  In the landmark 2002 environmental case, Tahoe-Sierra Preservation \nCouncil v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, he successfully argued \nbefore the Supreme Court in favor of limits on property development and \nin support of protection of the Pristine Lake Tahoe Basin area.\n  Judge Roberts has been described as ``one of the top appellate \nlawyers of his generation'' by the Legal Times, and one of the top 10 \ncivil litigators by the National Law Journal in 1999.\n  Colorado's own Rocky Mountain News offered its unequivocal \nendorsement of Judge Roberts. The Rocky Mountain News stated that \n``Roberts is\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\nnot only well-spoken, he's tactful, amicable and focused'' and \n``projects a temperament that should serve a Chief Justice well.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the full September 17 article printed \nin the Record. \n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Rocky Mountain News, Sept. 17, 2005]\n\n                     Roberts Rises to the Occasion\n\n       When Chief Justice John Roberts finished his testimony \n     Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee--oops! we're \n     getting ahead of ourselves. When the next chief justice \n     finished his testimony, some senators complained they knew \n     little more about him than when the hearings started because \n     he'd dodged so many questions.\n       Weren't they listening? Most of us know a lot more about \n     Roberts today than we did a week ago--even though he did, \n     yes, dodge questions about issues that will come before the \n     court. Every one of the current justices once dodged such \n     questions, too.\n       We learned, for example, that Roberts is quick on his feet \n     and able to respond with aplomb to questions that in some \n     cases were asinine. Wisconsin Sen. Herb Kohl actually wanted \n     Roberts to explain what role he'd play ``in making right the \n     wrongs revealed by Katrina.'' Roberts politely reminded him \n     that courts are ``passive institutions'' that ``decide the \n     cases that are presented.''\n       We learned that Roberts is not only well-spoken, he's \n     tactful, amicable and focused--that he projects a temperament \n     that should serve a chief justice well.\n       No, we still don't know how he'll rule on cases related to \n     abortion or the regulatory powers of government under the \n     commerce clause, to cite issues that exercised senators. But \n     learning his views on such matters was never realistically in \n     the cards.\n       Our favorite part of his testimony was when he was pressed \n     to explore his analogy between being a judge and a baseball \n     umpire. He said he believed balls and strikes were objective \n     facts even if an umpire isn't always correct in calling them.\n       ``I do think there are right answers,'' he explained. ``I \n     know that it's fashionable in some places to suggest that \n     there are no right answers and that judges are motivated by a \n     constellation of different considerations . . . That's not \n     the view of the law that I subscribe to.\n       ``I think when you folks legislate, you do have something \n     in mid . . . and you expect judges not to put in their own \n     preferences, not to substitute their judgment for you, but to \n     implement your view of what you are accomplishing in that \n     statute. I think, when the framers framed the Constitution, \n     it was the same thing. . . . And I think there is meaning \n     there and I think there is meaning in your legislation. And \n     the job of a good judge is to do as good a job as possible to \n     get the right answer.''\n       That's not a complete judicial philosophy, of course, but \n     it's the start of a good one. And despite the scattered \n     complaints, we suspect a majority of senators recognize it, \n     too.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, another Colorado newspaper, the Pueblo \nChieftain, offered its praise for Judge Roberts stating that ``Judge \nRoberts looks like the kind of justice who would apply the Constitution \nas it is written,'' adding ``that's as it should be.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the full September 8 editorial \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Pueblo Chieftain]\n\n                            Altered Calculus\n\n       The death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist over the \n     weekend has altered the calculus of Supreme Court \n     nominations.\n       President Bush, who had named Circuit Court Judge John \n     Roberts to fill the seat of retiring Associate Justice Sandra \n     Day O'Connor, withdrew that nomination and renominated him to \n     succeed Justice Rehnquist. It was a logical decision.\n       The American Bar Association already has given Judge \n     Roberts, 50, its highest rating. He is well-regarded in legal \n     circles. He's been under a microscope by senators and the \n     media and found to be top-notch. Colorado's own Democratic \n     Sen. Ken Salazar gives Judge Roberts high marks.\n       So the Beltway oddsmakers are calling Judge Roberts' \n     confirmation in the Senate a sure bet. That brings into \n     question, then, the president's choice to replace Justice \n     O'Connor, who says she will remain on the bench until here \n     replacement is confirmed.\n       During both of his presidential campaigns, Mr. Bush made as \n     one of his key planks restoring the balance on the court away \n     from the liberal, activist mode which became de rigueur when \n     President Eisenhower named Earl Warren (``the biggest damn \n     fool mistake I've ever made'') as chief justice.\n       Credit Justice Rehniquist for slowly tipping the balance \n     back during his tenure. But that balance is precarious.\n       President Bush will face an unrelenting deluge from \n     liberals saying he should nominate someone from the \n     ``mainstream,'' meaning left of center. These groups would \n     like to derail any Supreme Court nominee who has a \n     conservative bone in his or her body, because it has been \n     only through the liberal courts, not the legislative process, \n     where they have been able to influence public policy.\n       Funny, though, but recent elections have shown that the \n     mainstream is not over there in the Beltway/Hollywood \n     liberals' bailiwick.\n       And elections mean something. President Clinton named Ruth \n     Bader Ginsburg to the high court, and most Republicans in the \n     Senate voted to confirm her. If President Bush names someone \n     in the judicial philosophical mold of an Antonin Scalia and \n     Clarence Thomas, he would be fulfilling a campaign pledge and \n     helping return the court to its rightful role, not as a de \n     facto legislature but as arbiter of the law and the \n     Constitution.\n       Judge Roberts looks like the kind of justice who would \n     apply the Constitution as it is written. And we urge \n     President Bush to nominate another justice with the same \n     inclination.\n       That's as it should be.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe Judge Roberts will be an \nadvocate and practitioner of judicial restraint, a Justice who focuses \non a narrow interpretation of the Constitution as the Framers intended. \nIn his own words:\n\n       My obligation is to the Constitution. That's the oath.\n\n  I believe he is temperamentally and intellectually inclined to stick \nto the facts and the law in cases that will come before him on the High \nCourt, and that he will refrain from attempting to legislate from the \nbench. In his own words, Judge Roberts says:\n\n       The role of the judge is limited . . . [j]udges are to \n     decide the cases before them. They're not to legislate, \n     they're not to execute the laws.\n\n  I also believe Judge Roberts' personal views will not determine the \noutcome of cases before him. In his own words, the ``American justice \nsystem is epitomized by the fact that judges . . . wear . . . black \nrobes. And that is meant to symbolize the fact that they're not \nindividuals promoting their own particular views, but they are supposed \nto be doing their best to interpret the law, to interpret the \nConstitution, according to the rules of law--not their own preferences, \nnot their own personal beliefs.''\n  Judge Roberts recognizes the importance of property rights and the \nrole of the legislature in drawing the line in cases of eminent domain. \nCommenting on the Court's recent decision in Kelo, Judge Roberts \nexplained:\n\n       What the Court was saying is there is this power, and then \n     it's up to the legislature to determine whether it wants that \n     to be available--whether it wants it to be available in \n     limited circumstances, or whether it wants to go back to an \n     understanding as reflected in the dissent, that this is not \n     an appropriate public use.\n\n  President Bush has sent forward the name of an excellent nominee. His \nqualifications to serve as Chief Justice of the United States are even \nmore apparent after his remarkable testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Judge Roberts testified for approximately 22 \nhours, 10 hours longer than William Rehnquist when he became Chief \nJustice, 5 hours longer than Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and 4 hours longer \nthan Stephen Breyer.\n  During the course of his testimony, Judge Roberts demonstrated an \nimpressive command of the law and understanding of a myriad of legal \nissues. He provided thoughtful and thorough answers to over 500 \nchallenging questions asked by Senators of both parties.\n  Personally, I admire his commitment to maintaining his judicial \nindependence and ability to rule fairly by choosing not to prejudge \ncases that are likely to come before him. It is indicative of his \nundying and lifelong commitment to equal protection under the law.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to give him a final vote in support of \nhis nomination.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceed to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

Mr. President, I rise today to address a matter of \nextreme importance, women's health, public safety, and the independence \nand credibility of one of our Nation's most revered Federal agencies, \nthe FDA.\n  I am very concerned. American women are concerned, and consumers all \nacross this country should be concerned that the FDA is letting \npolitics trump science in the way it approves medicine for American \nconsumers.\n  I have always supported a strong and independent Food and Drug \nAdministration. It is the only way in which the FDA can truly operate \neffectively and with the confidence of American consumers and health \ncare providers.\n  Americans must have faith when they walk into the local grocery store \nor local pharmacy that the products they purchase are safe, that they \nare effective, and that their approval has been based on sound science, \nnot on political pressure or pandering to interest groups. By allowing \npolitics to play a role in the decisionmaking, the FDA is now opening a \nPandora's box that could have profound consequences in determining the \nsafety and efficacy of the drug approval process.\n  Unfortunately, recent decisions and delays at the FDA have now called \ninto question the agency's independence and allegiance to science-based \ndecisions, and plan B is exhibit A. But don't take my word for it. \nListen to Dr. Susan Wood, the former director of the FDA's Office of \nWomen's Health. In resigning in protest, Dr. Wood wrote:\n\n       I have spent the last 15 years working to ensure that \n     science informs good health policy decisions. I can no longer \n     serve a staff when scientific and clinical evidence fully \n     evaluated and recommended by the professional staff here has \n     been overruled.\n\n  In later comments to the Associated Press she said:\n\n       There's fairly widespread concern about FDA's credibility \n     among agency veterans as a result of the Plan B process.\n\n  Those are the words of a health care professional who worked for \nyears within the FDA to improve women's health. Her resignation is a \nhuge loss to the agency, to those in Congress who have championed \nwomen's health and, most importantly, her resignation is a loss to the \nmillions of American women who rely on the FDA to make choices based on \nsound science.\n  Let me take a step back and explain what plan B is and why the FDA's \nactions are such a threat to the public's health. Plan B is a form of \ncontraception. Plan B contains a specific concentrated dose of ordinary \nbirth control pills that prevent pregnancy. Emergency contraception \ncannot interrupt or disrupt an established pregnancy. In fact, plan B \nhas the potential to reduce the incidence of abortions, something I \nthink every one of us can agree on. It is an important goal.\n  Raising the awareness and use of emergency contraceptives such as \nplan B is an important component to reducing the rate of abortion in \nthe United States. An analysis conducted by the Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute estimates that 51,000 abortions were prevented by emergency \ncontraceptive use in 2000 and that increased use of emergency \ncontraceptives accounted for up to 43 percent of the total decline in \nabortion rates between 1994 and 2000. Plan B has already been approved \nby the FDA for prescription use and it is available over the counter in \nseven States, including my home State of Washington. However, it is not \navailable nationwide.\n  When it comes to emergency contraceptives, every hour counts. The \neffectiveness of plan B declines by 50 percent every 12 hours. The \nlonger a woman must wait to see a doctor, get a prescription, and then \nfind a pharmacy that will fill the prescription, the less effective \nplan B becomes. Even privately insured women with regular access to a \nhealth care provider have to overcome significant barriers to obtain a \nprescription for emergency contraceptives, including finding a pharmacy \nthat stocks plan B within a short timeframe. For many uninsured women \nand teens, the barriers are often insurmountable.\n  Back in December of 2003, almost 2 years ago, the FDA's own \nscientific advisory board overwhelmingly recommended approval of plan B \nover-the-counter application by a vote of 23 to 4. However, the FDA has \nnot adhered to its own guidelines for drug approval and continues to \ndrag its heels.\n  In fact, Alastair Wood, who is a member of the advisory panel, told \nUSA Today:\n\n       What's disturbing is that the science was overwhelmingly \n     here, and the FDA is supposed to make decisions on science.\n\n  At a HELP Committee hearing in April of this year, I pressed the \nPresident's nominee to head the FDA, Dr. Lester Crawford, to answer \nquestions about this long-pending application for nationwide over-the-\ncounter approval of plan B. When Dr. Crawford informed me that he \ncouldn't answer my questions in a public forum, I invited him to my \noffice to discuss the process in a private meeting. My colleagues \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Clinton joined me for a very frustrating \nmeeting in which Dr. Crawford failed to provide any timeline or \nspecific reasons for the FDA's highly unusual foot dragging on the plan \nB application. It was very clear to me after this disappointing meeting \nthat politics had trumped science, and the public health mission of the \nFDA had been compromised.\n  For this reason, Senator Clinton and I joined to place a hold on Dr. \nCrawford's nomination to head the FDA on June 15, 2005. We placed that \nhold saying we want a determination on the application. We did not \nadvocate for a particular outcome. All we asked was that the FDA abide \nby its own rules and regulations. That is a very important point. \nSenator Clinton and I did not demand approval. We simply called on the \nFDA to follow its own procedures. In the end, apparently, even that was \nasking too much.\n\n  The administration and the chairman of the HELP Committee \nunderstandably wanted Dr. Crawford confirmed. We began what I consider \nto be a very productive conversation about restoring integrity to the \nFDA's process and getting Dr. Crawford confirmed. I thank the chairman \nfor his responsiveness and good-faith efforts. Our discussions \nculminated in a July 13 letter to the HELP Committee and cochair, to \nSenator Enzi and to Senator Kennedy, from Health and Human Services \nSecretary Michael Leavitt.\n  This chart shows the letter from Secretary Leavitt:\n\n       I have spoken to the FDA, and based on the feedback I have \n     received, the FDA will act on this application by September \n     1, 2005.\n\n  Based on this letter, based on his personal assurance, Senator \nClinton and I then dropped our hold on Dr. Crawford and subsequently \nhis nomination passed the Senate.\n  Now, unfortunately for the American people and especially for the \nintegrity of the FDA, Secretary Leavitt and the FDA broke their \npromise. The FDA had a chance to restore the confidence of American \nconsumers in promoting safe and effective treatments, but it failed in \nits mission.\n  A delay is not a decision. For over 6 months, Senator Clinton and I \nasked for a simple answer, yes or no. It is a breach of faith to have \nhad this administration give us their word that a decision would be \nmade and have that promise violated. Now the FDA is claiming there are \n``unanswered'' questions about plan B's effect on girls under 17. The \nfact is the pending application does not apply to that group. Today, \ngirls under 17 may only receive this drug with a prescription. That \nwould remain the case if the FDA were to approve plan B's application. \nThe FDA's argument is highly suspect because the Government already \nregulates products with age restrictions. They do it with tobacco, \nnicotine gum, and alcohol.\n  The administration gave us their word, and then they pulled the rug \nout at the last minute. This continued delay goes against everything \nthe FDA's own advisory panel found nearly 2 years ago, that plan B is \nsafe, it is effective, and it should be available over the counter. \nThere is no credible scientific reason to continue to deny increased \naccess to this safe health care option. In fact, in his statement of \nfurther delay, Dr. Crawford acknowledged that the application has \nscientific merit, but he still refused to approve it.\n\n[[Page S10250]]\n\n  I can only infer that the FDA and Dr. Crawford, as its head, are \ncontinuing to put politics ahead of science. I am not the only one. \nAccording to the Washington Post editorial page, August 30:\n\n       In recent months, critics have accused the FDA--which is \n     required by law to make decisions exclusively on scientific \n     and legal grounds--of falling victim to outside political \n     agendas.\n       They have claimed that the Plan B decisions have reflected \n     not sound science and legitimate caution but rather the \n     influence of ``moral'' antiabortion lobbies . . .\n       By abruptly rejecting an application that had been tailored \n     to meet the FDA's requirements, Mr. Crawford appears to \n     confirm the critics' worst fears.\n       Whatever the legal arguments taking place, this unexpected \n     delay at this stage of the approval process makes the FDA--\n     long admired around the world for its neutrality and \n     professionalism--look like an easily manipulated political \n     tool.\n\n  Here is what Newsday said:\n\n       Drugs and politics do not mix.\n       The current case in point is Plan B, the morning after \n     emergency contraceptive, and the politics of abortion.\n       Taken together, they are threatening the Food and Drug \n     Administration's credibility as an agency that \n     dispassionately evaluates the safety and effectiveness of \n     drugs.\n       The FDA said Friday it will delay for 60 days a decision on \n     whether to allow Plan B to be sold to those 16 and older \n     without a prescription.\n       Officials attributed the foot-dragging to a concern that \n     younger teens would get the drugs and wouldn't use it \n     responsibly.\n       That rings hollow.\n       When the FDA rejected an application for over-the-counter \n     sales without age restriction 2 years ago it overruled that \n     staff and an advisory panel, and discounted the experience of \n     six states and 33 countries where such pills are sold without \n     prescription.\n       The most recent application responsibly included the age \n     restriction.\n\n  Here is how the Virginian Pilot put it:\n\n       Plan B contraceptives can prevent tens of thousands of \n     abortions and unwanted pregnancies. Restriction on \n     availability to minors is consistent with other national \n     reproductive policies and therefore valid.\n       A country that can put a man on the moon can surely figure \n     out how to distinguish between younger and older women in \n     selling a pill. If, that is, policymakers care half as much \n     about science in one case as in the other.\n\n  And perhaps most succinctly, I quote from the Baltimore Sun:\n\n       Dr. Crawford has been forced to adopt many improbable \n     positions in order to keep his job. But now he is at risk of \n     turning the world's most respected drug reviewing agency into \n     a laughingstock.\n       Nobody wins if that happens.\n\n  No amount of semantics or politicking can change the fact that the \nHHS Secretary and the FDA performed a bait and switch with the Senate \nand, more importantly, to the American people. Today, the Bush \nadministration has its FDA Commissioner, but the American public still \ndoes not have an answer on plan B. Unfortunately, the FDA, which has \nlong been known as the gold standard in drug approval, is now at risk \nof becoming known for a double standard.\n  The health and well-being of the American people should not blow with \nthe political winds. Caring for our residents is an American issue, and \npart of that goal is ensuring that our residents have access to safe, \neffective medicines in a timely fashion. As a new member of the Senate \nHELP Committee back in 1997 I faced the daunting task of working to \nhelp reform the FDA. I, along with my colleagues, was dedicated to \nmaking the Food and Drug Modernization Act work.\n  The intent of this landmark legislation was to introduce a new \nculture at the FDA, one which would expedite the drug approval process \nby eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic delays while ensuring product \nsafety.\n  This new partnership was intended to open the lines of communication \nand ensure that manufacturers had a clear understanding of what would \nbe required in our drug approval process. The FDA has broken those \nlines of communication and has now called into question the future of \ndrug approval within the agency.\n  I believe strongly in a strong and independent FDA, but I believe \nthis agency has made a mockery of Congress and of its own procedures \nand its own protocols. They have abused the trust of Congress and of \nthe American people in the way they have played around with plan B. It \nis far past time to return credibility to the FDA. The FDA needs to \nreturn to the gold standard, not continue to create a double standard \nthat puts politics ahead of the health and safety of the American \npublic.\n  This is not the last word on this issue. The problem with politics \nsubverting the FDA's adherence to science and its integrity is so \nprofound and so urgent that I intend to use every tool available to me \nas a Senator to make sure this discussion about our priorities and our \nfuture is not lost.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, this week, as we celebrate our \nConstitution's 218th anniversary, we are nearing the exercise of one of \nthe Senate's most solemn constitutional requirements and \nresponsibilities. Few decisions the Senate faces are as consequential \nand enduring as when the Senate decides whether to confirm, by giving \nits consent, the nomination of a justice--of course, even more so when \nthe nomination is for Chief Justice of the United States.\n  The Supreme Court is different from the lower courts. The Supreme \nCourt is the only Federal court required by the Constitution itself. \nActually, the Chief Justice is the only member of the Court expressly \nnamed in the Constitution. All other courts are bound by the decisions \nof the Supreme Court. Its decisions are final. They are unappealable. \nOnly the Supreme Court can modify or overrule its precedents. Its power \nis enormous. The role of the Chief Justice is to lead not only that \nall-powerful Court but the entire third branch of Government. We have \nhad 43 Presidents in this country, but we have had only 16 Chief \nJustices--all appointed for life.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, whose \npassionate advocacy established our Constitution Day commemoration, \ndescribes the Constitution very accurately as the soul of our Nation. \nThe Senate's advice and consent responsibilities are at the core of \nthis body's vital role in our Republic.\n  This week, we commemorate our Constitution in a time of great \nchallenges, and we are reminded again how resilient our Constitution is \nin empowering our Nation to meet each era's challenges. The carefully \ncalibrated checks and balances within our Constitution are essential to \nthat. No branch of Government is intended to be the rubberstamp of \nanother branch.\n  Each day, Americans are fighting and dying in Iraq. Hundreds of \nthousands of Americans have been displaced by disasters here at home. \nFour years after 9/11, with public confidence shattered, we have to \nembark on a review of why we are still not prepared to respond to a \nterrorist attack or foreseen natural disasters.\n  The cost of energy--gas and home heating fuels--continues to climb to \nall-time highs, adding to the cost of other goods. The administration \nis suspending environmental and worker protections. Poverty and the \ndisparities of opportunity between races and classes continue their \ninsidious rise each year. After having seen recent years of budget \nsurpluses, now the country's budget deficits are at previously unheard \nof levels--between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. Our national \ndebt is at $8 trillion--8,000 billion dollars--that is a profligate \namount. It can only be paid off by our children and our grandchildren.\n  So Americans need to know their constitutional rights will be \nprotected, that their Government is on their side, and that the courts \nwill be a place of refuge, stability, independence, and justice.\n  The nomination of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the \nUnited States presents a close question and one that each Senator must \ncarefully weigh and decide. This is a question that holds serious \nconsequences for all Americans today and for generations to come. I \nhave approached this nomination with an open mind, as I do all judicial \nnominations. There is no entitlement to confirmation for lifetime\n\n[[Page S10251]]\n\nappointments on any court for any nomination by any President, \nDemocratic or Republican.\n\n  I have served in the Senate for slightly over three decades, and on \nthe Judiciary Committee for most of that time. I take my constitutional \nresponsibility with respect to advice and consent seriously. I am 1 \nvote out of 100, but I recognize those 100 of us privileged to serve in \nthe Senate are entrusted with protecting the rights of 280 million of \nour fellow citizens. We stand in their shoes. We and the President are \nthe ones with a vote in the choice of the Chief Justice of the United \nStates.\n  With this vote, I do not intend to lend my support to an effort by \nthis President to move the Supreme Court and the law dramatically to \nthe right. Above all, balance and moderation on the Court are crucial. \nI want all Americans to know the Supreme Court will protect their \nrights and respect the authority of Congress to act in their interests. \nI want a Supreme Court that acts in its finest tradition as a source of \njustice. The Supreme Court must be an institution where the Bill of \nRights and human dignity are honored.\n  I have voted for the vast majority of President Ford's, President \nCarter's, President Reagan's, President George H.W. Bush's, President \nClinton's, and President George W. Bush's judicial nominees. I have \ndrawn the line only at those nominees who were among the most \nideologically extreme who came to us in the mode of activists. That is \nwhat they were intended to be. That is the way they were described. \nThat is the way they came to us. In those cases, the President opted \nnot to seek moderate candidates. I think some of these extreme choices \nwere sent here to politicize the process and did so to a greater extent \nthan I had previously seen in my 31 years in the Senate.\n  I have not reflexively opposed Republican nominees or conservative \njudicial nominees nominated by Republican Presidents. In fact, I \nrecommended a Republican to President Clinton to fill Vermont's seat on \nthe Second Circuit, Judge Fred Parker. I recommended another \nRepublican, Judge Peter Hall, to President Bush to fill that seat after \nJudge Parker's death.\n  I voted for President Reagan's nominations of Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor and Justice Anthony Kennedy, and for President Bush's \nnomination of Justice Souter.\n  Unfortunately, this President has said he approached this matter as \nif fulfilling a campaign pledge to appoint someone in the mold of \nJustice Thomas and Justice Scalia. I voted against confirmation of \nJustice Thomas. I voted for Justice Scalia, and I now question that \nvote, as many of those who voted for him do today. If I thought Judge \nRoberts would easily reject precedent in the manner of Justice Thomas \nor would use his position on the Supreme Court as a bulwark for \nactivism in the manner of Justice Scalia, then I would not hesitate to \nvote no. If I were convinced he would undercut fundamental rights of \nprivacy or equal protection, this would not even be a close question.\n  I want to vote for a Chief Justice of the United States who I am \nconfident has a judicial philosophy that appreciates the vital role of \nthe judiciary in protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans. \nChief Justice Marshall understood the essential function of the \njudiciary as a check on Presidential power. Under his leadership, the \nConstitution's guarantee of an independent judiciary and the bedrock \nprinciple of judicial review became realities. But Chief Justice Roger \nTaney, who everybody said was a brilliant lawyer, led the Court in a \ndifferent and destructive direction. He authored the Dred Scott \ndecision which propelled the States toward Civil War by relying only on \ntechnical reasoning and an unjust holding that denied all African \nAmericans the status of citizens.\n  Contrast that with Chief Justice Earl Warren. He led the Supreme \nCourt and the Nation in a crowning achievement when he forged the \nunanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education and breathed life \ninto the equal protection guarantee of the 14th amendment and put a \nstop to segregation in this country, which will always be a blot on our \nnational conscience.\n  The President has asked that this nomination be handled with fairness \nand dignity. No matter how we vote, the Judiciary Committee has met \nthose standards. Our committee held a hearing on the merits. I worked \nwith the chairman to expedite the committee's consideration of the \nnomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court out of respect to \nJustice O'Connor and the work of the Court.\n  Fewer than 36 hours after the announcement of the passing of Chief \nJustice Rehnquist and during the horrific aftermath in the week \nfollowing Hurricane Katrina, the President withdrew that nomination to \nbe Associate Justice. Thereafter, we were sent this alternative \nnomination for Judge John Roberts to become the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States. Again, I cooperated with Chairman Specter in an \naccelerated consideration of this nomination.\n  I wish we had had as much cooperation coming from the administration. \nAlthough we started off well with some early efforts at consultation \nafter Justice O'Connor's retirement announcement in early July, that \nconsultation never blossomed into meaningful discussions. It was \ntruncated after a bipartisan meeting with Senate leaders at the White \nHouse. The President did not share his thinking with us or his plans, \nalthough that would be the nature of true consultation. His naming of \nJudge Roberts as his choice to replace Justice O'Connor came as a \nsurprise, not as something that came resulted from meaningful \nconsultation.\n  He then preemptively announced that he decided to withdraw that \nnomination and, instead, nominated Judge Roberts to succeed Chief \nJustice Rehnquist. He did so at 8 a.m. on the Monday morning following \nthe announcement on the previous Saturday night of the Chief's passing. \nThere could and should have been consultation with the Senate on the \nnomination of somebody to succeed Chief Justice Rehnquist and to serve \nas the 17th Chief Justice of the United States. For that position as \nChief Justice there was no consultation. In fact, I learned about the \nPresident's decision shortly before his televised announcement Monday \nmorning.\n  I think the administration committed another disservice to this \nnomination and, especially to this nominee, by withholding information \nthat has traditionally been shared with the Senate. The administration \ntreated Senators' requests for information with little respect. \nInstead, for the first time in my memory, they grafted exceptions from \nthe Freedom of Information Act to limit their response to legitimate \nrequests from Senators for information.\n  In fact, they stonewalled entirely the narrowly tailored request for \nwork papers from 16 of the cases John Roberts handled when he was the \nprincipal deputy to Kenneth Starr at the Solicitor General's office \nduring the President's father's administration. The precedent from \nChief Justice Rehnquist's hearing and others, of course, goes the other \nway.\n  Previous Presidents have paid the appropriate respect and \nacknowledgment to the Senate and to the constitutional process by \nworking with the committee to provide such materials. Accordingly, it \nis understandable if a Senator were to vote against the President's \nnomination on this basis alone.\n  I must also say that some of my friends on the other side of the \naisle disserved the confirmation process by urging the nominee not to \nanswer questions or reveal his judicial philosophy during the course of \nthe hearing. One notable exception was the chairman of the committee. I \nappreciate Senator Specter's commitment to the role of the Senate and \nhis taking our duty to advise and consent as seriously as it deserves \nto be taken. Regrettably, many of the answers of the nominee seemed to \ntake to heart the bad advice that he had heard from the other side.\n  Finally, I believe the nominee disserved himself by following the \nscript that he developed while serving in the Reagan administration. He \nand this administration rejected the spirit of Attorney General \nJackson's opinion that with respect to Senate consideration of \nnominations, no person shall be submitted ``whose entire history will \nnot stand light.'' The nominee took a narrow judicial ethics rule \ncorrectly limiting what a judge or judicial nominee should say about a \nparticular case--I agree with him on that--and turned it into a broad \nexcuse from comments on any issue that might arise at any time, in any \ncase. He apparently rejected the Supreme Court's\n\n[[Page S10252]]\n\nholding in 2002, in Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, in which \nJustice Scalia held that a State canon limiting judicial candidates \nfrom announcing their views on legal and political issues was \nunconstitutional.\n  By contrast, however, the public witnesses who appeared last Thursday \nwere extraordinarily helpful in underscoring what is at stake for all \nAmericans with this decision. No one who heard Congressman John Lewis, \nWade Henderson, and Judge Nathaniel Jones can doubt the fundamental \nimportance of our refusal to retreat from our Nation's commitment to \ncivil rights. This Nation can never retreat from that commitment to \ncivil rights or we fail as a nation.\n  The testimony of Coach Roderick Jackson and Beverly Jones reminded us \nhow courageous Americans are still opening doors and going to our \ncourts to right wrongs. The testimony of Anne Marie Talman of MALDEF \nreflected what is at stake when alien children are denied education and \nbenefits that should be available to every child in America.\n  We had a dignified and fair process. Again, I commend Chairman \nSpecter and those members of the committee on both sides of the aisle \nwho did not prejudge the matter and who did not seek to politicize the \nprocess.\n  The hearings did provide the committee with some information. I was \nencouraged by Judge Roberts' answer to my question about providing the \nfifth vote needed to stay an execution when four other justices vote to \nreview a capital case. That has not always been the practice of late. \nHe was right to recognize the illogic--if not the injustice--of having \nthe necessary votes to review the case but lacking the necessary vote \nto allow that review to take place, especially a review that takes \nplace when someone's life is in the balance.\n  I hope the nominee will take up our suggestion to allow greater \naccess to the Supreme Court's proceedings by authorizing their being \ntelevised. I will work with him and Chairman Specter and Senator \nGrassley to increase transparency in the work of the increasingly \nimportant FISA court. This is the foreign intelligence surveillance \ncourt that acts in secret, with very little oversight--certainly \nprecious little oversight in the past few years--from the Senate. Only \nrecently have we begun to ask the questions we should have been asking.\n  I also urge him to consider ways to decentralize the power \naccumulated to the Chief Justice so that the Judicial Conference, the \ncircuit courts, and others can do more. I encourage him to reform the \nrecusal procedures and conflict-of-interest protections at all levels \nof the judiciary but in particular with regard to the Supreme Court \nitself. Perhaps what many have said were his own missteps in connection \nwith his interviewing for this nomination during its consideration of \nthe Hamdan case will inspire him to greater efforts in this important \nregard.\n  As a young man, Judge Roberts clerked for Judge Henry Friendly of the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. That is my circuit, a \ncircuit I have been proud to argue before. The Second Circuit has been \nhome to a number of leading judicial lights; certainly, Henry Friendly \nwas among them. I hope he is going to be faithful to Judge Friendly's \nfairness and thoughtfulness, something all of us in that circuit \nrespected.\n  I made no secret of my concerns about this nomination. In advance of \nthe hearing, I met twice with Judge Roberts, and for nearly 3 hours in \nall I raised my concerns. I provided him additional opportunities to \nrespond during the hearing. This is not a case of ``gotcha.'' This is a \ncase of finding out how he thinks and who he is.\n  I told him I was concerned that he would not act as an effective \ncheck on the abuse of presidential power. Judge Roberts' work in the \nReagan and Bush Justice Departments, as well as his former period in \nthe Reagan White House, seems to have led him to a philosophy of \nsignificant deference to presidential authority. It is exhibited in his \nrecent decisions in the Hamdan, Acree, and Chao cases, among others. \nMaybe this deference was a principal basis on which the President chose \nhim. None of us know.\n  But I did learn other things. I learned, throughout the process, that \nJudge Roberts and I share admiration for Justice Robert Jackson. \nJustice Jackson's protection of fundamental rights, including unpopular \nspeech under the first amendment--of course, popular speech never needs \nprotection; it is the unpopular speech that needs protection--and his \nwillingness to serve as a check on presidential authority are among the \nfinest actions by any Justice in our history.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. When Judge Roberts testified about his respect for Justice \nJackson, I hoped it was a signal he was sending. I actually posed that \nquestion to him and asked him if he was sending us a signal.\n  I accept his assurance that he will act as an independent check on \nthe President in the mold of Justice Jackson and that when he joins the \nSupreme Court, he will no longer heavily defer to presidential \nauthority. It is one of the crucial roles of the Court, and I take him \nat his word that he will do so.\n  This is a fundamental question. We know that we are in a period in \nwhich the executive has a complicit and, some would say, compliant \nRepublican Congress that refuses to serve as a check or balance. \nWithout the courts to fulfill that constitutional role, excess will \ncontinue, and the balance will be tilted.\n  The other dimension of the fundamental balance of constitutional \npowers involves appropriate deference to congressional action taken by \nthe people's elected representatives. The manner and techniques Judge \nRoberts has used while in the executive, private practice, and while \nbriefly on the DC Circuit, show him to require an unrealistic \nexactitude in drafting laws that no collective body could ever meet, \nespecially one of 535 people. I wish he had served in Congress or \nworked for a time in Congress so he would have a deeper understanding \nof the legislative process. I hope that his experience during the \nhearing and the many questions from Senators of both sides of the aisle \nhave helped to increase his appreciation for congressional authority \nand its importance.\n  I believe the current activism of the Supreme Court must be \ncurtailed. I hope that will not be a part of Chief Justice Rehnquist's \nlegacy that John Roberts seeks to continue. Congress acts to protect \nthe interests of Americans through the commerce clause, spending powers \nand the 14th amendment. That has to be respected. I am encouraged by \nhis assurances that he will respect congressional authority.\n  My reading of his dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc of the \nRancho Viejo v. Norton case, in which he made the ``hapless toad'' \nreference, is that he urged rehearing to ``afford the opportunity to \nconsider alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Act.'' \nIndeed, his steadfast reliance on the Supreme Court's recent Raich \ndecision as significant precedent contravening further implications \nfrom Lopez and Morrison was intended to reassure us that he would not \njoin the assault on congressional authority under the commerce clause. \nI heard him, and I rely on him to be true to the impression he created.\n  As a lawyer, John Roberts has been significantly involved in the \ndevelopment of Supreme Court authority limiting the authority of \nCongress under its constitutional spending powers. He argued before the \nSupreme Court in the 1980s, 1990s, and in this decade in a series of \ncases--South Dakota v. Dole, Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association, \nSuter v. Artist M., and Gonzaga University v. Doe--in which he talked \nabout narrowing Congress's spending powers and limiting the ability of \nindividuals to sue to compel the protections Congress required under \nFederal law.\n  His briefs in Gonzaga adopted the extreme view that spending power \nenactment was a contract between the State and Federal Governments and \nthat the intended beneficiaries of those programs had no rights to sue \nto enforce the commitments, even when states were violating the law and \nthe Federal government was not effectively enforcing it. I questioned \nhim extensively on\n\n[[Page S10253]]\n\nthat. At the hearing, he took pains to assure me and Senator Feinstein, \namong others, that as Chief Justice, he would not continue to urge \nadditional restrictions and would respect congressional authority. To \ndo otherwise would greatly undermine Congress's ability to serve the \ninterests of all Americans and protect the environment, assure equal \njustice, provide health care and other basic benefits. I think he knows \nthat now.\n  From the initial questioning by Chairman Specter, throughout the \ntestimony of the nominee, many Senators asked about the fundamental \nreproductive rights of women. He testified that he now recognizes Roe \nv. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey as established precedents of \nthe Supreme Court and entitled to respect.\n  He testified that he interprets the liberty protected by the due \nprocess clause of the 14th amendment as the constitutional bedrock of \nthe right of privacy, both substantive and procedural. Here, too, \nwithin the overly strict confines of his own self-imposed constraints \non his answers, he consciously created the impression that he would not \nbe a judicial activist on this essential point. He left me with the \nunderstanding that he would not seek to overrule or undercut the right \nof a woman to choose. I trust that he is a person of honor and \nintegrity, that he will act accordingly.\n  As Chief Justice, John Roberts would not be only an appointee of a \nRepublican administration or a legal advocate for a narrow interest. As \nChief Justice, he has to be able to check the abuse of presidential \npower. As Chief Justice, he must support congressional efforts to serve \nthe interests of all Americans. As Chief Justice, he has to work to \nensure that the Federal courts, and the Supreme Court in particular, \nare halls of justice where Americans such as Beverly Jones and Roderick \nJackson and Christine Franklin can see and find redress for grievances, \nmeaningful remedies for the violation of their rights, and protection \nof their fundamental interests.\n\n  Justice White wrote in the Franklin case:\n\n       From the earliest years of the Republic, the Court has \n     recognized the power of the Judiciary to award appropriate \n     remedies to redress injuries actionable in court.\n\n  As Chief Justice, John Roberts has to ensure that the Supreme Court \nand all Federal courts never ``abdicate our historic judicial authority \nto award appropriate relief in cases brought in our court system.''\n  Supreme Court Justices decide what cases to decide. They consciously \nshape the direction of the law by choosing which cases to hear as well \nas how they are to be decided. We know he believes in the rule of law. \nI was impressed when he talked about why he went to law school--because \nhe believes in the rule of law. That was the same reason that I went to \nGeorgetown Law School. But court decisions--and especially Supreme \nCourt decisions--are not mechanical applications of neutral principles. \nIf they were, all judges would always reach the same results for the \nsame reasons. But they don't. Legal decisions are not mechanical. They \nare matters of judgment and often matters of justice.\n  As Chief Justice, John Roberts is responsible for the way in which \nthe judicial branch administers justice for all Americans. He must \nknow, in his core, in his heart, in his whole being, the words engraved \nin the Vermont marble on the Supreme Court building are not just \n``under law'' but ``equal justice under law.'' It is not just the rule \nof law that he must serve but the cause of justice under our great \ncharter.\n  I heard days of testimony and held hours of meeting with Judge \nRoberts. I would have liked more information, of course. I always want \nmore.\n  Is a ``no'' vote the easier, more popular one? Of course. For me it \nwould be. But in my judgment, in my experience, but especially my \nconscience, I find it is better on this nomination to vote yes than no. \nUltimately, my Vermont roots have always told me to go with my \nconscience, and they do so today.\n  Judge Roberts is a man of integrity. I can only take him at his word \nthat he does not have an ideological agenda. For me, a vote to confirm \nrequires faith that the words he spoke to us have meaning. I can only \ntake him at his word that he will steer the Court to serve as an \nappropriate check of potential abuses of Presidential power.\n  I respect those who have come to different conclusions, and I readily \nacknowledge the unknowable at this moment, that perhaps they are right \nand I am wrong. Only time will tell. All of us will vote this month, \nbut only later will we know if Judge Roberts proves to be the kind of \nChief Justice he says he will be, if he truly will be his own man. I \nhope and trust that he will be.\n  I will vote for his confirmation. I will give my consent as a \nSenator.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But I do believe we are at \nour best when we rely upon the principles and the values that bind us \ntogether rather than those that distinguish us and separate us as \nSenators.\n  I must confess that yesterday I was more than a little bit \ndisappointed when the distinguished Democratic leader announced that he \nwould vote no on this nomination. Clearly, it is within his right and \nprerogative, as it is within any Senator's right and prerogative to \nvote as they see fit. But I guess what struck me was the fact that at \nthe same time he announced he would vote no, he called Judge Roberts an \n``excellent lawyer'' and ``a thoughtful, mainstream judge'' who may \nmake ``a fine Supreme Court Justice.''\n  These were words quoted in today's editorial in the Washington Post \nentitled, ``Words That Will Haunt.'' I guess what concerns me is you \ncan be an excellent lawyer, you can be a thoughtful mainstream judge \nwho may make a fine Supreme Court Justice, and yet because of the \noutside groups that demand allegiance to their positions that do not \nrepresent the mainstream of America, do not represent rational thought \nbut, rather, the triumph over partisanship and special interest groups \nover the public interest, what worries me so much is that they seem to \nhave such undue influence on the decisionmaking process of some Members \nwhen it comes to judicial confirmations.\n  Indeed, I believe it was because of the interest groups that we had \nseveral years of near meltdown when it came to the unprecedented use of \nthe filibuster to block a simple up-or-down vote on the President's \nnominees, something that had never happened before that time in the 200 \nyears of the history of the Senate, and particularly when it came to \njudicial confirmation votes.\n  I do want to address some of the concerns the distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Leahy, raised because I do have a different view. \nUnfortunately, the formula that seems to be creating the theme here of \nconsultation, questions, and documents is one that was foreshadowed in \nearlier news stories that said this was the strategy the outside groups \nwere going to use in an attempt to defeat this nomination.\n  By that I mean--first on consultation--I know Senator Leahy said he \ndid not think consultation was adequate, but there was unprecedented \nconsultation by the White House with Senators about the nomination, \nsomething that had never before occurred.\n\n[[Page S10254]]\n\nThe President listened to ideas of Senators on both sides of the aisle \nabout the type of person and individual he should nominate to the \nSupreme Court.\n  Ultimately, though, the Constitution provides the authority to choose \nto the President and the President alone. The Constitution does not \ncontemplate the Senate being cochoosers of the nominee but, rather, the \nPresident making that choice and then the Senate providing advice and \nconsent during this judicial confirmation process, ultimately leading \nup to an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  I am a little disappointed that in spite of this attempt to reach out \nmore than halfway to the Senate, and particularly the minority in the \nSenate on consultation, the President's good efforts have been rejected \nas inadequate. But I don't see how any reasonable outside observer \ncould reach that conclusion.\n  Second, the issue of questions. What kind of questions should a \nnominee answer? The standard for this was set in the early 1990s by \nRuth Bader Ginsburg who was nominated by President Clinton and \nconfirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court. While she was willing to talk \nabout things she had written in the past, it was clear that she was \ngoing to draw a very important line in terms of sending signals or \nprejudging cases or issues that were likely to come back before the \nCourt. It was using that same standard observed by not only Judge \nGinsburg but Judge Breyer, who was confirmed after her--also a Clinton \nnominee--Thurgood Marshall, Sandra Day O'Connor, or William Rehnquist \nin his confirmation proceeding.\n  It is clear, as Judge Roberts said, that there is an ethical line \nthat judges cannot cross, one of which is set by the American Bar \nAssociation Model Code on Judicial Ethics. It says clearly, in \nconfirmation proceedings--I asked Judge Roberts during the Senate \nJudiciary Committee hearings--that applies to judicial confirmation \nhearings. So it would have been unethical to cross the line. And \nnow some Senators insist Judge Roberts should have crossed the line \nwhen it came to answering certain types of questions that would ask him \nto prejudge certain issues and cases.\n\n  But there is also a constitutional standard because the independence \nof the judiciary is a core value of our form of government and of the \nAmerican people. Who could feel that a judge was truly independent and \nfair who has already stated in a confirmation hearing how he would rule \non an issue that later comes before the Supreme Court? Everyone \nrecognizes that is not fair, that is not an independent judiciary. So I \nbelieve the judge drew an appropriate line from that standpoint as \nwell.\n  Finally, there is the third prong of this three-prong attack laid out \nby the special interest groups long before Judge Roberts was even \nnominated and has to do with the documents issue. This has to do with \ndocuments prepared by the Solicitor General's Office as it prepared to \nrepresent the United States in the Supreme Court.\n  I asked Judge Roberts whether that sort of ability to have candid and \nconfidential communications among the lawyers who are representing the \nUnited States was part of a recognized privilege that all lawyers and \nclients share, whether it is the Government or whether it is \nindividuals, and he said it was.\n  In fact, a number of Senators on our Judiciary Committee were quite \nupset last year when it appears confidential documents written by their \ncommittee lawyer to those Senators were then published in the outside \nworld, claiming their rights had been violated. If the Senators are \nentitled to have confidential communication from our own lawyers and \nour own staff without having it published in the outside world, then \nsurely the President of the United States enjoys that same right and \nprivilege.\n  This nominee has withstood in admirable form more than 20 hours of \nquestions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. There were 32 \nwitnesses who testified after he did, including the American Bar \nAssociation which has given him an A plus, so to speak, that considered \nhim unanimously to be well qualified for this position. In the end, \nthough, this nominee is probably better known to the Senate and the \nSenate Judiciary Committee than any nominee in recent history, having \nonly 2 years ago been confirmed by unanimous consent to the District of \nColumbia Court of Appeals, what some have called the second highest \ncourt in the land.\n  I ask my colleagues who are bound and determined to vote against this \nnominee who, by most accounts, is one of the most impressive nominees \nand outstanding nominees who has ever been nominated to the Supreme \nCourt, is there any nominee of this President for whom they could vote? \nI fear the answer to that is no, that for some of our colleagues, there \nis no nominee by this President to the U.S. Supreme Court for whom they \ncould ever vote.\n  That should sadden and disappoint all of us because what it means is \nthat the bitter partisan divisions that separate us in this body far \ntoo often and distract us from the important work we have been sent \nhere by our constituents to do have triumphed over the constitutional \nobligation to provide advice and consent and to conduct our ourselves \nwith civility and dignity and to resist the pressures of interest \ngroups who cry out for the political scalp of not just this President \nbut all of his nominees and discourage good men and women from being \nwilling to answer the call to public service. If they know they are \ngetting ready to be put through a sausage grinder, if they know \neverything they did and said would be examined and distorted even and \nin the end that the merit of their nomination would play second fiddle \nto bitter partisan politics, I fear there are good men and women who \nwould like to answer the call to public service who will simply say no.\n  I am looking forward on Thursday to the Senate Judiciary Committee \nvoting Judge Roberts out of the committee and his nomination coming to \nthe floor. I hope our colleagues will study his background, the record \ncreated before the Judiciary Committee, and come to their own decision, \nwithout regard to politics, without regard to partisanship, and judge \nit solely on the merits. But particularly it is my earnest hope and \nplea they resist the cry of the outside special interest groups who \ncare nothing about good government but only about their narrow special \ninterests and are using these nominations, more than anything, to raise \nmoney by scaring people and by distorting the qualifications and \ncredentials of good men and women such as John Roberts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 245 submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 245) recognizing the life and \n     accomplishments of Simon Wiesenthal.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nwho dedicated himself to preserving the memory of the millions who \nperished in the Holocaust and to promoting human rights and preventing \ngenocide.\n  Simon Wiesenthal lived through unimaginable tragedy and horror as a \nprisoner in Nazi concentration camps\n\n[[Page S10255]]\n\nduring World War II. He survived the Holocaust and spent the next 60 \nyears of his life tracking down the war criminals who had perpetrated \nterrible atrocities.\n  During the course of World War II, Simon Wiesenthal spent 4 years in \na series of 12 concentration camps. He was a prisoner in the Mauthausen \ncamp when it was liberated by the U.S. Army on May 5, 1945.\n  COL Richard Seibel who led the troops in liberating the camp \ndescribed the horror that they found in a report to his superiors:\n\n       Mauthausen did exist. Man's inhumanity to man did exist. \n     The world must not be allowed to forget the depths to which \n     mankind can sink, lest it should happen again.\n\n  Mr. Wiesenthal and his wife Cyla had been separated by the war but \nwere reunited shortly after it ended. Between the 2 of them, 89 family \nmembers were killed.\n  They decided to start a family of their own and in 1946 had a \ndaughter, Paulinka, who went on to have children and grandchildren of \nher own.\n  Also following the war, Mr. Wiesenthal went to work for the War \nCrimes Office run by the Americans. This was just the start to a \nlifelong mission to bring Nazi war criminals to justice.\n  He opened his own Historical Documentation Center to collect \ninformation on war criminals that was used to search them out and \nprosecute them for their heinous crimes. The evidence collected at the \ndocumentation center was used in prosecutions at the International \nMilitary Tribunal in Nuremberg in 1945 and 1946.\n  Credited with hunting down 1,100 major and minor Nazi war criminals \nsince the end of World War II, Mr. Wiesenthal is most renowned for his \nrole in the capture of Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann engineered Adolf \nHitler's ``Final Solution of the Jewish Problem'' that led to the \nextermination of 6 million Jews as well as millions of non-Jews.\n  Eichmann was captured by Israeli agents in Argentina in 1960. \nObserved at trial in 1961, Mr. Wiesenthal later described his \nimpression of Eichmann:\n\n       In my mind I had built up the image of a demonic superman. \n     Instead I saw a frail, nondescript, shabby fellow in a glass \n     cell between two Israeli policement; they looked more \n     colorful and interesting than he did. There was nothing \n     demonic about him; he looked like a bookkeeper who was afraid \n     to ask for a raise.\n\n  I am privileged to say that I did personally know Simon Wiesenthal. I \nreceived him in my home to raise money for the Wiesenthal Center in Los \nAngeles. I also met with him in Vienna where I saw his small, cramped \noffice and voluminous files.\n  He was one of the most amazing people; he stayed the course, never \ngave up, and was the greatest Nazi hunter of our time.\n  Dedicated in 1977 to all of the 11 million people of different \nnationalities, races, and creeds who died in the Holocaust, the Simon \nWiesenthal Center in Los Angeles promotes tolerance and understanding \nthrough community involvement, educational outreach and social action, \nand confronts important issues such as racism, anti-Semitism, \nterrorism, and genocide.\n  The center's founder and dean, Rabbi Marvin Hier said the following \nabout Simon Wiesenthal's legacy:\n\n       I think he'll be remembered as the conscience of the \n     Holocaust. In a way he became the permanent representative of \n     the victims of the Holocaust, determined to bring the \n     perpetrators of the greatest crime to justice.\n\n  We have lost a leading voice for raising awareness and understanding \nof the Holocaust. It is imperative that his legacy and dedication to \nthe millions who were killed because of their religion, race or \nnationality be remembered. We must do all that we can to ensure that \nhuman atrocities like this never happen again.\n  Let me conclude with Mr. Wiesenthal's own words:\n\n       When history looks back, I want people to know that the \n     Nazis weren't able to kill millions of people and get away \n     with it. . . . If we pardon this genocide, it will be \n     repeated, and not only on Jews. If we don't learn this \n     lesson, then millions died for nothing.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today the world has lost one of the great \ncrusaders for justice, Simon Wiesenthal. After suffering through many \nNazi death camps, he emerged from the war with a mission to bring the \narchitects of the Holocaust and their collaborators to account for \ntheir crimes. Later in life his work was valuable for establishing the \nfacts of the Holocaust and keeping the memory of the suffering of the \nvictims of the Holocaust alive. Simon Wiesenthal was a valuable voice \nof conscience when many around the world wanted to ignore these \nhorrible crimes and forget this awful period of the 20th century.\n  A successful Ukrainian architect before the war, when the Nazis \ninvaded the Soviet Union, he was rounded up with his family and \nnarrowly escaped death. He would spend the rest of the war in a variety \nof death and work camps. After the war he was eager to work with the \nAmericans to bring Nazis and their collaborators to justice for their \nwar crimes during the Holocaust. When the Allies seemed to tire of \nbringing former members of the Third Reich to justice, Simon Wiesenthal \ncontinued his work on his own, painstakingly researching and \nidentifying members of the Gestapo and SS.\n  He may be most famously known as the man who found Adolf Eichmann, \nthe organizer of Hitler's campaign to eradicate the Jews. Bringing \nEichmann to justice was no doubt the most high profile of his \nsuccesses, and he was able to use that spotlight to help him find and \nferret out more criminals. In all he was involved in over 1,100 cases \ninvolving Nazi war criminals.\n  Mr. Wiesenthal did more than just round up the perpetrators of the \nmost notorious mass killing in history. He also used his name \nrecognition to fight against rising anti-Semitism in Europe and around \nthe world. He sounded the alarm over rising neo-Nazi movements, and \nfought against their malicious influence. His work documenting the \nHolocaust and the testimony of survivors was ground breaking and has \nformed am important part of what we know about that tragic period and \nthe people who survived it.\n  Mr. Wiesenthal has been seen as an important voice of justice, \nforcing the world to face a difficult reality about the evil in humans. \nHis work laid bare the worst that man is capable of, but it also showed \nthe importance of justice and the power of the human spirit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today we mourn the passing of a great man \nwhose name has become synonymous with the pursuit of justice, Simon \nWiesenthal. Mr. Wiesenthal dedicated his life to finding and \nprosecuting Nazi war criminals, and he was extraordinarily successful \nat doing so. He was a passionate, courageous man waging an often lonely \nyet critical fight.\n  Born 96 years ago in what is now the Ukraine, Mr. Wiesenthal barely \nsurvived the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust, emerging from a \nconcentration camp at the end of the war weighing less than 100 pounds. \nThough the Nazis had not succeeded in taking his life, he had lost 89 \nmembers of his family.\n  Simon Wiesenthal took this incomprehensible grief and turned it into \naction, embarking on a lifelong quest to find Nazi war criminals and \nsecure justice for their victims. He had already begun this work in the \nconcentration camps, committing to memory details of his captors. After \nthe war, he worked first for the U.S. Army's War Crimes Office and then \nopened the Jewish Historical Documentation Center in Linz, Austria in \n1947, to continue that work on his own. The Center later moved to \nVienna, where Mr. Wiesenthal worked every day in a small office \nbuilding, surrounded by files, meticulously documenting and tracking \nthe guilty. He worked in that office until last year, when his health \nwould no longer permit it.\n  In his most prominent success, information from Wiesenthal led \nIsraeli agents to capture Adolf Eichmann, the architect of Hitler's \nextermination campaign, in Argentina in 1960. Wisenthal's other high-\nprofile arrests include Anne Frank's captor, Karl Silberbauer, and the \ncommandant of the Treblinka and Sobibor camps, Franz Stangl. The vast \nmajority of his work, though, was pursuing lesser-known and unknown \nNazis and demanding accountability for their roles. In all, he is \ncredited with bringing more than 1,100 Nazi war criminals to justice.\n  Those prosecutions not only brought punishment to the guilty but also \naffirmed to the world that justice, even when delayed, must always be \ndone.\n\n[[Page S10256]]\n\n  As we honor and thank Mr. Wiesenthal for the results of his work, we \nowe him a special debt for the way he went about that work. Despite his \npersonal tragedy and despite the staggering scale of the atrocities, \nMr. Wiesenthal sought, as he said, ``justice, not revenge.'' He broke \nthe cycle of hate and elevated us all. Indeed, one of his strongest \nhopes was that his work would help us to rise above our history. As he \nsaid:\n\n       The history of man is the history of crimes, and history \n     can repeat. So information is a defense. Through this we can \n     build, we must build, a defense against repetition.\n\n  The 11 million victims of the Holocaust had no finer, more dedicated, \nmore capable advocate than Simon Wiesenthal. The living had no finer \nexample of a hero. Our only solace in his passing is that the 11 \nmillion Simon Wiesenthal spoke for can finally say to him today: \n``Thank you for remembering us.''\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Simon Wiesenthal, a \nremarkable man, a Holocaust survivor, who dedicated his life to the \npursuit of justice and worked to prevent anti-Semitism and prejudice of \nall kinds.\n  After surviving imprisonment at five German concentration camps and \nescaping death several times, Mr. Wiesenthal continued to remember the \n6 million people who lost their lives during the Holocaust by working \nto bring over 1,100 war criminals to justice. He pursued justice, not \nrevenge. He demanded public trials, not secret executions.\n  He made sure society would remember those crimes against humanity so \nthat future purveyors of ethnic cleansing would know that they could \nnever escape retribution.\n  Mr. Wiesenthal earned the respect of those throughout the world, \nhaving many honors and awards bestowed upon him. He received \ndecorations from the Austrian and French resistance movements, the \nDutch Freedom Medal, the Luxembourg Freedom Medal, the United Nations \nLeague for the Help of Refugees Award, the French Legion of Honor and \nthe U.S. Congressional Gold Medal which was presented to him by \nPresident James Carter in 1980.\n  Mr. Wiesenthal never questioned giving up his prewar trade of \narchitecture. In a New York Times article in 1964, Mr. Wiesenthal \ndescribed attending Sabbath services with a fellow camp survivor who \nhad become a wealthy jeweler.\n  The man asked why Wiesenthal had not resumed architecture--his prewar \ntrade--for it would have made him rich.\n  ``You're a religious man,'' Wiesenthal told his friend. ``You believe \nin God and life after death. I also believe.''\n  ``When we come to the other world and meet the millions of Jews who \ndied in the camps and they ask us, `What have you done?' there will be \nmany answers. You will say, `I became a jeweler.' Another will say, `I \nsmuggled coffee and American cigarettes.' Another will say, `I built \nhouses.'\n  ``But I will say, `I didn't forget you.'''\n  Thank you Mr. Wiesenthal for leaving an indelible mark on society. We \nowe you a debt of gratitude, and we will never forget you.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record, without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 245) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 245\n\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal was born on December 31, 1908, to \n     Jewish merchants in Buczacz, in what is now the Lvov Oblast \n     section of the Ukraine;\n       Whereas after he was denied admission to the Polytechnic \n     Institute in Lvov because of quota restrictions on Jewish \n     students, Simon Wiesenthal received his degree in engineering \n     from the Technical University of Prague in 1932;\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal worked in an architectural office \n     until he was forced to close his business and become a \n     mechanic in a bedspring factory, following the Russian army's \n     occupation of Lvov and purge of Jewish professionals;\n       Whereas following the Germany occupation of Ukraine in \n     1941, Simon Wiesenthal was initially detained in the Janwska \n     concentration camp near Lvov, after which he and his wife \n     were assigned to the forced labor camp serving the Ostbahn \n     Works, which was the repair shop for Lvov's Eastern Railroad;\n       Whereas in August of 1942, Simon Wiesenthal's mother was \n     sent to the Belzec death camp as part of Nazi Germany's \n     ``Final Solution'', and by the end of the next month 89 of \n     his relatives had been killed;\n       Whereas with the help of the Polish Underground Simon \n     Wiesenthal was able to help his wife escape the Ostbahn camp \n     in 1942, and in 1943 was himself able to escape just before \n     German guards began executing inmates, but he was recaptured \n     the following year and sent to the Janwska camp;\n       Whereas following the collapse of the German eastern front, \n     the SS guards at Janwska took Simon Wiesenthal and the \n     remaining camp survivors and joined the westward retreat from \n     approaching Russian forces;\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal was 1 of the few survivors of the \n     retreat to Mauthausen, Austria and was on the brink of death, \n     weighing only 99 pounds, when Mauthausen was liberated by \n     American forces on May 5, 1945;\n       Whereas after surviving 12 Nazi prison camps, including 5 \n     death camps, Wiesenthal chose not to return to his previous \n     occupation, and instead dedicated himself to finding Nazi war \n     criminals and bringing them to justice;\n       Whereas following the liberation of Mauthausen, Simon \n     Wiesenthal began collecting evidence of Nazi activity for the \n     War Crimes Section of the United States Army, and after the \n     war continued these efforts for the Army's Office of \n     Strategic Services and Counter-Intelligence Corps;\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal would also go on to head the \n     Jewish Central Committee of the United States Zone of \n     Austria, a relief and welfare organization;\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal and his wife were reunited in \n     1945, and had a daughter the next year;\n       Whereas the evidence supplied by Wiesenthal was utilized in \n     the United States Zone war crime trials;\n       Whereas, after concluding his work with the United States \n     Army in 1947, Simon Wiesenthal and others opened and operated \n     the Jewish Historical Documentation Center in Linz, Austria, \n     for the purpose of assembling evidence for future Nazi \n     trials, before closing the office and providing its files to \n     the Yad Vashem Archives in Israel in 1954;\n       Whereas despite his heavy involvement in relief work and \n     occupational education for Soviet refugees, Simon Wiesenthal \n     tenaciously continued his pursuit of Adolf Eichmann, who had \n     served as the head of the Gestapo's Jewish Department and \n     supervised the implementation of the ``Final Solution'';\n       Whereas in 1953, Simon Wiesenthal acquired evidence that \n     Adolf Eichmann was living in Argentina and passed this \n     information to the Government of Israel;\n       Whereas this information, coupled with information about \n     Eichmann's whereabouts in Argentina provided to Israel by \n     Germany in 1959, led to Eichmann's capture by Israeli agents, \n     trial and conviction in Israel, and execution on May 31, \n     1961;\n       Whereas following Eichmann's capture, Wiesenthal opened a \n     new Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna, Austria, for the \n     purpose of collecting and analyzing information to aid in the \n     location and apprehension of war criminals;\n       Whereas Karl Silberbauer, the Gestapo officer who arrested \n     Anne Frank, Franz Stangl, the commandant of the Treblinka and \n     Sobibor concentration camps in Poland, and Hermine \n     Braunsteiner, who had supervised the killings of several \n     hundred children at Majdanek, are among the approximately \n     1,100 war criminals found and brought to justice as a result \n     of Simon Wiesenthal's investigative, analytical, and \n     undercover operations;\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal bravely forged ahead with his \n     mission of promoting tolerance and justice in the face of \n     danger and resistance, including numerous threats and the \n     bombing of his home in 1982;\n       Whereas the Simon Wiesenthal Center was established in \n     1977, to focus on the prosecution of Nazi war criminals, \n     commemorate the events of the Holocaust, teach tolerance \n     education, and promote Middle East affairs;\n       Whereas the Simon Wiesenthal Center monitors and combats \n     the growth of neo-Nazi activity in Europe and keeps watch \n     over concentration camp sites to ensure that the memory of \n     the Holocaust and the sanctity of those sites are preserved;\n       Whereas the Simon Wiesenthal Center played a pivotal role \n     in convincing foreign governments to pass laws enabling the \n     prosecution of Nazi war criminals;\n       Whereas throughout his lifetime, Simon Wiesenthal has had \n     many honors and awards bestowed upon him, including \n     decorations from the Austrian and French resistance \n     movements, the Dutch Freedom Medal, the Luxembourg Freedom \n     Medal, the United Nations League for the Help of Refugees \n     Award, the French Legion of Honor, and the United States \n     Congressional Gold Medal, which was presented to him by \n     President James Carter in 1980;\n       Whereas President Ronald W. Reagan once remarked, ``For \n     what Simon Wiesenthal represents are the animating principles \n     of Western civilization since the day Moses came down from \n     Sinai: the idea of justice, the idea of laws, the idea of the \n     free will.'';\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\n       Whereas President George H. W. Bush has stated that Simon \n     Wiesenthal, ``is our living embodiment of remembrance. The \n     two pledges of Simon Wiesenthal's life inspire us all -- \n     `Never forget' and `Never again'.'';\n       Whereas President William Clinton has remarked of Simon \n     Wiesenthal, ``To those who know his story, one of miraculous \n     survival and of relentless pursuit of justice, the answer is \n     apparent. From the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust, \n     only a few voices survived, to bear witness, to hold the \n     guilty accountable, to honor the memory of those who were \n     killed. Only if we heed these brave voices can we build a \n     bulwark of humanity against the hatred and indifference that \n     is still all too prevalent in this world of ours.''; and\n       Whereas, at the end of a life dedicated to the pursuit of \n     justice and advocacy for victims of the Holocaust, Simon \n     Wiesenthal passed away on September 20, 2005, at the age of \n     96: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its most sincere condolences to the family \n     and friends of Simon Wiesenthal;\n       (2) recognizes the life and accomplishments of Simon \n     Wiesenthal, who, after surviving the Holocaust, spent more \n     than 50 years helping to bring Nazi war criminals to justice \n     and was a vigorous opponent of anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism, and \n     racism; and\n       (3) recognizes and commends Simon Wiesenthal's legacy of \n     promoting tolerance, his tireless efforts to bring about \n     justice, and the continuing pursuit of these ideals.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10257-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10257-S10258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   IRAN NONPROLIFERATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations be discharged from further consideration \nof S. 1713, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1713) to make amendments to the Nonproliferation \n     Act of 2000 related to International Space Station payments.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on September 15 I introduced a bill to \namend the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000, Public Law 106-178. The \nbill, S. 1713, provides authority for the administration to continue to \ncooperate with the Russian Federation on the International Space \nStation.\n  Current law prohibits certain payments from being made to Russia. \nWhen Congress enacted the Iran Nonproliferation Act, INPA, it did so to \nprovide the President with a means to address proliferation of \nballistic missile-related and other dangerous dual-use technology to \nIran. Congress passed and the President signed legislation designed to \ngive the executive branch additional tools with which to address \nRussian proliferation and the proliferation of other countries that are \ntransferring dangerous weapons technology to Iran. The legislation was \nalso meant to enhance significantly the ability of Congress to monitor \nproliferation to Iran and oversee executive efforts to combat it.\n  With regard to Russia, at the time of its enactment, the rationale \nfor INPA restrictions on payments to Russia for cooperation on the \nInternational Space Station was that the Russian Aviation and Space \nAgency, RASA, could use any legal or operational authority it may have \nhad over certain organizations and entities that might be proliferating \nto Iran to stop such activities.\n  I continue to believe that Russia must prevent proliferation to Iran \nof weapons of mass destruction, their means of delivery and the \ntechnical know-how to make them.\n  The bill I introduced last week does not condone the proliferation \nactivities of Russian entities nor those of others proliferating to \nIran. It does allow the United States to meet its obligations under the \nAgreement Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space \nStation. While it creates an exception for certain U.S. payments to \nRussia in support of the space station, it also mandates that Congress \nbe kept aware of the specific Russian entities to which the United \nStates makes payments, and that the President determine that such \npayments are not prejudicial to our nonproliferation policies with \nrespect to cruise and ballistic missile proliferation to Iran or other \nstate sponsors of terrorism.\n  Since the introduction of S. 1713, a question has arisen as to which \nagreements might be negotiated under its authority that could, in fact, \nobligate the United States to make payments beyond the date specified \nin section 3 of that bill. It is my intention that no payments may be \nmade after January 1, 2012. Also, I understand that NASA intends to \naccelerate its crew exploration vehicle, CEV, program so as to avoid \nany complications that might arise as a result of continued U.S. \nutilization of Russian-provided technology during the period between \nthe shuttle's retirement and the CEV becoming operational.\n  I want to thank all my colleagues for their cooperative consideration \nof this bill. I urge the Senate to pass S. 1713.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1713) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1713\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Nonproliferation \n     Amendments Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Director of Central Intelligence's most recent \n     Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of \n     Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and \n     Advanced Conventional Munitions, 1 July Through 31 December \n     2003, states ``Russian entities during the reporting period \n     continued to supply a variety of ballistic missile-related \n     goods and technical know-how to countries such as Iran, \n     India, and China. Iran's earlier success in gaining \n     technology and materials from Russian entities helped \n     accelerate Iranian development of the Shahab-3 MRBM, and \n     continuing Russian entity assistance has supported Iranian \n     efforts to develop new missiles and increase Tehran's self-\n     sufficiency in missile production.''\n       (2) Vice Admiral Lowell E. Jacoby, the Director of the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency, stated in testimony before the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate on February \n     16, 2005, that ``Tehran probably will have the ability to \n     produce nuclear weapons early in the next decade''.\n       (3) Iran has--\n       (A) failed to act in accordance with the Agreement Between \n     Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the \n     Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on \n     the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Vienna June \n     19, 1973 (commonly referred to as the ``Safeguards \n     Agreement'');\n       (B) acted in a manner inconsistent with the Protocol \n     Additional to the Agreement Between Iran and the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of \n     Safeguards, signed at Vienna December 18, 2003 (commonly \n     referred to as the ``Additional Protocol'');\n       (C) acted in a manner inconsistent with its obligations \n     under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and \n     entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''); and\n       (D) resumed uranium enrichment activities, thus ending the \n     confidence building measures it adopted in its November 2003 \n     agreement with the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, \n     France, and Germany.\n       (4) The executive branch has on multiple occasions used the \n     authority provided under section 3 of the Iran \n     Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-178; 50 U.S.C. \n     1701 note) to impose sanctions on entities that have engaged \n     in activities in violation of restrictions in the Act \n     relating to--\n       (A) the export of equipment and technology controlled under \n     multilateral export control lists, including under the \n     Australia Group, Chemical Weapons Convention, Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, and the \n     Wassenaar Arrangement or otherwise having the potential to \n     make a material contribution to the development of weapons of \n     mass destruction or cruise or ballistic missile systems to \n     Iran; and\n       (B) the export of other items to Iran with the potential of \n     making a material contribution to Iran's weapons of mass \n     destruction programs or on United States national control \n     lists for reasons related to the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction or missiles.\n       (5) The executive branch has never made a determination \n     pursuant to section 6(b) of the Iran Nonproliferation Act of \n     2000 that--\n       (A) it is the policy of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation to oppose the proliferation to Iran of weapons of \n     mass destruction and missile systems capable of delivering \n     such weapons;\n       (B) the Government of the Russian Federation (including the \n     law enforcement, export promotion, export control, and \n     intelligence agencies of such government) has demonstrated \n     and continues to demonstrate a\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\n     sustained commitment to seek out and prevent the transfer to \n     Iran of goods, services, and technology that could make a \n     material contribution to the development of nuclear, \n     biological, or chemical weapons, or of ballistic or cruise \n     missile systems; and\n       (C) no entity under the jurisdiction or control of the \n     Government of the Russian Federation, has, during the 1-year \n     period prior to the date of the determination pursuant to \n     section 6(b) of such Act, made transfers to Iran reportable \n     under section 2(a) of the Act.\n       (6) On June 29, 2005, President George W. Bush issued \n     Executive Order 13382 blocking property of weapons of mass \n     destruction proliferators and their supporters, and used the \n     authority of such order against 4 Iranian entities, Aerospace \n     Industries Organization, Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, \n     Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group, and the Atomic Energy \n     Organization of Iran, that have engaged, or attempted to \n     engage, in activities or transactions that have materially \n     contributed to, or pose a risk of materially contributing to, \n     the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their \n     means of delivery (including missiles capable of delivering \n     such weapons), including efforts to manufacture, acquire, \n     possess, develop, transport, transfer, or use such items.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, our Founders proclaimed the bedrock \nprinciple that we are all created equal. But everyone knows that when \nwe started, the reality was far different. For more than two centuries, \nwe have struggled, sometimes spilling precious blood, to fulfill that \nunique American promise. The goals, the principles, and the sacrifices \nof millions of Americans breathed an ever-fuller life into our \nconstitutional ideals.\n  The Constitution itself has been the inspiration for this march of \nprogress. The open-ended principles that our Founders had the wisdom to \nbequeath us have acquired ever-deepening meaning over the years--a \nremarkably steady movement toward greater protection for individual \nrights and liberties, and an increasing assurance that governments at \nall levels have the authority to defend ordinary Americans from \noverreaching by those who would discriminate against them or exploit \nthem.\n  We have made much progress. But our work is not finished, and we \nstill look to our elected representatives and our independent courts to \nuphold those founding principles in each new generation, to continue \nthe great march of progress, to never turn back and never give up our \nhard-won gains.\n  This was the basic issue in our hearings on the nomination of John \nRoberts to become our next Chief Justice. Would he bring to that high \noffice the values and ideals that would enable our struggle for \nequality and opportunity for all to continue, or would he stand in the \nway?\n  The only records made available to us were those of John Roberts as \nan aggressive activist in the Reagan administration, eager to limit \nbasic values that we have achieved at great cost and sacrifice over the \nyears, especially in basic areas such as voting rights, women's rights, \ncivil rights, and disability rights. He is an outstanding lawyer who \nsays he could represent clients on any side of a question. As \nCongressman John Lewis eloquently stated in our hearings, 25 years ago, \nJohn Roberts was on the wrong side of the Nation's struggle to achieve \ngenuine equality of opportunity for all Americans. Now, we need to know \nwhich side he is on today. We need to know that as Chief Justice of the \nUnited States, his sole client would be all the American people.\n  John Roberts is a highly intelligent nominee. He has argued 39 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court and won more than half of them. He is adept at \nturning questions on their head while giving seemingly appropriate \nanswers. These skills served him well as a Supreme Court advocate. \nThese same skills, however, did not contribute to a reasonable \nconfirmation process. At the end of the 4 days of hearings, we still \nknow very little more than we knew when we started.\n  In answer to another question about his views, he stated again:\n\n       I will confront issues in this area as I would confront \n     issues in any area, . . . and that would be to fully and \n     fairly consider the arguments presented and decide them \n     according to the rule of law.\n\n  In yet another instance, he proclaimed:\n\n       The responsibility of the judicial branch is to decide \n     particular cases that are presented to them in this area \n     according to the rule of law.\n\n  And again:\n\n       I became a lawyer or at least developed as a lawyer because \n     I believe in the rule of law.\n\n  The rule of law--everyone in the Senate agrees with that. In fact, we \nhave each taken an oath of office to protect and defend the \nConstitution, and we take that oath seriously. But it reveals little \nabout how we will vote on the important questions of the day, and what \nvalues and ideals we bring to our decisions.\n  Judge Roberts said that a judge should be like an umpire, calling the \nballs and strikes but not making the rules.\n  But we all know that with any umpire, the call may depend on your \npoint of view. An instant replay from another angle can show a very \ndifferent result. Umpires follow the rules of the game. But in critical \ncases, it may depend on where they are standing when they make the \ncall.\n  The same holds true of judges.\n  As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously stated:\n\n       The life of the law has not been logic; it has been \n     experience.\n\n  As Justice Stephen Breyer offered in his confirmation hearing:\n\n       I always think law requires both a heart and a head. If you \n     do not have a heart, it becomes a sterile set of rules, \n     removed from human problems, and it will not help. If you do \n     not have a head, there is the risk that in trying to decide a \n     particular person's problem in a case that may look fine for \n     that person, you cause trouble for a lot of other people, \n     making their lives yet worse.\n\n  The rule of law is not some mathematical formula for meting out \njustice. It is our values and ideals that give it real meaning in the \ncase of the Constitution, not our personal values and ideals but our \nvalues and ideals, derived from the meaning of the constitutional text.\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\n  We all believe in the rule of law. But that is just the beginning of \nthe conversation when it comes to the meaning of the Constitution. The \nConstitution of Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas is a very different \ndocument from the Constitution of Justice Stevens and Justice Souter. \nEveryone follows the same text. That is the rule of law. But the \nmeaning of the text is often imprecise. You must examine the intent of \nthe Framers, the history, and the current reality. And this examination \nwill lead to very different outcomes depending on each Justice's \nconstitutional world view. Is it a full and generous view of our rights \nand liberties and of government power to protect the people, or a \nnarrow and cramped view of those rights and liberties and the \ngovernment's power to protect ordinary Americans?\n  Based on the record available, there is clear and convincing evidence \nthat Judge Roberts' view of the rule of law would narrow the protection \nof basic voting rights. The values and perspectives displayed over and \nover again in his record cast large doubts on his view of the validity \nof laws that remove barriers to equal opportunity for women, \nminorities, and the disabled. His record raises serious questions about \nthe power of Congress to pass laws to protect citizens in matters that \nthey care about.\n  In fact, there is nothing in the record to indicate otherwise. For \nall the hoopla and all the razzle-dazzle, the record is no different in \nits bedrock substance than it was the day the hearings started.\n  When Senator Kohl and others asked Judge Roberts whether he would \ndisavow any of the positions he took over the years, he refused to do \nso. On the first day of the hearing, Senator Kohl asked, ``Which of \nthose positions were you supportive of, or are you still supportive of, \nand which would you disavow?'' in order to try to determine what his \nviews are today. Judge Roberts never provided a clear response.\n  In the area of voting rights, he has a long and detailed record of \nstrong opposition to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which is \nwidely acknowledged by scholars and civil rights experts to be one of \nthe most powerful and effective civil rights laws ever enacted. It \noutlaws voting practices that deny or dilute the right to vote based on \nrace, national origin, or language minority status--and is largely \nuncontroversial today. Before it was passed, there had not been a \nsingle African American elected since Reconstruction from seven of the \nSouthern States with the greatest of African-American populations.\n  But in 1981 and 1982, Judge Roberts was one of a small group of \nattorneys in the Justice Department urging the administration to oppose \na strong section 2, which allowed discrimination to be proved by \ndemonstrating its results, not just its intent. Although Judge Roberts \nsought to characterize his opposition to this critical amendment as \nsimply following the policy of the Reagan administration, the dozens of \nmemos he wrote on this subject show that he personally believed the \nadministration was right to oppose the ``effects test.''\n  In fact, he pressed to keep others from changing their minds about \nopposing the law. When the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil \nRights Division Brad Reynolds raised concerns about sending the Senate \na letter on this issue, John Roberts urged the Attorney General to send \nit, stating that ``my own view is that something must be done to \neducate the Senators on the seriousness of this problem. . . .'' Of \ncourse, the problem he saw was the amendment, not the discrimination it \nwas designed to end.\n\n  He also urged the Attorney General to assert his leadership against \nthe amendment to section 2. He wrote that the Attorney General should \n``head off any retrenchment efforts'' by the White House staff who were \ninclined to support the amendment. He consistently urged the \nadministration to require voters to bear the heavy burden of proving \ndiscriminatory intent in order to overturn practices that locked them \nout of the electoral process.\n  Judge Roberts clearly knew that his position would make it harder for \nvoters to overturn restrictive voting laws. As he wrote at the time, \n``violations of section 2 should not be made too easy to prove. . . .'' \nThat was his quote, remember, when he wrote this there were no African \nAmericans elected to Congress from the States with the largest Black \npopulations, and only 18 in Congress overall. And there were only 6 \nLatinos in Congress. There is no indication in any of his writings on \nthe Voting Rights Act that he was the least bit troubled by this \nobvious discrimination.\n  The year after section 2 was signed into law, Judge Roberts wrote in \na memo to the White House counsel that ``we were burned'' by the Voting \nRights Act legislation, even though it was signed by President Ronald \nReagan.\n  Given his clear record of hostility to this key voting rights \nprotection, the public has a right to know if he still holds these \nviews. But Judge Roberts gave us hardly a clue.\n  When I asked him if he holds these views today, he refused to answer. \nHe repeatedly tried to characterize his views as the views of the \nadministration. He declined to say whether he agreed with them--then or \nnow. That answer strains credibility, when the memos themselves \ndeclare: ``my own view is that something must be done. . . .''\n  In fairness, he did concede that he no longer believes that section 2 \nis, to use his words from the 1980s, ``constitutionally suspect.'' But \nthe fact that it took almost 20 minutes for him to provide this obvious \nanswer to a straightforward yes-or-no question is not reassuring.\n  Both Senator Feingold and I tried to find out whether he came to \nagree with the strengthened Voting Rights Act after President Reagan \nsigned it into law.\n  Even when Senator Feingold asked whether Judge Roberts would \nacknowledge today that he had been wrong to oppose the effects test, he \nrefused to give a yes-or-no answer.\n  Senator Feingold asked:\n\n       What I'm trying to figure out is, given the fact that \n     you've followed this issue for such a long time, I would \n     think you would have a view at this point about . . . whether \n     the department was right in seeking to keep the intent test \n     or whether time has shown that the effects test is really the \n     more appropriate test.\n\n  Judge Roberts responded:\n\n       I'm certainly not an expert in the area and haven't \n     followed and have no way of evaluating the relative \n     effectiveness of the law as amended or the law as it was \n     prior to 1982.\n\n  So we still don't know whether he supports the basic law against \nvoting practices that result in denying voting rights because of race, \nnational origin, or language minority status.\n  You don't need to be a voting rights expert to say we are better off \ntoday in an America where persons of color can be elected to Congress \nfrom any State in the country, as opposed to the America of 1982, in \nwhich no African American had been elected to Congress since \nReconstruction from Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina, \nSouth Carolina, Virginia, or Louisiana, because restrictive election \nsystems effectively denied African Americans and other minorities the \nequal chance to elect representatives of their choice. In these States, \nAfrican Americans were a third or more of the population, but they were \neffectively blocked from electing any candidate of their choice decade \nafter decade throughout the 20th century.\n  Yet Judge Roberts repeatedly refused to give even this simple \nreassurance about the act. Is that what he means by the rule of law?\n  Another very important area in which Judge Roberts refused to disavow \nhis long history of opposition to civil rights is the prevention of \ndiscrimination by recipients of Federal funds. These laws were adopted \nbecause, Congress believed, as President Kennedy said in 1963, that \n``[s]imple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers . \n. . contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, \nentrenches, subsidizes, or results in . . . discrimination.'' As an \nassistant to Attorney General William French Smith, John Roberts argued \nthat these important laws should be narrowed.\n  In fact, his position was even more extreme than the Reagan \nadministration's. In 1981, he supported a recommendation to exempt \ninstitutions from civil rights laws if the only Federal financial \nassistance they received was in the form of loans to their students. \nUnder this view, the enormous subsidies the Federal Government\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\ngives to colleges and universities in the form of Federal financial aid \nwould not have been enough to require them to obey the laws against \ndiscrimination. Can you imagine that? Those were just the type of \nthings that President Kennedy was addressing. These are the \nuniversities, the colleges that are getting all this help and \nassistance from grants and loans which are essential to the running of \nit. He said oh, no, we are going to have to look at the other \nrequirements. Because they get all these loans, it is still done \nmeaning they have to conform to the nondiscrimination, title XI, the \nwomen, on hiring on race or the disabled. Let me continue.\n  At many private institutions, financial assistance to students was \nthe only form of Federal aid, so Judge Roberts' suggestion would have \nleft those institutions largely free to discriminate against women, the \ndisabled, and minorities in both education and hiring.\n  In fact, Judge Roberts's position was so extreme that it was rejected \nby the Reagan administration and later by the Supreme Court. But in his \ntestimony, Judge Roberts ignored this aspect of his record. He refused \neven to acknowledge that his past positions had gone beyond the \nadministration's. Instead, he stated repeatedly that he was just doing \nhis job.\n  He said:\n\n       I was articulating and defending the administration's \n     position. . . . The position that the administration advanced \n     was the one I just described. The universities were covered \n     due to Federal financial assistance to their students. It \n     extended to the admissions office.\n\n  That is an accurate statement of the administration's position but \nthe view Judge Roberts advanced in his December 8, 1981, memo was quite \ndifferent.\n  I also asked whether he still agreed with the statement he made in \n1985, that ``[t]riggering coverage of an institution on the basis of \nits accepting students who receive Federal aid is not too onerous if \nonly the admissions office is covered. If the entire institution is to \nbe covered, however, it should be on the basis of something more solid \nthan Federal aid to the students.''\n\n  Again and again, Judge Roberts refused to say whether he still agrees \nwith those words. He said only, ``Well, Senator, the administration \npolicy was as I articulated it. And it was my job to articulate the \nadministration policy.''\n  That is no answer at all. I never asked about the policy of the \nReagan administration. I asked only whether today, he still believed, \nor would disavow, his earlier position. Given his repeated refusal to \nanswer, I can only conclude that he still holds those views today, \ngiven his failure to respond.\n  In other words, his position was the following: It really doesn't \nmake a difference, if a university is getting financial aid through \ngrants or through loans, that they can go ahead and discriminate if \nthey are not going to discriminate in the admissions office. So if they \ndo not discriminate in the admissions office, then they can \ndiscriminate in the other areas of the university.\n  That happened to be the holding in the Grove City case. The question \nwas: Was that what the Congress meant when it said we were not going to \nprovide funds and permit any entities to discriminate? The overwhelming \nmajority in the House and the Senate said: That is what we intended. If \nthey are going to get this aid and assistance through college loans and \ngrants, they can't discriminate against women in sports, against hiring \nof black professors or against the disabled, overwhelmingly.\n  Not Judge Roberts, no, no. He wanted it program specific.\n  Say they had 15 in the admissions office, and if they didn't \ndiscriminate based on race, disability or against women, it doesn't \nmake any difference what the rest of the university did.\n  That position was absolutely, completely rejected by the \nadministration and overwhelmingly in a bipartisan way. We asked Judge \nRoberts now what his position still was on this issue, and we could not \nget an answer.\n  In addition, in response to questions from Senator Biden, Judge \nRoberts refused to say he no longer agrees with his former position \nthat laws against discrimination should be narrowly interpreted to \napply only in the parts of the institution that directly receive \nFederal funds. Under this view, a college that received Federal \nfinancial assistance through its admissions office could not \ndiscriminate in admissions, but it could discriminate in every other \naspect of its operations--in hiring teachers, in instructing students, \nand in athletics. When Senator Biden reminded Judge Roberts that he had \nwritten in 1982 that he ``strongly agreed'' with this view, Judge \nRoberts never said he no longer holds that position. Instead he \ntestified under oath, ``So if the view was strongly held, it was \nbecause I thought that was a correct reading of the law.'' Is that his \nview of the rule of law?\n  Another very important area in which Judge Roberts failed to give any \nreassurance was his position protecting women and girls against \ndiscrimination in educational programs under title IX. In the case of \nFranklin v. Gwinnett County, in 1991, Judge Roberts argued that title \nIX did not allow a high school girl who had been sexually abused by her \nteacher to recover damages. Judge Roberts' argument would have left the \nvictim with no remedy at all.\n  Senator Leahy asked him, ``Do you now personally agree with and \naccept as binding law the reasoning of Justice White's opinion in \nFranklin v. Gwinnett?'' Judge Roberts replied that, ``It certainly was \na precedent of the court that I would apply under principles of stare \ndecisis.''\n  That answer sounds reassuring, until you realize that Judge Roberts \nnever answered whether he personally agreed with this unanimous \ndecision of the Court.\n  Senator Leahy offered Judge Roberts several chances to disavow his \nposition in the Franklin case. He asked, ``Do you now accept that \nJustice White's position [in Franklin v. Gwinnett County] was right and \nthe government's position was wrong?'' Judge Roberts replied again, ``I \ncertainly accept the decision of the court--the 9 to 0 decision, as you \nsay--as a binding precedent of the court. Again, I have no cause or \nagenda to revisit it or any quarrel with it.''\n  That also sounded reassuring, until I recalled that Justice Thomas \nrepeatedly used the same words--``I have no quarrel with it''--to evade \nanswers during his nomination hearing. Justice Thomas testified, for \ninstance that he had ``no quarrel'' with the test established by the \nSupreme Court in the Lemon v. Kurzman case for analyzing claims under \nthe first amendment's prohibition on the establishment of religion. But \njust 2 years later, Justice Thomas joined a dissent ridiculing the test \nand saying it should not be applied, and Justice Thomas has \nconsistently opposed the Lemon test ever since.\n  I wonder why it was so difficult for Judge Roberts simply to say, \n``Yes, in hindsight, I personally believe that Franklin v. Gwinnett was \ncorrectly decided, and that victims of intentional sex discrimination \nin educational programs do have a right to relief under title IX.'' Why \nwas that so difficult an answer for Judge Roberts to give? Could it be \nthat it was contrary to his view of the rule of law?\n  Judge Roberts's record is also one of consistent and long-standing \nopposition to affirmative action. In the 1980s, he urged the Reagan \nadministration to oppose affirmative action. In the 1990s, in the \nadministration of the first President Bush, he urged the Supreme Court \nto overturn a Federal affirmative action program. In private practice \nin the late 1990s and as recently as 2001, he litigated cases \nchallenging affirmative action. That includes his repeated challenges \nto the Department of Transportation's disadvantaged business enterprise \nprogram, which has been upheld by every court that has reviewed it, and \nendorsed overwhelmingly by bipartisan majorities in the House and \nSenate.\n  On affirmative action, his view of the rule of law seems to be that \nestablished court precedents have little meaning, even though they have \nbeen found again and again to advance our progress on civil rights.\n  In 1981, he advocated abolishing race- and gender-conscious remedies \nfor discrimination, although he admitted this position was in \n``tension'' with the Supreme Court's opinion in United Steelworkers of \nAmerica v. Weber, upholding affirmative action in employment--a case \nthat had been decided only 2 years earlier. He wrote that the\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\nadministration did not see that opinion--Supreme Court opinion--as a \n``guiding principle.''\n  In the same memos dealing with the Weber decision, Judge Roberts even \nsuggested that the opinion might be overturned because of changes in \nthe Court's composition.\n  Given his long and consistent opposition to affirmative action, \nSenators were entitled to seek some reassurance from the nominee that \nhe would not use the power of the Chief Justice to continue his past \nefforts to end affirmative action.\n  I asked Judge Roberts:\n\n       Do you agree then with Justice O'Connor, writing for the \n     majority, who gave great weight to the real-world impact of \n     affirmative action policies in universities?\n\n  He stated:\n\n       I can certainly say that I do think that that is the \n     appropriate approach, without commenting on the outcome or \n     the judgment in a particular case. But you do need to look at \n     the real-world impact in this area, and I think in other \n     areas as well.\n\n  So he thinks that we should consider real world impact, but he never \nstated whether he agreed with Justice O'Connor that the University of \nMichigan case was correctly decided. On that issue, we don't know any \nmore than we did before the hearing.\n  Senator Feinstein also asked Judge Roberts his views on affirmative \naction, but he avoided her question as well. She asked, Do you \npersonally subscribe, not to quotas, but to measured efforts that can \nwithstand strict scrutiny?'' Judge Roberts replied, ``A measured effort \nthat can withstand strict scrutiny is . . . a very positive approach.'' \nWell, that sounds as though he agrees, but then he also said, ``And I \nthink people will disagree about exactly what the details should be.''\n  When Senator Feinstein stated she specifically wanted to know his \nview of Grutter v. Bollinger, the University of Michigan case upholding \naffirmative action, Judge Roberts gave a long--answer that was no \nanswer at all. ``In the Michigan case, obviously, you have I always \nforget whether it's the law school--but I think the law school program \nwas upheld and the university program was struck down because of the \ndifferences in the program. But efforts to ensure the full \nparticipation in all aspects of our society by people, without regard \nto their race, ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs, all those are \nefforts that I think are appropriate.''\n  But of course, Senator Feinstein had not asked about efforts to \nensure participation without regard to race. She asked his view on a \nparticular affirmative action program at the University of Michigan Law \nSchool that took race into account. We still do not know whether he \nagrees with that important Supreme Court decision. His refusal to tell \nus is very troubling.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I shall not object, but the junior \nSenator from Massachusetts is looking for time and we are anxious to \nget on to the bill. I will not object to the request for an additional \n5 minutes, but I hope the Senator could, in fact, finish in that 5-\nminute time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will try and do it in a shorter time.\n  I am also troubled by Judge Roberts' refusal to distance himself from \nhis past criticism of the very important Supreme Court decision Plyler \nv. Doe that held that the basic principle of equal protection requires \nall school-age children to have the same access to public education, \nincluding the children of undocumented immigrants. In a very real \nsense, the Plyler decision is as important to the children of \nundocumented workers as the Brown decision is to African-American \nchildren. Yet Judge Roberts strongly criticized the decision. On the \nday the case was decided, he coauthored a memo criticizing the \nSolicitor General's office for failing to file a brief, arguing that \nthese children could be denied public education.\n  Senator Durbin asked Judge Roberts:\n\n       Did you agree with the decision . . . then? Or do you agree \n     with the decision now?\n\n  Judge Roberts avoided the question, saying:\n\n       I haven't looked at the decision in the Plyler v. Doe in 23 \n     years.\n\n  Senator Durbin asked:\n\n       Is this settled law, as far as you are concerned, about our \n     commitment in education . . . ?\n\n  Judge Roberts avoided this, saying he had not looked at the case \nrecently, and that when he wrote the memo he was doing his job.\n  So we are left with nothing to reassure us he has changed his mind \nfrom his harsh criticism of that opinion in the past. His many \nstatements of support for the rule of law yield no clue about his true \nconvictions on this important question today.\n  Finally, a number of my colleagues on the committee asked Judge \nRoberts about issues related to women's rights, women's right to \nprivacy. On these important matters, too, he never gave answers that \nshed light on his current views.\n  No one is entitled to become Chief Justice of the United States. The \nconfirmation of nominees to our courts, by and with the advice of the \nSenate, should not require a leap of faith. Nominees must earn their \nconfirmation by providing full knowledge of the values and convictions \nthey will bring to the decisions that may profoundly affect our \nprogress as a nation toward the ideal of equality.\n  Judge Roberts has not done so. His repeated allegiance to the rule of \nlaw reveals little about the values he would bring to the job of Chief \nJustice of the United States. The record we have puts at serious risk \nthe progress we have made toward our common American vision of equality \nof opportunity for all of our citizens.\n  Supporting or opposing nominees in the Supreme Court should not be a \npartisan issue. In my 43 years in the Senate, I have supported more \nnominees for the Supreme Court by Republican Presidents than by \nDemocratic Presidents, but there is clear and convincing evidence that \nJudge Roberts is the wrong choice for Chief Justice.\n  I oppose the nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the order now is that we go to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. I ask unanimous consent the junior \nSenator from Massachusetts be allowed to speak for 15 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we all know there are few things the Senate \ndoes which are as important as confirming a Supreme Court Justice, let \nalone the Chief Justice of the United States. We know that making the \ndecision to support or oppose the nomination is both serious and \ncomplicated. We do not need to belabor those points.\n  What we do need to talk about is what kind of process ought to occur, \nmust occur, before a Senator can vote for or against a judicial \nnominee. What kind of information should be provided? What kind of \ndiscourse should we engage in?\n  I met with Judge Roberts last week. I must say I enjoyed our \nconversation enormously. He is earnest, friendly, incredibly \nintelligent, and on a personal level I liked him. He has dedicated his \nlife to the law, has given back to the legal community, and is \ncertainly beyond question a superb lawyer. It may turn out he will be \nan outstanding Chief Justice. But I can't say with confidence that I \nknow on a sufficient number of critical constitutional issues how he \nwould rule or what his legal approach would be. I have read memos he \nwrote during the Reagan administration. I have reviewed the limited \nmaterials available from his time in the Solicitor General's office, \nwhere he worked under Ken Starr, and then in private practice at Hogan \nand Hartson. I have read the cases he participated in on the DC \nCircuit. I have listened to as much of the Judiciary Committee hearings \nas I could and I have reviewed transcripts where I couldn't.\n  After all of that, I still find something essential is missing, \nsomething critical to our democratic process, something to ensure that \nwe have an appropriate understanding of both our courts and our judges \nand their role in America. That understanding requires a genuine \nexchange of information and a real development of ideas, similar, in \nfact, to that which occurs in every argument at the Supreme Court \nitself or in the appellate courts.\n  In appellate arguments, judges and Justices question lawyers, probing \nthe depth of their legal arguments, testing their particular legal \nargument against\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\nthe court's, or determining how it fits into their interpretation of \nthe Constitution. They determine how interpretive principles apply and \nhow they can reconcile apparently conflicting arguments. They make a \njudgment about the consequences of a potential outcome. The result in \nthe end is a better understanding of the record before the court and, \nhopefully, a principled approach to deciding the case.\n  Judge Roberts' Judiciary Committee hearings, notwithstanding the \nefforts of the Chair and many other of the Senators partaking in it, \ncontinue an increasingly sterile confirmation process: little genuine \nlegal engagement between the questioners and the questioned, no real \nexchange of information, and too little substantive discussion. The \nconfirmation exercise has now become little more than an empty shell. \nPeople are left guessing, hoping they understand the nominee's \npositions.\n  The administration's steadfast refusal to disclose documents Judge \nRoberts worked on while serving as a Deputy Solicitor General in the \nfirst Bush administration has only compounded this problem. They claim \ndisclosure of the documents will violate attorney-client privilege. I \nfind that argument absurd. What client are they trying to protect? The \nSolicitor General represents the people of the United States of \nAmerica. He is charged with arguing cases on behalf of all Americans. \nWe were Judge Roberts' client when he worked in the Solicitor General's \noffice. We have a right to know what he thought about the arguments he \nmade on behalf of the American people.\n  When John Roberts served as a Deputy Solicitor General under Ken \nStarr, he was intimately involved in critical decisions that office \nmade, such as whether to intervene in a pending case; what legal \narguments to advance in support of their position; whether to push for \nSupreme Court review; what the consequences of those arguments or that \naction would be; how those arguments fit into their theory of \nconstitutional interpretation, whether those arguments reflect the \nviews of the American people--all of these decisions are critical to an \nindividual's thinking, to their approach to the law, to their \nunderstanding of public trust and public responsibility, to their \nunderstanding of the Constitution itself. All of these decisions helped \nto shape how Federal law was applied and how our Constitution was \ninterpreted during that period of time.\n  The fact is, there are bureaucrats, none of whom take an oath, as we \ndo, to uphold the Constitution, who are aware of the contents of those \nparticular memoranda. Yet we, the Senators, who are constitutionally \nobligated to give consent to this nominee, still do not know what \npositions Judge Roberts took, the arguments he made, or the thinking \nbehind those arguments.\n  For example, the Solicitor General's office decided to intervene in \nBray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic. That case was brought against \nabortion clinic protesters during the height of clinic violence and \nbombings. The plaintiffs argued that protesters were violating a \nFederal antidiscrimination law by blocking access to clinics and \ninciting violence. The Government intervened and argued that the \nFederal antidiscrimination law did not apply and, therefore, could not \nbe used to stop the protesters.\n  Judge Roberts briefed and argued the case for the Government. I \nbelieve the arguments advanced by the Government and the consequences \nof those arguments are troubling, but what we do not know is even more \nimportant: What role did Judge Roberts play in making them? What did he \nthink about that approach? Did he consider the consequences on life, \nlimb, and individual? Did he argue for a more narrow or broad \ninterpretation of the law?\n  At the same time, the Solicitor General's office intervened in a \ndistrict court case in Wichita, KS, which raised the same issues that \nthe Supreme Court in Bray was facing. The Government tried to get the \ndistrict court to lift an injunction put in place to protect the safety \nof the clinic workers and patients. They argued that the plaintiffs \ncould not win and, therefore, the injunction was improper. The district \ncourt denied the Government's request and chastised it for \nunnecessarily endangering people's lives. Those are the real \nconsequences. We ought to know what kind of thinking, what were the \nlegal approaches to the protection of those individuals' lives.\n  The question still remains, what role did Judge Roberts have in \nmaking that decision? What was the legal reasoning that prompted it? \nDid he consider the real-life dangers that would result from that legal \nargument?\n  The Solicitor General's office is never obligated to intervene in \nprivate litigation. There are thousands of cases pending every day like \nthese questions. Why did the Government choose to intervene in those \nparticular cases? And, even more importantly, what role did Judge \nRoberts have in making that decision?\n  The administration's refusal to disclose those documents, in my \njudgment, creates a serious roadblock in the Senate's ability to \nproperly evaluate Judge Roberts. But Judge Roberts' refusal to \ngenuinely engage in the confirmation hearings, answer legitimate \nquestions, or at least shed light on them creates a bigger one.\n  I understand a Supreme Court nominee cannot answer questions about a \ncase in controversy, cannot answer questions about a case that may well \ncome before him, and I understand that he can't promise to resolve a \nfuture case in a particular way. I am not asking him to do that. I \ndon't expect that to be the standard of the hearings.\n  But that does not mean you can't discuss the principles of decided \ncases and whether you agree with them. What legal principles do you \nbring to the job? It doesn't mean you should refuse to disclose an \napproach to constitutional analysis. It doesn't mean you should do \nnothing more than recite the status of current Supreme Court case law.\n  This is not the first time the Supreme Court nominees have refused to \nengage in that kind of meaningful discourse. Justice Souter refused to \nanswer fundamental questions about his judicial philosophy. For that \nreason I voted against him at that time. I am happy to say I have been \nsurprised, and pleasantly, that my concerns did not come to pass. \nJustice Thomas also refused to answer fundamental questions about \njudicial philosophy. As I said at the time, Justice Thomas found a lot \nof ways to say ``I don't know'' or ``I disagree'' or ``I cannot agree'' \nor ``I can't say whether I agree.'' I voted against Justice Thomas \nbecause again I didn't know what the end product was going to be. I \nbelieve I was correct in making that decision.\n  At the end of the day I find myself in the same position I was with \nboth of these Justices. Notwithstanding Judge Roberts' impressive legal \nresume, I can't say with confidence that I know what specific \nconstitutional approach he believes in or what kind of Chief Justice he \nwill be. Will he protect the civil rights and civil liberties we fought \nfor so long and hard, which he acknowledged in the course of the \nhearings? Will he support the power of Congress to enact critical \nenvironmental legislation? Will he be an effective check on executive \nbranch actions? In my judgment, before you vote for Chief Justice, \nparticularly one who may lead a court for potentially 30 years or more, \nwe ought to know the answers to those fundamental questions. In the \ncase of Judge Roberts, we don't.\n  For example, I don't know how Judge Roberts will approach cases \nchallenging the power of Congress to enact vital national legislation. \nI understand that terms such as the ``Commerce Clause,'' ``Section 5 of \nthe 14th Amendment,'' and ``Spending Clause'' don't mean a lot to \neverybody in the country on a daily basis. But however technical and \nlegalistic the discussion of those terms may be, they are critical to \nus in our judgments as Senators about how our Government functions. A \nJustice with a limited view of congressional power will undermine \nCongress's ability to respond to national problems.\n  For example, under the commerce clause, Congress can only regulate \nthings that affect interstate commerce. When Congress enacted the \nViolence Against Women Act in 1996, it made numerous very specific \nfindings about how that violence affected interstate commerce. The \nCourt found those findings insufficient and struck down that piece of \nlegislation.\n  When asked by Senator Specter whether he agreed with the Court in \nthis case, Judge Roberts refused to answer. When asked whether he would\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\nhave found similar congressional findings insufficient, Judge Roberts \nrefused to answer. I believe those answers ought to have been \nforthcoming, particularly when they address how Judge Roberts would \ninterpret Congress's fundamental constitutional powers.\n  Judge Roberts has shed some light himself on his view of the commerce \nclause because he wrote about it in a dissenting opinion on the DC \nCircuit. In Rancho Viejo v. Norton, the so-called ``hapless toad \ncase,'' Roberts suggested that the Endangered Species Act, as applied \nto the California toads at issue, might be unconstitutional because \nthey had an insufficient connection to interstate commerce.\n  He also suggested there might be other ways of looking at the case to \npreserve the act's constitutionality. When asked about it during the \nhearings, and again personally in my own meeting with him, Judge \nRoberts did not endorse one view or the other. He gave no sense of how \nhe might interpret Congress's power and its limitations.\n  While his refusal to completely condemn the Endangered Species Act \nwas obviously somewhat reassuring, at the end of the day, I am left \nwithout any real understanding of how he would approach a commerce \nclause question. I have no idea whether he will undermine Congress's \nability to pass needed legislation. I have no idea how he will approach \nchallenges to existing Federal environmental laws, such as the \nEndangered Species Act. Which of the possible approaches he laid out in \nRancho Viejo does he believe is the most correct? This certainly \ncreates a risk I personally am unwilling to accept when voting to \nconfirm the next Chief Justice of the United States.\n  Another area of great concern to me is obviously the area of privacy, \nan area where Judge Roberts skillfully answered a lot of questions \nwithout giving a hint as to his own position. For example, while \nRoberts admitted that the Court has recognized that privacy is \nprotected under the Constitution as part of the liberty in the due \nprocess clause, he refused to give any indication of what he thought \nabout the Court's most recent decisions.\n  The furthest he went was to say he had no quarrel with the decisions \nin Griswold and Eisenstadt, yet this kind of endorsement is not \nreassuring. In his confirmation hearings, Justice Thomas agreed that \nthe Court had found a constitutional right to privacy. Like Judge \nRoberts, he also stated he had no quarrel with the Court's holding in \nEisenstadt. Yet when he got to the Supreme Court, he disavowed the very \nrights he had said the Constitution protected.\n  In fact, more recently in Lawrence v. Texas, Justice Thomas stated he \ncould not ``find [neither in the Bill of Rights nor any other part of \nthe Constitution a] general right of privacy.'' The bottom line is I do \nnot know how Judge Roberts will approach those questions with respect \nto the fundamental right of privacy.\n  In addition to what I do not know, what I do know about Judge Roberts \nalso raises issues. I know in the early 1980s, while he worked in the \nDepartment of Justice and White House Counsel's Office, Judge Roberts \ntook an active role in advocating on behalf of administration policies \nthat would have greatly undermined our civil rights and liberties.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, may I ask for an additional few minutes? \nThank you.\n  For example, Judge Roberts argued against using the ``effects test'' \nto determine whether section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was violated. \nInstead, he believed that an ``intent'' test--requiring proof of a \ndiscriminatory motive--should be required, regardless of the fact that \nmany victims of discrimination would be absolutely unable to prove a \nreal discriminatory intent and, therefore, would be unable to enjoy the \nprotections afforded by the act. In some cases, the effect of Judge \nRoberts' intent test meant that disenfranchised individuals had to \nprove the motive of long dead officials who had crafted the \nlegislation. Obviously, that is impossible. So he would have set up an \nunacceptable standard, one that would come between citizens and their \nconstitutionally protected right to fair representation in our \ndemocracy.\n  Judge Roberts also argued that the obligations imposed on educational \ninstitutions by title IX should apply only to the specific program that \nreceived Federal funding rather than to the whole institution. Again, \nby limiting the application of an important antidiscrimination law, \nthere is an effect, which is to deny people their constitutional right.\n  In the area of affirmative action, Judge Roberts argued in favor of \nlimiting race-conscious remedies to instances where individuals were \nproven to be the victims of identifiable acts of impermissible \ndiscrimination.\n  I realize Judge Roberts took the positions I just described some time \nago. I know he told the Judiciary Committee he was simply advocating \nthe views of the administration at the time. But I think those of us \nwho have worked in and around Government for a period of time find it \nhard to believe that a staffer at Justice or in the White House never \nwrote a memo that represented some of his views rather than just \nadministration positions, particularly when the theme of those memos is \nconsistent across the board--strict adherence to narrow principles of \nlaw despite their real-world impact, and particularly when some of the \nmemos released from this time include acknowledgements by Judge Roberts \nthat his own position failed to prevail in the internal deliberations.\n\n  That was certainly true when he argued, unsuccessfully, within the \nadministration that Congress could strip the Federal courts of \njurisdiction over abortion and desegregation cases.\n  I will conclude, Mr. President. I do not want to abuse the Senator's \npermissiveness here. Let me close with this particular argument.\n  Judge Roberts' more recent decision to join to Judge Randolph's \nopinion in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld is important with respect to the security \nconsequences regarding the military and our soldiers. That opinion gave \nthe President unfettered and unreviewable authority to place captured \nindividuals outside the protections of the Geneva Convention. Six \nretired senior military officials with extensive experience in legal \npolicy, the laws of war, and armed conflict, have filed a friend-of-\nthe-court brief in the Supreme Court, arguing that Hamdan must be \noverturned immediately because it directly endangers American soldiers. \nThese are the real effects of these rigid applications of law.\n  I understand that Judge Roberts felt he could not discuss the case \nwhile it was pending before the Supreme Court, but even when asked \nabout his views of the scope of executive power unrelated to the Hamdan \ncase, he was evasive. He did little more than describe the Court's \ncurrent framework for analyzing assertions of executive power.\n  As a result, I do not know whether he believes that the state of war \nis a blank check for the President or whether he would closely \nscrutinize the legality of executive branch actions at all times. Given \nthe fact that the Hamdan decision placed our troops at risk, I am \nforced to conclude that some of his future decisions might threaten the \nsecurity of troops abroad and our security at home.\n  Now, some may argue that Democrats ought to vote for Judge Roberts \nbecause he is the best nominee we could expect from the administration. \nI cannot agree to confirm the next Chief Justice of the United States \nsimply because the next nominee to the Court may be less protective of \nour fundamental rights or liberties or less dangerous to national \nsecurity. Frankly, I am not sure how I would make that determination \ngiven the limited record before me.\n  Some may argue that Democrats should vote for Judge Roberts because \nof his resume. He obviously is qualified in terms of his legal \neducation and litigation experience. But I do not think that should be \nthe test. A Supreme Court Justice needs more qualifications than an \nimpressive legal resume. They need compassion and sensitivity. They \nneed a clarity with respect to their approach to the Constitution. They \nneed an understanding of the consequences of their decisions and how \nthey further democratic traditions.\n  As a Senator, I am duty bound to consider each nominee as an \nindividual and how he or she will fit into the current Court--the \ncurrent closely divided\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\nSupreme Court. I have a duty to protect the fundamental rights I \nbelieve our Constitution guarantees. I have a duty to preserve the \nincredible progress that has been made toward the realization of those \nrights for Americans. I have a duty to safeguard our national security, \nand to prevent the executive from using war as a blank check to violate \nboth national and international law.\n  John Roberts will be confirmed. I hope and look forward to decisions \nthat will allay all of my concerns. He may author or join opinions \nprotecting the rights which we hold so dear, and in so doing he may \nprove all of my concerns to be groundless. I hope so. But the questions \nI have raised, the absence of critical documents, the lack of clarity \nsurrounding fundamental issues on how he would interpret the \nConstitution, requires me to fulfill my constitutional duty by opposing \nhis nomination to be the next Chief Justice.\n  I thank the Chair again, and I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10264-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2744, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2744) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n             Nomination Of John Roberts To Be Chief Justice\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, we are on the Agriculture bill, but the \nmorning has been taken up with discussion of Judge Roberts. I think \nthat is appropriate given the decision of the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, to support Judge Roberts and to \nannounce that here this morning. That was perhaps unexpected by some of \nthe commentators and, therefore, deserved a little time.\n  I will take the opportunity, having listened to the junior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, to respond to some of the things he said, not with \nthe understanding that it is going to change anything anywhere but for \nthe satisfaction of getting a few things off my chest.\n  The Senator complained bitterly, as he and others have done with \nrespect to other nominees, that the memos given to the Solicitor \nGeneral are not being made public. He did not tell us that every \nSolicitor General--regardless of party, regardless of administration--\nwho is currently living has agreed with Judge Roberts, with Miguel \nEstrada, with others who worked in the Office of the Solicitor General, \nthat those memos should, in fact, not be made public.\n  They are, in fact, covered by the attorney-client privilege. Some \nsay, ``Well, the American people are the client, not the Solicitor \nGeneral.'' The Solicitor General is the attorney for the American \npeople and has a right to attorney-client privilege within his own \nstaff, as any attorney has for material within that attorney's own \noffice, as if they are representing a private client.\n  This keeps coming up. It keeps being repeated in the hope that it \ncatches on. We need to always remember that every single Solicitor \nGeneral who is living--regardless of their party--says that is the bad \nthing to do. That is the wrong interpretation of the law. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts did not point that out. I think it needs to be \npointed out.\n  He made a reference to the bureaucrats who were involved here who, as \nhe said, have not taken an oath to defend the Constitution as we \nSenators have. I have been a bureaucrat. I have taken an oath as a \nbureaucrat to defend the Constitution. Those who serve the United \nStates in these positions are sworn in with the same oath Senators \ntake. It should be made clear those people who took that position and \nwere in that position were, in fact, under oath to defend the \nConstitution. It demeans them to suggest their actions were any less \npatriotic or anxious to protect the law than actions of Senators.\n  I will conclude by quoting from an editorial that appeared in the Los \nAngeles Times. The Los Angeles Times is not known as a paper supportive \nof Republican positions. Indeed, it is often thought of as being a \ncompanion publication with the New York Times. But the Los Angeles \nTimes says:\n\n       It will be a damning indictment of petty partisanship in \n     Washington if an overwhelming majority of the Senate does not \n     vote to confirm John G. Roberts Jr. to be the next chief \n     justice of the United States.\n       As last week's confirmation hearings made clear, Roberts is \n     an exceptionally qualified nominee, well within the \n     mainstream of American legal thought, who deserves broad \n     bipartisan support. If a majority of Democrats in the Senate \n     vote against Roberts, they will reveal themselves as nothing \n     more than self-defeating obstructionists. . . .\n       Even if one treats this vote merely as a tactical game, \n     voting against an impressive, relatively moderate nominee \n     hardly strengthens the Democrats' leverage [on the upcoming \n     second nomination].\n       If Roberts fails to win their support, Bush may justifiably \n     conclude that he needn't even bother trying to find a justice \n     palatable to the center. And if Bush next nominates someone \n     who is genuinely unacceptable to most Americans, it will be \n     harder for Democrats to point that out if they cry wolf over \n     Roberts.\n\n  I am not sure that will change anything, but it makes me feel a \nlittle better having said it, after listening to the presentations we \nhave heard over the last hour. I congratulate my friend, Senator Leahy \nfrom Vermont, for his courage in standing up to internal pressures and \nhis announcement that he will, following the advice of the Los Angeles \nTimes and others who have examined this, in fact vote to confirm Judge \nRoberts. This guarantees that we will have a bipartisan vote out of \ncommittee, as we should, and that we will have strong bipartisan \nsupport here on the floor, as we should.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1783\n\n  Returning to the Agriculture appropriations bill, I send an amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1783.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 173, at the end of the page, insert the following:\n       ``Sec. 7__. (a) Notwithstanding subtitles B and C of the \n     Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4501 et \n     seq.), during fiscal year 2006, the National Dairy Promotion \n     and Research Board may obligate and expend funds for any \n     activity to improve the environment and public health.\n       ``(b) The Secretary of Agriculture shall review the impact \n     of any expenditures under subsection (a) and include the \n     review in the 2007 report of the Secretary to Congress on the \n     dairy promotion program established under subtitle B of the \n     Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4501 et \n     seq.).''.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, we need a little background on this \namendment. It may be controversial. I understand there are some \nSenators who have opposed it and will be coming to the floor.\n  It would allow the producers on the National Dairy Promotion and \nResearch Board to vote to fund or not fund the dairy air emission \nresearch required under the Environmental Protection Agency's Air \nQuality Compliance Agreement. This sounds fairly technical. In fact, \nthe money that is available to the board has always been used for \nparticular purposes, and most dairy producers want to make sure that it \nstays restricted to those purposes. But something has come up that \nrequires research. It has come not from the Department of Agriculture \nbut from the Environmental Protection Agency in a new agreement that \naffects dairy farmers. And in order to defend themselves against the \nposition taken by the EPA, they need research. They need it now, and \nthey need it badly.\n  This amendment would allow a one-time use of dairy promotion and \nresearch funds to fund the research. Most\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\ndairy farmers are in favor of it. Dairy is the only program that does \nnot have an option for funding its own research. The research will be \nconducted by Purdue University, according to protocols approved by the \nEPA. This is not in opposition to EPA procedures. The actual research \nwill be performed by land grant universities in the States identified \nby the U.S. Dairy Environmental Task Force.\n  If we assume approval by the board, which would happen if my \namendment were adopted, the funds will flow through an oversight \norganization, again approved by the EPA. The Agriculture Air Research \nCouncil, Inc., AARC, will contract with Purdue which will, in turn, \ncontract with the universities in the States where the sites are \nselected. Dairy funds only will be used to fund the dairy research. \nAARC's board will include two members from the dairy industry and will \nmonitor and audit the progress of the research and how the funds are \nspent.\n  The ultimate goal of all of this research will be to develop air \nemissions data that can be used in a process model that will allow any \ndairy farmer in the United States to input his dairy's operation \ninformation and find out what his emissions are. The information \ngenerated by this research, therefore, will benefit all dairy \nproducers.\n  The reason is because the EPA has laid down rules with respect to \nemissions from dairy farmers. Most farmers have no clue as to how many \nemissions their farm is producing. The EPA has some fairly draconian \nrestrictions to put on dairy farms, if the emissions go above a certain \nlevel. So how is a farmer to know whether he is in compliance, if there \nis no research on how the emissions can be measured? That is the reason \nwe want the research done, and that is the reason farmers will benefit.\n  I believe Congress never intended the environmental statutes \nregarding emissions to apply to agriculture. When we talk about \nemissions, we are talking about smokestacks and automobiles and things \nthat have been created by human beings. Now the EPA has said, no, we \nmust monitor and, where necessary, control the emissions that come from \ncows. Cows have been generating emissions for a long time, perhaps even \nbefore human beings came along. So let's look at it, but let's not have \na rule that arbitrarily disadvantages the dairy farmers without giving \nthem an opportunity to know what is going on. That is what is behind \nthis. In order to deal with the EPA regulations, the farmers need to \nknow what is happening with respect to emissions. My amendment would \nfund a one-time study to give them the information they need. I believe \nwithout statutory changes, the courts will continue to rule that the \nenvironmental laws do, in fact, apply to dairy farms, and that is an \nissue for the authorizing committee. It is not something we should deal \nwith on the Agriculture bill. Barring changes to the laws, I believe \nthe collection of these data and the development of an emissions model \nwill provide more certainty to producers.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. Those who are opposed \nhave been notified. I understand there are conflicts on both sides of \nthe aisle at this particular moment. I am not sure how many Senators \nwill be able to come down. We are open for business. We are ready for \namendments. We are anxious to proceed. I hope my colleagues will \naccommodate us.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, as certainly the Senate knows, we are \nconsidering the Senate appropriations bill. There is an amendment that \nthe chairman has brought at the request of the national dairy industry \nthat is of great concern to me. As a result of that, I stand today in \nopposition to legislation that would seek to divert funds from the \nNational Dairy Promotion Program to be used as a one-time-only source \nto fund EPA's dairy air quality studies.\n  While I am wholeheartedly in support of the need for research money \nto carry out air quality studies, dipping into a program that all \nproducers, large and small, are required to pay into to promote their \nproducts does not seem to meet the test of where we want to now \nreallocate this resource.\n  The Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 was established to \nstrengthen the dairy industry's position in the marketplace and to \nmaintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and use for fluid milk \nand dairy products. The act does provide for research dollars to be \nspent but only on research projects related to the advertisement and \npromotion of the sale and the consumption of dairy products. So should \nthis act leave the door open as a slush fund available any time a \nselect group needs quick money for a proposed unrelated intent of the \nlaw? I would hope not, I would think not, and I am afraid the amendment \ntakes us in that direction.\n  On September 9, 2005, I and the entire Idaho congressional delegation \nsent a letter on this issue to Secretary Johanns. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Idaho Congressional Delegations,\n\n                                                September 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Mike Johanns,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Independence \n         Avenue, SW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Johanns: We write to express opposition to a \n     proposal to divert funds from the National Dairy Promotion \n     Program to fund the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) \n     dairy air quality studies.\n       We understand that a proposal has been put forward to \n     provide for a ``one time'' use of National Dairy Promotion \n     Program funds for dairy air quality studies. We support \n     necessary environmental research. However, we share the \n     concern of Idaho dairy producers that this proposal would \n     provide a misdirection of funds that are intended, according \n     to the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983, to be used \n     for dairy promotion and related research and education. In \n     authorizing the program, Congress clearly stated that the \n     assessments were to be used for ``carrying out a coordinated \n     program of promotion designed to strengthen the dairy \n     industry's position in the marketplace and to maintain and \n     expand domestic and foreign markets and uses for fluid milk \n     and dairy products produced in the United States.''\n       The Act and the Dairy Promotion and Research Order, which \n     implements the program, also defines research to be provided \n     through the fund as ``studies testing the effectiveness of \n     market development and promotion efforts, studies relating to \n     the nutritional value of milk and dairy products, and other \n     related efforts to expand demand for dairy products. \n     ``Therefore, it is clear that the fund is meant to be used \n     for research related to the promotion of dairy products and \n     not for other purposes. If implemented, we are concerned with \n     the precedent the proposal would set toward possible future \n     diversion of these important promotion funds.\n       The dairy industry, the Administration, Congress, and \n     interested parties must work to find the best ways to fund \n     dairy environmental research that do not jeopardize promotion \n     efforts. Last year, dairy producers in Idaho voted to assess \n     themselves an extra $0.005/cwt. to fund environmental \n     research. This is raising approximately $500,000 per year, \n     enabling the establishment of a broad based research \n     coordination team that includes the State and Regional EPA \n     officials. This effort serves as an example of how the \n     industry is working to enable research, while not \n     compromising promotion.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look \n     forward to continuing to work with you to ensure the \n     continued success of U.S. agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mike Crapo,\n       United States Senator.\n     Mike Simpson,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Larry E. Craig,\n       United States Senator.\n     C.L. ``Butch'' Otter,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, Idaho recently became the fourth largest \ndairy producer in the Nation, and coupled with that new status are our \ninherent growing pains. Over the past 15 years, Idaho's expansion in \nthe dairy industry has been swift. So has the growth of the State's \npopulation. The two have come in conflict with each other over the need \nfor Idaho's dairy industry to be good players in the environmental \narena. That is a critical issue, and they have, in most instances, been \nsuccessful in working out their problems.\n  Even with the increased pressure of urban encroachment and stringent \nenvironmental regulations--and our State has not turned its back on \nthis issue--producers in my State continue to surprise me in their \nwork, in their\n\n[[Page S10266]]\n\ninnovation, and the progressive thinking as it relates to resolving the \nenvironmental problems that I suggested are inherent with large \nconcentrated herd and dairy development that is on going.\n  Idaho's industry realized a few years ago that it was vital they work \ncollectively to support research to find new technologies and methods \nto mitigate the impact of the operations on the environment. So in \n2004, Idaho dairy producers voted to assess themselves an extra half \ncent per hundredweight to fund environmental research. In other words, \nthey didn't ask the country to do it, they didn't ask the Nation to do \nit, they did it themselves. This initiative raised about a half a \nmillion dollars per year, enabling the establishment of a broad-based \nresearch coordination team that includes Idaho and regional EPA \nofficers.\n  This effort serves as an example of how the industry ought to be \nworking to solve critical research problems rather than asking us now \nto dip into a fund that was dedicated to advertisement, promotion, and \nproduct development.\n  I am aware of EPA's work on the livestock ``air consent agreement'' \nto provide limited immunity from frivolous environmental lawsuits to \nproducers who voluntarily allow EPA to conduct their quality research \non their operations. I know that those who support this onetime dollar-\ndipping have good intentions, and I support all of their intentions \nfully. I have been working with them for a good number of months on \nother ways to shape Federal policy on air quality issues. However, \nasking Congress to allow a onetime-only access to the pool of money \nnever intended for that purpose defies the integrity of the dairy \npromotion program that has worked so very effectively for now 22 years.\n  Supporters of this proposal say it would only cost around $5 to $8 \nmillion, but if it is that small amount, then if you look at the \nassessment that Idaho did on themselves, you would suggest that more \nand more could be raised if other States were to do as Idaho has done. \nThe program assesses all producers to promote the products that these \nproducers all provide to the consumer. The money from the promotion \nprogram that some, not all, in the industry now seek would only benefit \na specific group of producers--about 1200--for a purpose completely \nunrelated to the intent of the program. Why should we allow a precedent \nto be set that robs Peter and the rest of his family to pay Paul? Never \nmind that this has never been done in the program's history.\n  Mr. President, again, I would like to express my support for the \ncritical need for Federal investment in air quality and other \nenvironmental research programs for the dairy industry, but we should \nnot open the gate to a flood that might never cease from a program that \nis intended for an entirely different purpose. With that, I will have \nto oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I listened to my friend from Idaho with \ngreat interest and great sympathy, and if, indeed, we could get all the \nother dairy producers to follow Idaho's example and put an assessment \non themselves in order to come up with this money, I would agree with \nhim this amendment is not necessary. Unfortunately, I believe there is \nan urgency here. The research needs to be done as quickly as possible, \nand this seems to be the logical place to which we should go.\n  I will say to the Senator from Idaho and to my other colleagues the \nfundamental problem here is not the research. The fundamental problem \nin my view is the absurdity of the EPA position with respect to the \nunderlying question. That, as I said earlier, is not a matter for the \nappropriations subcommittee to deal with. It is a matter for the \nauthorizing committee. But I will pledge to my friend from Idaho that \nto the degree we can have some influence on the EPA's position in \nconference, I will do everything I can to try to get a little common \nsense into this regulatory pattern.\n  With that, Madam President, I call for a voice vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1783) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, prior to the call of the roll, I wish to \nthank the chairman of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee for \nhis work on this issue and his cooperation. Certainly, this industry, \nas it is important to my State, is important to his State. We work very \ncooperatively together. We have a lot of commonness across State lines \nas it relates to the dairy industry, and we share a great deal of work \nand research. I appreciate the urgency of the need as he has expressed \nit, but I felt it was extremely important that Idaho's position be \nheard and understood by the rest of the States because this could be \ndone by the industry itself from another resource, not unlike how Idaho \nhas approached it. And I hope that other States would recognize the \nneed to resolve this issue, and I certainly agree with Senator Bennett \nthat the authorizing committee has a responsibility here and EPA needs \nto get their act together on this issue.\n  I yield the floor, noting the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, is is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Milkulski pertaining to the \nsubmission of S. Res. 246 are located in today's Record under \n``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. First of all, I rise \nto encourage my colleagues to vote for the appropriations bill that is \nbefore us. It is the appropriations bill to fund The Department of \nAgriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. I would like to thank \nthe chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. \nBennett, as well as the ranking member, for the excellent bill that \nthey have put together, and therefore it warrants our support because \nit does fund the agricultural needs of our communities, and also funds \nthe Food and Drug Administration.\n  Mr. President, Maryland is an agricultural State. It might surprise \npeople because usually we are thought of as the home of high-tech \nresearch, Johns Hopkins University, the National Institutes of Health, \nbut we are agricultural in soybeans and poultry. Also, we are the proud \nhome of the Food and Drug Administration. We are so proud of the fact \nthat the FDA is in Maryland and that the agency is charged with the \nmission of food safety and also with the safety of our drugs and our \nmedical devices.\n  One might ask why is FDA in Agriculture appropriations. Well, because \nits original mission was food safety. But now it has expanded to the \nmission of ensuring the safety of our drugs and also of our medical \ndevices.\n  It is wonderful to have them in the State, these competent people who \nwork very hard putting America first, putting the safety of our people \nfirst, and also ensuring that drugs and medical devices move to areas \nof clinical practice.\n  But I am telling you I am really worried about what is going on at \nFDA currently. FDA has always been the gold standard in maintaining \ndrug safety and drug efficacy. Yet today this agency is being \npoliticized and degraded. The current administration has shown a \npersistent pattern of bringing incompetent leaders into critical \npositions. We have seen it at FEMA. We have seen it at other agencies. \nAnd now it is true at FDA. I see appointments being made on the basis \nof ideology instead of competency. I have seen people who have worked \nand devoted their\n\n[[Page S10267]]\n\nlives to FDA resigning because they saw science being politicized. I am \nworried about this.\n  Now, I voted against the current FDA Director, not because he is not \na pleasant man but because there were so many problems under his watch. \nAnd they are not getting better. Let's take the situation that occurred \nin the consideration of something called plan B. Regardless of how you \nfeel about whether plan B emergency contraception should be available \nover the counter, I think we would all agree that a decision should be \nmade. I understand it is controversial from a cultural standpoint, but \nthe question is was it controversial from a scientific standpoint? \nWell, delay, delay, delay, delay. Even the head of the FDA recently \npromised Senators Clinton and Murray that a decision would be made. \nGuess what happened? What happened was after the scientists made their \ndecision, the Director delayed it because he said: How can we prevent \nteenagers from getting it? Well, Madam President, you are a mom. You \nknow if we can keep alcohol and cigarettes out of the hands of \nteenagers, surely the Food and Drug Administration would know how to \nhandle this issue of contraceptives with teenagers. Put it behind the \ncounter. Dr. Susan Wood, the Director of the FDA Office of Women's \nHealth, resigned in protest. Dr. Wood is a distinguished scientist. She \nis a competent policymaker. She headed up the Office of Women's Health \nthat the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, and I worked \nto establish, to be sure that as drugs and clinical devices went \nthrough the evaluation, special needs of women would be taken into \nconsideration and also children--another aspect led by our colleague \nfrom Ohio, Senator DeWine.\n  So this is what Wood's job was. Did she quit because of pay? Did she \nquit because she got some big job with the pharmaceutical industry? Why \ndid she quit? She quit because, she said, ``after spending the last 15 \nyears to ensure that science forms policy decisions, I can no longer \nserve when scientific and clinical evidence are being overruled by the \nleadership.''\n  Well, she quit. So what happened? Guess who they announced would \nserve as the acting director of the office last week? They announced a \nmale, a guy, with a background in veterinary medicine. What a \ndismissive attitude of the Office of Women's Health.\n  Now, I am not saying a man could not handle that job. He probably \nwould have to work twice as hard to prove himself. But nevertheless, an \nindividual with a background in veterinary medicine in charge of the \nOffice of Women's Health? I admire the veterinarian community. They \nplay a very important role in our community. They are respected. They \nare admired. They have sophisticated training. But I do not believe, as \nwe are looking at the impact of a drug on pregnancy, or of \npostmenopausal women that someone with a background in veterinary \nmedicine should be in charge.\n\n  Guess what. Advocates and scientists pounded the table, and they put \nsomeone else in charge. And the FDA doesn't even have the guts to stand \nup for the immediate appointment it made. It backed off, saying: Oh, we \nnever announced his appointment. However a lot of people have that e-\nmail. I do not know the qualifications of the new acting director, but \nwe are not heading in a good direction.\n  I want FDA to be the gold standard on safety and efficacy. There are \nmany countries around the world that are poor. They rely on what is \napproved by FDA because they could never afford to have an FDA. Doctors \nin clinical practice rely on the FDA to tell them what is a good and \nsafe drug, or what is a good and safe medical device, or an effective \ndevice. This is phenomenal. I had the benefit of this myself. I wore a \nheart monitor, invented in the United States of America, that could \ntell my doctor whether the drugs they were giving me controlled a \ncondition of arrhythmia that I have. It was wonderful to know it had \nbeen approved by FDA, that it could tell me if what I was doing was \nsafe, and could give advice to my physician on how best to treat me. \nThis is what we want the FDA to be able to do.\n  We have a lot of problems. Look what is happening. We know what \nhappened to Vioxx, out there prematurely, or with data withheld. We \nhave all of these questions.\n  If you want to worry about teenagers, let's worry about \nantidepressants. I worry they can get antidepressants faster than they \ncan get plan B. That is up to parents and others to control. But these \nantidepressants have had a very negative and dangerous effect on some \nteenagers. Where was FDA?\n  Now we have these implantable defibrillators that can go into your \nbody, wonderful devices that can jump-start a heart. But guess what. \nThey are found to have short circuits. The manufacturer knew about it, \nFDA knew about it, and they took no action on this. What is happening \nto our FDA?\n  I have fought for the right resources, I fought for the right \nlegislative framework for FDA, and I am going to fight for the right \nleadership.\n  I wish Dr. Crawford would, No. 1, take charge of his agency. I am not \ncalling for his resignation today, though he has to think about what he \nis doing over there. He cannot continue to politicize this agency. I am \nsaying to him now that if he continues to politicize it, we will have \nto look at further action. I believe he is a decent person, but either \nhe is getting direction from somewhere else or he has lost direction. \nThis is meant to be a scientific agency, standing sentry over the \nsafety of our food supply, doing the necessary evaluations as to \nwhether a drug should come into clinical practice, and making decisions \nabout whether a medical device can be safe and reliable and be the tool \nit was supposed to be, such as the one I had the benefit from.\n  So I say let's support the appropriations, let's make sure they have \nthe right resources, but I sure in heck want them to have the right \nleadership so we can come to the right conclusions, and people all over \nthe world--doctors, clinicians, and the American people can rely on \nFDA. I want to rely on FDA for science and not politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                       nomination of john roberts\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to state my intention to \nsupport the nomination of John G. Roberts to be the next Chief Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  He has the experience, judicial temperament, and qualifications \nnecessary to be Chief Justice, and his testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has given me reason to believe he is not an \nideologue and that he will make decisions based on sound legal \nreasoning that is within the mainstream of judicial thought in this \ncountry. I do not believe that he has an agenda to reverse our Nation's \nhistoric commitment to civil rights, and I take him at his word when he \nsays that he will take each case on its facts and apply the law \nregardless of his personal views. It is for these reasons that I intend \nto vote in favor of Judge Roberts' nomination.\n  Many people have raised legitimate concerns about views that Judge \nRoberts expressed in the past. As a 26-year-old staff attorney in the \nReagan White House Counsel's Office, Roberts wrote a series of memos \nthat raised concerns about his commitment to civil rights. At his \nconfirmation hearing he said that he no longer held certain views and \nit was important to distinguish between his personal views and those of \nan advocate seeking to uphold the policies of his client.\n  Due to the limitations the Senate faced in obtaining documents, in \nmaking my decision I had to primarily rely on Judge Roberts' testimony \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. The assurances he provided in his \ntestimony give me what I believe is a reasonable expectation regarding \nhow he will approach cases if placed on the Court. I would like to take \na moment to briefly discuss some of these expectations that I believe \nare reasonably based on what he said at that set of hearings.\n  First, Judge Roberts repeatedly stressed that he respects the rule of \nlaw and recognizes the importance of considering stare decisis in the \ndecision making process. I agree that looking to settled precedent \nshould always be the starting point in this process. It is essential \nthat the decisions of the Supreme Court provide reliable guidance to \nthe American people, Congress, and the executive branch, and I believe \nthat the whimsical reinterpretation of settled law is not in the best \ninterest of our Nation. Based on the answers that\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\nJudge Roberts gave, I believe it unlikely that Judge Roberts will chart \na new right-wing course for the Court based on his own personal views. \nHis answers indicate that he will apply the law in a fairminded way and \nthat he will afford longstanding precedent adequate deference.\n  Second, when asked about whether the Constitution contains a right to \nprivacy, which provides the legal basis for a woman's right to choose \nand the use of birth control, Judge Roberts made clear that he believed \nthat it did. He stated clearly that the right to privacy was protected \nby the ``liberty'' due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth \namendments. More importantly, Judge Roberts asserted that the right to \nprivacy conferred under the Constitution was a substantive and not \nmerely a procedural right. This view is in stark contrast to that of \nJustice Scalia, who has argued for a strict constructionist \ninterpretation of the Constitution and believes the right to privacy is \nan artificial construct that lacks any foundation in the Constitution.\n  Third, Judge Roberts also distinguished his views from those who see \nConstitution as a static document and only recognize recourse to the \n``original'' intent when interpreting it. I believe strongly that the \nConstitution was intended to be a living document, and that we must \nhave a constitution that is able to address the challenges and \nadversities that we face as a modern society. When our country was \nfounded we were living in very different times, and it is important \nthat our Constitution reflect the new world we are living in. In his \ntestimony, Roberts noted that although it was impermissible to \ncontradict the plain text of the Constitution, where the Constitution \nuses general terms, such as ``liberty'' or ``equal protection,'' it is \nacceptable to interpret the text in light of today's notions of liberty \nand equal justice, not just those concepts as they were contemplated in \n1787.\n  Fourth, with regard to recent Supreme Court decisions that have \nrestricted the ability of Congress to enact certain laws pursuant to \nthe commerce clause, Roberts' answers indicated a willingness to \ninterpret these cases in the context of the overwhelming jurisprudence \nsupporting Congressional authority in this area. Further restrictions \non the power of Congress to legislate under the commerce clause could \nhave profound implications concerning the ability of Congress to pass \nlaws with respect to the environment, civil rights, and many of the \nbasic advancements we made during the Warren court.\n  In addition, Judge Roberts also specifically rejected the tenets of \nthe Supreme Courts' 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, which \ndrastically curtailed the ability of Congress to pass critical workers' \nrights legislation, such as wage and child labor laws. Of course this \ndecision has since been overruled, but some jurists nominated by \nPresident Bush, Judge Janice Rogers Brown, have advocated that the \ndecision was correctly decided.\n  There is one other issue that I would like to discuss. Some of the \nmost challenging issues that the Supreme Court will likely face over \nthe next decade will involve how we balance civil liberties with the \nneed to confront terrorism. The President has asserted tremendous \nauthority in this area, including the right to indefinitely detain a \nU.S. citizen that he unilaterally deems an ``enemy combatant.'' The \nCourt will have to decide issues involving the detention of suspected \nterrorists, due process rights, constraints regarding the use of \ntorture, and many other questions that will define our commitment to \nlongstanding principles of civil rights and civil liberties. During the \nhearings, Judge Roberts rejected the Supreme Courts' decision in \nKorematsu, which upheld the mass detainment of Japanese Americans \nduring World War II. Although this decision is a sad part of our \nhistory, in a technical sense it is still legally binding. Judge \nRoberts' complete rejection of this approach gives me hope that he \nunderstands that governmental powers are not without limit in times of \nwar.\n  When asked whether he considers himself in the mold of Justices \nScalia or Thomas, Judge Roberts stated clearly that he would be his own \nman. As I have stated, I expect that Judge Roberts will afford adequate \ndeference to Congress, will follow longstanding precedent, and will \napply the law in a fair and straightforward way. It is my hope that \nJudge Roberts will uphold these expectations.\n\n\n                             Team Nutrition\n\n  Mr. President, I now speak on a different issue. This is in relation \nto an amendment I have filed on the current pending legislation, the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. I will not offer that amendment at \nthis point because we are still in discussions with the bill's manager \nand the ranking Democrat and their staffs to see if we can find an \nappropriate offset for this amendment. It is one I offer with Senator \nLugar as my cosponsor. I believe it is a very important amendment. It \nis an amendment to provide $10 million in additional funding to expand \nand develop new team nutrition programs across the country.\n  Senator Lugar and I offer this amendment in light of the growing and \nprofound evidence that our Nation must confront what both the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human \nServices refer to as our ``growing epidemic of childhood obesity.''\n  As Eric Bost, the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer \nServices, testified before Congress in April of this year:\n\n       Nearly 365,000 deaths a year are related to poor diet and \n     physical inactivity; poor diet and inactivity are the second \n     leading cause of preventable death after smoking.\n\n  He added:\n\n       In the past 20 years the percentage of children who are \n     overweight has doubled and the percentage of adolescents who \n     are overweight has more than tripled. If we do not stem this \n     tide, this may be the first generation of children who will \n     not have a longer life expectancy than their parents.\n\n  According to a 2005 Institute of Medicine report, there are \napproximately 9 million children nationwide over the age of 6 who are \nconsidered obese, resulting in increases in children being diagnosed \nwith type II diabetes and hypertension. In addition to the negative \neffects on the health and well-being of these children, the rise in \nchildhood obesity has a profound economic cost for our country.\n  Between 1979 and 1999, obesity-associated hospital costs for children \nbetween the ages of 6 and 17 more than tripled, according to a study \npublished in Children Pediatrics. To combat this, the administration \nhas launched an initiative it refers to as part of its larger healthier \nU.S. initiative. It is called the Healthier U.S. School Challenge, \nwhich is focused on helping children live longer, better, and healthier \nlives.\n  Secretary Ann Veneman and the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nannounced in July of this year:\n\n       The school challenge builds upon the Team Nutrition Program \n     and recognizes schools that achieve nutrition and physical \n     activity standards.\n\n  The School Challenge and Team Nutrition requires schools to do \nessentially five things: One, to serve national school lunch meals that \nare verified to meet nutrition standards; second, to offer nutrition \neducation, which is the purpose of the amendment Senator Lugar and I \nare offering; third, to maintain national school lunch participation \nabove certain levels; fourth, to offer physical activity for students \nin those schools; and fifth, to ensure that all foods offered through \nthe school meet healthy standards as reflected in the dietary \nguidelines for Americans.\n  Although there are 28,000 schools nationwide that are participating \nas of October of last year as Team Nutrition schools, that is far from \nadequate. There are way too many schools that are not participating \nthat should be participating. In fact, these programs are chronically \nunderfunded. Team nutrition has once again been proposed by the \nadministration, and in the current spending bill before the Senate the \nproposed funding is $10 million. This is equivalent to 21 cents per \nyear for every child in public school in this country. There is nobody \nwho could credibly argue that 21 cents per child per year is an \nadequate funding level for nutrition education. Unfortunately, the $10 \nmillion that has been proposed this year for funding in this program is \nwhat was proposed last year. It is what was proposed the year before. \nEssentially, we are on auto pilot in the Department of Agriculture with \nregard to this program. There is no effort to\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\nmove ahead and deal with the very real, new challenges we have in \ntrying to teach nutrition to the young people of this country.\n  Furthermore, there is not a single set of funding in over half of the \nStates in the country as Team Nutrition dollars are only going to 21 \nStates. Unfortunately, New Mexico is one of those States and is not \nable to participate in Team Nutrition at any level because the funding \nis so inadequate.\n  Today, one in seven young people is obese in this country; one in \nthree is overweight. Obese children are twice as likely as nonobese \nchildren to become obese adults. Only 2 percent of children consume a \ndiet that meets the five main recommendations of a healthy diet from \nthe food guide pyramid that is published by the Secretary of \nAgriculture, and three out of four children in the United States \nconsume more saturated fat than is recommended in the dietary \nguidelines for Americans published by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  We need to support any effort we can to curb this growing obesity \nproblem. We need to support making our children healthier today by \nteaching them and the adults in their lives about the importance of \nhealthy eating habits and physical activity.\n  I urge the support of my amendment and Senator Lugar's amendment. As \nI indicated, we will not call it for consideration or a vote at this \ntime, but hope we are able to find an appropriate offset and get \nagreement to add this amendment to the legislation.\n  I would argue, I think without any reservation, that this is a small \ninvestment. It is a first step, but it is an important step we should \nbe making as a Nation to confront the profound and growing problem many \nchildren in our society face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we understand in the House bill there is \none section that deals with the country-of-origin labeling. This has \nbeen one of the most heated debates we have had in the livestock \nindustry. It seems like it comes up every year.\n  In 2002, a mandatory country-of-origin labeling law was passed in the \nfarm bill. I remind my colleagues it is the law of the land. It was \nsigned into law. USDA was directed to start writing the administrative \nrules that all meat being imported into the United States have a label \non it and also that meat domestically produced would also have a label \nsaying: ``Made in the U.S.A.'' That was in 2002. That was 3 years ago. \nWe have gone through this debate, and I know sometimes it gets carried \naway and is very emotional. I understand in the House bill there is \nanother delay in putting the rules into effect.\n  Now, whether you agree or do not agree with the mandatory law, it is \nthe law of the land. This old business of delay and delay and delay \ndoes not do anything for our beef or pork producers because there is no \nconsistency in the law. They do not know what to expect and what to do.\n  In Montana, my producers are tired of waiting. The USDA published a \nproposed rule on mandatory country-of-origin labeling on October 27, \n2003.\n  The public had a chance to comment. In fact, they even extended the \ncomment period to give folks extra time to weigh in on this important \nissue. Three years have gone by, and here we are--no progress on \nlabeling. This is unacceptable. The Department needs to publish a final \nrule, and they need to do it now. It is long past time to implement \ncountry-of-origin labeling. It is the law of the land. If you don't \nlike the law, then repeal the law. But let's move on. At a minimum, at \nleast let us take a look at the rule. Congress voted to delay COOL once \nalready, and the anti-COOL forces are at it again. But we don't know \nwhat the labeling requirements will look like. So the USDA needs to act \nand to take a leadership role, and it needs to be published.\n  My producers in Montana will not tolerate another day of delay in \nthis important program. We need to get it done, and it needs to be done \nright. And it needs to be mandatory. If Congress votes to make COOL \nvoluntary, they may just as well repeal the law because voluntary COOL, \nor country-of-origin labeling, will not work.\n  In October of 2002, the Secretary did publish guidelines for a \nvoluntary labeling program. Any retailer who chose could begin labeling \ntheir products. There is a lot of misconception and misinformation. \nSome would contend that if we have a mandatory labeling law, that would \ntake precedence over a marketing label. In other words, if you wanted \nto label beef as certified Angus beef, they couldn't do that. Sure, \nthey can do that. They can do it as long as it is domestically \nproduced, and the vast majority of it is, or any other marketing tool \nthat a State should have or that a product should have can still be \npublished, but we have to have a label USA.\n  Since we put it off and the voluntary rule has been in effect, I \nwonder if anybody knows how many people took advantage of that \nvoluntary program. It doesn't take long to count them: zero, none, \nzilch. Some of my friends say before we mandate a program, let's try \nmaking it voluntary. Well, we tried that. It has been a 3-year period. \nNobody has used it. Nobody participated in a voluntary labeling \nprogram. Now it is time to shift the balance of power to the world of \nagricultural marketing.\n  Overwhelmingly, the folks who support country-of-origin labeling are \nsmall cow/calf producers. These are the people who work hard every day \nto raise healthy calves, produce a product, highest quality beef in the \nworld. They take a lot of pride in their products. They want consumers \nto know that their beef was made in America, made in the good old USA. \nBut they don't have a whole lot to say about this decision, though, \nbecause after they sell their calves, they go to a feedlot, and from \nthe feedlot they go into processing. From processing they go into the \nretail channels. Somebody doesn't want to say this is a product of the \nUSA. Costly, have to trace, herd ID--all of those things, yes, there \nwill probably be a little work to it. But labeling is no more than \nputting the label on of their own logo. It is time we did it.\n  Cow/calf people right now have not had much luck in sharing our pride \nwith our product. That is why Congress must act. Congress has acted. We \nhave passed mandatory COOL 2002. It is the law of the land. That is the \nway it should be. Yet every year when Congress takes up Agriculture \nappropriations, we face another attempt on the part of some to prevent \ncattle producers from marketing their products as U.S. origin. What I \nam saying today is; enough is enough. Congress passed the law. Let's \nimplement it. Producers are tired of waiting around. If you don't like \nthe law, then repeal the law. But don't keep us in this limbo of \nstanding here and waiting for something to happen, knowing that it \nnever will.\n  I know we will try and deal with this, whether it be on the Senate \nfloor--I would probably prefer not because the chairman of the \nAgriculture appropriations said maybe this is a time that we should \nhave a little scrap in conference, and that is where I think it should \nbe done. I trust his judgment on that. But, nonetheless, I want \neverybody to know--and I want the House of Representatives to know--\nthat this is irresponsible. You passed that law just like we did. If \nyou didn't like the law, then for goodness' sake, stand up and have \nnerve enough to repeal it. But if it is not repealed, let's implement \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Country of Origin Labeling\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about part of \nthe Senate bill that has to do with the identification of livestock \nproducts and the country of origin labeling. This is an issue we have \ntalked about for some time and one that I think is very important. It \nis important to my State and to livestock producers there.\n  Country of origin labeling is a very simple thing: When you go into \nthe store to buy a package of meat, it says on there where it comes \nfrom. That is not a unique idea. We do it on T-shirts and jackets and \neverything else and often many other foods. I think people would like \nto know, and have the right to know, where that product comes from.\n  Country of origin labeling actually was put on the Agriculture bill \nabout 3 years ago, I believe. I was one of the original sponsors of the \namendment that put it on the Agriculture bill in 2002, as a matter of \nfact. It has been around since. It simply says that consumers have the \nright to know what was the origin of this particular product that they \nare buying. It can be done by identifying the product as it comes off \nthe farm or range and following it through the process. It does not \nrequire the same thing for hamburger or mixed food, which would be very \ndifficult.\n  I believe most consumers support mandatory labeling and many nations \nrequire it on many kinds of foods and other products, including the \nUnited States. But this bill, even though it passed originally, has \nbeen postponed several times. I think there is something to that effect \nin the House appropriations bill now. It is time we do it. We ought to \ncome to the snubbing post and get something done. It can be done. It \nhas been done other places. I think there is support for doing it.\n  There is labeling of fish, shellfish, and other foods, and that \nappears to be working. As I said, it has been delayed more than once, \nand I think the idea is it would be put in place in 2006.\n  I am asking, as we bring this bill to completion and come on to \nworking with the House in the conference, that we make sure we allow \nthis bill, that has been passed and approved by the House and the \nSenate in the past, to go on and become law.\n  I will not take a great deal more time. I wish to point out it is \nsomething, No. 1, that can be done; No. 2, that there has been support \nfor doing it. What we have done is kept postponing doing it. There are \nsome people, some of the retailers and so on, who do not want to have \nto go to the trouble. But I think the process, for the consumers, is a \ngood idea. People should have the right and they have the desire, I \nbelieve, to know the source of the product that they and their family \nare going to consume. I ask, as we go forward with this bill, we should \nkeep that in mind and seek to complete this whole action, allowing it \nto move forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that there are three \namendments at the desk; one offered by Senator Gordon Smith, one \noffered by Senator John McCain, and one offered by Max Baucus.\n  I ask these amendments be called up and considered en bloc. They are \namendments No. 1786, for Senator Smith; No. 1785, for Senator McCain; \nand No. 1800, for Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In a time of national catastrophe, it is the \n     responsibility of Congress and the Executive Branch to take \n     quick and decisive action to help those in need.\n       (2) The size, scope, and complexity of Hurricane Katrina \n     are unprecedented, and the emergency response and long-term \n     recovery efforts will be extensive and require significant \n     resources.\n       (3) It is the responsibility of Congress and the Executive \n     Branch to ensure the financial stability of the nation by \n     being good stewards of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any funding directive contained in this Act, or its \n     accompanying report, that is not specifically authorized in \n     any Federal law as of the date of enactment of this section, \n     or Act or resolution passed by the Senate during the 1st \n     Session of the 109th Congress prior to such date, or proposed \n     in pursuance to an estimate submitted in accordance with law, \n     that is for the benefit of an identifiable program, project, \n     activity, entity, or jurisdiction and is not directly related \n     to the impact of Hurricane Katrina, may be redirected to \n     recovery efforts if the appropriate head of an agency or \n     department determines, after consultation with appropriate \n     Congressional Committees, that the funding directive is not \n     of national significance or is not in the public interest.\n\n                           amendment no. 1785\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is \nnearly identical to the amendment that was adopted unanimously last \nweek during debate on the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill. \nIt is another attempt to reign in wasteful spending, particularly \nduring this time when portions of our country along the gulf are \nenduring the devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina--indeed, a \nnational tragedy.\n  As our Nation continues to manage the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, \nthe Congress and the administration must do what it can to help the \nhundreds of thousands of victims of one of the worst natural disasters \nin our history. And now, another hurricane is gaining momentum which \ncould cause even more serious destruction to the region.\n  The costs of the recovery and relief effort will be enormous. We have \nalready appropriated more than $62 billion, and that is likely a mere \ndownpayment on the yet to be determined total expenditures that will be \nrequired. Indeed, we live in times of great need and limited resources.\n  Americans are being called to sacrifice, and so many are selflessly \ncontributing what they can to the recovery efforts--they are donating \nmoney, opening their homes, or offering other useful assistance. \nCongress needs to do its part too. To the extent that it is possible, \nwe should pay for this effort now rather than pass on even more debt to \nfuture generations. We should also make better use of taxpayers' money \nby eliminating wasteful spending, and that is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  This year's Agriculture appropriations bill, and particularly its \naccompanying report, contain numerous questionable earmarks, the \nmajority of which warrant further review, particularly given the \ncircumstances that have arisen since the bill was reported by the \nAppropriations Committee in July.\n  Here are just a few examples: $2,000,000 for the National Sheep \nIndustry Improvement Center; $50,000 earmarked to study the shiitake \nmushroom; $300,000 for USDA research at the Utah State University Space \nDynamics Laboratory to accurately measure gaseous emissions from \nagriculture operations; $200,000 for grapefruit juice/drug interaction \nresearch in Winterhaven, FL; $140,000 to the University of Nevada Reno \nto conduct a feasibility study for a cooperative sheep slaughter \nfacility; $1,000,000 for grasshopper and Mormon cricket pest control in \nthe State of Utah; $24,066,000 above the budget request for boll weevil \npest management; $1,150,000 above the budget request for grasshopper \npest management; $300,000 for biological weed control in Sidney, MT; \n$300,000 for the healthy beef initiative, Little Rock, AR; $200,000 to \nstudy sudden oak death in Oregon; $600,000 for cranberry production \nassistance in the States of Massachusetts and Wisconsin; $6,000,000 for \nthe construction of the Animal Waste Management Research Laboratory in \nBowling, KY; $1,000,000 for multiflora rose control in the State of \nWest Virginia; $1,500,000 for the construction of the Center for Grape \nGenomics in Geneva, NY; $100,000 earmarked for animal identification \nand tracking in the State of Washington; $100,000 for brown tree snake \nmanagement in Hawaii and Guam; $248,000 to reduce beaver damage to \ncropland and forests in the State of Wisconsin; and $400,000 earmarked \nfor preventing blackbird damage to sunflowers in North and South \nDakota.\n  Certainly I must not be the only one who questions these kinds of \nearmarks. We simply cannot afford ``business as usual'' around here.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendment that I am proposing would allow for \na redirection of the funding for any of the earmarks that have not been \nauthorized, have not been requested by the President, or are not \nrelated to the impact of Hurricane Katrina to be used for recovery \nefforts. This would occur if the agency or Department head determines, \nafter consultation with the appropriate congressional committees--and \nthis would mean authorizers as well as appropriators--that such an \nearmark is not of national significance or is not in the public \ninterest. Since almost all of these earmarks are in the report \nlanguage, which is not something I can amend, this amendment at least \nsends a strong message to the agencies that they will be held \naccountable for reviewing these directives and ensuring they are only \nfunded if found to be in the public interest.\n  I hope the amendment can be easily adopted and not take much of the \nSenate's time, particularly since a similar provision was agreed to \nlast week. In a time of national catastrophe, it is the responsibility \nof the U.S. Congress to take quick and decisive action to help those in \nneed. It is not appropriate to continue the practice of wastefully \nearmarking scarce funds in the face of such a great tragedy. This \nshould be a time of sacrifice for the sake of our suffering citizens.\n  Mr. President, despite high gas prices, despite a swelling $331 \nbillion deficit, despite our military operations overseas, and despite \nour domestic emergencies, pork continues to thrive in good times and \nbad. The cumulative effect of these earmarks erodes the integrity of \nthe appropriations process and, by extension, our responsibility to the \ntaxpayer.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee for \nagreeing to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when a seat on the Supreme Court opened in \nJuly, I made a promise to the people of California. I promised I would \nonly support a nominee I believed would protect their rights and \nfreedoms.\n  After much thought, I have concluded that I cannot in good conscience \ngive my constituents that assurance with the nominee we have before the \nSenate, Judge John Roberts. In fact, I am very worried that with Judge \nRoberts on the Supreme Court, the rights and freedoms that have made \nAmerica a light to the rest of the world could be in serious jeopardy.\n  The question before the Senate is not whether Judge Roberts is a \nbrilliant lawyer and not whether he is well qualified or well spoken or \naffable or unflappable. He is certainly all of those. But examining his \ncredentials is where our analysis must begin, not end. The American \npeople understand this. In poll after poll after poll, the American \npeople say that before we vote, it is important to know where Judge \nRoberts stands on key issues that define us as Americans and what kind \nof country we will leave behind for our children.\n  The next Chief Justice will have the opportunity to steer a deeply \ndivided Court and influence our lives and the lives of our families for \ngenerations. In recent years, the Court has issued 5-to-4 decisions to \nprotect our air, to safeguard women's reproductive health and the \nrights of the disabled, to give HMO patients the right to a second \nopinion, to allow universities to use affirmative action, and to \nguarantee government neutrality toward religion.\n  With so many of our fundamental rights hanging in the balance, it is \nnot good enough, in my view, to simply roll the dice, hoping a nominee \nwill change his past views. It is not good enough to think this is the \nbest we can expect from this President. I simply do not buy into that \nreasoning. And no, I don't buy into this reasoning either: Let's \nsupport this nominee because the next one might be worse. I will tell \nyou why that rationale does not work for me and it will never work for \nme as long as the Constitution gives me and my colleagues in the Senate \nan equal role in this process.\n  It fails the bar that I set--the bar that says that I must be able to \nlook into the eyes of my constituents and assure them that I feel \nconfident in this choice. I said I could only vote for a nominee who \nwould protect the rights and the freedoms of the people I represent.\n  I need to be able to look into the eyes of my constituents and to \nassure them I have made that judgment before I vote yes in their name. \nI can't do it here. We must demand far more in a nominee because the \npeople we represent deserve no less.\n  I will vote no on this nomination because of what we know and what we \ndo not know about Judge Roberts.\n  Long before President Bush made this nomination, we knew that his \nmodel judges were Justices Scalia and Thomas.\n  Now, President Bush isn't known for changing his mind, so that \ndoesn't leave us in a good place if we're hoping for a moderate. Nor \ndoes a reading of Judge Robert's record while he served in the Reagan \nAdministration 20 years ago.\n  In fact, some of Judge Roberts's writings raise serious concerns \nabout whether he understands the ugly history of discrimination and \ninjustice in our country, or the proper role of government in injustice \nand discrimination.\n  Of course, we were told over and over again by Judge Roberts and by \nthis administration and some of his supporters: Do not pay attention to \nthose memos; they were written long ago; he was just a young man; he \nwas just a lowly staff attorney. Here is the point: Judge Roberts never \nbacked away from those memos. When given the chance, he said over and \nover again they were written for someone else. Someone else is not up \nfor the Supreme Court; Judge Roberts is up for the Supreme Court. So to \nsimply say, Yes, I wrote that, but I wrote it for someone else, just \ndoes not pass the test.\n  Then we try to examine Judge Roberts' tenure years later as a top \npolitical appointee under the first President Bush. That is when he \nworked as Deputy Solicitor General for Ken Starr,\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\nwho was the Solicitor General. Again and again, Senator Leahy, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Feinstein, all the Democrat Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee asked for documents relating to just 16 cases that would have \nshed some light on the way Judge Roberts approaches civil rights, \nreproductive health, the separation of church and state, environmental \nprotection, and more. The Democratic women Senators asked too. But \nagain and again, the administration refused to turn over the documents, \nand Judge Roberts refused to help us.\n  The President had access to that information when he nominated Judge \nRoberts. Why should this Senate a full partner in choosing the next \nJustice--have anything less?\n  This is not a small point of process. This goes to the heart and soul \nof what we are expected to do as Senators. We are supposed to be an \nequal partner in this process. We have the role of advice and consent \nto the President on judicial nominations. How can we do our job if the \nadministration has access to information and yet we don't? I don't \nthink it is fair. I don't think it is just.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for making her statement and \nparticularly her comments about the effort by the Judiciary Committee \nto seek some 16 of the 300 cases in which Judge Roberts was involved as \na Deputy Solicitor General.\n\n  As Judge Roberts pointed out during the hearings, when he was acting \nas the Solicitor General, he was acting as America's lawyer. That was \nnot being a part of the Republican administration. The Solicitor \nGeneral is to act as America's lawyer. That is why even Robert Bork, \nwhen he was Solicitor General, gave the information to the committee; \nand Brad Reynolds, who was in the Solicitor General's Office, also gave \nthe materials from the Solicitor General to the committee.\n  As I have listened to the Senator, this is basically Judge Roberts' \njob interview for America. The members of the Judiciary Committee are \njust instruments to try to help the American people understand this \nnominee. It seems to me if the material had been favorable to Judge \nRoberts, they probably would have made it available. I imagine the \nAmerican people are wondering, since others have made it available, why \nthey did not make it available for him and why they denied the American \npeople additional helpful information so they would be able to make up \ntheir own minds during the course of the hearing.\n  I underline the point the Senator made about the importance of \ninformation and the importance of documents. Would the Senator not \nagree this is basically Judge Roberts' interview with America, that the \nJudiciary Committee is the instrument by which the American people are \nforming an impression? It is a worthwhile part.\n  This is no more a client-lawyer relationship than the man in the \nmoon, although some have suggested that. This is a longstanding process \nwhere that material has been made available to the Judiciary Committee. \nI have had the good opportunity to sit for some 20 nominees, I have \nseen the different procedures followed, and I have seen when it has \nworked the best. The information has been made available to the \nAmerican people, and this is the point the Senator is making.\n  I wanted to ask the Senator if she agreed with me that this is his \njob interview with America?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for asking me this question. I could \nnot agree more. The American people have told us through many polls \nthat they want to have this information. They want to know. They \nbelieve it is more important and I believe the number was 77 percent \nsaid it was more important to know about where Judge Roberts stood than \nit was to know about his qualifications. Everyone agrees on his \nqualifications. The Senator is absolutely right. It is, to me, very \ndisappointing that the judge himself refused to help us.\n  It is also my understanding--and Senator Kennedy, if I am wrong, I \nhope you will correct me--that when Judge Rehnquist was up for the \nCourt, he also turned over documents from when he was a lawyer in \ngovernment. So we had Judge Rehnquist, we had Robert Bork, and that was \nthe right thing to do.\n  You have to ask the question, What are they hiding? The American \npeople are very smart. They understand it. Why wouldn't one show the \ncommittee this information?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The point being this was only a request for 16 cases out \nof the 300 cases he actually participated in directly. There were many \nmore where he expressed an opinion. These 16 directly involve \nconstitutional issues. One was on a case involving affirmative action \nwhere the Federal Communications Commission asked the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office to support their program on affirmative action because \nno major television stations were available to any of the minorities, \nBlack or Brown, in this country, and they were trying to work out a \nprocess where there could be greater availability and they would be \nable to participate in these various bids that were coming in. They \nrequested the Solicitor General to help them. They had a program. It \nhad been approved. They asked the Solicitor General's Office to help \nthem with their program.\n  What happened is not only did Mr. Roberts decide he wouldn't help \nthem, he filed a brief for the Solicitor General's Office in opposition \nto the agency's program that would have opened up greater competition, \ngreater diversity in terms of communication and ownership. That is \nexceptionally done, rarely ever done. All we were trying to find out \nwas the circumstances--why did this happen, this unique set of \ncircumstances?\n  Clearly, if we had enough time, I suppose we could have had the \nFederal communications lawyers at that time come in, and we could have \ntried to do our own kind of investigation on this particular case. But \nthat is not what these hearings are all about, and that was \nillustrative of the type of case that was being requested and was \ndenied to the Judiciary Committee, which had a direct relevancy as to \nhis competency--whether we were going to continue to march toward \nprogress in striking down the walls of discrimination, the walls of \ndenial of opportunity, the gender discrimination which we have had in \nthis country and which we made very substantial progress in over the \nperiod of the last 30 years with title IX, the actions that we have \ntaken in terms of the 1964, 1965 Act, the 1968 Housing Act.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator, I think what we have tried to do in \nthis little exchange is make a point to the American people that \ninformation was denied to the Judiciary Committee, and that information \nwas denied to the Senate. And, the only information we have is very \nslim. It is a 2-year stint on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  We have a lot of information from 20 years ago. So on the one hand, \nit is kind of a catch-22 circumstance here. When you go back 20 years \nago, everybody says: Oh, that is old information. It does not reflect \nJudge Roberts. You ask Judge Roberts, he won't answer. He says he was \nwriting for someone else. So we then need to look at the time in the \n1990s when he worked in the Solicitor General's office. But, we cannot \nget that information. So we go around in a circle.\n  I have to say, if this debate were about a small matter, it would be \none thing. But, we are talking about the future of this country. The \nimportance of a position on the U.S. Supreme Court cannot be \noverstated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On those memoranda, I think the Senator quite \nappropriately recorded that he had written those a number of years ago. \nAnd he, when he was asked about those memos, indicated he was just \nworking for the administration. Of course, he made the application to \nwork for the administration; he was vetted for the administration; he \ngot the job with the administration. So this was something he very much \nwanted to do. He was constantly promoted within the administration. He \ncould have very easily worked in another area. As John Lewis pointed \nout, this was a key moment in American history in terms of the march \ntoward progress and moving ahead in terms of knocking down walls of \ndiscrimination.\n\n[[Page S10275]]\n\n  I say, as a member of the committee, I was disappointed that Judge \nRoberts would not say whether those were his views today. That was the \nkey. You can accept that, well, he was just an attorney in the Ford \nadministration and was carrying on the administration's policy, \nalthough I think that is a stretch in many of the different memoranda \nthat he wrote, when he explicitly said ``this is my opinion'' and ``I \nbelieve,'' as compared to ``we believe'' or ``it is our position.'' I \nthink that is very distinguishable.\n  But, nonetheless, he was asked repeatedly, as I mentioned in my \ncomments earlier, by Senator Kohl, by Senator Feingold, by Senator \nBiden, and other members of the committee, are those his views today? I \nexpected he would say, ``well, you know, times have changed. I wouldn't \nhave used those words. I wouldn't have come, perhaps, to those \nconclusions,'' which would have been very understandable. But there is \nnot a single instance--not a single instance--during the course of \nthose hearings where he said: Those are not my views today. I have \nchanged my position.\n  I think the Senator appropriately points out that aspect of the \nhearings and why that is troublesome. Because we only can conclude if \nhe does not disown those positions, they may very well be his positions \ntoday, which would be very disturbing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator, again you are making a very \nimportant point. The fact is, Senators on the Judiciary Committee--and \nI watched every minute of the hearings I could. I even watched the \nreruns of your hearings in the evening. You gave Judge Roberts ample \nopportunity in a very nice way to distance himself from his writings. \nHe refused to do so. He simply said: I was doing this for my boss, and \nI was thinking like my boss. It is not good enough because he is the \none who is up for Chief Justice.\n  I know Senator Bennett would like me to conclude, and I will do so.\n  In his reviewing his record, I also looked for some assurance in the \ndecisions Judge Roberts wrote during his two years on the DC Circuit. \nBut, again, nothing. In fact, some cases raised serious concerns about \nhis commitment to protect the environment and his support of an all-\npowerful executive branch.\n  Judge Roberts had three days to tell the Senate and the American \npeople what he really believes today.\n  He had the chance repeatedly to distance himself from the \ncontroversial positions he once advocated. He did not.\n  Let's face it: Judge Roberts was specific only when it mattered least \nand evasive when it mattered most.\n  Last year I ran for the Senate, and I ran a commercial that people \nsaid was very direct, but that is the kind of Senator I am. I said in \nmy own words, right in that commercial, I would do everything in my \npower to ensure that we never go back to those dark days of back-alley \nabortions, when thousands of women died and many others were rendered \ninfertile.\n  We know that Judge Roberts signed a brief calling for Roe to be \noverturned. It was one of those 16 cases the administration will not \nrelease. And it concerned one of the many important topics about which \nJudge Roberts refused to answer questions.\n\n  To simply say Roe is a precedent, which he said over and over again, \nis stating the obvious. Every case of the Supreme Court is a precedent. \nAnd to say you respect precedent, yes, every judge must respect \nprecedent. But it does not give us an inkling into his views, and that \nis not good enough.\n  We deserved an answer to Senator Feinstein's questions about privacy: \nDoes the right to privacy extend to the beginning of life and the end \nof life? We still don't know what Judge Roberts believes.\n  We deserved an answer to Senator Biden's question about gender \ndiscrimination. Does Judge Roberts stand by an interpretation of title \nIX that would have denied all remedies to a girl who was repeatedly \nsexually harassed by her teacher? We still do not know how Judge \nRoberts feels.\n  We deserved an answer to Senator Kennedy's probing questions about \ncivil rights. Does Judge Roberts have any concerns about the \nconstitutionality of landmark civil rights laws? We still do not know.\n  How could he be silent on those laws. They stand out in history as \nlandmark moments that changed the course of human events in America \nforever, that finally spoke to all our citizens and told them they were \nequal, and the government would make sure they were protected and safe.\n  We deserved answers to Senator Leahy's questions about Congressional \nWar Powers. We did not get them.\n  Now, Judge Roberts says as a Justice, he will ``just'' be an umpire \ncalling balls and strikes. Of course, balls and strikes look a lot \ndifferent depending on where the umpire is standing. And umpires have a \nlot of power to decide who wins and who loses.\n  So who will be the winners if we confirm Judge Roberts next week? \nWill it be the families of America? Will it be the children of America? \nWill it be the victims of violence? Will it be the poor and the \npowerless? Will it be the middle class? Will it be the environment? \nWill it be freedom? Will it be liberty? Will it be justice? Will it be \nour Constitution? Or will the winners be those who want to stop the \nnational Government from acting to protect and defend our people and \ntheir rights and their freedoms?\n  I cannot tell my people that Judge Roberts will continue the steady \nmarch of progress that has defined our country's proud history.\n  So I will vote no. And because I believe the Senate deserves those 16 \ncases that Senator Kennedy talked about, and answers to our questions, \nI will vote no.\n  I hope and pray my doubts about Judge Roberts are misplaced and that \nhe will join the moderate wing of the Court to protect the Constitution \nof this country that I love so much and the deserving people of my \ngreat State who will be counting on him to protect their rights and \ntheir freedoms.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the hour of 4 o'clock has come and gone. \nThat was the hour by which all amendments to the bill had to be \nsubmitted. We had 120. We have disposed affirmatively of 31 of those, \nand we are not at all sure the other roughly 90 are all going to be \noffered.\n  The majority leader has made it clear he wants to finish this bill \ntonight, and so I say to those who have amendments still on the list, \nif they do not show up to offer their amendments, we will move to third \nreading at an appropriate time. We want to accommodate the majority \nleader's desire. I think it is the desire of most of the Members of the \nSenate to move forward. So I say to the other Members who do have \namendments, you are on notice that if you do not let us know you are \ngoing to be here and try to reserve some time to call up your \namendment, we will indeed move to third reading. There are hotlines \nthat have been going out to Senators who have amendments filed to give \nthem that message. We will go forward in that fashion.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1754 and 1755\n\n  Mr. President, I do have two additional amendments to those that have \nalready been cleared, which I send to the desk and ask for their \nimmediate consideration. Both are on behalf of Senator Salazar of \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments will be \nconsidered en bloc. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], for Mr. Salazar, \n     proposes amendments numbered 1754 and 1755 en bloc.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1754\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a report on the impact of increased prices of \n gas, natural gas, and diesel on agricultural producers, ranchers, and \n                           rural communities)\n\n       On page 173, after line 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7___. Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture, in \n     cooperation with the Secretary of Energy, shall provide to \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives a \n     report that describes the impact of increased prices of gas,\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\n     natural gas, and diesel on agricultural producers, ranchers, \n     and rural communities.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1755\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Agriculture to prepare a report \n   on the conduct of activities to address bark beetle infestations)\n\n       On page 173, after line 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7___. The Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in \n     this section as the ``Secretary'') shall prepare a report for \n     submission by the President to Congress, along with the \n     fiscal year 2007 budget request under section 1105 of title \n     31, United States Code, that--\n       (1) identifies measures to address bark beetle infestation \n     and the impacts of bark beetle infestation as the first \n     priority for assistance under the Healthy Forests Restoration \n     Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.);\n       (2) describes activities that will be conducted by the \n     Secretary to address bark beetle infestations and the impacts \n     of bark beetle infestations;\n       (3) describes the financial and technical resources that \n     will be dedicated by the Secretary to measures to address \n     bark beetle infestations and the impacts of the infestations; \n     and\n       (4) describes the manner in which the Secretary will \n     coordinate with the Secretary of the Interior and State and \n     local governments in conducting the activities under \n     paragraph (2).\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I call for a vote on the two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1754 and 1755) were agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. With that, Mr. President, we continue to go through the \namendments that are available to us to see if they can be cleared on \nboth sides in an effort to get them cleared. But I say, once again, to \nSenators who may be watching, we need to have an understanding of \nwhether you are coming forward. We will soon reach the point where the \namendments that can be cleared on both sides have been. At that point, \nif a Senator has not notified us of his intention to proceed and has \nnot shown up, we will move to third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah should be advised that \nin my capacity as a Senator from Oklahoma, I plan to offer amendments, \nand I will make those arrangements forthwith.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Presiding Officer. We were aware of his \nintention to offer his amendments, and we will not take advantage of \nhim being trapped in the Chair to move ahead without protecting his \nrights and his interests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1760, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a brief colloquy with \nSenator Cochran, who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, to discuss agriculture disaster assistance. The purpose of \nthis colloquy is to set the stage for withdrawing a pending amendment \nwhich I am sure the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from \nUtah, will be happy to hear.\n  This has been a tough year for agricultural producers from coast to \ncoast. Hurricane Katrina has decimated production throughout the gulf \ncoast. The most recent USDA estimates released yesterday put hurricane-\nrelated losses in that region at nearly $900 million as a result of \nHurricane Katrina. Having just visited this region with Senator Cochran \na few days ago, I am not surprised. The devastation there is \nunimaginable, until one is on the scene.\n  In addition, we have had a terrible drought in the Midwest--in my \nhome State of Illinois, Missouri, parts of Iowa, and Minnesota. We have \nhad the worst drought in over 100 years in some parts of my State. \nEvery county but one in Illinois has been designated a disaster area by \nthe Secretary of Agriculture. Corn that should be standing 10 feet tall \nin some of the most fertile ground in America barely measures 6 feet \nand, sadly, is not going to produce much. The same is true for many of \nmy counties when it comes to soybean production.\n  These drought conditions have reduced crop yields. Based on September \nUSDA estimates of 2005 crop production and prices, the value of corn \nand soybean production in Illinois has been reduced by over $792 \nmillion, relative to what might have been expected under average \ngrowing conditions. In addition to these losses, there may be impacts \non other crops and pastures as well.\n  We also face flooding in parts of North Dakota, red tide problems in \nNew England that are shutting down shellfish producers who depend on \nthe sea for their livelihoods, and an extended drought in the West and \nparts of the South, including Arkansas.\n  During this uncertain time, it is important to ensure that our \nagricultural producers stay in business. Most producers depend on \nfarming for their livelihoods. In addition, there is an intrinsic good \nin knowing our food has been grown locally, is regulated by the Federal \nand State Governments, and is the safest in the world. We all benefit \nwhen American farmers are prosperous. For all of these reasons, I hope \nto ensure that our farmers, ranchers, and others who face disaster \nlosses have their day in court when it comes to our Federal Government.\n  We have done this in the past. Last year, following a series of \nhurricanes, we enacted legislation to provide assistance to farmers who \nexperienced crop loss.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Mississippi to include agriculture \nlosses incurred due to Hurricane Katrina and other national disasters, \nincluding the drought in the Midwest, in the next Katrina supplemental \npackage.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Mississippi for a response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my friend from \nIllinois in bringing to the attention of the Senate the fact that there \nhave been substantial losses that have occurred as a result of \nHurricane Katrina, particularly in the States of Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama.\n  Having visited the State, as the Senator pointed out, just recently, \nit makes a vivid impression upon anyone who looks upon the widespread \ndisaster that was caused by this dreadful hurricane.\n  While we do have on the books Federal crop insurance programs, other \ndisaster assistance authorization, there always seems to be examples in \na disaster of this kind of unmet needs and where, for some reason or \nanother, the effect of the disaster is not fully protected by existing \nprograms.\n  I am pleased to note, on page 88 in the committee report accompanying \nthis appropriations bill, the committee includes information about the \nrecent amendments to the Agricultural Risk Protection Act. It amended \nthe original Federal Crop Insurance Act to strengthen the safety net \nfor agricultural producers by providing greater access to more \naffordable risk management tools and improved protection from \nproduction and income loss and to improve the efficiency and integrity \nof the Federal Crop Insurance Program.\n  So progress has been made, but notwithstanding, I agree to work with \nthe Senator from Illinois and the chairman of the subcommittee to craft \nlanguage and funding that would be approved by the Senate, it is my \nhope, in any supplemental bill which the administration may request.\n  It is my understanding, from a visit yesterday with the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, it is expected that the \nadministration will request an additional appropriation supplementing \nthe funds that are available for many Government agencies and some \ndepartments to continue to provide disaster assistance to help recover \nfrom this dreadful hurricane.\n  In that legislation, when it does come before the Senate, we will \nwork together to ensure that an appropriate provision is included, as \ndescribed by the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \ncoming over to the floor because I know\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\nthere are thousands of agricultural producers across the United States \nwho were anxious to hear we are mindful of the disasters they have \nfaced and in the region of Hurricane Katrina and other natural \ndisasters across our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following cosponsors be added to the \namendment I have sent to the desk: My colleague from Illinois, Senator \nObama, who shares my feelings on the drought that has faced our State, \nas well as my colleague from across the Mississippi River, Senator \nBond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, with this colloquy, however, I feel \nconfident we can work together to resolve this problem in a reasonable \nway and, as a consequence, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 1760.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, for his work in crafting this \nlegislation, of which I am a cosponsor. This amendment would provide \ncritically needed disaster relief to Illinois farmers who face \nsignificant financial jeopardy from crop losses due to this season's \nhistoric drought.\n  Illinois agriculture is experiencing one of the driest periods in the \nlast century and certainly one of the most severe droughts in two \ndecades. Illinois is the Nation's leading producer of corn and \nsoybeans. However, U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, reports show \nthat more than half of the corn crop and almost a third of the soybean \ncrop have been decimated by drought. Of the 102 counties in Illinois, \n98 have reported crop damage due to the lack of rainfall.\n  In July, Senator Durbin and I asked the Secretary of Agriculture to \ndeclare the affected counties in Illinois an agriculture disaster area. \nI am pleased that President Bush granted our request to give our \nIllinois farmers some much-deserved relief, qualifying Illinois farmers \nfor USDA assistance programs, including low-interest emergency loans.\n  While this action provided an important amount of economic \nassistance, the scope and severity of this year's drought requires that \nadditional measures be taken. At the present time, most of northern and \nwestern Illinois remains in a severe or extreme drought. Much of \neastern Illinois is classified as abnormally dry. This is particularly \nalarming because farmers are at a critical point in the growing season.\n  Moreover, the reduction in fuel refining capacity caused by Hurricane \nKatrina has resulted in Illinois farmers facing a sudden surge in \nunanticipated fuel costs on top of already escalating fuel prices. The \ndisruption in Mississippi River traffic at gulf ports, where half of \nthe Nation's grain exports are shipped for foreign markets, has spiked \nshipping costs for farm commodities transported by barge downriver. The \nthreat of an aflatoxin outbreak that affects corn during times of crop \nstress and drought is also of particular concern in recent weeks; \nshould this condition progress after harvest and storage, farmers may \nface additional financial consequences in the coming months.\n  I understand that the Senior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, \nhas made a commitment to address this issue in the next hurricane \nsupplemental appropriations bill that is sent to Congress. Given that \ncommitment, I support Senator Durbin's decision to withdraw the \namendment, and I thank Senator Cochran for his cooperation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are making progress. I see the Senator \nfrom Minnesota on the floor and hope that he can proceed with his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Is there an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment pending.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1844, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1844 and send a \nmodification to the desk and ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1744, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 88, line 16, strike ``$23,103,000'' and insert \n     ``$21,103,000''.\n       On page 109, line 21, before the period at the end, insert \n     the following: ``: Provided further, That none of the funds \n     made available by this Act may be used to carry out section \n     508A(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1508A(c)) in a manner that, for purposes of counties declared \n     to be disaster areas in calendar year 2005 by the Secretary \n     under section 321(a) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural \n     Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961(a)) or by the President under \n     the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), applies the phrase \n     `in the same crop year' to have a meaning other than not \n     later than October 15 of the year in which the first crop was \n     prevented from being planted''.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It \naddresses the severe crisis in counties in northwestern Minnesota that \nwere flooded last June after they had planted their crops. Many farmers \nin that region of my State lost most or even all of their crops. So the \npreventive planting program has been established which allows them to \nplant alfalfa and other cover. It says, after November 1, they may \nharvest the crop or graze on the crop. That works well for most of the \ncountry, but whoever wrote that date into law some time ago forgot to \ncheck the weather maps as they pertain to northern Minnesota which, by \nNovember 1, is often under snow.\n  The intent of the program is to provide for the ecological covering \nof the affected acreage, then allowing for farmers to salvage something \noff the land in addition to the preventive payment from the Government \nby harvesting it or allowing grazing on it. The effective date is too \nlate to benefit Minnesota farmers.\n  This amendment would simply say, for those counties in Minnesota and \nelsewhere across the country that have been declared an agriculture \ndisaster in this calendar year by either the President of the United \nStates or by the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to their \nauthorities, that they would then, for the purpose of this year only, \nbe able to use that acreage for harvesting or grazing effective October \n15. It moves up the timetable.\n  I think it preserves the original and actual intent of the program, \nand it means it applies to northern Minnesota, as it does to the rest \nof the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMinnesota does involve some cost. We are, at the moment, unable to have \na score from CBO. We are working on getting a scoring from CBO, so I \nask we not vote on this amendment at the present time, until we get \nthat.\n  I will say to the Senator and to Senators, generally, since the \npassage of the bill by the committee, we have had a number of requests, \nsuch as the one from the Senator from Minnesota, many of which appear \nto be meritorious but when added together, we get a sum of money that \nwe simply cannot sustain under our allocation. So we have taken the \nposition that we will not entertain these additional requests for \nmoney.\n  There are a number of Senators who have been disappointed as a result \nof that position, including, if I may say, the Senator from Utah. I \nfelt that I had to deal with everybody equally, and those requests that \nhave come in from my own State since the passage of the bill by the \ncommittee, with some difficulty, I have had to say to people, I cannot \ntreat Utah differently than others.\n  This is a meritorious issue the Senator has raised, and I am not \nsaying we will automatically oppose it because it does add to the list \nthat I described. Because we want to know exactly what the number would \nbe and get the information from CBO, I ask that we set this one aside \nfor the time being, and when we have that information, then I\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\nwill be in a better position to respond to the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I say \nthat the practice of the committee chairman of treating himself equally \nwith anyone else should be noted and praised. I commend it to the rest \nof the committee chairmen and ranking members as well. I thank the \nchairman for his remarks.\n  I apologize for the late moment and also the absence of a score. I \nhad received a score today on a broader amendment, which was $2 million \nfor this coming fiscal year 2006. I was asked to restrict the \namendment. I believe, quite confidently, when the score is obtained, it \nwill be less than that $2 million.\n  I am mindful of the imperatives on the subcommittee that they have to \nmeet the mark they have been given. I recognize this will have an \nimpact on that. I hope my staff might work with the chairman's staff \nand look for some suitable offset and some way to address this issue.\n  I thank the chairman for his consideration. I apologize again for \nadding to his burdens.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comment and \nassure him this is no burden, and we will do the best we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, in a few moments, I will offer several \namendments, but I feel inclined, because of what we have heard about \nthe last two or three amendments that have come forward here, to \ncomment.\n  There are products offered called crop insurance. It is very \nimportant for us as a Senate to remember that everything in life has \nrisk. As we look at Katrina and the tremendous issues that have come \nforward, not everybody who has a loss in this country is entitled for \nthe Federal taxpayers to pay for that loss. If my house burns down and \nI am underinsured, is that a Federal Government responsibility? At what \nlevel do we recognize personal responsibility and risk in terms of \nnatural events?\n  There is no question we are going to be working hard to do our part \nat the Federal level to aid those involved in the tragedy of Hurricane \nKatrina, but the very idea that now we are considering helping those \npeople means we jump on with everybody else who has a need in this \ncountry right now is a very dangerous trend that I guarantee we cannot \nafford.\n  I applaud the statement of the Senator from Utah in recognizing there \nis a limit to what we can afford. I know these issues will come through \nin regular order and process, but I think it has to be said that these \nare meritorious, that is right, but they are going to have to be listed \nwith the rest of the priorities in this country of what has to come \nfirst.\n  We do not have an unending source of funds, although sometimes we act \nas if we do. These are going to have to be put in that order of \npriority. I am sure this body will do that in terms of priority, but \nwhat we cannot do is continue to mortgage the future of the next two \ngenerations by not making those hard choices.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1773\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment 1773.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1773.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reduce spending levels, to promote more efficient use of \n     resources, and to encourage more appropriate budget estimates)\n\n       On page 122, line 24, strike ``$653,102,000'' and insert \n     ``$610,754,560''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is the first of many amendments I am \ngoing to be offering the rest of the year to make a downpayment for our \ngrandchildren to pay for Hurricane Katrina. I start small, but there \nare many in Washington who say we cannot do it, that there is not the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, there are not significant dollars that are not \nspent wisely and prioritized. This is one that I am not sure will pass, \nbut it certainly cannot not be recognized by anybody who looks at the \nbooks of the rental assistance program that this is an appropriate \namendment. The appropriation for this program in 2005 was $587,264,000. \nThe budget estimate for 2006 was $650 million, the House allowance was \n$650 million, and the committee recommendation is $653 million.\n  According to the committee, this program and the objective of the \nprogram is to reduce rents paid by low-income families living in rural \nhousing service financed with rental projects and farm labor housing \nprojects. That is a meritorious goal. It is something we ought to be \ndoing, and I fully support doing that. However, the payments from the \nfund are made to the project owner for the difference between the \ntenant's payment and the approved rental rate established for the unit.\n  Why would I offer an amendment to trim that back? It is because the \nrental assistance program has been gaming us, according to the \nGovernment Accountability Office. Let me explain how.\n  In March 2004, they reported that since 1990--this is 14 years--the \nrental housing program had consistently overestimated its budget needs \nfor the rental assistance program. Concern had arisen about the issue \nin early 2003 because RLS reported hundreds of millions in unexpended \nbalances tied to its rental assistance contracts. Specifically, in \nestimating the needs for rental assistance contracts, it routinely uses \nhigher inflation factors than recommended by OMB, did not apply the \ninflation rates that are recommended to each year of a contract, and \nbased the estimates of future spending on recent high usage rather than \nthe average usage of the rental assistance program.\n  First, the agency used inflated factors that were higher than those \nrecommended by the OMB budget process, that they didn't apply it \nseparately to each year, but they did it cumulatively to gain the \namount of money they were asking from Congress. The result was an \ninflation rate that was more than five times the rate of the last year \nthan the first year. So therefore the numbers they are asking for and \nthe balances that are retained are high. And they are not utilizing the \nmoney we are appropriating. They are just accumulating money. RLS based \nits estimates of future expenditures on recent maximum expenditures--\nand that may very well be right, but that is what we are doing in \nsupplementals, that is what we have done the supplementals for--rather \nthan the average rates for which the units were funded historically.\n  According to GAO in its most recent report the agency was not \nfollowing the guidelines, and they actually overestimated their need \nlast year by $51 million or 6 percent of their appropriations. That is \nnot Tom Coburn saying that. That is the General Accounting Office \nsaying it. The GAO has harshly criticized the agency for lacking proper \ninternal control standards through its administration of this program. \nAs a matter of fact, one single employee has largely been responsible \nfor both budget estimating and allocating rental assistance funds. This \namendment simply reduces it from a growth rate of 10 percent to a \ngrowth rate of 4 percent. That is higher than our rate of inflation, \nbut it brings it back in line.\n\n  The agency has proven it cannot forecast its real needs accurately. \nIt has not forecast its real needs accurately. It fails to track its \nreal needs and fails to track its basic expenditures.\n  Let me underscore one point. This program will still receive a $23.5 \nmillion increase this year under this amendment. If we hope to approach \nany type of fiscal sanity in the Senate or in this country through this \nGovernment, then we have to start holding\n\n[[Page S10279]]\n\nagencies accountable. We can have all the GAO reports we want. If they \nkeep getting the money on the same basis that they are getting the \nmoney, then we are not going to change behavior. What we want to do is \nnot hurt one person who is relying on us for this rental assistance, \nbut what we do want is the agency to apply and come up to the standards \nthat are recognized as necessary in the Federal Government.\n  This is one of several amendments I will be offering over the next \ncouple of months. But it proves to the American taxpayer that we can do \nbetter. My hope is that the committee will look at this amendment, \ndecide that the GAO was right, decide that they have overestimated it, \nand trim back this money.\n  This money is money that can be saved and used to start to offset the \ncosts of this catastrophe that is in front of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma is correct in \nthe comments that he makes about the GAO and their study of this \nprogram. We have looked into it for the same reasons that the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has and find that there have been mistakes made and there \nhave been overestimates made. However, we have also discovered that the \nDepartment has recognized this and has made changes in the program, and \nthe Department has reacted to the criticism that has come from the GAO.\n  The estimates that we have before us in this bill we believe are \nsound and the concern we have is that there is, in fact, no extra money \nsitting around. If we were to accept the amendment the Senator has \noffered, there would, in fact, be people who are currently in low-\nincome housing who would lose that housing. They would lose that \nhousing immediately upon passage of this bill.\n  It is further, of course, exacerbated by the situation created by \nKatrina, in that people have lost their housing by virtue of the \nhurricane, and to see others who have not been affected by the \nhurricane turned out because of the cutback in this program is \nsomething I do not think anybody would want to see.\n  The President requested $650 million, as the Senator said. We are at \n$653 million, based on the information that we have from the \nDepartment, which we now believe is far more accurate than the \ninformation of previous years. The GAO criticism is correct about \nmisestimates.\n  Also, we point out these are 4-year contracts, so that something that \nappears to be money sitting there is, in fact, not necessarily money \nsitting there. It is money that has been committed over the 4-year \ncontract. This is not just a single year's appropriation.\n  For these reasons I would have to oppose the amendment of the Senator \nbecause I believe in the present circumstances we do not want to have \nthe consequence of having people who are currently in housing, \ncurrently receiving aid under this program, lose that aid and have to \nleave their housing. If it were entirely prospective, I would be more \nsympathetic to the amendment of the Senator, but all of the information \nI have is that it would, in fact, cause people who are currently \nreceiving this to lose their housing.\n  I know the Senator from Oklahoma has some other amendments. I would \nlike to give as much notice as possible to Senators around the city as \nto when we would take a vote. The Senator from Oklahoma says he would \nlike to have this the subject of a rollcall vote. Of course, we will \naccommodate him. But if we could find out what other amendments the \nSenator has, and see if we could have a discussion and then set a time \nfor those votes to be stacked--if indeed he wishes to have additional \nrollcall votes?\n  I ask if the Senator could respond to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond. The Senator \nfrom Utah has my great respect. I know he is an accountant and has a \ntremendous background in terms of finance. But if you overestimate for \nthe 3 years prior to coming into this before you change it, and you \nhave contracts based on that that were overestimated, you do have an \nexcess of funds in there now. There will be no shortage of rental \npayments because of the over-roll of the overpayments, the overestimate \nof the contracts that have been made.\n\n  The good answer for the American people is this is going to throw \npeople out. It is not going to throw a person out. There is plenty of \nmoney in this account. There is almost $50 million at the end of this \nyear left in this account that is not expended and can be spent. So it \nis not accurate to say people will not be able to have the homes that \nthey have.\n  I think the Senator will agree that if, in fact, you overestimate \ninflation rates 4 years running, and you have been appropriated all \nthat money looking forward for that, and you had contracts on costs \nthat were less than that, if anything the surplus will grow if the \nusage is the same.\n  To make the argument that we should not do this because somebody \nmight be thrown out, when, in fact, it is not accurate based on the \nfunding that is in this account at this time, doesn't do justice to the \nvery problems that we have before us.\n  I do not expect this amendment to pass, and I probably will not ask \nfor a rollcall vote. I don't know what I am going to do in terms of \nasking for a rollcall vote. But it is that kind of thing we have to \nlook at. We have to tighten our belts. There is loose money in this \nprogram. It can be done better. They have demonstrated they have \nstarted to do better, but they have not demonstrated they are doing \nbetter. What I would ask is for us to send a message: Do better. It \ndoesn't undercut the first person we are trying to help. We have \nalready sent $62 billion out there for this disaster, and we are \nplanning on sending more. If we need to make an adjustment in one of \nthose appropriations bills, if in fact I am wrong and you are right--\nwhich I do not believe to be the case--we can do it then. But send the \nsignal: Do it right, do it efficiently, and do it for the best price \nyou can because our grandchildren are counting on you.\n  I hope at some point in time we will start getting to the realization \nthat we have to start making some choices. This is a choice that is not \ngoing to hurt the first person, but it is going to change an agency to \nmake them recognize you are going to start playing with real numbers \nand quit gaming the system. They have a cushion. They know they have a \ncushion. I believe the appropriators and accounting staff know they \nhave a cushion, and we ought to take that cushion away and make them do \nwhat they should be doing.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am unaware of the existence of the \ncushion. I would be happy to work with the Senator to try to find out \nexactly whether there is one and how much it is. But the information \nthat I received both from the staff and, admittedly, from the \nDepartment, is there is no cushion and passage of this amendment would, \nin fact, cause people who are currently in housing to lose their \nhousing.\n  I am not in a position to challenge the Senator's sources. I simply \nstate that my sources have given me an additional answer. I have not \nlooked over the books. I have not personally gone into the accounting \nof this situation, and therefore I am not in a position to do any more \nthan state, as I have stated, that my information is different than \nhis.\n  Clearly, this is a subject that needs to be pursued. I congratulate \nhim on raising it. The question for the Senate now is how we proceed on \nthis amendment, whether the Senator will ask for a rollcall vote and, \nif he does, when we schedule it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may state his inquiry.\n  Mr. COBURN. Does a decision on a rollcall vote have to be made at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is not under any obligation to ask \nfor the yeas and nays at this time.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will defer that at this time and have a discussion with \nthe Senator from Utah about having a vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Very good. We will have that discussion. As I say, my \ndesire is to give Senators notice if they are at a location \nsufficiently far from\n\n[[Page S10280]]\n\nthe Capitol that they need a heads up. That is the only concern that I \nhave. I will be here. I will be prepared to vote virtually at any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1796\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \nSenate amendment No. 1796.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Hearing none, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for Mr. \n     Jeffords, proposes amendment numbered 1796.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funds to carry out the historic barn preservation \n                        program, with an offset)\n\n       On page 85, line 15, strike ``$128,072,000'' and insert \n     ``$126,072,000''.\n       On page 126, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n\n                   HISTORIC BARN PRESERVATION PROGRAM\n\n       For the historic barn preservation program established \n     under section 379A of the Consolidated Farm and Rural \n     Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2008o), $2,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent to lay the amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1775\n\n  (Purpose: To require that any limitation, directive, or earmarking \n   contained in either the House of Representatives or Senate report \n accompanying this bill be included in the conference report or joint \n  statement accompanying the bill in order to be considered as having \n               been approved by both Houses of Congress)\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1775 and ask to \nset the pending amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1775:\n         At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n         Sec. __. Any limitation, directive, or earmarking \n     contained in either the House of Representatives or Senate \n     report accompanying H.R. 2744 shall also be included in the \n     conference report or joint statement accompanying H.R. 2744 \n     in order to be considered as having been approved by both \n     Houses of Congress.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment I offered earlier in \nthe year on a previous appropriations bill. I want to set the stage for \nthis because I think this is probably one of the most important \namendments I will offer in the Senate. It is important the American \npublic recognize what this amendment does.\n  Appropriations bills start in the House. They come to the Senate. \nThey are met in conference.\n  In the House bill there is report language. In the Senate bill there \nis report language. In that report language is where you find out where \nthe money is going to be spent. The purpose of this amendment is to \nmake sure, when a bill comes out of conference, that the Members of \nthis body know where all the money is going to be spent before they \nvote on the bill.\n  There is no lack of desire for many of us who want to know that, but \nit is hard to find out as you approach the conference bill; that is, \nfor us. But it is also difficult for the American people to know.\n  What this amendment is about is about sunshine. It is about sunshine \non the legislative process so that the American people know items that \nare special projects for Members of Congress, items that have been \nearmarked or especially directed that we ought to know of, and what \nthat is ought to be in the report language, where it is going and to \nwhom it is going.\n  This amendment received 34 votes last time. I think it is absolutely \nimperative for us to keep the integrity of our appropriations process \nso that we know, No. 1, what is in the bills that we vote on and have \navailable to us--that information on report language, but, No. 2, for \nthe American people to know.\n  It has been said they can find it on the Internet. They can if they \ncare to really dig through it. But if there is report language that has \nit where you can go to, you can, in fact, know before we vote what the \nspecial interests are that influence the appropriations bills of this \ncountry.\n  This is simply saying sunshine, let us know what is in it, let us \nprint what is in it, and let us not deny what is in it. If it is good, \ngreat; if not, take the lumps that go along with it.\n  If you are doing a special favor for someone, or earmarking one of \nyour political constituencies, it ought to be out there, and it ought \nto be looked at.\n  This is a simple, straightforward amendment that we ought to honestly \nsay that we like sunshine rather than darkness and less than \nstraightforwardness.\n  It is my hope that the body will again consider this and add it to \nthis bill so that, when we go to conference, everybody understands what \nis in the bill when it comes out of conference. We are going to know \nwhat is in the bill, and we will not have to play games to know what is \nin the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I examine this question, it is a \nquestion that involves the traditions and procedures of the full \ncommittee. At the risk of being accused of dodging, I would prefer to \nhave Senator Cochran as chairman of the full committee examine and \nrespond.\n  We have reached out to get hold of Senator Cochran to see if he is \nwilling to do that. But this would be a departure from previous \nprocedures.\n  As I understand, the Senator from Oklahoma would like there to be a \npermanent departure that occurs on virtually every appropriations bill \nfrom here on out. For that reason, I am a little reluctant to set a \nprecedent on the bill over which I have responsibility which might then \nbe cited as a precedent for all the other bills that would follow.\n  For that reason, I hope we can have Senator Cochran appear and have \nhis position before we come to the question of whether or not we vote \non it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, so the Members of the body know, I intend \nto offer this on every bill that doesn't have it. Some of the bills \nhave had it but some have not. So my intention is to offer this \namendment for the next 6 years on every appropriations bill that comes \nthrough because I believe more information going to the American public \nis a whole lot better than information hidden and sequestered away from \nthem to know what we are doing.\n  We are accountable. If we are doing our work, then we ought to be \nproud of our work, and we ought to put it out.\n  I will be happy to discuss this with the chairman of the committee. \nHe knows. I have had this debate with him before. I am persistent, and \nthe Senator from Utah knows that. I believe the people of Oklahoma \nbelieve it. I believe that the vast majority of Americans believe it. \nWe ought to know what we are voting on, where the money is going and \nwho is going to benefit from it ought to be printed.\n  On this amendment, I ask for the yeas and nays, and I ask for a \nrollcall vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1773\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I call for the regular order on the \nCoburn amendment No. 1773.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I call for a vote on this by voice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1773) was rejected.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 7 o'clock be evenly divided between myself and Senator \nBingaman from New Mexico, with the vote on the Coburn amendment No. \n1775 to occur at 7 o'clock to be followed by a vote on the Bingaman \namendment, with the yeas and nays ordered in both instances with no \nother amendments being allowed to either amendment prior to the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  It shall be in order to order the yeas and nays on any amendment at \nthis time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair states that at 7 o'clock a rollcall \nvote will occur on the Coburn amendment, followed by a vote on the \nBingaman amendment, with the time between now and then evenly divided \nbetween the Senator from Utah and the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that between the \ntwo votes there be a period of 2 minutes for explanation equally \ndivided between the Senator from New Mexico and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I thank my \ncolleague from Utah for his courtesy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1797\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Lugar, proposes an amendment numbered 1797.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 85, line 15, strike ``$128,072,000'' and insert \n     ``$118,072,000''.\n       On page 132, line 24, strike ``$12,412,027,000'' and insert \n     ``$12,422,027,000''.\n       On page 132, line 26, strike ``$7,224,406,000'' and insert \n     ``$7,234,406,000''.\n       On page 133, line 6, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That not less than \n     $20,025,000 shall be available to implement and administer \n     Team Nutrition programs of the Department of Agriculture''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment I described earlier \ntoday, but let me describe it briefly again because it is very \nstraightforward.\n  Each year, when the administration sends the Congress its budget \nrequest for the Department of Agriculture, it asks for $10 million for \nnutrition education. It is the Team Nutrition programs sponsored by the \nDepartment of Agriculture. This is funding that goes to 21 States to \ntry to assist them in providing nutrition education in the schools. The \nother 29 States get no funds. My State gets no funds because there is \nnot enough being appropriated. This program cannot cover more than the \n21 States that are currently covered. So the children in my State do \nnot get the benefit of this nutrition activity.\n  Why is nutrition education an important issue for this Congress and \nthis country at this time in our history? I would suggest that the best \ncase for explaining that is set out in this letter which I received \nfrom the American Heart Association endorsing the amendment that I am \noffering on behalf of myself and Senator Lugar. Senator Lugar is the \ncosponsor of my amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       American Heart Association,\n\n\n                                  American Stroke Association,\n\n                                               September 21, 2005.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the American Heart \n     Association and its division, the American Stroke \n     Association, I am pleased to offer our support for \n     legislation that would expand funding for Team Nutrition. \n     This program provides funding to states to support nutrition \n     education and promote physical activity in schools. The \n     current funding level of $10 million provides support to only \n     21 States. The additional funding would be used to expand the \n     program so that more young people could obtain the knowledge \n     and skills necessary to make healthy lifestyle choices.\n       Overweight and obesity, especially among children, have \n     emerged as serious threats to our nation's health. Today, \n     about 16 percent of all children and teens in the United \n     States are overweight. Obesity is a major risk factor for \n     coronary heart disease, which can lead to heart attack. \n     Obesity can also induce diabetes, which makes the danger of \n     heart attack especially high. Recent research suggests that \n     obesity shortens the average lifespan by at least four to \n     nine months, and if childhood obesity continues to increase, \n     it could cut two to five years from the average lifespan. \n     This could cause our current generation of children to become \n     the first in American history to live shorter lives than \n     their parents. Besides its toll on health, obesity \n     contributes significantly to rising health care costs. The \n     World Bank has estimated the cost of obesity at 12 percent of \n     the nation's healthcare budget.\n       The American Heart Association is committed to lowering \n     rates of overweight and obesity in the United States by \n     helping Americans make better nutrition choices and by \n     facilitating increased levels of physical activity at all \n     ages. We support program and activities like those in your \n     amendment, that can help reduce rates of obesity, \n     cardiovascular disease and stroke. We commend you for your \n     leadership on this issue and look forward to working with you \n     to advance this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sue A. Nelson,\n                                  Vice President Federal Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will read parts of this letter so \npeople can understand the case that is being made.\n  The American Heart Association letter directed to me, signed by Sue \nNelson, Vice President for Federal Advocacy, says:\n\n       Overweight and obesity, especially among children, have \n     merged as serious threats to our Nation's health. Today, \n     about 16 percent of all children and teens in the United \n     States are overweight. Obesity is the major risk factor for \n     coronary heart disease which can lead to heart attack. \n     Obesity can induce diabetes which makes the danger of heart \n     attack especially high. Recent research suggests that obesity \n     shortens the average lifespan by at least 4 to 9 months, and \n     if childhood obesity continues to increase it could cut 2 to \n     5 years from the average lifespan. It could cause our current \n     generation of children to be the first in American history to \n     live shorter lives than their parents. Besides its toll on \n     health, obesity contributes significantly to rising health \n     care costs.\n\n  The World Bank has estimated that the cost of obesity is 12 percent \nof this country's overall health care budget.\n  The problem is we don't seem to be willing to connect the dots. We \ndon't seem to be willing to say if we spent a little more on something \nlike nutrition education, maybe we would not have to spend 12 percent \nof our health care budget to deal with the problem of obesity. That is \nthe simple reality.\n  All I am saying is, let's begin to connect the dots and put a \nreasonable amount of funding into the effort to provide instruction to \nchildren in our schools about how to eat a decent diet and maintain a \ndecent body weight. That is the entire purpose of the amendment.\n  We used to appropriate more money for nutrition education than we do \ntoday. Unfortunately, the last 3 years we have fallen into an automatic \n$10 million a year. That means no new States can participate in the \nprogram. It means no new students can get the benefit of this \ninstruction. To my mind that is not an acceptable circumstance, \nparticularly with this change in the lifestyle of Americans which we \nsee all around us.\n  We need to provide good information to our young people so they can \ngrow up and lead healthy productive lives. We are not doing that today. \nWhen you look around other parts of the Federal budget and say, well, \nokay, maybe the Department of Agriculture is not providing help with \nthis, but maybe the Department of Education is. They are not. This is \nthe only effort being made by the Federal Government to assist.\n  We have a lot of lofty statements being made by the administration. I\n\n[[Page S10282]]\n\nwelcome those statements. We need to follow through with some reality \nin addition to the statements. The administration has launched an \ninitiative. It refers to this initiative as the Healthier United States \nSchool Challenge, and it focuses on helping children to live longer, \nbetter, and healthier lives.\n  Our former Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman and the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture announced in July that the school challenge \nbuilds upon the team nutrition program and recognizes schools that have \nobtained nutrition and physical activity standards. So we are \nannouncing initiatives and calling them the Healthier United States \nSchool Challenge, but we are not willing to put in funds to allow the \nprograms to be available to most children in this country. To my mind, \nthat is not a responsible course. We can do better.\n  I offered an amendment similar to this 2 years ago in the Senate when \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill came up. At that time I was told, \nno, there is no money; we cannot afford to do this. I withdrew the \namendment at that time and I was encouraged because both the managers \nof the bill advised they would try to find additional funds. They were \nnot able to do that. I am sure in good faith they tried. They were not \nable to do that. Accordingly, we are still at $10 million.\n  I don't know of any other way to get this issue dealt with other than \nto ask the Senate to please vote on this. Please support my amendment \nand Senator Lugar's amendment and increase this funding. The offset we \nhave chosen is one that is called CCE, common computer environment. It \nis a $128 million item in the budget for improving the coordination of \nthe computing in the various parts of the Department of Agriculture. I \nam sure it is a worthy purpose, but I would be willing to see that \nreduced by $10 million so we could put that $10 million into child \nnutrition education. That is the purpose of that amendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it. At this time I have used my 10 \nminutes and I will go ahead and yield the floor and have a chance to \nexplain it very briefly before the actual vote occurs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, there is no question but that an \neducation program to try to get our young people to eat better makes \nsense. There is no question that we should do what we can to deal with \nthe challenge of obesity.\n  Now let us look at a few realities with which we are faced. The \nPresident requested $10.25 million for the program. The amendment \noffered by Senator Bingaman and Senator Lugar would virtually double \nthat amount. There is no other program we are dealing with where the \nrequest is to double the funds. We have people who are requesting \nincremental increases of 5 percent and 10 percent, but quite frankly we \nhave resisted.\n  The total number of earmarks and requests that have come in since the \ncommittee acted is over $50 million. We have stood firm against all of \nthem and said we are sorry, the money isn't there. We feel we have to \nstand firm against it. So this $10 million would double the program as \nit currently exists and would be 20 percent of the total amount we on \nthe subcommittee have said we cannot fund.\n  The offset is very interesting. It is the common computer \nenvironment. It always seems easy to say, well, we can get by, by \ndelaying activity with the computers. Let's cut the computers because \neducation is more important.\n  During the debate we have had today, we have heard complaints from \npeople about interoperability, about inability to communicate in the \ntime of emergency. Katrina has exposed problems with computers. If we \nwere to cut the computer program as drastically as this would cut it, \nwe run the risk of closing county offices. We run the risk of stopping \nthe modernization of services right at a time when complaints are \ncoming in about how antiquated those services are.\n  But interestingly, as the $50 million requests have come in, almost \nall of them, when we told them you have to have an offset, say let's \ncut the computers. If indeed we responded to every one of the requests \nfor additional spending, we would have cut the computers $50 million.\n  I don't want to cut the computers at all. I accept the arguments that \nsay we have challenges with communication in the Department; we need to \nhave as modern a communication system as we possibly can. The common \ncomputer environment that is trying to create that interoperability \nshould be encouraged and maintained.\n  For that reason, as fond as I am of the Senator from New Mexico and \nthe Senator from Indiana, I have to oppose this amendment. I will ask \nmy colleagues, when the time comes for the rollcall vote, to oppose it. \nThere will be another bill next year. We will see where we are next \nyear with overall spending. We will see where we are with respect to \nemergencies and how the Department of Agriculture is dealing with those \nemergencies.\n  I am convinced when we come to that, as we sift through all the \ndamage that is done by Katrina and perhaps by Rita and other \nchallenges, we would like to have as powerful and as modern a computer \nsystem to deal with communications as we possibly can.\n  For those reasons, the doubling of a program at a time of budget \nconstraints that we find ourselves in, and taking the offset from a \nprogram where we feel we need to be as modern as we possibly can, gives \nme two reasons to say that I would be opposed to this amendment.\n  I still have an additional 5 minutes and I frankly have said all I \nneed to say. I yield back the remainder of my time. If the Senator from \nNew Mexico wishes to claim it, I am happy to have him use it; \notherwise, we can go into a quorum call until such time as the vote \nstarts at 7 o'clock, unless there are other Senators who wish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will speak for another couple of minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Murkowski and Senator Coburn \nas cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me make one point. This is \nrequesting that we double the size of this program, but at the current \ntime, we are spending 21 cents per child per year on nutrition \neducation out of the Federal Government. This is suggesting we might \nwant to spend up to 42 cents per child per year.\n  I remember when I offered this amendment 2 years ago, Senator Byrd \nsaid we ought to at least provide as much per child as it costs to buy \na candy bar. I thought that was pretty good insight.\n  I see my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, wishes to speak \nbriefly.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an area I am all too familiar \nwith. If we are going to solve the health care crisis in America, it \nstarts with prevention. In the year 2070, one out of every $2 of \nMedicare we spend will be for diabetes. Fifty percent of the diabetes \nthat will occur in the future can be prevented by good nutrition \neducation in the early years, not only of the children but of the \nparents.\n  This is a fantastic amendment. I told the Senator from New Mexico I \nwished I had thought of it. For every $1 we spend on prevention, we get \n$17 back. For every $1 we spend on computers, we probably get $2 or $3 \nback. It comes back to the questions of priorities.\n  This is a great idea. I understand the resistance to not cut anything \nin a bill that comes to the floor from a Committee on Appropriations. I \nunderstand that. But I think of all the amendments I have heard, \nincluding mine, other than sunshine, this is the best I have heard \nbecause it will have the greatest impact. We get the most value for the \ndollars we spend. That is what we should be about. I heartily support \nthe amendment and I hope the Senate will too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we have had previous conversations about \nthe effectiveness of the Agriculture Department. We are talking about \nour own backgrounds. I have a little bit of\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n\nbackground in advertising. I would be anxious before we spend this \nmoney to do a little analysis of how effective the advertising has \nbeen.\n  You talk about instruction in schools. We all know that there are \ninstructions that work and there are instructions that don't. My own \nexperience is that the Government is not very good at advertising \nhealthy lifestyle changes. We could have been spending--I have no idea. \nWe have not researched this at all. I have no idea where the evidence \nmight be. We could have been spending the 21 cents per pupil and \nwasting every bit of it in terms of results.\n  I have something of a background in advertising and I know how much \nadvertising budgets get wasted simply because the advertising campaign \nis not effectively carried out.\n  I recommend to my colleagues we defeat this amendment and if, indeed, \nthe Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from New Mexico can examine \nthis from their background and demonstrate we are getting a 17-to-1 \nreturn from this particular program, that we are getting a 17-to-1 \nreturn from the kind of instruction going on in classrooms, then I \nwould be happy to endorse this at some future time.\n  In terms of what has been the result of the $10 million we have been \nspending, how certain will we be that doubling that is going to, in \nfact, increase health among our children? It may well be that a GAO \nstudy would say the $10 million has been spent on training materials \nthat have been ineffective and produced no result whatever.\n  In effect, we are being asked to buy something of a pig in a poke \nwithout understanding exactly how it works. I hope we would stay with \nthe committee allocation here. The issue is a very legitimate issue. I, \nfor one, will be more than willing in the hearings to ask the \nDepartment to give us a demonstration of how effective this has been.\n  If it can be demonstrated that it has, in fact, reduced obesity and \nhas had some impact on diabetes, at that point I would be all for \ndoubling it or tripling it because of the 17-to-1 figure the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma cites. But lacking that information, in this particular \nsituation I would be loathe to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1775\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non agreeing to the Coburn amendment No. 1775. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) and the Senator from Wyoming \n(Mr. Enzi).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nCorzine), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from \nMaryland (Ms. Mikulski), and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) are necessary absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune).

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request in \nwhich all Senators, I believe, will be interested.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the next vote, \nthere be no other rollcall votes until 9:30 tomorrow morning, with the \nunderstanding that all amendments will be offered tonight, all debate \nwill take place tonight, and all votes that occur tomorrow will be \nstacked to be followed by final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BENNETT. That means, Mr. President, that there will be no more \nvotes tonight, and amendments that require rollcall votes will be voted \non in the morning, and that we will go to final passage immediately at \n9:30 tomorrow after disposing of any rollcall votes. We have several \namendments pending which we hope we can deal with by voice votes \ntonight, and I hope that we will not have any more rollcall votes and \ncan go immediately to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I certainly understand the chairman's \nsentiments, but I ask the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwhat the impact of this schedule will be on our hearing tomorrow.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the answer to that is, we will work \naround it. We will proceed, and we will get the nominee voted out of \ncommittee. We can accommodate it. That is the answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1797\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nevenly divided on the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico. \nThe Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is being offered by \nmyself, Senator Lugar, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Coburn. The \namendment would add $10 million for child nutrition to the program that \nalready exists in the Department of Agriculture called Team Nutrition. \nThis is the only significant Federal effort we have to assist with \nnutritional education in our schools.\n  Today, it is drastically underfunded. This would allow us to add $10 \nmillion. Instead of spending 21 cents per child per year in this \ncountry on nutritional education from the Federal Government, we would \nbe spending 42 cents.\n  This is an amendment that I think all Members should support. \nClearly, this is needed to deal with the problem of childhood obesity \nthat is becoming an epidemic in our society.\n  I hope my colleagues will all support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the President's request for this program \nwas $10 million. This amendment doubles it and takes the money away \nfrom computers at a time when the Department is doing its very best to \nincrease its interoperability and raise its level of technological \nability. I do not think doubling a program that has not been evaluated \nfor its effectiveness is the right thing to do in this time of heavy \nbudget pressure.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1797. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1835.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1835.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To limit the use of certain funds)\n\n       On page 160, line 10, before the period at the end insert \n     the following: ``or for reimbursement of administrative costs \n     under section 16(a) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. \n     2025(a)) to a State agency for which more than 10 percent of \n     the costs (other than costs for issuance of benefits or \n     nutrition education) are obtained under contract''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I want to commend Senator Bennett \nand Senator Kohl for their work on the bill that is before us today, \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill. They worked hard to put together a \ngood bipartisan bill and overall I find no fault with it. I think it is \na great bill and it will have my support. I thank both Senator Bennett \nand Senator Kohl and their respective staffs for working with me and \nwith my staff on a number of issues that are in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  I want to draw the attention of Senators to page 160 of the bill, \nsection 746:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to \n     study, complete a study of, or enter into a contract with a \n     private party to carry out, without specific authorization in \n     a subsequent Act of Congress, a competitive sourcing activity \n     of the Secretary of Agriculture, including support personnel \n     of the Department of Agriculture, relating to rural \n     development or farm loan programs.\n\n  Well, what does all that say? What it says basically is that the \nDepartment of Agriculture cannot engage in any contracting out to \nprivate contractors applications processes for anyone coming in to get \nany assistance under rural development or farm loan programs. In other \nwords, those have to be carried out by public employees, employees who \nare publicly hired, and that any activity relating to that must go \nthrough those employees.\n  It says basically it has to be that way until we in the Agriculture \nCommittee on the Senate and the House authorize the Department of \nAgriculture to specifically engage in such contracting activity.\n  Do I support section 746? Yes, I think it is a good addition to the \nbill. I do not think the Secretary or the Department ought to be going \nout and contracting out to private entities these kinds of activities \nuntil we have had a chance to look at it, until the authorizing \ncommittees of the Senate and the House have hearings, take into \nconsideration what is involved, and either grant that to the Secretary \nof Agriculture or not grant it.\n  So I think section 746 is basically a sound approach that recognizes \nboth the value of the public sector and public employees, and \nrecognizes the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committees. However, \nthere is something missing from section 746. I believe this same logic \nshould apply to other USDA programs. In particular, I believe we need \nto protect vital services and benefits offered through the Food Stamp \nProgram.\n  The amendment I am offering would apply the same protection that 746 \napplies to farm loan and rural development functions to the Food Stamp \nProgram as well. In other words, my amendment basically says if you \nwant to contract out to private contractors elements of the Food Stamp \nProgram that have to do with application processes, you cannot do it \nuntil it is specifically authorized by Congress--just as the underlying \nbill requires for rural development or farm loan programs.\n  My amendment is basically an extension of the logic of the underlying \nbill. It is not a departure from it. It is not a major policy change. \nIt simply says the Food Stamp Program, like rural development and farm \nloan programs, is a vital public service program. It is not broken, it \nis working well. If you want to make some changes, why don't you come \nto Congress. We will have some hearings, and we will see if it needs to \nbe fixed.\n  I have been on the Agriculture Committee now for 30 years. That is \nright, this is my 30th year, now that I think about it: 10 in the House \nand 20 in the Senate. We have been through a lot in the Food Stamp \nProgram in 30 years. We have always made changes to it to meet changing \ntimes and circumstances. I was one of those who was in the lead on \ngetting rid of food stamps and getting it to an electronic benefit \ntransfer program, where you have a debit program. It has worked well.\n  However, in all of those cases we in the Congress decided on the \nchanges that should be made to the underlying program, not just the \nSecretary of Agriculture. As I said, this program is not broken. In \nfact, recent events have highlighted the value of the Food Stamp \nProgram and the need to protect it from changes that could undermine \nit.\n  Amidst the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina, the Food Stamp \nProgram has nobly and efficiently served those in need.\n  There has been a lot of criticism of the Federal Government's \nresponse to Katrina, but I have heard no criticism of the Food Stamp \nProgram. In many places hit by Katrina, the Disaster Food Stamp Program \nwas one of the first responders. We often think of first responders as \nbeing firefighters and policemen, emergency services personnel. That is \ntrue, they are. But in this case, first responders were also those \npublic employees who helped those most in need get the food they needed \nfor themselves and their families.\n  In Louisiana, nearly 300,000 households are already receiving food \nstamps and have been for the last couple of weeks since the hurricane \nhit. In Texas, another 125,000 households are receiving emergency food \nstamp assistance. Overall, approximately 1 million individuals affected \nor displaced by Hurricane Katrina are receiving emergency food stamp \nbenefits.\n  The USDA was able to respond quickly and set up these programs \nefficiently, in large part because the programs were run by State \nagencies in consultation with the Federal Government. That was their \npurpose. That was their reason for being.\n  Why do we want to allow the Food Stamp Program to be privatized and \nput out to private contractors? Usually you do that if there is a \nproblem, if something is failing to meet the needs of people. I defy \nanyone in this Senate to come up and show me or show anyone where the \nFood Stamp Program is failing to meet the needs of the people it \nserves, or is not being run efficiently.\n  When the next disaster occurs, do we want an outside contractor \nresponsible for running the Disaster Food Stamp Program? Do we in the \nSenate want to open up the program to the risks associated with food \nstamp privatization in general? We can ill-afford to put the Food Stamp \nProgram and the millions who benefit from it at this kind of risk.\n  What do I mean by risk? What is at the bottom of this? We know there \nhas\n\n[[Page S10285]]\n\nbeen a State that is currently seeking permission from the Department \nof Agriculture to privatize food stamps. Here is what they want to do. \nThey want to close a number of food stamp offices where a person goes \nto meet face to face with someone to determine eligibility and get \ntheir approval for food stamps. They want to close about 100 of those \nand open up three call centers. If you want to apply for food stamps, \nthey tell me you are going to have to call on the phone. Or you can go \nonline, as if people who apply for food stamps are sitting at home at \ntheir computers.\n  Let's take the case of these call centers. I have no reason to \nbelieve that it couldn't work like this. Imagine, here are people \ndesperately in need of food stamps. They get a number to call--probably \nan 800 number or something like that, probably toll free, I assume. \nThey call up. A voice answers, an automated voice answering system \nanswers and says: I understand because you are calling you probably \nwant to apply for food stamps. If you want to apply for food stamps and \nyou live in this area, punch 1; if you live in this area, punch 2; if \nyou live in this area, punch 3. You get all the way through and you are \npretty confused about where you live.\n  Let's say you figure it out and you say I am in this area and you \npunch 3. Then another voice comes on and says: OK, we understand you \nlive in this area and you want to apply for food stamps. If you are a \nsingle person, punch 1; if there are two of you, punch 2; if you have a \nfamily of three, punch 3. You see what I am saying? Then you have to \npunch in another entry.\n\n  Another automated voice comes on and says the next step in this \nprocess: If you are over a certain age, press this number; if you are \nunder a certain age, press this number; if you have ever applied for \nfood stamps--do you see what I am getting at? You have a person on the \nphone who wants to apply for food stamps and they are sitting there \ntrying to figure out, punch 3 for this, punch 4 for that.\n  Finally, after they get through all of these automated voice prompts \nthey are probably told: Thank you, your waiting time to talk to the \nnext operator is now 19 minutes. And you have to sit there and listen \nto music. If you are patient enough to wait that long, you are probably \ngoing to get someone on the line you will talk to. For all I know, by \nthe time you actually get to them, the person on the other line may not \neven be in the United States. That is what this is all about.\n  There are some companies that want to do this. They probably figured \nout they can make a lot of money. They hire someone in another country \nfor, I don't know, 50 cents an hour.\n  Again, the underlying bill says you cannot do that if you are a \nutility company and you want to apply for a rural development loan. \nThey don't make you go through call centers. They have someone there \nyou go see.\n  If you are a farmer, if you have a farm, you have assets, you own \nsomething, and you want to apply for a farm loan, you don't have to go \nthrough a call center. You go see someone. But by allowing wholesale \nprivatization of the Food Stamp Program, we would not be providing to \nlow-income Americans the same basic treatment. Poor people have to go \nthrough call centers and get all the runaround that we always get when \nwe try to call and get someone in one of those call centers.\n  That is why section 746 needs to be amended. That is why it needs \nthis addition, so that the Food Stamp Program is treated the same as \nfarm loans or rural development. If they want to change it, have them \ncome up to Congress. We will have hearings. We will take a look at it. \nMaybe they can make a good case. I don't know. But I am just concerned \nif we do not add this amendment, that waivers will be given that will \nallow contracting out the food stamp operations.\n  Furthermore, this may undo a lot of the progress we have made in \nimproving program integrity. Right now, program error in the Food Stamp \nProgram is the lowest than at any time in its existence. Why do you \nwant to change it? If something is working, why try to fix it? Why \nwould we choose to put these successes at risk by now turning it over \nto untested entities and call centers?\n  Under the current food stamp law, public employees of State food \nstamp agencies are responsible for two essential oversight functions: \nPayment accuracy and an annual self-evaluation of program management. \nBut if these functions are turned over to a private contractor with no \nexperience in running the Food Stamp Program, how do we know if they \nwill be able to maintain program accuracy? Should we just roll the dice \nand take it on faith that they will continue the error rate as low as \nwe have it right now?\n  I want to make it clear, I am not opposed to privatization of certain \nthings. I point out the electronic benefit transfer program under food \nstamps is privatized. It is all run by--I guess Citibank or someone, I \ndon't know, I could be a little wrong on that. But that is fine. There \nis nothing wrong with turning to specialized contractors for technical \nservices like financial operations. What I am talking about is when you \napply for food stamps; when you are in need and you want to apply or \nyou want to modify your food stamps because of another child born or \nsome other thing, something else has happened to change your life. That \nis when you need to have someone there who can help you immediately in \nyour situation and talk to you.\n  Anyway, as I said, my amendment would not stop that. It would not \nstop the private contracting out for EBT, but it certainly would for \nfundamental program functions like application and eligibility \nprocesses.\n  To repeat for emphasis sake, there is no evidence that we have any \nproblems in the Food Stamp Program that requires privatization. The \nerror rate is the lowest ever. The accuracy rate is high. Emergency \nfood stamps for disaster situations have worked extremely well. So \nthere is no evidence, nor have we had a hearing, to suggest that \nprivatizing the Food Stamp Program would in any way improve program \neffectiveness. That is why we should have extensive hearings on this \nbefore allowing any waivers to be granted.\n  The Food Stamp Program is strong. Not only does it deliver much \nneeded food assistance to 25 million Americans, but as we have just \nshown with Katrina, it is serving hundreds of thousands of families, \nover a million people devastated by that hurricane.\n  My amendment simply ensures that the Food Stamp Program remains as it \nis with those public employees best suited to carry it out. It extends \nthe logic that is in Section 1746 of the underlying bill dealing with \nrural development farm and loan programs to the Food Stamp Program as \nwell.\n  As I said, if they want to do something, they can come to the \nAgriculture Committee. We can have hearings and take into account some \nproblems that somebody might feel would be cured by privatizing and \nsetting up these call centers for food stamp applications.\n  I ask for support of the amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask that we proceed to a vote on the \nHarkin amendment by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1835) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nhis kindness and having this vote. Hopefully we can at least keep this \nin as we move ahead going to conference.\n  I thank the chairman for his kindness.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am unaware of any other Senator who is \nplanning to offer any amendment. I don't want to cut anybody off, but I \nmade it clear during the vote that all amendments have to be offered \ntonight and all debate take place tonight. We are scheduled for the \nvote tomorrow morning. My understanding is that the Dayton amendment is \nstill pending, and, therefore, if it can't be disposed of tonight, it \nwould be available for tomorrow morning. The Jeffords amendment is \nstill pending, and if that cannot be resolved tonight, that would be \nvoted on tomorrow morning. Those are\n\n[[Page S10286]]\n\nthe only two I am aware of at the present time.\n  I will suggest the absence of a quorum so we can check the list and \nsee who else might be out there. But I would say to any who are \nmonitoring our procedures on behalf of their respective Senators that \nthe time for offering amendments is getting mighty short. We don't want \nto deny any Senator his or her rights, but I feel we have given fair \nwarning this is what we will do.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1818\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1818, which is at \nthe desk, on behalf of Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] for Mr. Dodd, for \n     himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Reed, Mr. Carper, Mr. Biden, and Mr. \n     Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 1818.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Food and Drug Administration to issue a \n         monograph with respect to over-the-counter sunscreen)\n\n       On page 173, after line 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7  . (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consumers need clear and consistent information about \n     the risks associated with exposure to the sun, and the \n     protection offered by over-the-counter sunscreen products.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration (referred to in this \n     section as the ``FDA'') began developing a monograph for \n     over-the-counter sunscreen products in 1978.\n       (3) In 2002, after 23 years, the FDA issued the final \n     monograph for such sunscreen products.\n       (4) One of the most critical aspects of sunscreen is how to \n     measure protection against UVA rays, which cause skin cancer.\n       (5) The final sunscreen monograph failed to address this \n     critical aspect and, accordingly, the monograph was stayed \n     shortly after being issued until issuance of a comprehensive \n     monograph.\n       (6) Skin cancer rates continue to rise, especially in \n     younger adults and women.\n       (7) Pursuant to section 751 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379r), a Federal rule on sunscreen \n     labeling would preempt any related State labeling \n     requirements.\n       (8) The absence of a Federal rule could lead to a patchwork \n     of State labeling requirements that would be confusing to \n     consumers and unnecessarily burdensome to manufacturers.\n       (b) Not later than one year after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the FDA shall issue a comprehensive final monograph \n     for over-the-counter sunscreen products, which shall include \n     UVA and UVB labeling requirements.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1849 to Amendment No. 1818\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in the \nsecond degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for Mr. Dodd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1849 to amendment No. 1818.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress with respect to over-the-\n                           counter sunscreen)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 7___. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consumers need clear and consistent information about \n     the risks associated with exposure to the sun, and the \n     protection offered by over-the-counter sunscreen products.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration (referred to in this \n     section as the ``FDA'') began developing a monograph for \n     over-the-counter sunscreen products in 1978.\n       (3) In 2002, after 23 years, the FDA issued the final \n     monograph for such sunscreen products.\n       (4) One of the most critical aspects of sunscreen is how to \n     measure protection against UVA rays, which cause skin cancer.\n       (5) The final sunscreen monograph failed to address this \n     critical aspect and, accordingly, the monograph was stayed \n     shortly after being issued until issuance of a comprehensive \n     monograph.\n       (6) Skin cancer rates continue to rise, especially in \n     younger adults and women.\n       (7) Pursuant to section 751 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379r), a Federal rule on sunscreen \n     labeling would preempt any related State labeling \n     requirements.\n       (8) The absence of a Federal rule could lead to a patchwork \n     of State labeling requirements that would be confusing to \n     consumers and unnecessarily burdensome to manufacturers.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the FDA should, not \n     later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     issue a comprehensive final monograph for over-the-counter \n     sunscreen products, including UVA and UVB labeling \n     requirements, in order to provide consumers with all the \n     necessary information regarding the dangers of skin cancer \n     and the importance of wearing sunscreen.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the modification and \nadoption of the amendment as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the second-degree amendment. The amendment (No. 1849) \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the first-\ndegree amendment, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 1818), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, no one has come forward, so we are \nprepared to close down with the two amendments still unresolved, Dayton \nand Jeffords, and then move to final passage after those two are \nresolved for a voice vote or yeas and nays, I assume which will be \ndetermined tomorrow. At the moment, the yeas and nays have not been \nordered. I want to respect the rights of both of those Senators.\n  While we get together whatever final activity needs to go forward, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Molokai Agriculture Development\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Would the distinguished Senators from Utah and Wisconsin \nyield? I would like to discuss with you a program that addresses the \nvery limited employment and high barriers to entry into sustainable \nagricultural enterprises on the Island of Molokai.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would be pleased to yield to the senior Senator from \nHawaii.\n  Mr. KOHL. I, too, would also like to join in on the discussion of \nthis matter.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my distinguished colleagues for yielding. In \nfiscal year 2005 and prior fiscal years, the subcommittee has included \n$250,000 for a program that provides training, business coaching, and \ncost share assistance to new agricultural businesses on the Island of \nMolokai, that have the promise of being sustainable and beneficial to \nthis predominantly Native Hawaiian community. In 2004, the program \nallowed past grantees who had demonstrated success in their businesses \nto apply for expansion and enhancement funding. As a result, eight \nbusinesses were able to strengthen their operations through \ndiversification, value added treatment, and improved marketing. As a \nresult of the program, increased quantities and percentages of local \nproduce and value added products are available in Molokai's grocery \nstores, farmers markets and other venues. In addition, the marketing of \nsweet potatoes and papayas has continued to expand to the Island of \nMaui and on the mainland. In the coming year, the emphasis will be on \nfirst-time farm businesses. Mini start-up grants will be instituted to \nprepare new applicants for possible\n\n[[Page S10287]]\n\nprojects in the future. While this program is showing success in an \neconomically depressed part of my State, the need for this program \ncontinues.\n  Despite the support by the Congress, no funds are provided for the \nprogram in fiscal year 2006. Accordingly, efforts to assist first-time \nfarm businesses and to provide assistance and employment opportunities \nto the Island of Molokai will not continue without the continued \nsupport of the Congress and funding for the program. Would my \ncolleagues consider including such support for the program during \nconference deliberations on the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food \nand Drug Administration, and related agencies appropriations bill?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to assure the Senator from Hawaii that I \nwill work with Senator Kohl to ensure that this program will be \nconsidered in conference.\n  Mr. KOHL. I concur with my colleague from Utah, and will also work \nwith him to have this program addressed in conference.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleagues for their consideration and support \nof the Molokai Agriculture Development program.\n\n\n                           position transfer\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for the purposes \nof a colloquy.\n  Senator Kohl, the legume plant pathologist position currently working \nin the CRIS titled ``Improving Disease Management of Soil-borne \nDiseases of Edible Legumes'' is being eliminated in a reorganization \nproposed by USDA ARS.\n  Root diseases are fast becoming a major problem in all of the \nproduction areas. These root diseases cause a loss of yields and \nquality of pulse crops.\n  A reduction of research support by USDA ARS at this time of rapidly \nincreasing acreages of pulses in ND, MT, SD and NE is unacceptable. \nEliminating this research could substantially hurt the entire pulse \ncrop industry.\n  Within the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture appropriations, there is \nfunding provided for a legume pathologist focused on root diseases. Due \nto the reorganization of the ARS Prosser facility, this pathologist \nwill not be funded unless that position is moved to the ARS Pullman \nfacility. The need for this project is clear and should be supported by \nARS. In order to continue this vital research it is clear that it will \nneed to be moved to ARS Pullman.\n  I ask that the conference report accompanying the Agriculture bill \ninclude language directing ARS to transfer the legume pathologist \nposition and the $250,000 from the Vegetable and Forage Legume Research \nUnit at Prosser, WA, to the Grain Legume Genetics and Physiology \nResearch Unit at Pullman, WA. This requires no new funding, as it will \nsolely involve the transfer of the legume pathologist from Prosser to \nPullman.\n  This will allow ARS to continue its research on pulse crops at no \nadditional costs.\n  Senator Kohl, would you support this language moving the legume \npathologist position from Prosser, WA, to Pullman, WA?\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes, Senator Murray. Thank you for bringing this issue to \nmy attention. I will work with my colleagues in conference to support \nyour request and include language in the final report.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I concur with my colleague's views on the need to move \nthis ARS position to Pullman, WA, from Prosser, WA, and will work with \nSenator Kohl in conference to have language included in the final \nreport.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Senator Kohl, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, \nfor your support on this issue. This project is critical to the long-\nterm health and viability of dry pea and lentil producers in Washington \nState and all across the country.\n\n\n                       Citrus Canker Compensation\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the serious \nproblem of a disease that threatens to wipe out the citrus industry of \nFlorida. I sincerely appreciate the great efforts made thus far by \nChairman Bennett, the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, \nand their staff to work to address the on-going eradication efforts in \nFlorida. Under the FY 2006 Agriculture appropriations bill, $40,000,000 \nhas been directed towards the Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nService to assist citrus producers in combating this terrible \nbacterium.\n  Citrus canker is a bacterial disease characterized by the lesions it \nleaves on citrus trees and fruit that leaves trees weakened and results \nin reduced fruit production.\n  The four hurricanes that hit Florida in 2004 caused significant \nspread of citrus canker into commercial growing areas. The 2004 \nhurricane season in Florida not only damaged citrus crops and trees, it \nwas a primary cause of the spread of citrus canker beyond what was \ngenerally believed to be reaching a goal of eradication. The storms \ncreated an additional need for compensation to support the continuing \neradication effort.\n  Compensation for citrus producers is a vital component of the program \nas many commercial growers would not allow their trees to be cut \nwithout the promise of compensation. There is no cure for canker. The \nonly known way to contain the spread of citrus canker is to cut down \ninfected and exposed trees in a 1,900 square foot area. In a commercial \ngrove, that radius can encompass up to 250 acres around a single \ninfected tree. That's why the post-hurricanes outbreak has led to the \ndestruction of nearly 55,000 acres.\n  USDA has estimated that the 2002-2005 citrus crop will yield 151 \nmillion boxes of oranges, down from their 225 million box estimate \nearlier in 2004. This year's decrease of 94 million boxes represents a \nstaggering decrease of 38 percent.\n  Before the 2004 hurricane season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nhad compensated commercial growers an average $7,600 an acre for \ndestroying their property. According to my growers in Florida and the \nFlorida Department of Citrus, the backlog of unpaid compensation has \ngrown to nearly $450 million. It is my hope that during the conference \nnegotiations process with the House Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee that citrus canker compensation funding will be addressed \nat an appropriate level on behalf of growers that abide by the USDA \ncanker eradication program.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank Senator Martinez, for sharing his concerns on \nthis important issue. It is my understanding that the House has \nappropriated $10 million for citrus canker compensation payments and we \nare aware of the impact that this disease has on the citrus industry in \nhis State. We are committed to working with his office to help provide \nfunding for his growers that have worked with USDA to help eradicate \nthis destructive bacteria.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank the chairman. I appreciate his support and look \nforward to working with him as well as the appropriations process moves \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10287-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10287-S10288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SPECIALTY CROPS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, throughout this entire process, both at \nsubcommittee and at full committee level, Senator Feinstein and Senator \nCraig have expressed great interest and concern about specialty crops, \nand they have asked us to take action with respect to specialty crops. \nWe have been unable to find room in our allocation to deal with it. \nHowever, we recognize that the House has an allocation for specialty \ncrops, and for that reason we believe we will be able to find a \nsolution to this issue in conference.\n  The 2 Senators have been very cooperative and helpful. I want to make \neveryone understand that as we have worked our way through this they \nhave been in no way less than enthusiastic about supporting the issue \nof specialty crops. If we get the problem solved in conference, as I am \nhopeful we can, and as I have commented to them that I will work to do, \nit will be in large measure because of the tenacity and leadership of \nSenator Feinstein and Senator Craig. We appreciate their calling our \nattention to this particular issue.\n  Also, Senator DeWine and Senator Stabenow have a problem which we \nhave indicated we will do our best to deal with in conference. We \nunderstand the importance of the issue they have raised.\n  With that, I want to once again pay tribute to the ranking member, \nSenator Kohl, and to his staff as we have gone through this process. \nBoth the\n\n[[Page S10288]]\n\nmajority and minority staff have worked as one rather than as two \ncompeting staff. That is one of the reasons we have been able to clear \nas many amendments as we have as expeditiously as we have.\n  I once again want to thank my ranking member not only for his \nprofessionalism but for his friendship as we have gone throughout this \nprocess.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bennett very much for the \nsentiments expressed, which are felt similarly by myself and people who \nare working with me.\n  On the question of Senator Feinstein and Senator Craig and others in \nspecialty crops, as you have indicated, we all understand how important \nthis program is across the country, not only in California and in Idaho \nbut in other States, as well. I am aware the House bill includes \nfunding.\n  I will join with Senator Bennett and we will do everything we can to \nadopt the House level in conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10288-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Madam President, I rise to share great news with all \nof our colleagues. Last Sunday, an estimated 6 million people in \nAfghanistan voted in that country's historic first legislative election \nin over three decades. This is a tremendous achievement for the \ncitizens of Afghanistan, for the people of the broader Middle East, and \nfor obviously the United States because of America's interest in seeing \npeace and democracy flourish around the world. And, of course, it is a \nvictory in the war on terror.\n  Afghans turned out, despite threats of violence, and despite \nunfamiliarity with the parliamentary system, to vote in great numbers \nfor a 249-member lower parliamentary house and the members of 34 \nprovincial councils. Those councils, along with President Hamid Karzai, \nwill help select the 51 members of the upper parliamentary house, and \nthe Afghan Parliament will convene for the first time this coming \nDecember.\n  Four years ago, the ruthless Taliban regime ruled Afghanistan with an \nunyielding, murderous intolerance, and they laid down that country's \nwelcome mat to terrorists. Al-Qaida called the Afghan deserts their \nhome, and they plotted the deaths of Americans. Well, no more. Today a \ndemocratically elected President and Parliament chart a new course for \nthat country.\n  The turnout rate in this historic parliamentary election is estimated \nto exceed the typical turnout rate in our own country for our so-called \noff-year congressional elections, that is, when there is no \nPresidential election on the ballot. This follows the remarkable trend \nset last October when Afghanistan elected Hamid Karzai in its first \nPresidential election ever, also with a higher turnout rate than we had \nin this country a month later. I do not think Americans have to worry \nabout terrorist threats or deadly bombing attacks on their way to the \npolls, but obviously the people in Afghanistan were certainly concerned \nthat that might happen.\n  In fact, though there was some scattered violence, the Afghan police \nand army did an excellent job on the whole of securing the polls and \nthwarting these would-be terrorists. For instance, the police defused a \nlarge cache of explosives in Mazar-i-Sharif. In the western town of \nHelmand, an attack on a polling station ended with the deaths of two \nmen suspected to be remnant Taliban members. Police even caught two \nterrorists attempting to smuggle explosives hidden in a pen into a \npolling station.\n  Turnout among women was high as well. We do not have the official \nresults yet, but President Karzai claims it should account for about 40 \nto 60 percent of the total turnout. This is Afghanistan we are talking \nabout. Forty to 60 percent of the total turnout in the legislative \nelections were women. This Afghan election is a huge success story, \ndespite the deafening silence about it in the mainstream media. I \ncontinue to be disappointed at the media's refusal to cover the good \nnews taking place in the broader Middle East.\n  I would like to read the beginning of a commendable editorial from \nthe September 19, 2005, edition of the Wall Street Journal. I ask \nunanimous consent to have the entirety of that article printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 19, 2005]\n\n                           The Afghan Success\n\n       Who would have thought that free and successful elections \n     in Afghanistan would so quickly become a non-story? We sure \n     didn't, but that seems to be the case judging from the \n     paucity of news coverage of yesterday's historic Afghan vote \n     for a national parliament and provincial assemblies. Success \n     is apparently boring.\n       Taliban terrorists were unable to fulfill their pledge to \n     disrupt the vote, not that they didn't try. They killed five \n     candidates and four election workers leading up to the \n     election, and yesterday another 15 people died in violence, \n     including a Frenchman who was part of the international force \n     helping to provide security. Despite such dangers, turnout \n     was said to be heavy, though perhaps not up to the eight \n     million who voted in last October's presidential election.\n       The vote was also another milestone for Afghan women, with \n     580-some female candidates, or 10% of the total. The Taliban \n     had threatened female candidates in particular, much as they \n     had turned women into second-class citizens during their time \n     in power. For a country that hadn't chosen a legislature in \n     decades, and was thought too benighted to support democracy \n     by many Western sages, this is worth celebrating.\n       About 20,000 U.S. soldiers remain on the ground in the \n     country, providing security while Afghan police and army \n     forces continue to build. American and NATO forces will need \n     to be there for some time, notably special forces who can \n     pursue Taliban fighters who use terrorist tactics. But a \n     legitimate new legislature will make it that much harder for \n     the Taliban and its foreign recruits to find popular sympathy \n     or sanctuary.\n       It's worth recalling how perilous for U.S. interests this \n     comer of Southwest Asia was only four years ago. With the \n     Taliban running Afghanistan, and Pakistan intelligence \n     helping them, an Islamist takeover in Islamabad was not out \n     of the question. But now with the Taliban routed and Hamid \n     Karzai governing in Kabul, the region is no longer an al \n     Qaeda sanctuary. This is one battle in the war on terror that \n     we're clearly winning.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Here is how it begins:\n\n       Who would have thought that free and successful elections \n     in Afghanistan would so quickly become a non-story? We sure \n     didn't, but that seems to be the case judging from the \n     paucity of news coverage of yesterday's historic Afghan vote \n     for a national parliament and provincial assemblies. Success \n     is apparently boring.\n\n  I think they must teach them in journalism school that only bad news \nis news. Let me repeat that last part. As President Bush and our armed \nforces continue to defend and spread freedom in the broader Middle \nEast, if there is bad news, setbacks or casualties to report, the \nmainstream media will gladly hold the front page. But reporting success \nis apparently boring. Well, tell that to any one of the millions who \ncast their cherished ballot last Sunday.\n  I think the American people deserve to know the progress we are \nmaking in expanding freedom in countries that until now have known only \nterror. That is among one of the best ways of ensuring that terror does \nnot strike our shores again, as it did on September 11, 2001. But it \nappears that the mainstream media is not that interested in good news. \nThere is only one way to report this story: as a victory in the war on \nterror.\n  I ask all of our colleagues to join me in congratulating the Afghan \npeople for taking this giant step toward becoming a free democratic \nstate, justly governed under the rule of law. I ask them to join me in \npledging the full support of the United States as Afghanistan continues \nto root out the last vestiges of its extremist terrorist element and \nmoves forward into its democratic future. And I ask them to join me in \ndeclaring that whatever the final outcome of the elections, the true \nwinners are the Afghan people, and the people of the region who can \nlook to the Afghan exercise in democracy this past weekend as a model \nof success.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10289-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10289]]\n                     HONORING TERRENCE M.

However, as many of these programs will expire on \nSeptember 30, it is important that we extend the programs authorized by \nthis act until the Congress can successfully complete work on the \nreauthorization legislation.\n  I am pleased to have been able to report that legislation with a \nunanimous vote out of committee.

Mr. President, I have been a strong supporter of the \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, program since its \ncreation in 1994. Nationwide, the COPS program has awarded more than \n$11 billion in grants, resulting in the hiring of 118,000 additional \npolice officers. In Michigan, 514 local and State law enforcement \nagencies have received more than $220 million in grants through the \nCOPS program. These grants have improved the safety of communities by \nputting more than 3,300 law enforcement officers on Michigan streets.\n  In the past month alone, the COPS program has awarded nearly $2 \nmillion in grants to Michigan communities. One COPS grant program, the \nSecure Our Schools Initiative, recently awarded more than $1 million in \ngrants to nine Michigan communities to provide enhanced security for \npublic schools. These grants help our schools pay for security \nassessments, security training for students and personnel and the \ninstallation of metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other important \nsecurity measures. Another COPS grant program, the Tribal Resources \nGrant Program, awarded more than $800,000 in grants to eight Native-\nAmerican communities in Michigan. These funds will strengthen the \npolice departments in these communities by helping tribes hire and \ntrain police officers and modernize their equipment. COPS grants like \nthese are critical to Michigan communities that are working to prevent \nand respond to violent crimes, especially those involving guns.\n  Unfortunately, authorization for the COPS program was permitted to \nexpire at the end of fiscal year 2000. Although the program has \nsurvived through the annual appropriations process, it has received \nsignificant funding cuts under this administration. In fact, the fiscal \nyear 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act included only $606 million for the \nCOPS program, $142 million below the amount appropriated in 2004. \nDuring consideration of the fiscal year 2006 Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill last week, I supported an amendment that would have \nprovided $1 billion for the COPS program. Unfortunately, this amendment \nwas defeated and the majority in the Senate voted to cut the COPS \nprogram further to $515 million for fiscal year 2006.\n  I have cosponsored the COPS Reauthorization Act introduced by Senator \nBiden. This bill would continue the COPS program for another 6 years at \na funding level of $1.15 billion per year. This funding would allow \nState and local governments to hire an additional 50,000 police \nofficers over the next 6 years. In addition, the bill would modernize \nthe COPS program by authorizing $350 million in Law Enforcement \nTechnology Grants to assist police departments in acquiring new \ntechnologies for the analysis of crime data and the examination of DNA \nevidence, among other uses. The COPS Reauthorization Act would also \nbuild upon the accomplishments of the original COPS program by \nauthorizing $200 million in Community Prosecutor Grants. These grants \nwould be used to hire community prosecutors trained to work at the \nlocal and neighborhood level to prevent crime and improve relations \nwith residents.\n  The increased threat of terrorism as well as the continuing epidemic \nof gun violence underscores the need to devote more resources for our \nlaw enforcement agencies. The safety and security of our communities \ndepends upon our local police departments, most often the first \nresponders, being adequately staffed, trained, and equipped. I hope the \nSenate will do more to support the efforts of our local law enforcement \nofficials by adequately funding programs such as COPS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10289-5", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10289-S10290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor our former colleague \nClaiborne Pell, with whom I had the pleasure of serving in this body \nfor 16 years.\n  I have always felt a special affinity for Senator Pell. Both of our \nfathers served in Congress. We represented neighboring States in the \nNortheast. We sat together on three committees and share many of the \nsame views and principles about our great Nation and its role in the \nworld. And, he was one of the few Senators who served with both my \nfather and me. So it is with great personal pleasure that I come to the \nfloor to honor him today.\n  Senator Pell accomplished important things during his Senate career, \neach one of which could have defined a successful tenure for any one \nSenator. He created a Federal college scholarship initiative--later to \nbe named the ``Pell Grant'' in his honor. This initiative has opened \nthe doors of our colleges and universities to millions of American \nstudents. He coauthored legislation to establish the National Endowment \nfor the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, both of \nwhich have enriched the cultural life of our Nation. He helped to \nestablish the Northeast rail corridor. And he was a chief architect of \nthe ban on nuclear testing on the ocean floor.\n  Throughout 36 years of service, Senator Pell left a graceful and \nindelible legacy. His commitment to education, the arts and humanities, \nand peace was an attempt to cultivate the best in all of us. And we \nhave advanced as a nation in part because of his dedication to these \nideals and his success in codifying them.\n  Almost as admirable as his legislative accomplishments was the manner \nin which he legislated. In the 16 years that I served alongside Senator \nPell, even when he was the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee under the chairmanship of a hard-charging Senator from the \nother end of the political spectrum, I never saw him speak or act with \nanything but kindness and integrity. In the course of six elections to \nthe U.S. Senate, Senator Pell never once attacked a political opponent \nwho ran against him. He was a true gentleman. He always sought out the \nbetter nature of people through discussion and debate. He held immense \nrespect for the history of the Senate and the vocation of public \nservice. He was the model of what a leader should be.\n  Paying tribute to his tremendous career is reason enough to come to \nthe floor today, but I have also come to speak on a more timely matter. \nSenator Pell is to be recognized this Friday by a regimental review at \nthe U.S. Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut.\n  Senator Pell served in the Coast Guard for 37 years, enlisting 4 \nmonths before the attacks on Pearl Harbor. He began as a ship's cook, \nbut quickly received his commission and served as a lieutenant on boats \nin the North Atlantic and Sicily. During World War II, he was arrested \nsix times by enemy governments. After the war ended, he served as a \ncaptain in the Reserves until he reached the mandatory retirement age.\n  Senator Pell frequently cited his service as one of the defining \nmoments in his life. He has always been an ardent supporter of the \nCoast Guard--believing, as I do, that it plays a vital role in keeping \nAmerica safe. As the Coast Guard honors Senator Pell's service this \nweek, it is important that we remember the Coast Guard personnel who \ncontinue to risk their lives to maintain the safety and security of our \nNation.\n  Over the past few weeks, Coast Guard crews, operating with \ncharacteristic precision and professionalism, have rescued over 33,000 \npeople in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. They have spent \nsignificant sums to do so--sums that were never contemplated to be \nspent for this purpose. Regrettably, however, none of the over $60 \nbillion in aid that Congress recently sent to the Gulf coast region has \nbeen specifically set aside to replenish Coast Guard accounts. Their \ncosts in both operations and reconstruction are estimated in the \nhundreds of millions of dollars. They are being forced to divert funds \nfrom continuing and future operations.\n  The men and women of today's Coast Guard are certainly vindicating \nSenator Pell's faith in and commitment to this branch of our military. \nBy honoring their service--including by seeing to it that Coast Guard \noperations are fully supported by our Government--we honor the service \nof an outstanding leader, a great patriot, and a dear friend: Claiborne \nPell. I wish him, his wife Nuala, and his family my best wishes on this \nwonderful occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10290-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10290-S10291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PAUL BRUHN: PRESERVING VERMONT FOR ALL GENERATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to \ncongratulate Paul Bruhn and the Preservation Trust of Vermont on an \nanniversary that marks 25 successful years of protecting and \ncelebrating Vermont's historical treasures.\n  I am proud to be able to call Paul not only an accomplished Vermonter \nbut also a very good friend. He was my first campaign manager and my \nfirst chief of staff, and the Preservation Trust of Vermont is only one \nof his significant gifts to the Green Mountain State.\n  Paul became the founding executive director of the Preservation Trust \nof Vermont in 1980, after helping me find my way through the Senate \nduring my first term. Since then he has helped the Preservation Trust \nsave countless architectural treasures in every corner of the State, \nhelped reinvent communities that had eroded through years of neglect, \nand helped our State capitalize on its unique identity. Thanks in large \npart to his leadership, the Preservation Trust of Vermont has been a \nrespected, appreciated, and integral part of Vermont's culture for the \npast quarter century.\n  My wife Marcelle and I consider ourselves highly fortunate to call \nPaul a close personal friend. Before my campaign in 1974, we saw in \nPaul attributes that we knew would bring Vermont wonderful things. As \nthe consummate connector, Paul has been a humble servant of the public \ninterest, forging and leading broad community coalitions to overcome \nsome of the most difficult growing pains of development--retaining a \ncommunity's character. He has used these talents to bring attention to \nand preserve the most unique and defining aspects of Vermont. From \nmaking sure Vermont music legend Sterling Weed had a band stand, to \nbringing attention to the wonderful architecture at the St. Johnsbury \nAthenaeum, he has helped Vermonters embrace their unique spirit and \nstoried history.\n  Paul has always understood that a community's future vitality is \ndirectly linked to its past. When the city of Burlington was preparing \nto level the historic firehouse on Church Street--one of the most \nbeautiful and unique buildings in the city--it was Paul who convinced \nme to open my first Senate office there to save the building from the \nwrecking ball. Years later, as historic downtowns across the country \nwere being shuttered and demolished because of urban sprawl, Paul \nhelped me work with local and State officials to find millions of \ndollars in Federal investments to revolutionize Burlington's historic \ncenter of commerce, turning Church Street into an award-winning \npedestrian marketplace. Today the historic facades that have hung over \nChurch Street for a century or more remind shoppers of Burlington's \nrich history.\n  There is hardly a nook or cranny, village or gore, throughout Vermont \nthat has not felt the touch of Paul and the Preservation Trust of \nVermont. Whether through a small Preservation Trust grant for the \nrefinishing of a church tower, or through a multimillion dollar \ncampaign led by Paul and the talented people he works with, every \ncorner of the State from Burke to Bennington has benefited from Paul's \ncommunity- and consensus-building.\n  Just last year, this native Vermonter was at the heart of an effort \nto have the entire State of Vermont designated as one of the top 10 \nendangered places by the National Preservation Trust. It\n\n[[Page S10291]]\n\nwas the first time in the organization's history that an entire State \nwas added to the list. He helped the city of Rutland persuade Wal-Mart \nto anchor in the community's historic downtown instead of outside of \ntown in a vacant field, a victory that few other communities across the \ncountry have won. That was not enough though, and he has brought \nRutland's story to other communities throughout the State, where no \nmatter the outcome, he has helped empower community leaders to make \ndecisions rather than bow to the whims of out-of-state developers.\n  In my lifetime of public service, I have never met a person so adept \nat bringing people together and finding ways to make sure everyone has \na voice. Years before he came to work for me, Paul was a key player in \nsetting up the consumer fraud office within the Vermont attorney \ngeneral's office, where he not only protected consumer rights, but also \nhelped the office create a toll-free number that revolutionized the way \nVermonters communicated with their government. When I entered the \nSenate, Paul and I brought this concept to the greatest deliberative \nbody in the Senate by operating the first toll-free phone line in the \nCongress.\n  Paul has always put the interests of all Vermonters ahead of himself \nor any organization he has ever steered. The Preservation Trust of \nVermont has been no different. Through his involvement, Vermont is a \nbetter place and Vermonters have realized the wonderful things our past \nhas to offer. Thank you Paul, and congratulations to you and everyone \nwho has ever helped make the Preservation Trust of Vermont the success \nit is today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10291-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT CHARLES T. DUBOIS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who has \nserved over 36 years in the U.S. Air Force, with the vast majority of \nthat service in the Missouri Air National Guard. CMSgt Charles T. \nDuBois retired on September 10, 2005, after a long and distinguished \nrecord of service to the State of Missouri and the United States. Chief \nDuBois enlisted in the U.S. Air Force on June 18, 1969, at the height \nof the Vietnam War. He served in the Air Force until March 12, 1973, \nand entered the Air National Guard on September 14, 1975.\n  As a member of the 131st Fighter Wing in St. Louis, MO, Chief DuBois \nhas been associated with a unit whose history has spanned over eight \ndecades and whose former members have included the likes of aviation \npioneer Charles Lindbergh.\n  Throughout Chief DuBois' service at the 131st, he has seen the unit \ntransition from F-100s to F-4 Phantoms to F-15As, and now upon his \nretirement, the transition to F-15Cs, the Nation's premier homeland \ndefense and air superiority aircraft. As a crew chief, Chief DuBois was \nfully qualified on: the B-52D; C-141A; C-124; C-5A; F-100 C, D & F; F-4 \nC, D & E; and the F-15 A, B, C, and D models.\n  Throughout his career Chief DuBois remained dedicated concomitantly \nto the vital missions of the Air National Guard and to the paramount \ncommitment of taking care of his family. It is the latter that Chief \nDuBois will continue to fulfill upon his retirement as a devoted \nhusband, father and son. He and his wife Theresa were married in \nNovember of 1977 and have one son, Michael, who serves on my staff as \nan advisor on, among a number of other issues, the National Guard. \nChief DuBois has one daughter, Kristine, who lives and works in \nnorthern Virginia. As a dedicated son of someone whom I have had the \npleasure and honor to work with when I was Governor of Missouri, GEN \nCharles H. DuBois and his wife Ruth, ``Terry'' as Chief DuBois goes by \nin civilian life, remains dedicated to their well-being. The General, \nor ``Charlie Two Stars'' as I often referred to him, and his lovely \nwife Ruth, can rest assured they raised a son who has served both his \nfamily and the military with honor.\n  The honor in which Chief DuBois has served can be seen in the \nnumerous awards, ribbons and commendations he has been decorated with \nthroughout his career. He has received the Air Force Meritorious \nService Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal with two devices, the \nAir Force Achievement Medal with one device, the Joint Meritorious Unit \nAward for 2 AEF duty tours in Provide Comfort and Northern Watch, and \nthe National Defense Service Medal with two devices for his service \nduring Vietnam and Desert Storm. These accolades represent only a \nhandful of the numerous other State and Federal service medals Chief \nDuBois has collected during his 36 years of service. As Chief DuBois \nretired, he was the most senior chief master sergeant in the U.S. Air \nForce and Air National Guard and was the youngest guardsman to make \nchief when he did so, just like his father who, upon his retirement, \nwas the most senior major general in the Air Force and Air Guard and \nthe youngest at the time to make general.\n  Again, I wish to extend Chief Charles T. DuBois my heartiest \ncongratulations upon his retirement and my sincere thanks for the 35-\nplus years of service he has rendered to the State of Missouri and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10291-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALEXANDER, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On September \n2 through September 5, the residents of Alexander, ND, celebrated their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Alexander is a small town in the northwestern part of North Dakota \nwith a population of 216. Despite its size, Alexander holds an \nimportant place within North Dakota's history. It began on July 24, \n1905, when the city was platted by Frank B. Chapman. That same year, a \nwide variety of businesses were constructed in the town, including the \nDakota Trading Company Store, the Alexander State Bank, and the \nAlexander Hotel. Later that year, the McKenzie County Chronicle began \npublication in an office of the Alexander State Bank. In 1918, the town \nsuffered a devastating fire; however, the town rebuilt and continued to \ngrow.\n  Today, Alexander remains a proud community with an economy bolstered \nby farming, ranching, and oil extraction. In the city's park, \nhamburgers are served every summer Saturday evening. The town is also \nhome to the Lewis and Clark Trail Museum, which is housed in the old \nschool house. Each room in the museum highlights a different and unique \nview of the area's history.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nAlexander, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in \nwishing them well through the next century. I believe that by honoring \nAlexander and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we \nkeep the pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is \nsuch places as Alexander that have helped to shape this country into \nwhat it is today, which is why this community is deserving of our \nrecognition.\n  Alexander has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10291-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10291-S10292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF GALE REINERS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Mr. \nGale Reiners for his 35 years of service to the Department of Veterans' \nAffairs. When he retires later this month, Mr. Reiners will have served \nhis country for almost 40 years, both in the military and through his \npublic service on behalf of our Nation's veterans.\n  During his tenure at the Regional VA Office in Sioux Falls, Gale \nprovided important counsel and advice to veterans, family members, VA \nofficials, veterans' service officers, and congressional members and \ntheir staff on a range of issues. Throughout that time, he has \nwitnessed many changes in the VA, and has been diligent in assisting \nveterans with their questions, needs and issues. He has helped educate \nall those concerned about the ever-changing scope of the veterans' \nbenefits program.\n  Gale wanted to retire 18 months ago but was persuaded to continue his \nduties at the VA. At the time he announced his retirement, the VA \nregional offices in North Dakota and South Dakota were working to \ncombine various veterans' services. Gale's\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\nexperience and knowledge of those programs proved invaluable during the \ntransition period.\n  Mr. Reiners is a man of passion and integrity who takes his \nresponsibility to South Dakota veterans very seriously. It will be \ndifficult to find someone more knowledgeable than Mr. Reiners on the \nwide array of benefit and resource programs available to veterans. My \nstaff has worked with Gale and his colleagues at the regional office in \nSioux Falls on numerous issues impacting veterans and their families. \nGale always addressed each inquiry with professionalism. I commend his \ndedication and commitment to making sure every veteran's case or \nquestion was always handled in a timely manner.\n  The State of South Dakota will miss Gale Reiners' leadership. After \n35 years of service, Mr Reiners will be spending more time with his \nwife Patty, and their 4 children. It is with great honor that I share \nhis impressive accomplishments with my colleagues, and I thank him for \nhis service to this Nation and its veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10292-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN RECOGNITION OF FERNANDO VALENZUELA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few \nmoments to recognize the many important accomplishments of Fernando \nValenzuela, former pitcher, current radio broadcast announcer and long \ntime member of the Los Angeles Dodgers family.\n  Fernando Valenzuela has been an amazing asset to the Los Angeles \ncommunity. He has enriched the lives of many young children through \ntheir participation in the Amigos de Fernando children's program--an \ninnercity youth program he founded that is designed to reward \nunderprivileged children for their positive and active involvement in \ncommunity sports teams.\n  For the third consecutive Major League Baseball season, the Amigos de \nFernando children's program, with support from the Los Angeles Dodgers, \nhas continued to assist local children's groups. Through their efforts, \ninner-city children's groups receive assistance in continuing to guide \nand positively influence the children they service. The Amigos de \nFernando children's program has provided nearly 1,000 young people of \nthe City of Los Angeles with new and positive experiences that would \nhave otherwise been unavailable to them.\n  Fernando Valenzuela began his career with the Los Angeles Dodgers in \n1979. Since his rookie year in Major League Baseball, he has reached \nmany notable accomplishments including honors as Rookie of the Year in \n1981 and the highly coveted Cy Young Award--presented to each league's \nmost outstanding pitcher--also in 1981. In addition to his many \npersonal accomplishments, Fernando also played a significant role in \nachieving many team distinctions and championships, including the \nNational League Pennant and World Series Championships for the 1981 and \n1988 seasons. After a brief absence from the Los Angeles area, Fernando \nrejoined the Los Angeles Dodgers organization in 2003 as a member of \nthe Spanish-Language radio commentator team, providing his expertise \nand views to countless fans.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me and the children of the City \nof Los Angeles in commending Fernando Valenzuela for his great \nleadership and service to the community through the Amigos de Fernando. \nHis efforts are truly worthy of this recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10292-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE PASSING OF SANDRA FELDMAN\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to remember and celebrate \nthe incredible life and legacy of Sandra Feldman, a past president of \nthe American Federation of Teachers, who passed away on Monday at the \nage of 66 after a long battle with breast cancer.\n  Ms. Feldman was truly a trailblazer for education. She dedicated her \nlife to enhancing educational opportunities for our youth, to bettering \nthe lives of educators and to fighting for civil rights for workers, \nwomen and minorities.\n  Feldman grew up poor in Brooklyn, NY. She credited the public schools \nand libraries for ``creating her future'' and instilling in her a love \nof education. She spent her entire life enriching the lives of others.\n  In the 1960s, she fought for civil rights, participating in the \nFreedom Rides and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. She \nlater became a leader in the protection of various workers' rights \nmovements in New York, including representation of nurses and teachers. \nIn 1997, Feldman became the president of the American Federation of \nTeachers, one of the largest unions representing our teachers in this \ncountry, with 1.3 million members, including 4,800 in Colorado,\n  As president of the American Federation of Teachers, Ms. Feldman \nadvocated for early childhood education, greater investment in public \neducation and greater emphasis on high standards and accountability. \nFeldman was nationally recognized as a champion of universal preschool \nfor young children, extended kindergarten for disadvantaged youngsters, \nand redesigning schools to promote academic achievement. Many of \nFeldman's proposals, which were implemented on the State and Federal \nlevel, positively changed the lives of youth.\n  I commend and honor the life of Sandra Feldman, who stood and fought \nfor civil rights, workers' rights, and education. She was the epitome \nof a public servant and we are all better because of her life.

A bill to amend the material witness statute to strengthen \nprocedural safeguards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, under the Federal material witness statute \nour government is authorized to arrest a witness in order to secure his \ntestimony in a criminal proceeding. In order to obtain a material \nwitness warrant, the government must establish that the witness has \ninformation that is material to a criminal proceeding, and that it may \nbecome impracticable to secure the witness's presence at the proceeding \nby a subpoena. Once arrested, a material witness may be detained for a \nreasonable period, until his testimony can be secured by deposition or \nappearance in court.\n  The material witness law was intended to ensure the appearance of \nwitnesses in those rare cases where they might otherwise flee to avoid \ntestifying in a criminal proceeding. This authority is an important \ntool for our government's law enforcement duties, but it must be \nexercised responsibly. As the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \nnoted in 2003, in the case of United States v. Awadallah, ``It would be \nimproper for the government to use [the material witness statute] for \nother ends, such as the detention of persons suspected of criminal \nactivity for which probable cause has not yet been established.'' Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, however, that is exactly what the government has \nbeen doing. Indeed, senior Administration officials, including our \ncurrent Attorney General, have admitted that the government routinely \nuses material witness warrants to detain suspects in the so-called war \non terror.\n  A report released this summer by Human Rights Watch and the American \nCivil Liberties Union identifies 70 men, including more than a dozen \ncitizens, whom the Department of Justice\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\narrested as material witnesses in connection with its terrorism \ninvestigations. Many were never brought before a court or grand jury to \ntestify for the simple reason that they were viewed not as witnesses, \nbut as suspects. The evidence against these suspects was often flimsy \nat best, and would never have sufficed for criminal arrest and pre-\ntrial detention. This twisting of a narrow law designed to secure \ntestimony into a broad preventive detention authority has resulted in \nsome notorious abuses.\n  Just days after 9/11, the FBI arrested eight Egyptian-born men in \nEvansville, IN--one a naturalized American citizen--as material \nwitnesses, based on a bogus tip that they planned to fly a plane into \nthe Sears Tower in Chicago. The men were held for more than a week in \nsolitary confinement before being released. Many months later, the FBI \nissued a rare public apology to these men. That apology, while \nnecessary, could not repair the damage that had been done to them and \ntheir families in the form of lost business, tainted reputations, and \nthe accusing stares of their friends and neighbors.\n  The case of Abdallah Higazy further highlights the danger that can \noccur when this authority is abused. Shortly after 9/11, the 30-year-\nold Egyptian graduate student with a valid visa, was picked up after a \nsecurity guard at a hotel located across the street from Ground Zero \nclaimed to have found an aviation radio in the room where Higazy had \nstayed on 9/11. Higazy was held for more than a month in solitary \nconfinement until he ultimately confessed that the radio was his. \nHigazy was then charged with lying to the FBI for initially denying \npossession of the radio. These charges were dropped after the true \nowner of the radio, an American pilot, went to the hotel to claim it.\n  In another, higher profile case in May 2004, Portland attorney \nBrandon Mayfield was arrested as a material witness in connection with \nthe Madrid train bombing. An email sent from the Portland FBI office to \nthe Los Angeles FBI office the day before Mayfield's arrest refers to \nhim as a ``Moslem convert'' and notes as a ``problem'' that there was \nnot enough evidence to arrest him for a crime. After spending two weeks \nin prison, Mayfield was released and the FBI was expressing regret \nabout the erroneous fingerprint match that led to his arrest.\n  These and other examples of post-9/11 misuse of the material witness \nstatute are documented in the HRW/ACLU report. As the report shows, \nsuch misuse does more than just circumvent the requirement of probable \ncause for a criminal arrest. Suspects arrested as material witnesses \nare denied the basic protections guaranteed to criminal defendants, \nincluding the right to view any exculpatory evidence and to be able to \nchallenge the basis for their arrest and incarceration. The report \nconcludes that the misuse of the material witness law ``threatens U.S. \ncitizens and non-citizens alike because it reflects a lowering of the \nstandards designed to protect everyone from arbitrary and unreasonable \narrest and detention.''\n  The bill I introduce today will ensure that the material witness law \nis used only for the narrow purpose that Congress originally intended, \nto obtain testimony, and not to hold criminal suspects without charge \nwhen probable cause is lacking.\n  First, the bill raises the standard that the government must meet to \nobtain a material witness warrant. Under current law, a judge may order \nthe arrest of a material witness if there is probable cause to believe \nthat securing his presence by subpoena may become ``impracticable.'' \nUnder the bill, there must be probable cause to believe that the \nwitness has been served with a subpoena and failed or refused to appear \nas required, or clear and convincing evidence that the service of a \nsubpoena is likely to result in the person fleeing or cannot adequately \nsecure the appearance of the person as required.\n  Second, the bill imports several due process safeguards from the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the arrest and \narraignment of criminal defendants. Among other things, the bill \nrequires that a material witness warrant specify that the testimony of \nthe witness is sought in a criminal case or grand jury proceeding, and \ncommand that the witness be arrested and brought to court without \nunnecessary delay. The warrant must also inform the witness of his \nright to retain counselor or request that one be appointed. The right \nto counsel is already guaranteed to material witnesses under the \nCriminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. 3006A(a)(1)(g), and protects the \nwitness from erroneous, unnecessary, and prolonged incarceration.\n  The bill further provides that, upon arresting a material witness, \nthe government must provide him with a copy of the warrant or inform \nhim of the warrant's existence and purpose. A material witness must be \nbrought before a judge ``without unnecessary delay''--a term that has \nbeen strictly interpreted when applied to the criminally accused. The \ninitial appearance must be in the district of arrest or an adjacent \ndistrict. At the initial appearance, the judge must inform the witness \nof the basis for his arrest and of his right to counsel. The judge must \nalso allow the witness a reasonable opportunity to consult with \ncounsel. The judge must then determine whether the witness should be \nreleased or detained pending the taking of his testimony.\n  Third, the bill establishes clear procedures for material witness \ndetention hearings. Current law provides that material witnesses shall \nbe treated in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 3142, which governs the release \nor detention of defendants pending trial. Section 3142, however, \ncontains many factors that are not applicable to material witnesses. \nFor example, courts have held that a material witness may not be \ndetained on the basis of dangerousness. (See Awadallah, 349 F.3d at 63 \nn.15.) The bill clarifies that in detention hearings for material \nwitnesses, flight risk is the only relevant factor. A court shall order \na material witness detained only if no condition or combination of \nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the witness as \nrequired. As under current law, no witness may be detained because of \ninability to comply with any condition of release if the testimony of \nsuch witness can adequately be secured by deposition. In determining \nwhether a material witness should be released or detained, the court \nshall take into account the available information concerning the \nhistory and characteristics of the witness, and may also consider \nchallenges to the basis of the warrant.\n  Fourth, the bill establishes the ``clear and convincing evidence'' \nstandard used in other civil detention contexts for material witness \ndetentions. Few courts have directly examined what standard of proof \nshould be required of the government to demonstrate that no conditions \nof release can reasonably assure a witness's appearance. While the \nlower ``preponderance of the evidence'' standard may suffice for pre-\ntrial detention of defendants who pose a risk of flight, in the case of \ndefendants there has also been a finding of probable cause to believe \nthe person committed a crime. In the case of a witness, where there is \nno probable cause to believe the person committed a crime, the usual \ngrounds for fearing flight--the defendant's aversion to risking a \nguilty verdict and attendant sentencing--are not present.\n  Fifth, the bill imposes reasonable but firm time limits on the \ndetention of material witnesses. Current law sets no firm limit on how \nlong a witness may be incarcerated before being presented in a criminal \nproceeding or released. This has resulted, according to the recent \nreport, in many witnesses enduring imprisonment for two or more months, \nand in one case for more than a year. Under my bill, a material witness \nmay initially be held for not more than five days, or until his \ntestimony can adequately be secured, whichever is earlier. That period \nmay be extended for additional periods of up to five days, upon a \nshowing of good cause for why the testimony could not adequately be \nsecured during the previous five-day period. The total period of \ndetention may not exceed 10 days for a grand jury witness, or 30 days \nfor a trial witness, and in no case may a witness be held any longer \nthan necessary to secure his testimony.\n  Sixth, in recognition of the fact that material witnesses are not \ncharged with any offense, the bill requires that they be held in a \ncorrections facility that is separate, to the extent practicable, from \npersons charged with or convicted of a criminal offense, and under the \nleast restrictive conditions possible.\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\n  Finally, to facilitate congressional oversight, the bill requires the \nJustice Department to report annually on the use of the material \nwitness law. Since 9/11, the Department has withheld information \nrelating to material witnesses on the theory--in my view, a flawed \ntheory--that such information is covered by the grand jury secrecy \nrule. It is hard to imagine how the release of generalized data, such \nas the aggregate number of people detained as material witnesses, could \ndamage any reputational interest or any of the other interests \nprotected by Rule 6(e).\n  The recent, detailed report on post-9/11 uses of the material witness \nstatute leaves no doubt that the law has been bent out of shape, with \nreal consequences for citizens and non-citizens alike. My bill will \nrestore the law to its original purpose and prevent future abuses. I \nurge its speedy passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1739\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals to defer recognition of reinvested capital gains \ndistributions from regulated investment companies; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ncolleagues Tim Johnson of South Dakota and Jim Bunning of Kentucky, an \nimportant bill that will allow Americans to save more for the long term \nand will better prepare them for a secure retirement. The Generating \nRetirement Ownership Through Long-Term Holding GROWTH, Act has \nsubstantial and growing bipartisan support in the House, and Senator \nJohnson and I are proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation that \nprovides Americans a better tool to grow their long-term retirement \nsavings.\n  The GROWTH Act would allow investors in mutual funds to keep more \nretirement savings invested longer and growing longer by deferring \ntaxation of automatically reinvested capital gains until fund shares \nare sold, rather than allowing those long-term gains--which generate no \ncurrent income or cash in hand--to be taxed every year.\n  To understand how beneficial this bill would be, it is important to \nunderstand the role of mutual funds in long-term retirement savings. \nAmong households owning mutual funds, 92 percent are investing for \nretirement, with more than 70 percent saying their primary purpose in \ninvesting in funds is to prepare for retirement. Many of today's \nworkers do not yet have in place the retirement savings supplement to \nSocial Security that will prepare them for the future. In fact, almost \nhalf of American workers--nearly 71 million of 151 million workers--are \nnot offered any form of pension or retirement savings plan at work.\n  Meanwhile, the number of years spent in retirement is growing and the \ncosts individuals can expect to bear in retirement are growing, too. \nThe Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that an individual \nretiring at age 65 in 2014 will need $285,000 just to cover health \ncoverage premiums and expenses. Individual savings efforts also face \nsignificant obstacles. Those not covered by an employer's retirement \nplan, for example, can set aside a deductible IRA contribution of only \n$4,000 this year--$4,500 if they are age 50 or older.\n  Mutual funds are a hugely important part of American workers' \npreparation for retirement, both through their employers' retirement \nplans and on their own. Mutual funds now make up half of the $3.2 \ntrillion held by American workers through 401(k) plans and other \nsimilar job-based savings programs. About 34 million American \nhouseholds hold mutual funds through their defined contribution plans. \nMore than 30 million American households are saving through taxable \nmutual fund accounts, either as supplements to their employers' plans \nor because they do not have such plans.\n  The GROWTH Act is also a good idea because it remedies an unfairness \nin the tax code that can make saving difficult for many Americans. \nMutual fund investors who are struggling to save for retirement should \nnot have to pay taxes on ``profits'' they have not realized. If they \ndon't have money in hand, it makes no sense for them to have to pay \ntaxes. The GROWTH Act would defer taxes until the mutual fund shares \nare sold and the investor has actual funds to pay the taxes.\n  The GROWTH Act would be a valuable contributor to retirement savings \nefforts. Mutual fund savers who automatically reinvest are doing what \npolicymakers want to see. They are holding for the long term, \ncontributing to national savings, and building up their own retirement \nnest egg. These Americans should be encouraged to save--not discouraged \nthrough a tax on automatic reinvestments. The GROWTH Act is a step that \nwill show immediate results, a step that will help tens of millions of \nAmerican savers and ``should-be savers'' over the course of their \nworking lives, and a step that with time can make a real difference in \nthe retirement readiness of American families.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Johnson and me in supporting the \nGROWTH Act. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1740\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Federal Trade Commission to \ninvestigate and assess penalties for price gouging with respect to oil \nand gas products; to\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Post-Disaster \nConsumer Protection Act of 2005. This bill is designed to prohibit \nprice gouging of oil or gas products in the immediate aftermath of a \ndeclared disaster.\n  Hurricane Katrina had a devastating affect on the major oil and \nnatural gas producing region of our Nation. This natural disaster has \nexposed our Nation's vulnerability to even short-term disruptions \nanywhere in the supply chain. Oil production curtailments, refinery \nshutdowns or pipeline disruptions can all cause price spikes in \ngasoline, diesel and aviation fuel.\n  Directly following Hurricane Katrina, extreme price volatility of \ngasoline throughout the United States led to accusations of price \ngouging. Reports were made of individual retailers charging as much as \n$5.87 a gallon for gas. Even in my State of Oregon, which is less \nreliant on Gulf of Mexico production, prices spiked in the immediate \naftermath of the hurricane.\n  This bill declares that for the 30 days following the President's \ndeclaration of a disaster, it will be unlawful to engage in price \ngouging of oil or gas products for sale in the affected area, or of oil \nand gas products produced in the affected area for sale in interstate \ncommerce.\n  In addition, this bill authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to \ndetermine what represents a gross disparity in pricing and to prevent \nviolations under this act using its authorities under the Federal Trade \nCommission Act. Those authorities include seeking civil penalties of \n$11,000 per violation; assessing fines or repayment of illegal gains; \nfreezing assets; and seeking preliminary injunctions, cease and desist \norders or temporary restraining orders.\n  Drastic increases in oil and gas products have a negative impact on \nconsumers and businesses. That is why we must have a system in place \nthat discourages price gouging in the wake of a disaster, and allows \nenough time for markets to return to normal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1743\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the availability of resources under the \nCommunity Services Block Grant Act for individuals affected by \nHurricane Katrina; read the first time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join Senator Enzi in \nintroducing the Community Services Disaster Assistance Act.\n  The bill contains additional support for State Community Service \nBlock Grant offices, and community action agencies. Community Service \nBlock Grant agencies provide low-income communities with the support \nthey need to achieve self-sufficiency on a daily basis. Their programs \nand services include literacy, child health care, afterschool \nactivities, low-income housing development, food stamps, and emergency \nshelter assistance.\n  In the days after Hurricane Katrina, these agencies have been on the \nfront lines. According to the National Association of State Community \nService Programs, 32 States and their community action agencies have \nassisted over 65,000 evacuees. In this time of massive crisis, these \nagencies have been indispensable.\n  This bill will help the State offices and agencies continue their \namazing work. Community action agencies are already able to receive \nemergency funds from FEMA, and this bill expresses the sense of the \nSenate that emergency assistance should be made available immediately.\n  The bill also authorizes State offices to transfer a portion of their \nfunds for Community Service Block Grant administration or discretionary \nprograms to the Gulf Coast States. Offices that wish to provide \nmonetary support will be able to do so.\n  The bill establishes a temporary income eligibility waiver for \nservices funded by Community Services Block Grants in places designated \nas disaster areas. Evacuees will not have to worry about having the \nright paperwork ready, they will receive the services they need exactly \nwhen they need it.\n  The bill also permits agencies and State offices to send their staff \nto federally designated disaster areas in other parts of the same State \nor in other states to provide disaster assistance.\n  Support for this emergency work is more important today than ever. \nThe States hit hardest by the Hurricane and flood were also some of the \npoorest. We in Congress have a responsibility to do all we can to help \nthese States rebuild and thrive again. Passing this bill is a needed \nearly step because it provides urgently needed assistance to invaluable \ncommunity service organizations, and I urge my colleagues to approve \nit.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce new legislation, \ntitled the Good Samaritan Liability Improvement and Volunteer \nEncouragement, or ``GIVE'' Act of 2005. I introduce this legislation to \nensure that, as we continue to cope with the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina, that one of our country's greatest assets--the willingness of \nthe American people to give to their neighbors in need--is not \ninhibited by one of its greatest liabilities--a broken civil justice \nsystem.\n  In addition, I will take a few moments to remind my colleagues of \nlegislation that I introduced just before the August recess: the \nRespirator Access Assurance Act of 2005. This legislation is of even \ngreater importance in the wake of Hurricane Katrina--its passage would \nhelp to ensure that the thousands of workers, volunteers, and citizens \nof New Orleans working to restore that great city have the necessary \nprotection to sift through the clean-up.\n  From its beginning, the United States has been a generous nation. \nIndeed, in commenting on his observations of America in 1831, French \nhistorian Alexis de Tocqueville praised Americans for voluntarily \nassisting their neighbors during times of need. He noted, ``When an \nAmerican asks for the cooperation of his fellow citizens, it is seldom \nrefused; and I have often seen it afforded spontaneously, and with \ngreat good will.''\n  Since that time, America has continued to grow into an ever-more \ngenerous nation. As measured by financial contributions, giving by \nAmericans is at an all-time high. According to the Giving USA \nFoundation, philanthropic donations totaled almost $250 billion in 2004 \nand represented a 5 percent increase over the previous year. The chair \nof Giving USA notes that ``about 70 to 80 percent of Americans \ncontribute annually to at least one charity.''\n  Financial contributions are infinitely valuable. But, as we all know, \nthe value of the gift of time cannot be underestimated. Each and every \nyear, millions of Americans volunteer their time and their personal \nservices to charity. Americans volunteer in soup kitchens, schools, and \nhealth clinics, devoting countless hours to assist others.\n  And in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, we have seen this charitable \nspirit shine brighter than ever. In the short time since Katrina hit \nthe Gulf Coast, Americans have given more than $600 million to disaster \nrelief efforts. Millions of Americans have sent money, donated food, \nsent needed tools and equipment, given clothing, volunteered medical or \nother services, and otherwise helped in whatever manner they could.\n  Perhaps most heartwarming of all, thousands of Americans have opened \ntheir homes to those who lost everything. I am particularly proud of my \nhome State of Texas--where more than\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\n250,000 of our neighbors sought shelter--and where virtually all of \nthem have been able to find it.\n  But just as America enjoys a culture of giving and volunteering, she \nalso faces a culture of litigation. And this ``sue first, ask questions \nlater'' culture has produced an environment of fear that often gives \npause to some people who would otherwise wish to extend a helping hand.\n  As Common Good co-founder and chair, Philip Howard pointed out in \nhearings before the House Judiciary Committee in June of 2004, ``[w]hat \nwe have found is that, in dealings throughout society, Americans no \nlonger feel free to act on their reasonable judgment. The reason is \nthat they no longer trust our system of justice. . . No part of society \nis immune. Playgrounds have been stripped of anything athletic. Even \nseesaws are disappearing because town councils can't afford to be sued \nif someone breaks an ankle. . . There is a missing link in American \njustice--rulings on who can sue for what.''\n  Unfortunately, volunteers and non-profits face this question every \nday. To what degree should people volunteering services or providing \nneeded equipment and supplies be forced to choose between lending a \nhelping hand or facing the specter of litigation? And, should non-\nprofit organizations such as the Red Cross and the Salvation Army \nstruggle to find appropriate housing for evacuees due to liability \nconcerns?\n  In an attempt to respond to these concerns, 8 years ago the late \nSenator Paul Coverdell sponsored and successfully worked to enact the \nVolunteer Protection Act of 1997--legislation that protects volunteers \nfrom many frivolous lawsuits. However, as helpful and well-intentioned \nas this legislation was, more needs to be done to sufficiently protect \nall those lending a hand to those in need.\n  Consider, for example: Early this year, a jury in Milwaukee found the \nCatholic Archdiocese liable because a volunteer for a Catholic lay \norganization, driving her own car, ran a red light and caused an \naccident while delivering a statue of the Virgin Mary to an invalid \nperson. Although the church does not direct the activities of this \ngroup, called the Legion of Mary, its meetings are held on church \nproperty. The jury decided the Archdiocese should pay $17 million to \nthe paralyzed victim, an 82-year-old semi-retired barber.\n  In response to Hurricane Katrina, the Red Cross and the Salvation \nArmy are unable to coordinate efforts to set up emergency housing in \nprivate homes for evacuees because of liability issues.\n  In the midst of administering chest compressions to a dying woman \nseveral days after Hurricane Katrina struck, Dr. Mark N. Perlmutter was \nordered to stop by a federal official because he wasn't registered with \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency. ``I begged him to let me \ncontinue,'' said Perlmutter, who left his home and practice as an \northopedic surgeon in Pennsylvania to come to Louisiana and volunteer \nto care for hurricane victims. ``People were dying, and I was the only \ndoctor on the tarmac where scores of non-responsive patients lay on \nstretchers. Two patients died in front of me . . . I asked him to let \nme stay until I was replaced by another doctor, but he refused. He said \nhe was afraid of being sued.''\n\n  So, today, even as volunteers, businesses, and non-profit \norganizations across the Nation are working to return New Orleans and \nthe gulf coast region to something close to normal--I feel it is \ncrucial to ensure that those volunteers are protected from needless and \nfrivolous litigation.\n  That's why I am introducing today--and am proud to be joined by \nSenators Hutchison, Vitter, Lott, Grassley and Thune--the Good \nSamaritan Liability Improvement and Volunteer Encouragement, or GIVE \nAct of 2005.\n  The legislation offers a comprehensive solution to the fear of \nlitigation that unnecessarily burdens volunteers and often prevents the \nprovision of necessary goods and services to those in need. It will \nprovide protection for volunteers across the Nation, particularly those \nworking in response to national disasters such as 9/11 or Hurricane \nKatrina. More specifically, the GIVE Act will provide that: Disaster \nrelief volunteers, generally, are not liable for harm caused in \ncarrying out their volunteer activities in connection with disaster \nrelief, unless their act or omission constitutes willful, knowing or \nreckless misconduct; medical and other professionals can volunteer \ntheir services for disaster relief services based on being licensed in \ntheir home State regardless of where the declared disaster occurred; a \ndisaster relief volunteer is protected from liability under the act \neven if the volunteer is not working for a specific non-profit \norganization; disaster relief volunteers can offer their services \nwithout subjecting their business partners or employers to liability; \ndisaster relief volunteers are protected from punitive damages and non-\neconomic damages are apportioned according to percentage of fault; non-\nprofit organizations are not liable for the acts or omissions of their \nvolunteers unless the organization has willfully disregarded or is \nrecklessly indifferent to the safety of the individual harmed; all \ndonors of goods or equipment--whether businesses, non-profits, or \nindividuals--are not liable for harm caused by donating those items \nunless they acted with willful, knowing or reckless misconduct; and all \nlitigation that proceeds despite any protections under this act or \nunder the Volunteer Protection Act requires a high level of specificity \nand documentation in the claim and a review by a judge that the claim \nraises--as a matter of law--a genuine issue of material fact.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these two pieces of legislation--\nlegislation designed to ensure that the fear of litigation that \npervades our culture won't stand in the way of well-intentioned \nAmericans trying to help their neighbors in need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Sarbanes, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n        Dayton, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 1749. A bill to reinstate the application of the wage requirements \nof the Davis-Bacon Act to Federal contracts in areas affected by \nHurricane Katrina; to the Committee on Health, Education, labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As we send hundreds of billions of dollars in Federal \naid to the areas devastated by Hurrican Katrina, we must remember that \nwe are just rebuilding highway and schools--we are rebuilding \ncommunities and neighborhoods. And the foundation of such communities \nis good jobs with fair wages.\n  The winds of Katrina exposed to all of America just how much more \nwork remains to be done to achieve equality and fairness in this \ncountry. We are a stronger country when we are a fairer country. Yet, \nas the Administration awards billions of dollars in contracts to many \nof their corporate friends, they decide that the men and women of the \ngulf coast don't deserve to be paid a fair wage. The victims of Katrina \nhave lost everything, and now President Bush says it is okay for them \nto lose their fair wages too. That is why I am introducing this \nlegislation to ensure that that the workers involved in the recovery \nand reconstruction effort after Hurricane Katrina will earn a \nprevailing wage.\n  Many people harmed by Hurricane Katrina were already struggling to \nmake ends meet. Mississippi and Louisiana rank 1st and 2nd among States \nby the percentage of people below the poverty line. Moreover, \nMississippi and Louisiana rank 2nd and 3rd by the percentage of \nchildren below the poverty line. Now the devastation of hurricane has \ncaused the jobs and businesses they relied on to disappear. Experts \nhave said that from 400,000 to 1 million workers may become unemployed \nas a result of the hurricane, with the unemployment rate reaching 25 \npercent or higher in the gulf region. Many affected workers will be \nunemployed for 9 months or longer.\n  The new jobs in the clean up, recovery, and rebuilding of the area \nwill be a major source of new employment, and we need to be sure that \nthey pay decent wages. This is all that Davis-Bacon does: it simply \nensures that workers on Federal Government\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\nprojects earn a typical wage. Otherwise the large size of Federal \ncontracts can overwhelm a local labor market lead to bidding wars that \ndrive wages down. Indeed, Representative Davis and Senator Bacon were \nRepublicans who wanted to protect local contractors, who would not be \nable to compete in such a price war.\n  Workers who take these jobs will already face special hazards. Each \nday the administration reveals more details about workers' exposure to \nelevated levels of e.coli, toxic chemicals from flooded Superfund \nsites, and contaminants from massive oil spills. These workers should \nnot have to suffer below-market wages, too.\n  But the President apparently believes that workers in Louisiana, \nMississippi, Alabama, and parts of Florida don't even deserve to earn a \ndecent wage for a day's work. He would have you believe that Davis-\nBacon wages are exorbitant--nothing could be further from the truth. \nIndeed, in areas affected by Katrina, some typical wages include: $9.16 \nper hour sheet metal workers, in Pearl River County, MS, $10.00 per \nhour for laborers in Livingston Parish, LA, $8.54 hour for truckdrivers \nin Mobile County, AL. And Federal spending post-Hurricane Katrina \nshould be lifting workers up, not forcing them into a race to the \nbottom.\n  I urge the Congress to reverse the President's decision and to stand \nwith the hardworking men and women of the gulf coast as they rebuild \ntheir towns and their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10303-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10303-S10304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 245--RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF \n                            SIMON WIESENTHAL\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Reid, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Brownback, \nMr. Smith, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Biden, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \nAllen, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Carper, Mr. Graham, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida, Mr. Levin, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Burr, Mr. Alexander, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Salazar, Mr. \nCornyn, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Talent, Mr. Conrad, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \nDurbin, and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 245\n\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal was born on December 31, 1908, to \n     Jewish merchants in Buczacz, in what is now the Lvov Oblast \n     section of the Ukraine;\n       Whereas after he was denied admission to the Polytechnic \n     Institute in Lvov because of quota restrictions on Jewish \n     students, Simon Wiesenthal received his degree in engineering \n     from the Technical University of Prague in 1932;\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal worked in an architectural office \n     until he was forced to close his business and become a \n     mechanic in a bedspring factory, following the Russian army's \n     occupation of Lvov and purge of Jewish professionals;\n       Whereas following the Germany occupation of Ukraine in \n     1941, Simon Wiesenthal was initially detained in the Janwska \n     concentration camp near Lvov, after which he and his wife \n     were assigned to the forced labor camp serving the Ostbahn \n     Works, which was the repair shop for Lvov's Eastern Railroad;\n       Whereas in August of 1942, Simon Wiesenthal's mother was \n     sent to the Belzec death camp as part of Nazi Germany's \n     ``Final Solution'', and by the end of the next month 89 of \n     his relatives had been killed;\n       Whereas with the help of the Polish Underground Simon \n     Wiesenthal was able to help his wife escape the Ostbahn camp \n     in 1942, and in 1943 was himself able to escape just before \n     German guards began executing inmates, but he was recaptured \n     the following year and sent to the Janwska camp;\n       Whereas following the collapse of the German eastern front, \n     the SS guards at Janwska took Simon Wiesenthal and the \n     remaining camp survivors and joined the westward retreat from \n     approaching Russian forces;\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal was 1 of the few survivors of the \n     retreat to Mauthausen, Austria and was on the brink of death, \n     weighing only 99 pounds, when Mauthausen was liberated by \n     American forces on May 5, 1945;\n       Whereas after surviving 12 Nazi prison camps, including 5 \n     death camps, Wiesenthal chose not to return to his previous \n     occupation, and instead dedicated himself to finding Nazi war \n     criminals and bringing them to justice;\n       Whereas following the liberation of Mauthausen, Simon \n     Wiesenthal began collecting evidence of Nazi activity for the \n     War Crimes Section of the United States Army, and after the \n     war continued these efforts for the Army's Office of \n     Strategic Services and Counter-Intelligence Corps;\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal would also go on to head the \n     Jewish Central Committee of the United States Zone of \n     Austria, a relief and welfare organization;\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal and his wife were reunited in \n     1945, and had a daughter the next year;\n       Whereas the evidence supplied by Wiesenthal was utilized in \n     the United States Zone war crime trials;\n       Whereas, after concluding his work with the United States \n     Army in 1947, Simon Wiesenthal and others opened and operated \n     the Jewish Historical Documentation Center in Linz, Austria, \n     for the purpose of assembling evidence for future Nazi \n     trials, before closing the office and providing its files to \n     the Yad Vashem Archives in Israel in 1954;\n       Whereas despite his heavy involvement in relief work and \n     occupational education for Soviet refugees, Simon Wiesenthal \n     tenaciously continued his pursuit of Adolf Eichmann, who had \n     served as the head of the Gestapo's Jewish Department and \n     supervised the implementation of the ``Final Solution'';\n       Whereas in 1953, Simon Wiesenthal acquired evidence that \n     Adolf Eichmann was living in Argentina and passed this \n     information to the Government of Israel;\n       Whereas this information, coupled with information about \n     Eichmann's whereabouts in Argentina provided to Israel by \n     Germany in 1959, led to Eichmann's capture by Israeli agents, \n     trial and conviction in Israel, and execution on May 31, \n     1961;\n       Whereas following Eichmann's capture, Wiesenthal opened a \n     new Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna, Austria, for the \n     purpose of collecting and analyzing information to aid in the \n     location and apprehension of war criminals;\n       Whereas Karl Silberbauer, the Gestapo officer who arrested \n     Anne Frank, Franz Stangl, the commandant of the Treblinka and \n     Sobibor concentration camps in Poland, and Hermine \n     Braunsteiner, who had supervised the killings of several \n     hundred children at Majdanek, are among the approximately \n     1,100 war criminals found and brought to justice as a result \n     of Simon Wiesenthal's investigative, analytical, and \n     undercover operations;\n       Whereas Simon Wiesenthal bravely forged ahead with his \n     mission of promoting tolerance and justice in the face of \n     danger and resistance, including numerous threats and the \n     bombing of his home in 1982;\n       Whereas the Simon Wiesenthal Center was established in \n     1977, to focus on the prosecution of Nazi war criminals, \n     commemorate the events of the Holocaust, teach tolerance \n     education, and promote Middle East affairs;\n       Whereas the Simon Wiesenthal Center monitors and combats \n     the growth of neo-Nazi activity in Europe and keeps watch \n     over concentration camp sites to ensure that the memory of \n     the Holocaust and the sanctity of those sites are preserved;\n       Whereas the Simon Wiesenthal Center played a pivotal role \n     in convincing foreign governments to pass laws enabling the \n     prosecution of Nazi war criminals;\n       Whereas throughout his lifetime, Simon Wiesenthal has had \n     many honors and awards bestowed upon him, including \n     decorations from the Austrian and French resistance \n     movements, the Dutch Freedom Medal, the Luxembourg Freedom \n     Medal, the United Nations League for the Help of Refugees \n     Award, the French Legion of Honor, and the United States \n     Congressional Gold Medal, which was presented to him by \n     President James Carter in 1980;\n       Whereas President Ronald W. Reagan once remarked, ``For \n     what Simon Wiesenthal represents are the animating principles \n     of Western civilization since the day Moses came down from \n     Sinai: the idea of justice, the idea of laws, the idea of the \n     free will.'';\n       Whereas President George H. W. Bush has stated that Simon \n     Wiesenthal, ``is our living embodiment of remembrance. The \n     two pledges of Simon Wiesenthal's life inspire us all -- \n     `Never forget' and `Never again'.'';\n       Whereas President William Clinton has remarked of Simon \n     Wiesenthal, ``To those who know his story, one of miraculous \n     survival and of relentless pursuit of justice, the answer is \n     apparent. From the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust, \n     only a few voices survived, to bear witness, to hold the \n     guilty accountable, to honor the memory of those who were \n     killed. Only if we heed these brave voices can we build a \n     bulwark of humanity against the hatred and indifference that \n     is still all too prevalent in this world of ours.''; and\n       Whereas, at the end of a life dedicated to the pursuit of \n     justice and advocacy for victims of the Holocaust, Simon \n     Wiesenthal passed away on September 20, 2005, at the age of \n     96: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its most sincere condolences to the family \n     and friends of Simon Wiesenthal;\n       (2) recognizes the life and accomplishments of Simon \n     Wiesenthal, who, after surviving the Holocaust, spent more \n     than 50 years helping to bring Nazi war criminals to justice \n     and was a vigorous opponent of anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism, and \n     racism; and\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\n       (3) recognizes and commends Simon Wiesenthal's legacy of \n     promoting tolerance, his tireless efforts to bring about \n     justice, and the continuing pursuit of these ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10304-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10304-S10307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 246--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \nMISSIONS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD IN RESPONDING \n                          TO HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nStevens, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Lott, and Ms. Murkowski) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 246\n\n       Whereas the United States Coast Guard has been charged by \n     Congress with missions central to protecting the lives and \n     well-being of individuals and communities in the United \n     States, including protecting homeland security, conducting \n     search and rescue of lives in danger, protecting marine \n     environments from pollution, maintaining maritime safety and \n     aids to navigation, enforcing Federal fishing laws, and \n     intercepting illegal drugs and migrants before they reach our \n     shores;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard anticipated the potential for \n     significant loss of life and property as Hurricane Katrina \n     approached Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and made \n     landfall on August 29, 2005 and, in advance of the storm, \n     relocated its personnel, vessels, and aircraft out of harm's \n     way;\n       Whereas Hurricane Katrina made landfall as a Category 4 \n     hurricane with winds reaching 175 miles per hour and massive \n     storm surges, the combination of which left a trail of \n     devastation unprecedented on United States soil, as it \n     leveled countless homes, businesses, and other structures, \n     displaced millions of people from their communities, and \n     otherwise made coastal urban and rural areas unliveable;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard immediately deployed nearly 1,000 \n     personnel, including captains, crew, pilots, rescue swimmers, \n     pollution response teams, and other specialists and \n     reservists, from stations all over the country, to coastal \n     areas affected by the hurricane, for a total regional force \n     size of approximately 3,619 personnel;\n       Whereas Coast Guard personnel who had never personally \n     worked together before began to work as teams to conduct and \n     coordinate search and rescue operations while Hurricane \n     Katrina continued to bear down on the central Gulf of Mexico \n     shoreline;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard rescued or evacuated 33,544 \n     individuals as of September 21, 2005, a number that \n     represents eight times the number of lives saved by the Coast \n     Guard in an average year;\n       Whereas three Coast Guard pollution response Strike Teams \n     responded to 1,129 pollution incidents as of September 20, \n     2005, which include total discharges of more than 7 million \n     gallons of oil, unknown amounts of sewage, and unknown \n     quantities of other toxic chemicals, and the Coast Guard has \n     contained or otherwise closed 426 of these cases;\n       Whereas Coast Guard buoy tenders have responded to 964 \n     discrepancies in buoys and other aids to navigation and have \n     restored 39 of 48 critical aids to navigation as of September \n     21, 2005;\n       Whereas the costs of responding to Hurricane Katrina have \n     depleted the Coast Guard's operations and maintenance budget \n     for fiscal year 2005 and are rapidly depleting its budget for \n     fiscal year 2006, and the Coast Guard's costs associated with \n     this hurricane are anticipated to exceed $500 million;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard performed its hurricane response \n     missions largely with outdated legacy assets, increasing the \n     wear and tear on these assets while foregoing regularly \n     scheduled maintenance activities in the interest of \n     sustaining its surge in life-saving operations;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard already conducts its missions with \n     the 40th oldest fleet of the 42 nations with Coast Guard or \n     naval fleets;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard's program, known as Deepwater, for \n     modernizing its fleet of vessels and aircraft, is vital for \n     increasing the capabilities in performing its missions in the \n     face of ever-increasing natural and human threats;\n       Whereas the Deepwater program requires sustained Federal \n     funding commitments in order for the citizens of the United \n     States to realize the benefits of the Coast Guard having \n     state-of-the-art vessels, aircraft, technologies, and \n     interoperable communication equipment;\n       Whereas in addition to covering operation and maintenance \n     costs of a rapidly aging fleet, the Coast Guard needs to \n     rebuild several Coast Guard facilities in Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, and Alabama, including Station Gulfport which \n     was completely destroyed and where personnel are now working \n     in trailers amidst the ruins of that station;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard needs a strong Federal funding \n     commitment to ensure that all of its unexpected expenditures \n     during its response to Katrina are reimbursed;\n       Whereas more than 700 Coast Guard personnel stationed in \n     the Gulf region lost their homes and all personal property \n     and are now living on overcrowded Coast Guard vessels and in \n     makeshift shelters;\n       Whereas before, during, and after the landfall of Hurricane \n     Katrina, Coast Guard personnel exhibited determination and a \n     full commitment to their missions, and the Coast Guard has \n     proven to be one of the most resourceful and capable services \n     in the United States government;\n       Whereas before, during, and after the landfall of Hurricane \n     Katrina, Coast Guard personnel performed their missions with \n     the highest level of bravery and self-sacrifice, and their \n     effectiveness in performing their missions is unparalleled in \n     the United States government;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard has an operational and command \n     structure that allowed it to quickly take a leadership role \n     in saving lives, without waiting for instruction or \n     permission to act;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard's operational and command structure \n     continues to serve as a model for other agencies that need to \n     respond quickly to large-scale natural and man-made \n     disasters;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard's effective leadership in \n     responding to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and the \n     appointment of Vice Admiral Thad Allen as the primary Federal \n     officer in charge of this response, is helping to restore the \n     public's confidence in the Federal response effort: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate  That it is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States Coast Guard should receive Congress's \n     highest commendation for its tremendous and highly effective \n     response to the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina;\n       (2) the United States Congress should commit to providing \n     the Coast Guard with the resources it needs to modernize and \n     maintain its fleet of vessels and aircraft; and\n       (3) the Administration should ensure that the Coast Guard \n     receives sufficient funding to cover its unexpected \n     operational and capital costs associated with Hurricane \n     Katrina.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and praise the \nextraordinary response of the U.S. Coast Guard to Hurricane Katrina, to \ndemonstrate why that response exemplifies the imperative of providing \nthat service with the modern assets required to carry out these \nlifesaving missions, and to submit a resolution recognizing the awe-\ninspiring efforts of the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  I just visited the gulf coast region on Monday with the Commandant of \nthe Coast Guard, Tom Collins, and we were guided by Eighth District \nCommander ADM Robert Duncan. What I saw and heard on that day is a \nstory of heroism and a relentless can-do attitude that is nothing short \nof miraculous. The human spirit I witnessed was truly transcendental \nand a level I had never before experienced.\n  As we well know, Hurricane Katrina was the worst natural disaster \never to visit itself upon the United States, with an almost \nunimaginable magnitude of devastation and loss. The scale of the \ndestruction has been most horrifically reflected in the faces of those \nwe have seen over the past week, faces etched with an indelible and \nalmost unimaginable sorrow, suffering, and burden. Their images have \nreverberated throughout a country in solidarity with their terrible \nplight. In Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama lives have been forever \ntransformed along with the landscape, as we have witnessed untold \nscenes of homes that no longer exist, floods that ravaged entire \nneighborhoods and cities, fires that consumed what remains of \nbuildings, and men, women, and children missing loved ones. We have \nalso seen and heard the stories of those individuals who have rushed to \nthe aid of our fellow man, demonstrating that no human or natural act \ncan deprive us of our unyielding and singularly determined spirit. \nWhile the hurricane winds and rain have long since dissipated--and now \nwe have anticipation of Hurricane Rita--we all have the collective \nconcern and strength of this Nation that continues unabated, unbroken, \nundaunted, and unflagging.\n  We must now bring to bear all of our collective will and resources \nover what will undoubtedly be a long but ultimately victorious process \nof reclaiming the gulf coast towns and cities for the future. I extend \nmy thoughts and prayers to my colleagues, Senators Cochran, Lott, \nSessions, Shelby, Landrieu, and Vitter, as they work to guide their \nconstituents and their families through these most difficult of times. \nI will certainly do everything I can to assist them and the citizens of \ntheir States.\n  Today, as chair of the Fisheries and Coast Guard Subcommittee, I \nbelieve it is entirely appropriate to focus the Nation's attention on \nthe performance of the U.S. Coast Guard in response to Hurricane \nKatrina, as I believe it is an\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\nexemplary model for future responses. As I do so, I also thank all of \nour military Active-Duty and Reserve for their heroic service in the \ngulf shore region. Their performance under these conditions has been \noutstanding and unprecedented on American soil.\n  As a result of the U.S. Coast Guard's unparalleled performance and \noperations responding to the unfathomable destruction along the Gulf of \nMexico, the plans for which were put into motion even before the storm \nsubsided, thousands of children, senior citizens, and entire families \nare sleeping safely tonight. Indeed, the heart-wrenching stories I \nheard during my visit to the Coast Guard--of crews rescuing families \ntrapped in attics, of children separated from their parents, rescue \nswimmers tapping on roofs seeking signs of life in submerged houses--\nwill be forever etched in my own mind. People waving towels from \nwindows signifying the need for help, pregnant women about to go into \nlabor being hoisted into awaiting helicopters, rescue crews busting \ninto windows and roofs because there was no means of escape for the \noccupants--the stories are real, seemingly endless, and all faced with \nan unrelenting sense of duty and humanity by the men and women of the \nCoast Guard.\n  Indeed, over the past few weeks, as we see in this chart, we have \nwitnessed time and time again from news sources and television stations \nthe perilous helicopter rescues occurring each and every day. There is \nan outstanding example of one on this chart that shows exactly the kind \nof circumstance the Coast Guard has to perform in which to save life \nafter life. Incredibly, the Coast Guard, as of September 20, has saved \n33,544 lives. That is the equivalent of the number of rescues performed \nby the Coast Guard in 8 to 10 years. They accomplished those rescue \nmissions in just the past 2 weeks. The Coast Guard air station in New \nOrleans, which I visited on Monday, under the incredible leadership of \nCAPT Bruce Jones, has saved 6,471 lives, almost double the 3,689 lives \nthe station had saved over its previous 50 years of operation.\n  This chart shows the level of catastrophe to which the Coast Guard \nresponded. I talked to a rescue swimmer who genuinely believed that if \nhe had completed 15 rescues that day, it somehow wasn't enough. What is \nperhaps most remarkable is that the Coast Guard simply did not rescue \nthese people and deliver them to a nearby field or highway overpass \nuntil they could get further help. Nor did they forget that other \nfamily members remained in peril, not yet rescued. Rather, the men and \nwomen of the Coast Guard took it upon themselves to ensure to the best \nof their ability that families would be kept intact and assisted those \nthey rescued even after the rescue operation was complete. They \nactually returned to overpasses to follow up with those whom they had \nrescued. And if they still needed additional assistance or they hadn't \nbeen taken to where they should have been going with the medical rescue \ncrews, they made that happen.\n\n  They got them water if they needed it. If they required food, they \nbrought them food. As ADM Robert Duncan, District Commander for the \ngulf region, so eloquently expressed:\n\n       When the Coast Guard rescue teams touched a person, they \n     owned them.\n\n  This meant the Coast Guard was making itself responsible for their \ncontinued well-being. I ask my colleagues, what could be a more \ntouching or profound testament to the boundless will and compassion \nthat the U.S. Coast Guard exhibited during this operation? The people \nof the Coast Guard have conducted themselves oblivious to the true \nlevel of their own personal sacrifice and seemingly without regard to \nthe horrific conditions in which they serve. Seventy percent of them \nalone lost their houses; lost everything, that is, but their sense of \nduty to their fellow human beings in distress and despair.\n  The fact is, the Coast Guard has been, is, and will always remain a \nvital component of America's national security and disaster response. \nCoast Guard personnel risk their lives each and every day protecting \nour Nation and saving lives, no more so than during this national \ntragedy. Leadership, as we all know, starts from the top. For the U.S. \nCoast Guard, that individual is ADM Tom Collins. Admiral Collins has \nbeen a solid steady force in ensuring the rapid and safe execution of \nrescue operations.\n  In the midst of the storm and bureaucratic interagency chaos, the \nCoast Guard remained resolved, organized, focused, and responsive to \nthose in desperate need.\n  The bottom line is that the members of the Coast Guard did not wait \nto be told to conduct their mission. They knew their mission. They \nrefused to let anything, including redtape, get in their way. When they \nneeded fuel for helicopters, they found fuel. When they needed water \nfor their crews or for those they rescued, they found water. They did \nnot ask if an operation was actually a State responsibility or local \nresponsibility or another Federal agency's responsibility. They made it \ntheir responsibility. They took ownership of the life-and-death tasks \nat hand. Again, the can-do attitude of the Coast Guard is what allowed \nthem to shine.\n  As Vice Admiral Allen, the principal Federal officer in charge of the \nrelief operation, so simply stated:\n\n       The Coast Guard has a bias for action.\n\n  And from all I have seen, I could not agree more.\n  Indeed, the results are a living testament to the service's \nefficiency and organization and the superlative leadership of Admiral \nCollins.\n  The Coast Guard had the foresight and the wherewithal to pre-position \nits assets before the storm struck and to respond rapidly to its \naftermath. Moreover, the Coast Guard's exceptional planning led to not \na single loss of a Coast Guard plane or boat and enabled it to be on \nthe scene immediately upon the passage of the storm. This planning \nexpertise and management of assets should be the example for all \nFederal agencies to follow.\n  The Coast Guard also sent to the area personnel from Coast Guard \nstations from around the country to help with the effort as part of its \nwell-conceived plan. These personnel specialize in different fields and \nhad never previously worked together yet got the job done as if they \nhad been on the same team forever.\n  I think of the 160 crew members attached to the Coast Guard cutter \nHarriet Lane, a 270-foot cutter I visited on Monday, docked in New \nOrleans, that normally berths just 100 crew members. Yet all of those \naboard worked flawlessly together, overcoming obstacle after obstacle.\n  In one instance, due to the cutter's inability to make water from \noil-polluted river water, the crew set out to procure water from \nwherever possible. This mission led them to the discovery of water held \nin tanks controlled by the Forest Service on the pier. Unable to simply \ngive them the water due to bureaucratic hurdles, the Coast Guard found \na contractor who was able to pump water from their tanks into the \ncutter.\n  This is a ridiculous hurdle that should never have existed in the \nfirst place. Yet, once again, the Coast Guard didn't waste time with \nbureaucratic paperwork; instead, they got the job done.\n  The bottom line is, from what we have seen to date, I believe that \nthe Coast Guard's Herculean efforts provides a model for the proper \nplanning and execution of a mission to respond to a national emergency \nor crisis. And on that note, I was certainly pleased that Vice Admiral \nAllen was selected to coordinate the Federal response to Katrina. He \nwill bring that Coast Guard sensibility to the entire operation.\n  These astounding results, however, do not come without a cost. The \nCoast Guard has already used the funds allocated for search and rescue \noperations for the entire year and beyond. Furthermore, the extensive \nrate of use during the rescue mission is also degrading Coast Guard \nassets faster and delaying necessary maintenance.\n  Supplemental funding, which the Coast Guard has not yet received, is \nessential to ensure that cutters, small boats, and aircraft can operate \nand continue its heroic service in the coming months.\n  The Coast Guard has sustained damage to several small boat stations \nand air stations and to other facilities throughout the region. The \nCoast Guard station in Gulfport, MS, simply no longer exists.\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\n  The Coast Guard is actively assisting Americans, and we in the \nCongress must return the favor and start helping the Coast Guard by \nproviding them with crucial supplemental funding to cover the entirety \nof their operational requirements and to provide the necessary funding \nto replace its lost infrastructure.\n  In that light, I have sent a letter to the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget encouraging him to include a funding line in the \nnext supplemental appropriations bill for the Coast Guard. I thank my \nmany colleagues who have joined me in support of this request.\n  In addition, the Coast Guard is charged with maintaining all the aids \nto navigation within the region, including those of the Mississippi \nRiver. These aids were either totally lost or severely damaged.\n  Again, it shows on this chart that Congress has also mandated the \nCoast Guard to respond to marine environmental pollution, which is now \nreaching untold levels of hazardous contamination throughout the \nMississippi and Gulf of Mexico, and I think it is an indication of all \nthe responses to the contamination of oil spills in the region to which \nthe Coast Guard has had to respond. More than 7 million gallons of oil \nhas polluted the water in New Orleans.\n\n  The bottom line is, not only have the people of the Coast Guard been \nrisking their own lives to save the 33,544 other individuals, but they \nhave also responded to hazardous liquid spills in the region, conducted \n4,688 sorties, carried out 11,548 small boat and cutter sorties, \nrepaired vital aids to navigation to facilitate the flow of commerce in \nthe Mississippi, and have assisted in the replenishment of critical \nsupplies to thousands of displaced persons.\n  Yet, as capable and successful as the Coast Guard has been in \ncarrying out all of its missions, including opening the ports and the \nwaterways and drug interdiction--they are even doing that down there in \ncombination with all of these other missions--this service was already \nstretched thin in the aftermath of 9/11. Unless Congress pledges to \nequip the service with modern equipment, we jeopardize the success of \nany future missions. The Coast Guard requires new cutters and aircraft \nnow, and it can start this process only if Congress fully funds \nDeepwater, the service's recapitalization program for procuring new \ncutters, small boats, and aircraft.\n  The Senate version of the Coast Guard bill authorizes a total of $8.2 \nbillion for the Coast Guard, $400 million over the administration's \nrequest. Within that request, Deepwater authorized $1.1 billion, $134 \nmillion over the administration's request. We must ensure our numbers, \nthe Senate numbers, which are the higher numbers, are maintained in \nconference of this legislation.\n  By accomplishing this, it will allow for a targeted acceleration of \nrequired assets, those resources deemed most critical to the Coast \nGuard now.\n  The current situation can only be categorized as dire. It is a \nnational disgrace that this service that is integral to search and \nrescue operations, integral to our homeland security, as we saw in the \naftermath of September 11 when they immediately secured New York \nHarbor, integral to our fishing industry, would be operating the 40th \noldest fleet out of 42 in the world. Only the Philippines and Mexico \nhave older fleets. Deepwater is designed to remedy this situation, but \nin 20 to 25 years, rather than as I have insisted and I have requested, \nthat Deepwater needs to be completed in 10 to 15 years at the outset.\n  If anyone questions the condition of the Coast Guard assets, I \nsuggest they go out and sail on an aging cutter, go fly on an aging \nairframe, and you will witness firsthand the conditions that we \ncontinue to place upon the dedicated members of the Coast Guard. You \nonly have to recall the graphic portrayals of what occurred during \nHurricane Katrina, when these Coast Guard men and women performed under \nsuch perilous circumstances, when they were able to save so many \nthousands and thousands of men and women--in fact, more than 33,544 \nindividuals under very hazardous circumstances and conditions.\n  At my subcommittee's June 21 hearing on the revised Deepwater \nimplementation plan, we once again revisited the Coast Guard's current \nstatus of its legacy assets and the extremely high maintenance costs \nassociated with them. The inescapable conclusion was the Coast Guard \ncannot continue on the path it is currently being forced to walk. It \nrequires the additional money, the additional cutters and aircraft, and \nthe latest technologies associated with command, control, and \ncommunications.\n  On my visit to the cutter Harriet Lane in New Orleans this last week, \nI was briefed on the extreme difficulties encountered in trying to \nestablish effective communications among Federal, State, and local \nagencies. This cutter does not have the communications capabilities of \nwhat a new Deepwater cutter would be able to provide.\n  In fact, when cell phones didn't work and text messages were limited, \nthey tried to find old satellite phones to use to communicate. We know \nthat the new equipment on the new ships would provide this kind of \ncapability that is absolutely essential. They would be paramount in \nstreamlining and making these rescue efforts more efficient.\n  Yet, even without this new technology, the Coast Guard, as I said, \nmade it work with the resources they had at their disposal. With an \ninadequate amount of satellite receivers, the cutters still prioritized \nand switched communication channels to effectively prosecute the \nmission.\n  Yet the undeniable truth is, such a workaround should not have to \nhappen and would not happen on new Deepwater cutters.\n  The Coast Guard is a service clearly already populated with heroes. \nWe should not ask them all to be MacGuivers, as well as jury-rigging \nand Rube Goldberging rescue operations already perilous enough.\n  Doesn't America deserve better? Don't the men and women of the Coast \nGuard who perform so heroically deserve more from us than fighting 21st \ncentury threats and the war on terrorism with equipment from World War \nII?\n  Think about it: Some of these ships were operating when Emperor \nHirohito of Japan surrendered to the United States, operating through \nthe Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Cold War, the fall of the Berlin \nWall and the Soviet Union, and yet they remain as part of our U.S. \nCoast Guard in the year 2005. Some vessels are so old the Coast Guard \nhas to go to maritime museums to find spare parts.\n\n  How can we relegate the Coast Guard to this fate? As you look on this \nchart, USA Today did a very indepth story on the Coast Guard and its \naging assets of ships and aircraft. It says, and this was done July 6:\n\n       Aging Fleet Could Threaten Service's Anti-terror Mission.\n\n  That is what it is all about. We should have learned in the aftermath \nof September 11 what we need to accelerate, what we need to establish \nfor priorities and making sure the agency we ask so much from, the \nCoast Guard, that we ask to do so much for so little, gets at least the \nequipment they deserve when they are performing these risky missions, \nas we have seen so graphically over the last few weeks.\n  How can we relegate the Coast Guard to this fate? How can a nation of \nsuch resources fail to provide them to this indispensable service?\n  While the people of the Coast Guard certainly go above and beyond the \ncall of duty, the very equipment they sail and fly on has gone way \nbeyond the call of duty, and it is time they were retired for good.\n  Yet the Coast Guard will continue to operate one of the oldest fleets \nfor another 20 to 25 years with the current funding formula that is \nbeing made available for the Deepwater program. We are not just talking \nabout ships. Under Deepwater, vital aircraft, including the outdated \nHH-65 Dolphin and the HH-60 Jayhawk helicopters we have all seen \nconducting the rescue hoists on television, would be reengined and \nreoutfitted with improved navigation and radar equipment. But if \nDeepwater is not fully funded, these crucial improvements will not \noccur on a timely basis, preventing the Coast Guard from being fully \ncapable when the next tragedy strikes.\n  These are not exaggerated predictions. Pilots told me firsthand that \nwith the new technology, they could have seen much more clearly in the\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\ntotal darkness that loomed over New Orleans, allowing them to identify \ndowned power lines, vertical obstructions, and citizens requiring \nassistance.\n  That is why I repeatedly urged the administration and the Congress, \nfor the last 4 years, to increase the funding for this program \nimmediately and why I successfully fought to include a report on the \npossibility of accelerating the Deepwater program from a 20-to-25-year \nprogram to a 10-year program in the Homeland Security bill.\n  The fact is, by reducing the duration of implementation for the \nprogram, the Coast Guard could receive these vital assets 10 to 15 \nyears sooner, and not a moment too soon in my book. We cannot forget \nthat ships are not constructed in weeks or months. They take years to \ndesign and fabricate.\n  Now, only one national security cutter is in fabrication. The \noffshore patrol cutter is not in production, and the fast response \ncutter remains in the design phase. So we must act now.\n  Moreover, the unequivocal findings of the report I required was \nacceleration of the Deepwater program is not only feasible, it would \nalso save the American taxpayers a billion dollars in total acquisition \ncosts.\n  So, I ask, what exactly is there not to get? By accelerating the \nDeepwater program, we would provide desperately-needed updated \nequipment to this premier security and search and rescue service, while \nsaving taxpayer money, not to mention ultimately saving lives. Simply \nput, it defies the laws of common sense to not implement Deepwater as \nsoon as possible.\n  That is why I have recently sent the appropriations committee a \nletter, urging them to increase the funding for Deepwater in this \nyear's Homeland Security appropriations bill. Specifically, in the \nSenate version of the Coast Guard's authorization bill, we authorize \n$1.1 billion to be appropriated for Deepwater. This level will keep the \nCoast Guard on the proper road to guide them toward a modern maritime \nfleet of cutters and aircraft, able to perform their vital missions in \nthe 21st century.\n  It is critically important we not only provide the level of funding \nbut we also ensure that we accelerate the Deepwater acquisition program \nto 10 to 15 years as absolutely vital and essential.\n  So I hope we would be able to also release from the Senate the Coast \nGuard authorization legislation that allows for the increased funding, \nthat allows for this process to continue and, in addition, to get the \nhigher amount of the appropriations and to get the acceleration of the \nDeepwater program.\n  That is what I ask, that we release the Coast Guard authorization \nbill that is bottled up in the Senate. We need to remove all of the \nexcuses and allow this process to go forward for the service that has \nconducted itself so courageously and heroically during the course of \nHurricane Katrina.\n  In visiting with the men and women of the various Coast Guard \nstations, in New Orleans as well as the station in Gulfport, MS, I can \ntell you not one was complaining--not one. In fact, one admiral said, \nyou know, we have just been telling you some of the obstacles we had to \novercome to do our job, and we will do it no matter what, no matter the \ncircumstance. We are asking you not to use it as a rationale to defer \nthe needed repairs, maintenance, and the new equipment for the future \nbecause we don't know what is in the future when it comes to \nunforeseeable events. We cannot predict. We did not predict 9/11. We \npredicted Hurricane Katrina. Look what happened. It was the Coast Guard \nthat performed that mission. But we have to make sure that the Coast \nGuard receives the funding it requires in the future in order to enable \nit to respond as it did during the course of Hurricane Katrina. We \ncannot build ships nor aircraft overnight. It takes several years to \nget these ships in the pipeline.\n  So unless we get the authorization bill out of the Senate and out of \nthe entire Congress that we have been urging for months to get done, to \nhave an accelerating program, to get the appropriations that are \nessential, that cannot happen. So I am pleading with the Senate, \npleading with the Congress to do what is right for this magnificent \nagency that is, by the way, on the frontlines for protecting us and our \nhomeland security, one of the greatest problems of which, as you know, \nis the transshipment of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The Coast Guard is also essential and a vital component in protecting \nour homeland.\n  They are a multimission agency. They are asked, as I said earlier, to \ndo so much with so little. And even as they are performing down there \nin the gulf, they didn't ignore their other responsibilities--because \nof homeland security--for keeping the waterways open, which they have \nnow done in the gulf, because it is important we continue the commerce, \nthe interdiction of drugs; as a matter of fact, even over the weekend, \nproviding the humanitarian assistance that is so vital, cleaning up the \noil spills and the pollution that has occurred. As I showed you in a \nprevious chart, as we have seen here in the active response that they \nhave provided in so many areas, because of the spill of oil that is \npolluting the area and contaminating the water, that has complicated \nthe task of the cleanup. You can't ask the Agency to do more in \naddition to the saving of 33,000 lives. When I talked to the rescue \nswimmers and the pilots, I asked them what was the greatest challenge \nand they said: You know, we were overwhelmed, we were overwhelmed \nbecause we had so many people to rescue, and we feel we are doing \nnothing in a day when we are rescuing 15 individuals--under, as you can \nimagine, some very difficult and dire circumstances.\n  I ask my colleagues, what more does the Coast Guard have to do to \nprove its immense value to America? After the service's heroic and well \nplanned efforts in responding to Hurricane Katrina, they have clearly \nand convincingly shown that all Americans are well served by the United \nStates Coast Guard.\n  Therefore, I am proud to send this resolution to the desk for \nconsideration in the Senate, which gives recognition to the valiant \nwork of the Coast Guard. The resolution also notes the necessity of \nimproving the Coast Guard's aging fleet of ships and aircraft. I hope \nall of my colleagues can support this resolution.\n  Now is the time for us in the Congress to fully recognize the \nimportance of the Coast Guard and provide the service with the assets \nit needs to do the job now and into the future. The time has come, it \nis now our responsibility and our solemn duty to ensure it has the \nresources needed in order to serve the citizens of the United States \nfor decades to come and I hope my colleagues will join me in that \neffort.\n  It is vital because they are on the frontlines. They responded \nmagnificently, and they should be recognized and rewarded and applauded \nfor the job they have done and the job they will continue to do in the \nfuture. I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield to me for a request.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator allow me to be a cosponsor of her \nresolution?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes, I will be happy to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I compliment her for her forceful words on the Coast \nGuard, and I wish to align myself with them, as I fully believe in the \nremarks of the Senator.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am delighted to add my colleague, the Senator from \nMaryland, as a cosponsor. She has been an ardent advocate and supporter \nof the Coast Guard. I thank the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add the Senator from Maryland as a \ncosponsor of this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/21/senate-section/article/S10307-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10307-S10309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1770.

One is the emergency tax \nrelief bill passed today.\n\n[[Page S10324]]\n\n  The second is the health and welfare bill introduced last Thursday.\n  And we're working on a third bill to help rebuild and rejuvenate the \nGulf region.\n  Today I met with Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour to hear about the \nneeds of people in the Katrina area, both now and in the future.\n  In addition to Senator Baucus, I've been working with my colleagues \nfrom Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, including the cosponsors of \nthis tax bill--Senators Lott, Landrieu, Vitter, Cochran and Shelby.\n  For the next package, we're taking ideas from these senators.\n  I've talked with Senator Vitter, Senator Lott and Senator Landrieu \nabout tax incentives and expect to talk with the rest of the group in \nthe coming days.\n  We've had the biggest natural disaster in history. People are \nhurting, and we're getting them help.\n  We know that tax incentives helped to revitalize New York after 9/11. \nThey can do the same for New Orleans, Gulfport and the other hurricane-\nhit areas.\n  The immediate relief package will help get short-term aid to \nhurricane victims by encouraging food donations and the employment of \ndisplaced individuals, for example.\n  For those who've suffered casualty losses, we've liberalized the tax \nrules to permit affected taxpayers to deduct losses from damaged \nproperty.\n  We also want to help protect Katrina victims from undeserved IRS \nharassment.\n  It's good that the House and Senate quickly worked out minor \ndifferences in our respective versions of the bill.\n  We need to get these tax incentives on the books and help Katrina \nvictims make a fresh start.\n  The President is working to restore a high quality of life to the \npeople of the gulf region, and today we're contributing a solid piece \nof legislation to his effort.\n  After this package is completed, our focus will be on longer-term tax \nincentives to help rebuild homes and businesses.\n  We're looking at depreciation changes, tax-exempt bond authority, \ntax-exempt bond refunding, and enterprise-zone initiatives.\n  In the coming days and weeks, the Finance Committee will be examining \nthese ideas with an eye toward the most effective and efficient use of \nthe taxpayer's dollar.\n  The more thoughtful we are, and the more expeditiously we act, the \nsooner the people of the gulf region can return home, earn a living, \nand rebuild their communities.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, traveling down to the gulf coast region \nlast week, I saw firsthand the havoc that Hurricane Katrina had \nwreaked. As colleagues who have been down there know, in many places, \nit is stunning. It is like a war zone. It is worse than the pictures.\n  At one stop, we went into what was left of a library. Muck and ruin \ncovered books and other library materials. One shiny object caught my \neye and I picked up. It was a DVD of the film, ``The Perfect Storm.''\n  The victims of Katrina have many immediate needs. The legislation \nthat we pass today will address four of them.\n  One, they need cash. And they need it fast. Two, they need jobs. \nThree, they need housing. And four, charities need help from Congress \nso they can help the victims of the hurricane.\n  I am pleased that Congress could come together and act quickly on \nthis emergency tax relief to address those needs.\n  First, victims of Katrina need immediate access to cash. The working \npoor should not lose government benefits that they currently receive. \nThese benefits are an important supplement to low-income working \nfamilies. A prolonged change in their living situation could affect \ntheir eligibility for these benefits, such as the earned income credit \nand the child tax credit. This bill will allow displaced individuals to \nuse their 2004 income to calculate benefits on their 2005 tax return. \nIt will further ensure that these working families do not lose \ndeductions, credits or filing status because the family is displaced \nfrom their home.\n  We also allow victims of Katrina access to retirement accounts for \nimmediate cash assistance. Under current law, there is a 10 percent \npenalty for early distributions of money in these accounts. We waive \nthat penalty and allow displaced persons to recontribute to the \nretirement account over a 3-year period.\n  Victims also need tax relief if a commercial lender forgives their \ndebt. When a commercial lender discharges debt--such as a cancellation \nof a mortgage--this amount is included as income for tax purposes. This \nlegislation ensures that individuals affected by the hurricane are not \ntaxed on this personal debt relief.\n  Second, victims of Katrina want to get back in the workforce. We \nprovide businesses with the tools that they need to hire displaced \nworkers. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit allows employers to claim a \ncredit against wages paid to new workers that face barriers to \nemployment. It applies to veterans, low-income families, and other \ntargeted groups. We expand the Work Opportunity Tax Credit to cover all \nsurvivors of Hurricane Katrina who lived in the disaster zone no matter \nwhere they seek a job.\n  We also allow employers located in the disaster zone to take a $2,400 \ntax credit on wages paid to employees during the period the business \nwas shut down. These employees have tapped into their savings to help \nout their employees.\n  Third, we address the housing needs of people dislocated by the \nhurricane. Many folks across the country have opened up their hearts \nand opened up their homes. These generous individuals now face \nincreased living expenses--higher water, electric, and grocery bills. \nThis is a considerable burden. We help defray these costs.\n  We create a special tax deduction for individuals who provide rent-\nfree housing to dislocated persons for at least 60 days. The deduction \nis $500 for each dislocated person up to a maximum of $2,000.\n  Finally, the victims need the generosity of individuals and \nbusinesses across this country. There has been a surge in giving to \ncharitable organizations. We should encourage this activity. Our bill \nprovides incentives for corporations to increase gifts of cash, food, \nbooks, and other items sorely needed in the affected areas and \ncommunities.\n  We didn't get everything we wanted in this bill. I regret that my \nHouse colleagues did not accept our provision supporting ``pay \nprotection'' for military reservists and guards and I will continue to \nwork with my colleagues, Senators Landrieu and Kerry, to get this \nenacted. As passed by the Senate, employers in the disaster zone who \ncontinued to pay employees that were activated by the reserves or the \nNational Guard would also be entitled to the employee retention credit. \nOver a third of the Guard members in Mississippi and Louisiana are \ncurrently serving in Iraq, and in Alabama, all major Guard units who \nhave been activated for the disaster have already served in Iraq or are \nthere currently. Around 500 of the 3,700 Louisiana National Guard \nmembers serving in Iraq lost their homes or their families were \ndisplaced due to Hurricane Katrina. If their loyal employers, who \ndespite being hit by Hurricane Katrina, were continuing to help out \nthese military families, why shouldn't Congress at a minimum extend \nthis $2,400 employee retention credit? I am disappointed, but resolved \nto keep fighting on this matter.\n  In the coming weeks, I plan to work with my colleagues to draft a \nlong-term tax relief package. We will draft legislation that will help \nrebuild homes and businesses, pump money into local economies, and help \ndistressed working families.\n  I thank all Senators for allowing this emergency legislation to move \nforward today. Today, we have taken real steps, concrete steps, that \nwill make a difference in the lives of people who can use the help. \nThis is what we came here to government service to do. And I am glad \nthat we have been able to do it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, we are passing legislation which \nwill provide immediate tax relief to those directly affected by this \nincredible disaster. This tax relief will help put cash in the hands of \nvictims and encourage charitable giving. This legislation is needed, \nbut I am deeply disappointed that this legislation is missing an \nextremely important component--relief for military reservists.\n\n[[Page S10325]]\n\n  We have rightfully focused on rescuing, reuniting and rebuilding, but \nwe must also make sure to take care of our strained military families. \nThe first and best definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those \nwho wear our uniform. That means giving our troops the resources they \nneed to keep safe while they are keeping us safe. And it means \nsupporting our troops at home as well as abroad.\n  The Senate passed Hurricane Katrina tax relief legislation which \nlooked out for our military reservists. More than 40 percent of \nmilitary reservists and National Guard members suffer a pay cut when \nthey are called to defend our nation, including those serving in the \ngulf coast today. These citizens serve nobly. They are much more than \nweekend warriors. Currently, there are over 140,000 reservists called \nup for active duty in the war against terrorism and over ten thousand \nof these reservists and guardsman are from Louisiana, Alabama, and \nMississippi. Over 50,000 National Guard members have been called up to \nassist with Hurricane Katrina.\n  Many of these reservists are being hit with a double-whammy. After \nrecent service in Iraq or Afghanistan, they are coming home to an area \nthat has been devastated. The all-volunteer army depends on these \nreservists. They have been serving our country with distinction and \npride for many years, and should not be penalized financially for their \nhonorable service.\n  The Senate passed bill included an employee retention credit which \nprovides a 40 percent tax credit for wages paid up to $6,000 after \nAugust 28, 2005 and before December 31, 2005. This credit would help \nemployers in the gulf coast who pay employees that are not able to work \nbecause the business was either damaged or destroyed and pay reservists \nand guardsmen that worked for them right up to the time before they \nwere deployed.\n  Giving employers' incentives to pay reservist employees is the right \nthing to do. We have read about the Louisiana reservists who have come \nhome from Iraq and found that they have lost everything. According to \nthe Washington Post, nearly 550 of the Louisiana brigade's troops lost \nhomes or loved ones or were otherwise affected by Katrina. The brigade \nis coming to the end of its rotation in Baghdad. This is exactly why we \nmust provide a tax incentive that helps employers pay wages to these \nreservists. Businesses on the gulf coast want to do the right thing for \ntheir employees. But in the wake of this disaster, most just cannot \nafford it.\n  During negotiations between the House and the Senate on a final \nHurricane Katrina tax package, the employee retention credit was scaled \nback. Wages paid to reservists are no longer eligible for the credit. \nThis is the wrong message to be sending to our reservists who put their \nlives on the line defending our country.\n  Due to Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, \nthe military has placed greater training and participation demands on \nreservists, taking them away from their families and jobs. We should be \ndoing all we can to help these reservists, and this includes providing \ntax incentives to their employers who provide extended pay coverage.\n  Providing tax incentives to help employers in the gulf coast impacted \nby Hurricane Katrina was a step in the right direction in helping \nreservists. For the last couple of years, Senator Landrieu and I have \nworked on legislation to provide assistance to businesses that employ \nreservists who have been called up to active duty. That legislation \nwould provide tax credits to employers who pay reservists wages that \nare above their military pay and to help with the costs of hiring \nreplacement workers. This provision passed the Senate twice last year, \nunfortunately, it was not enacted into law.\n  This past Monday, I chaired a field hearing of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship entitled ``Military Reservists and Small \nBusiness: Supporting our Military Families and their Patriotic Small \nBusiness Employers.'' The hearing focused on the financial difficulties \nreservists who work for small businesses and their families face when \nthey are called up to active duty.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Sam Poulten told his compelling story. He was a \npartner in a real estate firm and he received a three-day notice that \nhe was being called-up to serve as a medical Army reservist in Iraq. \nLieutenant Colonel Poulten spent 13 months away from his business, \nwhich saw a loss in sales due to his absence. His wife had to resort to \nusing credit cards to pay for basic necessities. Lieutenant Colonel \nPoulten is one of the many examples of a reservist whose family and \nbusiness faced financial struggles due to long mobilization.\n  Captain Marshall Hanson, USNR (Ret), Legislative Director of the \nReserve Officers Association, discussed the consequences of \nmobilization and demobilization on military families and employers. He \nstated:\n\n       Families and employers play a large role in a citizen-\n     warrior's decision on whether or not to enlist and to remain \n     in the military. Employer pressure is cited as one of the top \n     reasons why reservists quit military service.\n\n  We left military reservists who were personally impacted by Katrina \nout of this tax bill and this is wrong. After Monday's field hearing, I \nam convinced more than ever that we need to provide tax credits to \nsmall employers who pay reservists above their military wages and to \nhelp with the cost of a temporary replacement employee.\n  I thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus for working with \nme to include wages paid to eligible reservists and guardsman as part \nof the employee retention tax credit. Unfortunately, we were not able \nto have this provision included in the final package.\n  I will continue to work on providing tax incentives for small \nbusiness employers who have military reservists as employees. We must \npass these tax incentives. If we do not make it easier for small \nbusinesses to employ military reservists, we will see a substantial \ndecline in our reserve forces. According to published reports, the Army \nNational Guard has missed its recruiting targets every month this year \nand appears certain to miss its third straight annual recruiting goal. \nOur military depends on these civilian-warriors. We need to recognize \nthat the needs of our reserve forces are different than the needs of \nthe career military. Our reservists did not sign-up for active duty, \nand they have been faced with long-term call ups and multiple call ups.\n  I do not understand why we cannot pass legislation which provides tax \nincentive to help employer's of civilian-warriors when we continue to \npass tax cuts that just benefit the wealthy.\n  We need to do all that we can to help our reservists and the \nbusinesses that employ them to ensure that our great tradition of \ncitizen soldiers does not fade or end because of the effect service can \nhave on work and family in this time of crisis.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent the Senate concur in the House \namendment to the Senate amendment and that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 246) to express the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the missions and performance of the United \n     States Coast Guard in responding to Hurricane Katrina.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 246) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 246\n\n       Whereas the United States Coast Guard has been charged by \n     Congress with missions central to protecting the lives and \n     well-being\n\n[[Page S10326]]\n\n     of individuals and communities in the United States, \n     including protecting homeland security, conducting search and \n     rescue of lives in danger, protecting marine environments \n     from pollution, maintaining maritime safety and aids to \n     navigation, enforcing Federal fishing laws, and intercepting \n     illegal drugs and migrants before they reach our shores;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard anticipated the potential for \n     significant loss of life and property as Hurricane Katrina \n     approached Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and made \n     landfall on August 29, 2005 and, in advance of the storm, \n     relocated its personnel, vessels, and aircraft out of harm's \n     way;\n       Whereas Hurricane Katrina made landfall as a Category 4 \n     hurricane with winds reaching 175 miles per hour and massive \n     storm surges, the combination of which left a trail of \n     devastation unprecedented on United States soil, as it \n     leveled countless homes, businesses, and other structures, \n     displaced millions of people from their communities, and \n     otherwise made coastal urban and rural areas unliveable;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard immediately deployed nearly 1,000 \n     personnel, including captains, crew, pilots, rescue swimmers, \n     pollution response teams, and other specialists and \n     reservists, from stations all over the country, to coastal \n     areas affected by the hurricane, for a total regional force \n     size of approximately 3,619 personnel;\n       Whereas Coast Guard personnel who had never personally \n     worked together before began to work as teams to conduct and \n     coordinate search and rescue operations while Hurricane \n     Katrina continued to bear down on the central Gulf of Mexico \n     shoreline;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard rescued or evacuated 33,544 \n     individuals as of September 21, 2005, a number that \n     represents eight times the number of lives saved by the Coast \n     Guard in an average year;\n       Whereas three Coast Guard pollution response Strike Teams \n     responded to 1,129 pollution incidents as of September 20, \n     2005, which include total discharges of more than 7 million \n     gallons of oil, unknown amounts of sewage, and unknown \n     quantities of other toxic chemicals, and the Coast Guard has \n     contained or otherwise closed 426 of these cases;\n       Whereas Coast Guard buoy tenders have responded to 964 \n     discrepancies in buoys and other aids to navigation and have \n     restored 39 of 48 critical aids to navigation as of September \n     21, 2005;\n       Whereas the costs of responding to Hurricane Katrina have \n     depleted the Coast Guard's operations and maintenance budget \n     for fiscal year 2005 and are rapidly depleting its budget for \n     fiscal year 2006, and the Coast Guard's costs associated with \n     this hurricane are anticipated to exceed $500 million;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard performed its hurricane response \n     missions largely with outdated legacy assets, increasing the \n     wear and tear on these assets while foregoing regularly \n     scheduled maintenance activities in the interest of \n     sustaining its surge in life-saving operations;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard already conducts its missions with \n     the 40th oldest fleet of the 42 nations with Coast Guard or \n     naval fleets;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard's program, known as Deepwater, for \n     modernizing its fleet of vessels and aircraft, is vital for \n     increasing the capabilities in performing its missions in the \n     face of ever-increasing natural and human threats;\n       Whereas the Deepwater program requires sustained Federal \n     funding commitments in order for the citizens of the United \n     States to realize the benefits of the Coast Guard having \n     state-of-the-art vessels, aircraft, technologies, and \n     interoperable communication equipment;\n       Whereas in addition to covering operation and maintenance \n     costs of a rapidly aging fleet, the Coast Guard needs to \n     rebuild several Coast Guard facilities in Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, and Alabama, including Station Gulfport which \n     was completely destroyed and where personnel are now working \n     in trailers amidst the ruins of that station;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard needs a strong Federal funding \n     commitment to ensure that all of its unexpected expenditures \n     during its response to Katrina are reimbursed;\n       Whereas more than 700 Coast Guard personnel stationed in \n     the Gulf region lost their homes and all personal property \n     and are now living on overcrowded Coast Guard vessels and in \n     makeshift shelters;\n       Whereas before, during, and after the landfall of Hurricane \n     Katrina, Coast Guard personnel exhibited determination and a \n     full commitment to their missions, and the Coast Guard has \n     proven to be one of the most resourceful and capable services \n     in the United States government;\n       Whereas before, during, and after the landfall of Hurricane \n     Katrina, Coast Guard personnel performed their missions with \n     the highest level of bravery and self-sacrifice, and their \n     effectiveness in performing their missions is unparalleled in \n     the United States government;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard has an operational and command \n     structure that allowed it to quickly take a leadership role \n     in saving lives, without waiting for instruction or \n     permission to act;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard's operational and command structure \n     continues to serve as a model for other agencies that need to \n     respond quickly to large-scale natural and man-made \n     disasters;\n       Whereas the Coast Guard's effective leadership in \n     responding to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and the \n     appointment of Vice Admiral Thad Allen as the primary Federal \n     officer in charge of this response, is helping to restore the \n     public's confidence in the Federal response effort: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate  That it is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States Coast Guard should receive Congress's \n     highest commendation for its tremendous and highly effective \n     response to the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina;\n       (2) the United States Congress should commit to providing \n     the Coast Guard with the resources it needs to modernize and \n     maintain its fleet of vessels and aircraft; and\n       (3) the Administration should ensure that the Coast Guard \n     receives sufficient funding to cover its unexpected \n     operational and capital costs associated with Hurricane \n     Katrina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n
