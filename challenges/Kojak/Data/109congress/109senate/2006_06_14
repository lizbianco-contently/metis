BYRD\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a minute or 2, if I can, to \njoin my other colleagues who over the last several days have paid \ntribute to our colleague from West Virginia, my seatmate, Senator \nRobert Byrd, who, on Monday, celebrated the unique landmark of serving \nlonger than any other person in the history of this remarkable \ninstitution.\n  I said to Senator Byrd, my colleague and seatmate, yesterday, his \nlongevity is impressive but his record as a U.S. Senator is really what \nexcels. While serving for 47 years in this institution is certainly \nremarkable, what he has done during those 47 years is what is truly \nremarkable. His contribution to the public discourse and debate of our \ncountry throughout that time has been truly exemplary.\n  I noted the other day, in fact, that when Senator Byrd was first \nelected to the House, there was a wonderful picture taken that appeared \nwith Senator Byrd and several other Members of newly minted Congressmen \nwho had been elected in 1952 at the White House with Dwight Eisenhower. \nIn that group of pictures was also a newly minted Congressman from \nConnecticut by the name of Thomas Dodd, my father.\n  Senator Byrd and my father were elected to the House together in \n1952, and came to this body together in 1958. So during these many \nyears of public service, Robert C. Byrd has had to serve with two Dodds \nin the U.S. Congress, my father and myself. I sit next to Senator Byrd \nby choice. I have been his seatmate for almost 15 or 16 years now, and \ndo so because I have enjoyed his company, his wisdom, and listening to \nhis contributions to the debate and his knowledge of the Senate and its \nprocedures.\n  I know we have a new group of pages who have arrived to serve in our \nNation's Capitol here in the U.S. Senate in the last few days. As \nsomeone who sat on the steps of the Democratic side back in the early \n1960s as a page, I say to the pages, I would strongly urge you to \nlisten to Robert C. Byrd. If you want to have truly a great lesson \nduring your tenure here as pages, then listen to the remarkable Senator \nfrom West Virginia, and you will learn more in the short period of time \nyou are here than almost anything else I could advise you to do, except \nto read his two-volume history of the U.S. Senate, which you may not \nhave time to do during your 2 of 3 weeks here as pages.\n  Senator Byrd, of course, has had significant accomplishments. And I \nthink\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\nof the time when I served as a page, an unpaid page, back many years \nago, and the giants of the Senate in those days; certainly people such \nas Lyndon Johnson, Mike Mansfield, Richard Russell, Everett Dirksen, \nMargaret Chase Smith, Hubert Humphrey, John Sherman Cooper, Stuart \nSymington--and so many others who served during those years who were \ntruly giants in many ways.\n  They were Senators in the very fullest sense of the word. They \nrepresented an institutional spirit that in many ways is lacking today, \nand I regret that deeply. But it was critical to the success of our \ndemocratic Republic how they related one to the other. It is a spirit \nof independence and understanding that all Senators are equal in this \nbody, regardless of the positions they hold in the institution. All 100 \nof us are equal Members representing our respective States and \nconstituencies. It is a spirit that allows us to debate--sometimes very \nvigorously--our differences, while still obliging us to seek common \nground for the common good of our country.\n  Robert Byrd certainly epitomizes that spirit--a vigorous debater but \nalso someone who recognizes it is vitally important to reach common \ngoals for the common good. It is a spirit that refuses to submit to the \nencroachments of any other institution or office in the land, including \nthat of the Executive.\n  I cannot count the times that Robert C. Byrd would correct someone \nwho said: I served under a President here. I served under seven \nPresidents. Robert Byrd will quickly tell you: You do not serve under \nany President. You serve with Presidents. You are a Member of a coequal \nbranch of the U.S. Government as embodied in the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  And how right he is. As Senators understand, Robert Byrd understands \nimplicitly that the Senate is a coequal, powerful branch of Government, \nthat our Founders wanted it to be of equal weight in the deliberations \nof our country.\n  I carry with me a copy of the U.S. Constitution. I have had this for \nmany, many years, and it was given to me by my seatmate, Robert C. \nByrd. It is getting rather worn, but his inscription inside is \nsomething I will cherish for the rest of my days and life--that I carry \na copy of the Constitution given to me by this person who cherishes and \nloves the Constitution as much as Robert C. Byrd does. One of the \nreasons I care so deeply about this particular copy is of course it was \ngiven to me by him and inscribed by him.\n  I think it is only fitting that someone who cares so much about that \ndocument and this institution is now the Senate's longest serving \nMember.\n  In his close to five decades of Senate service, Senator Byrd has had \nan enormous impact on his State and on our country. He, more than any \nother Member that I can think of in the last half century, has worked \nto preserve the delicate system of checks and balances conceived by the \nFounders of our great Republic. That work is typified by his opposition \nto the line-item veto and his insistence on preserving the prerogatives \nof this institution in relation to the other branches of Government.\n  But more than that, he has also helped to bring good jobs, better \nschools, and decent health care not only to the constituents of West \nVirginia but also to millions of people across this country because of \nhis leadership.\n  He has never forgotten the good, hard-working people who sent him \nhere from his beloved West Virginia or why they did so; that is, to \nmake our Nation a stronger, more prosperous, and more hopeful Nation \nfor all of its citizens.\n  Senator Byrd has had the courage and strength of character to admit \npast errors--something that too few of us do in this Chamber--and to \nseek genuine understanding for the good of our country.\n  In his history of the U.S. Senate, Senator Byrd has written that:\n\n       After 200 years, the Senate is still the anchor of the \n     Republic, is still the morning and evening star in the \n     American constitutional constellation.\n\n  More than any other U.S. Senator in this body, I believe Senator Byrd \nhas helped to ensure that this U.S. Senate retains that unique \ndistinction.\n  So I am pleased to join with my other colleagues in wishing him well. \nI know more than anything else he would have loved to have his beloved \nErma here with him in these days to celebrate this achievement. Of \ncourse, he lost Erma just a few months ago. But I am certain, as all of \nus are, that she is watching, with a great big smile, as she celebrates \nwith all of us the distinction that our colleague from West Virginia \nhas achieved this last Monday--47 years in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia, our friend Robert Byrd, has achieved yet another historic \nmilestone. He is now the longest-serving Senator in the history of the \nSenate. But what is most remarkable about Senator Byrd is not his \nlongevity, but his unique stature and accomplishment within this body.\n  Senator Byrd is renowned for his unmatched knowledge of the Senate's \nhistory. So he remembers very well that our former colleague, Philip \nHart of Michigan, was known as the ``conscience of the Senate.'' Well, \nI believe that history will remember the senior Senator from West \nVirginia as the soul of the Senate.\n  No individual in my memory has been a more tenacious champion of the \ntraditions, prerogatives, and rules of this body. No individual has had \ngreater reverence for the Constitution, and for the Founders' vision of \nan assertive, independent, co-equal legislative branch. As the Almanac \nof Americans says in its profile of Senator Byrd, and I quote, he ``may \ncome closer to the kind of Senator that the Founding Fathers had in \nmind than any other.'' By the way, if anyone here on the Senate floor \nneeds to look something up in the Constitution, we know where to turn; \nSenator Byrd always carries a copy in his left breast pocket, directly \nover his heart.\n  I have always had a special affinity for Senator Byrd, because we are \nboth the sons of coal miners, both raised in humble circumstances. \nReading about the Senator's early years, lifting himself out of poverty \nas a welder and meat cutter before running for the West Virginia \nLegislature in 1946, I am reminded of Thomas Edison's remark that \n``opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in \noveralls and looks like work.'' Well, Robert Byrd made his own \nopportunities with relentless work, self-education, and striving. And \nthat incredible work ethic continues right up to this day.\n  One product of that work ethic, and of Senator Byrd's always \nimpressive erudition, is his two-volume history of this body. It is \nrecognized as the definitive history of the Senate during its first 200 \nyears, and widely praised for its graceful writing. On this score, \nSenator Byrd has much in common with Winston Churchill. Both were \nprolific writers. And both were major players in the events that they \nchronicled.\n  On a personal note, let me just say that I have always valued Senator \nByrd's friendship, wisdom, and advice. And I will always appreciate the \nway he tutored me in the ways of the Senate when I first came to this \nbody in 1984.\n  So I join with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in saluting \nour friend. Senator Byrd is the longest-serving Member of this body. \nBut there are still many chapters yet to be written in the career of \nthis great Senator. As the late Senator Paul Wellstone used to say, \n``The future belongs to those with passion.'' By that standard, Senator \nByrd is very much a man of the future.\n  I say to my friend, it has been an honor to serve with him.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man who may \nbe the most important friend that the people of West Virginia have ever \nsent to Washington or ever will send to Washington. He is the senior \nSenator of West Virginia, and today he becomes America's senior \nSenator.\n  The Senate is housed in this beautiful Chamber of marble columns and \nintricate architecture. But the Senate is not a building; it is not a \nseal or a symbol or an idea. The Senate is a group of 100 men and women \nwho are chosen by the people to craft the laws that define and govern \nthe American People.\n  While the Senate is not a building, it does have individuals who \nserve as pillars upon which the rest of us place our\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\ntrust and reliance. Today, we salute one such pillar. The senior \nSenator from West Virginia enters the record books as the longest \nserving Senator.\n  Note, I say that he enters the record books, not the history books. I \nsay that because I expect the senior Senator from West Virginia to be \nmaking history on this floor for many years to come.\n  In an earlier time, we would have called Robert Byrd a renaissance \nman in the mold of such American luminaries as Jefferson or Franklin. \nConsider that he is a poet, an accomplished musician, an author, the \nforemost historian of this Chamber, a parliamentary expert, an \nintensely devout Christian, an unrivaled legislator, a scholar of our \nConstitution, and earned a J.D. while a Member of this Chamber.\n  Yet all of these accomplishments as an individual are dwarfed by what \nhe has done and will continue to do for the people of West Virginia. He \nhas brought mew industries like biotechnology, biometrics and other \nhigh tech, high skilled work to West Virginia. He has fought for dams, \nroadways, hospitals, and highways. It is hard to imagine that one man \nmight have such a transformative impact on a State. Yet friend and foe \nalike would concede this point to Robert Byrd.\n  I say today that Senator Byrd becomes America's senior Senator. In \nmany ways, he always has been. No man or woman more rigorously defends \nthe role of this Chamber in our governmental structure, and no man or \nwoman fights more ardently to preserve that beautiful document he \ncarries in his breast pocket--the U.S. Constitution. One of the first \nthings I did when I was sworn in as a Member of this body was to take \nthe whole Landrieu family to see Senator Byrd and have him give us a \ntalk on the Constitution and the role of the Senate.\n  For the last 6 years, it has been my pleasure to serve under Senator \nByrd's leadership on the Senate Appropriations Committee. In that \ncapacity, he has proven repeatedly that he is a friend to the people of \nLouisiana and understands the tragedy that has befallen them. I thank \nhim for that help and friendship.\n\n  Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that today is a \nbittersweet anniversary, for it is also Erma's birthday. A woman whose \nlife, and now memory, Senator Byrd so obviously cherished.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank America's senior Senator for his service \nto this country and for his friendship.\n  I conclude my remarks, as he so often does, with a verse of poetry--\none of the Senator's favorites--the final verse of ``The Building of \nthe Ship'' by Longfellow:\n\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O UNION, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n     'Tis of the wave and not the rock;\n     'Tis but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee,--are all with thee!\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 5 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I note my deep disappointment that the \nconference agreement for the emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nnow pending before the Senate does not include the supplemental funding \nfor VA health care that was included in the Senate-passed measure.\n  Despite the fact that the Senate spoke strongly on the need to ensure \nthat VA has enough resources during the balance of this fiscal year to \nbe able to treat our Nation's veterans in an effective and timely \nmanner, my amendment to add $430 million to the VA health care account \nwas not included in the final compromise.\n  Back in April and May, when we debated the supplemental \nappropriations measure here in the Senate, I was delighted that my \namendment, cosponsored by 21 of our colleagues, to secure a relatively \nmodest amount of emergency funding for VA health care was included in \nthe legislation. The reasons we gave then in support of this funding \nwere clear, and they remain so today.\n  First, Vet Centers and other mental health programs need to be given \nmore support if VA is to continue to be able to reach out to veterans \nin need of readjustment counseling or other psychological treatment, \nespecially those returning from service in a war zone.\n  Secondly, across the VA system, facilities need some additional \nfunding to ensure that VA is able to continue to provide quality of \ncare and availability of services for all veterans.\n  At the time of the Senate debate, after a slight modification to the \namendment so as to require the President to request the emergency \nfunding in order for VA to receive it, the Senate voted 84-13 to adopt \nthe amendment and include it as part of the supplemental package.\n  My colleagues indicated their overwhelming support of the measure \nthrough that vote. In light of that show of support, the failure to \ninclude this VA funding in the pending measure is all the more \nregrettable, all the more unacceptable.\n  Having just traveled to Iraq to see for myself what the situation is \nlike on the ground there, I am even more steadfast in my belief that VA \nmust have the resources it needs to care for returning servicemembers.\n  Programs to transition our men and women in uniform who require \nmental health, prosthetic rehabilitation, or other specialty health \ncare services back into civilian life are a clear, continuing part of \nthe overall cost of war. These services are more important than ever, \nand we must do our part to support them.\n  Although we did not succeed in keeping this additional funding in \nthis measure, we will not give up the fight and will do our utmost to \nensure that VA has the funding it needs.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5823-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5823-S5828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to talk about all of the interesting \nthings going on in Iraq. We saw yesterday the surprise, very important \nvisit by the President to the new Iraqi Cabinet under Premier Nouri \nKamal al-Maliki. This marks one more significant step in efforts to \nbring national unity to Iraq. We all must remember that just a few \nshort years ago, Iraq was ruled by a murderous tyrant, Saddam Hussein. \nAccording to the Iraqi Survey Group's Charles Dilfer, Iraq was a far \nmore dangerous place even than we knew. We may not have had the \nintelligence right, but the intelligence was focusing on the fact of \nhow dangerous this place was. Dilfer said that Iraq was overrun with \nterrorists, like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was then in al-Ansar Islam \nand later changed that to al-Qaida in Iraq, the butcher who brazenly \nbeheaded innocent Americans and others on television.\n  Dilfer said that Saddam Hussein had the ability to produce chemical \nand biological weapons that he had in the past and he was willing and \nable to sell them to terrorists who could deliver them to our country. \nThis milestone, unfortunately, received not enough attention or \nappreciation in the media. This is not an isolated example of people \ntrying to downplay good news in Iraq. As Peter Wehner wrote in the Wall \nStreet Journal on May 23:\n\n       Iraqis can participate in three historic elections, pass \n     the most liberal constitution in the Arab world, and form a \n     unit government despite terrorist attacks and provocations. \n     Yet, for some critics of the President, these are minor \n     matters.\n\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\n\n  We have seen time and again the focus of our media, and thus, what \nmany Americans hear is just the killings, the slaughter of innocents in \nbombings and suicide attacks. We read the tragic stories of the loss of \nAmericans. But the real story, when you talk to our troops on the \nground, is how much good they have been doing. They have been \ncompleting their mission. They have been pacifying large areas of the \ncountry. Schools and hospitals are being built. Women are enjoying \nnewfound freedom. Yet for television, if it bleeds, it leads. That is \nthe only stuff we hear about.\n  We are told of massacres and chaos, but we aren't told that millions \nof Iraqis who fled to other countries as refugees by the millions in \npast years under Saddam Hussein are returning; 1.2 million refugees \nhave returned to their homes. We rarely see positive stories about \nseminaries which, under Saddam, held only a few dozen students and now \nhave 15,000 pupils from 40 different countries. We don't read about the \nincrease in the value of the Iraqi dinar, the record number of media \noutlets, the tremendous growth in small businesses forming the economic \nfoundation for Iraq, and the revival of Iraqi agriculture. These \nstories were told very well by a well-known Iranian journalist, Amir \nTaheri, who published an article in Commentary magazine available on \ntheir Web site talking about how Iraq has improved--a man who has \nwatched Iraq for 40 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             The Real Iraq\n\n                            (by Amir Taheri)\n\n       Spending time in the United States after a tour of Iraq can \n     be a disorienting experience these days. Within hours of \n     arriving here, as I can attest from a recent visit, one is \n     confronted with an image of Iraq that is unrecognizable. It \n     is created in several overlapping ways: through television \n     footage showing the charred remains of vehicles used in \n     suicide attacks, surrounded by wailing women in black and \n     grim-looking men carrying coffins; by armchair strategists \n     and political gurus predicting further doom or pontificating \n     about how the war should have been fought in the first place; \n     by authors of instant-history books making their rounds to \n     dissect the various fundamental mistakes committed by the \n     Bush administration; and by reporters, cocooned in hotels in \n     Baghdad, explaining the carnage and chaos in the streets as \n     signs of the country's impending or undeclared civil war. Add \n     to all this the day's alleged scandal or revelation--an outed \n     CIA operative, a reportedly doctored intelligence report, a \n     leaked pessimistic assessment and it is no wonder the \n     American public registers disillusion with Iraq and everyone \n     who embroiled the U.S. in its troubles.\n       It would be hard indeed for the average interested citizen \n     to find out on his own just how grossly this image distorts \n     the realities of present-day Iraq. Part of the problem, faced \n     by even the most well-meaning news organizations, is the \n     difficulty of covering so large and complex a subject; \n     naturally, in such circumstances, sensational items rise to \n     the top. But even ostensibly more objective efforts, like the \n     Brookings Institution's much-cited Iraq Index with its \n     constantly updated array of security, economic, and public-\n     opinion indicators, tell us little about the actual feel of \n     the country on the ground.\n       To make matters worse, many of the newsmen, pundits, and \n     commentators on whom American viewers and readers rely to \n     describe the situation have been contaminated by the \n     increasing bitterness of American politics. Clearly there are \n     those in the media and the think tanks who wish the Iraq \n     enterprise to end in tragedy, as a just comeuppance for \n     George W. Bush. Others, prompted by noble sentiment, so abhor \n     the idea of war that they would banish it from human \n     discourse before admitting that, in some circumstances, \n     military power can be used in support of a good cause. But \n     whatever the reason, the half-truths and outright \n     misinformation that now function as conventional wisdom have \n     gravely disserved the American people.\n       For someone like myself who has spent considerable time in \n     Iraq--a country I first visited in 1968--current reality \n     there is, nevertheless, very different from this conventional \n     wisdom, and so are the prospects for Iraq's future. It helps \n     to know where to look, what sources to trust, and how to \n     evaluate the present moment against the background of Iraqi \n     and Middle Eastern history.\n       Since my first encounter with Iraq almost 40 years ago, I \n     have relied on several broad measures of social and economic \n     health to assess the country's condition. Through good times \n     and bad, these signs have proved remarkably accurate--as \n     accurate, that is, as is possible in human affairs. For some \n     time now, all have been pointing in an unequivocally positive \n     direction.\n       The first sign is refugees. When things have been truly \n     desperate in Iraq--in 1959, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1980, 1988, and \n     1990--long queues of Iraqis have formed at the Turkish and \n     Iranian frontiers, hoping to escape. In 1973, for example, \n     when Saddam Hussein decided to expel all those whose \n     ancestors had not been Ottoman citizens before Iraq's \n     creation as a state, some 1.2 million Iraqis left their homes \n     in the space of just six weeks. This was not the temporary \n     exile of a small group of middle-class professionals and \n     intellectuals, which is a common enough phenomenon in most \n     Arab countries. Rather, it was a departure en masse, \n     affecting people both in small villages and in big cities, \n     and it was a scene regularly repeated under Saddam Hussein.\n       Since the toppling of Saddam in 2003, this is one highly \n     damaging image we have not seen on our television sets--and \n     we can be sure that we would be seeing it if it were there to \n     be shown. To the contrary, Iraqis, far from fleeing, have \n     been returning home. By the end of 2005, in the most \n     conservative estimate, the number of returnees topped the \n     1.2-million mark. Many of the camps set up for fleeing Iraqis \n     in Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia since 1959 have now closed \n     down. The oldest such center, at Ashrafiayh in southwest \n     Iran, was formally shut when its last Iraqi guests returned \n     home in 2004.\n       A second dependable sign likewise concerns human movement, \n     but of a different kind. This is the flow of religious \n     pilgrims to the Shiite shrines in Karbala and Najaf. Whenever \n     things start to go badly in Iraq, this stream is reduced to a \n     trickle and then it dries up completely. From 1991 (when \n     Saddam Hussein massacred Shiites involved in a revolt against \n     him) to 2003, there were scarcely any pilgrims to these \n     cities. Since Saddam's fall, they have been flooded with \n     visitors. In 2005, the holy sites received an estimated 12 \n     million pilgrims, making them the most visited spots in the \n     entire Muslim world, ahead of both Mecca and Medina.\n       Over 3,000 Iraqi clerics have also returned from exile, and \n     Shiite seminaries, which just a few years ago held no more \n     than a few dozen pupils, now boast over 15,000 from 40 \n     different countries. This is because Najaf, the oldest center \n     of Shiite scholarship, is once again able to offer an \n     alternative to Qom, the Iranian holy city where a radical and \n     highly politicized version of Shiism is taught. Those wishing \n     to pursue the study of more traditional and quietist forms of \n     Shiism now go to Iraq where, unlike in Iran, the seminaries \n     are not controlled by the government and its secret police.\n       A third sign, this one of the hard economic variety, is the \n     value of the Iraqi dinar, especially as compared with the \n     region's other major currencies. In the final years of Saddam \n     Hussein's rule, the Iraqi dinar was in free fall; after 1995, \n     it was no longer even traded in Iran and Kuwait. By contrast, \n     the new dinar, introduced early in 2004, is doing well \n     against both the Kuwaiti dinar and the Iranian rial, having \n     risen by 17 percent against the former and by 23 percent \n     against the latter. Although it is still impossible to fix \n     its value against a basket of international currencies, the \n     new Iraqi dinar has done well against the U.S. dollar, \n     increasing in value by almost 18 percent between August 2004 \n     and August 2005. The overwhelming majority of Iraqis, and \n     millions of Iranians and Kuwaitis, now treat it as a safe and \n     solid medium of exchange.\n       My fourth time-tested sign is the level of activity by \n     small and medium-sized businesses. In the past, whenever \n     things have gone downhill in Iraq, large numbers of such \n     enterprises have simply closed down, with the country's most \n     capable entrepreneurs decamping to Jordan, Syria, Saudi \n     Arabia, the Persian Gulf states, Turkey, Iran, and even \n     Europe and North America. Since liberation, however, Iraq has \n     witnessed a private-sector boom, especially among small and \n     medium-sized businesses.\n       According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the \n     World Bank, as well as numerous private studies, the Iraqi \n     economy has been doing better than any other in the region. \n     The country's gross domestic product rose to almost $90 \n     billion in 2004 (the latest year for which figures are \n     available), more than double the output for 2003, and its \n     real growth rate, as estimated by the IMF, was 52.3 per cent. \n     In that same period, exports increased by more than $3 \n     billion, while the inflation rate fell to 25.4 percent, down \n     from 70 percent in 2002. The unemployment rate was halved, \n     from 60 percent to 30 percent.\n       Related to this is the level of agricultural activity. \n     Between 1991 and 2003, the country's farm sector experienced \n     unprecedented decline, in the end leaving almost the entire \n     nation dependent on rations distributed by the United Nations \n     under Oil-for-Food. In the past two years, by contrast, Iraqi \n     agriculture has undergone an equally unprecedented revival. \n     Iraq now exports foodstuffs to neighboring countries, \n     something that has not happened since the 1950s. Much of the \n     upturn is due to smallholders who, shaking off the \n     collectivist system imposed by the Baathists, have retaken \n     control of land that was confiscated decades ago by the \n     state.\n       Finally, one of the surest indices of the health of Iraqi \n     society has always been its readiness to talk to the outside \n     world. Iraqis are a verbalizing people; when they fall \n     silent, life is incontrovertibly becoming hard for them. \n     There have been times, indeed, when one could find scarcely a \n     single Iraqi, whether in Iraq or abroad, prepared to express \n     an opinion on anything remotely political. This is what Kanan \n     Makiya meant when he described Saddam Husseins regime as a \n     republic of fear.\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\n       Today, again by way of dramatic contrast, Iraqis are \n     voluble to a fault. Talk radio, television talk-shows, and \n     Internet blogs are all the rage, while heated debate is the \n     order of the day in shops, tea-houses, bazaars, mosques, \n     offices, and private homes. A catharsis is how Luay \n     Abdulilah, the Iraqi short-story writer and diarist, \n     describes it. This is one way of taking revenge against \n     decades of deadly silence. Moreover, a vast network of \n     independent media has emerged in Iraq, including over 100 \n     privately owned newspapers and magazines and more than two \n     dozen radio and television stations. To anyone familiar with \n     the state of the media in the Arab world, it is a truism that \n     Iraq today is the place where freedom of expression is most \n     effectively exercised.\n       That an experienced observer of Iraq with a sense of \n     history can point to so many positive factors in the \n     country's present condition will not do much, of course, to \n     sway the more determined critics of the U.S. intervention \n     there. They might even agree that the images fed to the \n     American public show only part of the picture, and that the \n     news from Iraq is not uniformly bad. But the root of their \n     opposition runs deeper, to political fundamentals.\n       Their critique can be summarized in the aphorism that \n     democracy cannot be imposed by force. It is a view that can \n     be found among the more sophisticated elements on the Left \n     and, increasingly, among dissenters on the Right, from \n     Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to the ex-neoconservative \n     Francis Fukuyama. As Senator Hagel puts it, You cannot in my \n     opinion just impose a democratic form of government on a \n     country with no history and no culture and no tradition of \n     democracy.\n       I would tend to agree. But is Iraq such a place? In point \n     of fact, before the 1958 pro-Soviet military coup detat that \n     established a leftist dictatorship, Iraq did have its modest \n     but nevertheless significant share of democratic history, \n     culture, and tradition. The country came into being through a \n     popular referendum held in 1921. A constitutional monarchy \n     modeled on the United Kingdom, it had a bicameral parliament, \n     several political parties (including the Baath and the \n     Communists), and periodic elections that led to changes of \n     policy and government. At the time, Iraq also enjoyed the \n     freest press in the Arab world, plus the widest space for \n     debate and dissent in the Muslim Middle East.\n       To be sure, Baghdad in those days was no Westminster, and, \n     as the 1958 coup proved, Iraqi democracy was fragile. But \n     every serious student of contemporary Iraq knows that \n     substantial segments of the population, from all ethnic and \n     religious communities, had more than a taste of the modern \n     worlds democratic aspirations. As evidence, one need only \n     consult the immense literary and artistic production of \n     Iraqis both before and after the 1958 coup. Under successor \n     dictatorial regimes, it is true, the conviction took hold \n     that democratic principles had no future in Iraq--a \n     conviction that was responsible in large part for driving \n     almost five million Iraqis, a quarter of the population, into \n     exile between 1958 and 2003, just as the opposite conviction \n     is attracting so many of them and their children back to Iraq \n     today.\n       A related argument used to condemn Iraq's democratic \n     prospects is that it is an artificial country, one that can \n     be held together only by a dictator. But did any nation-state \n     fall from the heavens wholly made? All are to some extent \n     artificial creations, and the U.S. is preeminently so. The \n     truth is that Iraq--one of the 53 founding countries of the \n     United Nations--is older than a majority of that \n     organizations current 198 member states. Within the Arab \n     League, and setting aside Oman and Yemen, none of the 22 \n     members is older. Two-thirds of the 122 countries regarded as \n     democracies by Freedom House came into being after Iraq's \n     appearance on the map.\n       Critics of the democratic project in Iraq also claim that, \n     because it is a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional state, \n     the country is doomed to despotism, civil war, or \n     disintegration. But the same could be said of virtually all \n     Middle Eastern states, most of which are neither multi-ethnic \n     nor multi-confessional. More important, all Iraqis, \n     regardless of their ethnic, linguistic, and sectarian \n     differences, share a sense of national identity--uruqa \n     (Iraqi-ness)--that has developed over the past eight decades. \n     A unified, federal state may still come to grief in Iraq--\n     history is not written in advance--but even should a divorce \n     become inevitable at some point, a democratic Iraq would be \n     in a better position to manage it.\n       What all of this demonstrates is that, contrary to received \n     opinion, Operation Iraqi Freedom was not an attempt to impose \n     democracy by force. Rather, it was an effort to use force to \n     remove impediments to democratization, primarily by deposing \n     a tyrant who had utterly suppressed a well-established \n     aspect of the country's identity. It may take years before \n     we know for certain whether or not post-liberation Iraq \n     has definitely chosen democracy. But one thing is certain: \n     without the use of force to remove the Baathist regime, \n     the people of Iraq would not have had the opportunity even \n     to contemplate a democratic future.\n       Assessing the progress of that democratic project is no \n     simple matter. But, by any reasonable standard, Iraqis have \n     made extraordinary strides. In a series of municipal polls \n     and two general elections in the past three years, up to 70 \n     percent of eligible Iraqis have voted. This new orientation \n     is supported by more than 60 political parties and \n     organizations, the first genuinely free-trade unions in the \n     Arab world, a growing number of professional associations \n     acting independently of the state, and more than 400 \n     nongovernmental organizations representing diverse segments \n     of civil society. A new constitution, written by Iraqis \n     representing the full spectrum of political, ethnic, and \n     religious sensibilities was overwhelmingly approved by the \n     electorate in a referendum last October.\n       Iraq's new democratic reality is also reflected in the \n     vocabulary of politics used at every level of society. Many \n     new words--accountability, transparency, pluralism, dissent--\n     have entered political discourse in Iraq for the first time. \n     More remarkably, perhaps, all parties and personalities \n     currently engaged in the democratic process have committed \n     themselves to the principle that power should be sought, won, \n     and lost only through free and fair elections.\n       These democratic achievements are especially impressive \n     when set side by side with the declared aims of the enemies \n     of the new Iraq, who have put up a determined fight against \n     it. Since the country's liberation, the jihadists and \n     residual Baathists have killed an estimated 23,000 Iraqis, \n     mostly civilians, in scores of random attacks and suicide \n     operations. Indirectly, they have caused the death of \n     thousands more, by sabotaging water and electricity services \n     and by provoking sectarian revenge attacks.\n       But they have failed to translate their talent for mayhem \n     and murder into political success. Their campaign has not \n     succeeded in appreciably slowing down, let alone stopping, \n     the country's democratization. Indeed, at each step along the \n     way, the jihadists and Baathists have seen their self-\n     declared objectives thwarted.\n       After the invasion, they tried at first to prevent the \n     formation of a Governing Council, the expression of Iraq's \n     continued existence as a sovereign nation-state. They managed \n     to murder several members of the council, including its \n     president in 2003, but failed to prevent its formation or to \n     keep it from performing its task in the interim period. The \n     next aim of the insurgents was to stop municipal elections. \n     Their message was simple: candidates and voters would be \n     killed. But, once again, they failed: thousands of men and \n     women came forward as candidates and more than 1.5 million \n     Iraqis voted in the localities where elections were held.\n       The insurgency made similar threats in the lead-up to the \n     first general election, and the result was the same. Despite \n     killing 36 candidates and 148 voters, they failed to derail \n     the balloting, in which the number of voters rose to more \n     than 8 million. Nor could the insurgency prevent the writing \n     of the new democratic constitution, despite a campaign of \n     assassination against its drafters. The text was ready in \n     time and was submitted to and approved by a referendum, \n     exactly as planned. The number of voters rose yet again, \n     to more than 9 million.\n       What of relations among the Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds the \n     focus of so much attention of late? For almost three years, \n     the insurgency worked hard to keep the Arab Sunni community, \n     which accounts for some 15 percent of the population, out of \n     the political process. But that campaign collapsed when \n     millions of Sunnis turned out to vote in the constitutional \n     referendum and in the second general election, which saw \n     almost 11 million Iraqis go to the polls. As I write, all \n     political parties representing the Arab Sunni minority have \n     joined the political process and have strong representation \n     in the new parliament. With the convening of that parliament, \n     and the nomination in April of a new prime minister and a \n     three-man presidential council, the way is open for the \n     formation of a broad-based government of national unity to \n     lead Iraq over the next four years.\n       As for the insurgency's effort to foment sectarian violence \n     strategy first launched in earnest toward the end of 2005 \n     this too has run aground. The hope here was to provoke a \n     full-scale war between the Arab Sunni minority and the Arab \n     Shiites who account for some 60 percent of the population. \n     The new strategy, like the ones previously tried, has \n     certainly produced many deaths. But despite countless cases \n     of sectarian killings by so-called militias, there is still \n     no sign that the Shiites as a whole will acquiesce in the \n     role assigned them by the insurgency and organize a concerted \n     campaign of nationwide retaliation.\n       Finally, despite the impression created by relentlessly \n     dire reporting in the West, the insurgency has proved unable \n     to shut down essential government services. Hundreds of \n     teachers and schoolchildren have been killed in incidents \n     including the beheading of two teachers in their classrooms \n     this April and horrific suicide attacks against school buses. \n     But by September 2004, most schools across Iraq and virtually \n     all universities were open and functioning. By September \n     2005, more than 8.5 million Iraqi children and young people \n     were attending school or university, an all-time record in \n     the nation's history.\n       A similar story applies to Iraq's clinics and hospitals. \n     Between October 2003 and January 2006, more than 80 medical \n     doctors and over 400 nurses and medical auxiliaries were \n     murdered by the insurgents. The jihadists also raided several \n     hospitals, killing ordinary patients in their beds. But, once \n     again, they failed in their objectives. By January 2006, all \n     of Iraq's 600 state-owned hospitals and clinics were in full \n     operation, along with dozens of new ones set up by the \n     private sector since liberation.\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\n       Another of the insurgency's strategic goals was to bring \n     the Iraqi oil industry to a halt and to disrupt the export of \n     crude. Since July 2003, Iraq's oil infrastructure has been \n     the target of more than 3,000 attacks and attempts at \n     sabotage. But once more the insurgency has failed to achieve \n     its goals. Iraq has resumed its membership in the \n     Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and has \n     returned to world markets as a major oil exporter. According \n     to projections, by the end of 2006 it will be producing its \n     full OPEC quota of 2.8 million barrels a day.\n       The Baathist remnant and its jihadist allies resemble a \n     gambler who wins a heap of chips at a roulette table only to \n     discover that he cannot exchange them for real money at the \n     front desk. The enemies of the new Iraq have succeeded in \n     ruining the lives of tens of thousands of Iraqis, but over \n     the past three years they have advanced their overarching \n     goals, such as they are, very little. Instead they have \n     been militarily contained and politically defeated again \n     and again, the beneficiary has been Iraqi democracy.\n       None of this means that the new Iraq is out of the woods. \n     Far from it. Democratic success still requires a great deal \n     of patience, determination, and luck. The U.S.-led coalition, \n     its allies, and partners have achieved most of their major \n     political objectives, but that achievement remains under \n     threat and could be endangered if the U.S., for whatever \n     reason, should decide to snatch a defeat from the jaws of \n     victory.\n       The current mandate of the U.S.-led coalition runs out at \n     the end of this year, and it is unlikely that Washington and \n     its allies will want to maintain their military presence at \n     current levels. In the past few months, more than half of the \n     103 bases used by the coalition have been transferred to the \n     new Iraqi army. The best guess is that the number of U.S. and \n     coalition troops could be cut from 140,000 to 25,000 or \n     30,000 by the end of 2007.\n       One might wonder why, if the military mission has been so \n     successful, the U.S. still needs to maintain a military \n     presence in Iraq for at least another two years. There are \n     three reasons for this.\n       The first is to discourage Iraqs predatory neighbors, \n     notably Iran and Syria, which might wish to pursue their own \n     agendas against the new government in Baghdad. Iran has \n     already revived some claims under the Treaties of Erzerum \n     (1846), according to which Tehran would enjoy a droit de \n     regard over Shiite shrines in Iraq. In Syria, some in that \n     countrys ruling circles have invoked the possibility of \n     annexing the area known as Jazirah, the so-called Sunni \n     triangle, in the name of Arab unity. For its part, Turkey is \n     making noises about the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), which gave \n     it a claim to the oilfields of northern Iraq. All of these \n     pretensions need to be rebuffed.\n       The second reason for extending Americas military presence \n     is political. The U.S. is acting as an arbiter among Iraqs \n     various ethnic and religious communities and political \n     factions. It is, in a sense, a traffic cop, giving Iraqis a \n     green or red light when and if needed. It is important that \n     the U.S. continue performing this role for the first year or \n     two of the newly elected parliament and government.\n       Finally, the U.S. and its allies have a key role to play in \n     training and testing Iraqs new army and police. Impressive \n     success has already been achieved in that field. \n     Nevertheless, the new Iraqi army needs at least another year \n     or two before it will have developed adequate logistical \n     capacities and learned to organize and conduct operations \n     involving its various branches.\n       But will the U.S. stay the course? Many are betting against \n     it. The Baathists and jihadists, their prior efforts to \n     derail Iraqi democracy having come to naught, have now pinned \n     their hopes on creating enough chaos and death to persuade \n     Washington of the futility of its endeavors. In this, they \n     have the tacit support not only of local Arab and Muslim \n     despots rightly fearful of the democratic genie but of all \n     those in the West whose own incessant theme has been the \n     certainty of American failure. Among Bush-haters in the U.S., \n     just as among anti-Americans around the world, predictions \n     of civil war in Iraq, of spreading regional hostilities, \n     and of a revived global terrorism are not about to cease \n     any time soon.\n       But more sober observers should understand the real balance \n     sheet in Iraq. Democracy is succeeding. Moreover, thanks to \n     its success in Iraq, there are stirrings elsewhere in the \n     region. Beyond the much-publicized electoral concessions \n     wrung from authoritarian rulers in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, \n     there is a new democratic discourse to be heard. Nationalism \n     and pan-Arabism, yesterday's hollow rallying cries, have \n     given way to a big idea of a very different kind. Debate and \n     dissent are in the air where there was none before a \n     development owing, in significant measure, to the U.S. \n     campaign in Iraq and the brilliant if still checkered Iraqi \n     response.\n       The stakes, in short, could not be higher. This is all the \n     more reason to celebrate, to build on, and to consolidate \n     what has already been accomplished. Instead of railing \n     against the Bush administration, America's elites would do \n     better, and incidentally display greater self-respect, to \n     direct their wrath where it properly belongs; at those \n     violent and unrestrained enemies of democracy in Iraq who \n     are, in truth, the enemies of democracy in America as well, \n     and of everything America has ever stood for.\n       Is Iraq a quagmire, a disaster, a failure? Certainly not; \n     none of the above. Of all the adjectives used by skeptics and \n     critics to describe today's Iraq, the only one that has a \n     ring of truth is messy. Yes, the situation in Iraq today is \n     messy. Births always are. Since when is that a reason to \n     declare a baby unworthy of life?\n\n  Mr. BOND. This follows closely the story we found when on a codel \nwith my colleagues, Senators Bayh and Obama, in Iraq in January. We \ntalked to our people, military and civilians. We had a great meeting \nwith President Talabani and top-elected Sunni and Shi'a officials at \nthe time who all pledged they were going to work together for a unity \ngovernment.\n  Now that the President and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have formed \na Cabinet, this is one more significant step. It is a big step, and it \nhas been completely overshadowed by the killing of al-Zarqawi. But for \nthe long term, this formation of a government is one more step that is \nvitally important. I am delighted the President was there to highlight \nit.\n  It doesn't mean the violence is over. The killing of al-Zarqawi was \nwidely celebrated by our troops abroad and at home because they knew \nthis ruthless butcher was the face, the media darling of al-Qaida in \nIraq. There is a supreme irony that he went out with his spiritual \nadviser. Good time to have your spiritual adviser with you. For al-\nZarqawi, he and his spiritual adviser are going to find out at the same \ntime just how good the spiritual advice Sheik Rahman gave him was.\n  We know his loss will be a significant loss because of his ability to \nplay the media with his ruthless killings. But we know he will be \nreplaced. They are bringing up another successor to him already. Let us \nhope that successor has the same short shelf life that al-Qaida's \noperation commanders, such as Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, Abu Faraj al-\nLibi, and Hamza Rabia, have had. They have all been captured or killed. \nWe hope we will be able to continue that effort.\n  We hear some of our colleagues from the other side saying what a few \nin the media are saying, that we need to bring our troops home \nimmediately. We have sorrowful parents who are very much concerned \nabout their children going into harm's way. They want them brought home \nimmediately. Let me speak to that directly. As a father of a son who \nwas in Iraq and is preparing to go back, I can tell you that it is not \nwithout a good bit of concern that we see our young people going into \nharm's way. But we are very proud of them. We are very proud of them to \nknow that they are willing to stand up and take the risk of going to \nwar to defend our freedom and peace and security in the world. They are \ndoing a good job. Yes each death of an American soldier or marine or \nairman is a tragedy. As a parent, you suck in a little wind and say a \nprayer when you hear about them. But these brave young men and women \nwho are volunteers go there because they know they have a higher \nmission. By carrying the fight to the terrorists, they help make our \ncountry safer.\n  It is no accident that our country has not had a major attack since \nSeptember 11, not only because of homeland security but because of the \nstrong efforts we have taken in Afghanistan and Iraq to disrupt \nterrorist strongholds, the safe havens for terrorists.\n  Our young men and women over there are in harm's way. But they are \nnot afraid of taking the risk of war. Let me tell you what they really \nfear. They fear that a lack of political will in this body and in the \nUnited States will cause a premature withdrawal of our troops before \nthe Iraqi Government has adequate military and police in place to \nprovide the security that country needs to continue to grow and \nflourish and be safe from terrorism. They worry that if we bring our \ntroops back before the Iraqi military and police are able to secure the \ncountry, there will be chaos--chaos which fosters the rejuvenation of \nterrorist groups, chaos which will permit a form of state-sponsored \nterrorism, preparation of chemical and biological weapons that could be \nused against us, so the next 9/11 might be with a weapon of mass \ndestruction. They know there is a danger that violence between the \nfactions, the Shi'a and the Sunnis, could engulf Iraq and maybe the \nrest of the Middle East.\n  They want to complete their mission. They didn't go there and take \nthe risk and make the sacrifice and see some of\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\ntheir colleagues lose their lives and have to take inventories of their \npersonal belongings and send them home. Yet they fear the lack of \npolitical will to continue and succeed in the necessary battle more \nthan they fear the dangers of the battlefield. If we walk away, the \nsacrifices of these brave men and women will have been in vain. We have \nto complete the transformation and the transition in Iraq to a \nfunctioning government of national unity, able to defend the country \nagainst terrorists and insurgents.\n  I hear some of my colleagues talking about how tragic the activities \nwere in Haditha. They have seized on reports of horrible incidents. \nThey are presuming the American soldiers are guilty without having a \nhearing. They want to set up a 9/11-type commission. What a tragedy it \nwould be if we were to follow the political game plan to make guilty \nparties out of soldiers who have not even had their day in court in \norder to win political points against the Department of Defense and the \nPresident.\n  As we all well know, these events will be thoroughly investigated. If \nthere was wrongdoing, it will be prosecuted. We prosecuted the out-of-\nline soldiers who were at Abu Ghraib. We don't tolerate those things. \nWe don't tolerate misconduct. Our military justice system will \nprosecute any who are guilty. But please, let us not jump to the \nconclusion that they are presumed guilty because of reports of \noutrageous actions. There are other sides to the story. Let the normal \nprocess work. There could be hearings in the appropriate committees, \nthe Armed Services Committee or the Appropriations Committee, if they \nare warranted. But to set up another commission now is a dangerous \npolitical game and one I hope we will not accept. Instead of demanding \nmore commissions, we should be demanding that the facts come out. If \nany wrongdoing took place, those who did it will be punished \naccordingly.\n  There are those who want to continue to take cheap shots at the \nadministration over anything that goes wrong in the war. When you have \nwars, unfortunately, things go wrong. There is no guaranteed success \nrate. It is not an unbroken path of success. We need to look at what \nwent on in Haditha. The negative news reports will continue, and we \nexpect the news media, when there are negative things, to report on \nthem. But we would hope they would also report on the positive things \nthat are done. If we had followed the advice of all the naysayers \nearlier this year who dominate our television with their defeatist \npolitical rhetoric, we would not have seen free elections in Iraq, a \nunity government, or the elimination of al-Zarqawi. He would be running \nfree, plotting his next attack and seeking to reach out beyond Iraq to \nneighbors, possibly in the United States. Thankfully, we did not pull \nout of Iraq. Iraq is a much different place, a much more hopeful place \nbecause America and its brave men and women are committed to making the \nworld a safer place.\n  I sincerely and deeply urge my colleagues not to let our troops down, \nnot to bring them home because parents are concerned about them. We \nvalue and honor their service. Let them do their jobs and let the \nprocess of the military justice system go forward before we jump to the \nconclusion that American soldiers are guilty because we don't happen to \nagree with the war or the efforts they are making.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed for no more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, like my colleague from Missouri, I come \ntoday to address the Senate and my fellow countrymen on the \ndevelopments in Iraq and to speak to the American public about the war \nand our efforts in the Middle East.\n  Before I begin, let me quickly state that, like many Americans across \nthe country, I have and will maintain steadfast and strong support for \nour men and women in uniform. Also, like many Americans across the \ncountry, I, too, over the last good many months have had moments of \ndoubt regarding the progress in Iraq and the overwhelming challenges \nthat the Iraqis and Americans and coalition forces have faced there. \nWhen I go out to Walter Reed Hospital to visit with our young men and \nwomen who are having new parts put on their bodies as a result of the \nexplosions and bombings in Iraq, and I feel their spirit and desire to \ncontinue to serve and I speak to them of the mission they were involved \nin, I come back to my office on Capitol Hill more dedicated than ever \nto assure that these young men and women are allowed to continue to \nwork to finish their mission.\n  However, seeing through the fog of war, seeing through the \ninterpretation by the liberal media is a frustration that most \nAmericans are consumed with at this moment. Only the bad is reported \nand rarely the good. But the other day something good happened that \ncould not be denied by the media of this world. That was the \nannihilation of Zarqawi and the unquestionable proof that intelligence \nand informants have the al-Qaida on the run in Iraq. The liberal media \ncould not step away from the reality of that message. Two 500-pound \nbombs delivered it loudly around the world. While it says a lot about \nour own intelligence, it is my opinion and I am told it says a great \ndeal about the Iraqi people who are fed up with the way they are being \ntreated by the insurgent forces in Iraq, and many of those forces are \nfrom outside their country.\n  Some in this country, and even some in this body, are saying: Well, \nthat was just then, and we have to deal with now and into the immediate \nfuture. Let's get out of there, let's cut and run. It is time we bring \nour soldiers home.\n  I suggest that it may be time to adjust tactics. They have a new \ngovernment in Iraq. It is now whole, it is stood up, it is running, and \nit is putting its own people out in front in defense of its country, \nboth in the military and in the civilian police. Now is not the time to \nleave this fledgling new country standing alone. Our tactics may change \nand we may step back a bit, but I believe we have to be there to \ncontinue to strengthen and allow them to grow. The message of turning \naway from the recent successes and turning away from Iraqi men and \nwomen and children who are on the verge of freedom for the first time \nsends a phenomenal ill-fated doomsday message to the Iraqi people and \nspeaks loudly to the world. And, most importantly, it sends a strong \nmessage to the terrorists that all they have to do is be patient, take \ntheir losses along the way, because America's will will melt and we \nwill leave.\n  First and foremost, if we cannot and won't finish the job we set out \nto do, we will forever question our own future, and the people around \nthe world will question our resolve. Simply put, we are at, I believe, \na defining moment not only in the future of Iraq, but in the future of \nour own Nation with the message we send around the world. Therefore, it \nis imperative that this country and the people of this country stand up \nand send a message to the terrorists and to the Iraqi people that we \nwill not be deterred, we will finish our job in cooperation with the \nIraqi Government. I believe that is the message our President delivered \nin the last 24 hours as he flew to Iraq to visit with the new \nGovernment and our troops.\n  Right now, there is a new al-Qaida leader somewhere in Iraq. I will \nbet he is not sleeping at night. I will bet he is running from house to \nhouse. My guess is that his immediates around him are doing the same \nthing because we receive now thousands and thousands of informant \nmessages, and this man, while he has a new title of leader, is being \nhunted by a young man from Twin Falls, ID, or from Manchester, England, \nor from Kirkut. Those are the realities of war.\n  That is why we stand on the Senate floor talking on behalf of this \ncountry's future and the men and women who wear our uniform and the \nmission we have sent them to do.\n  Removing U.S. forces, that are standing side-by-side with Iraqi and \ncoalition forces, will effectively and instantly remove the fear that \nwe have now embedded within al-Qaida members now on the run in Iraq.\n  I am certain that those Members in this body advocating for the U.S. \nto pull out fully understand and appreciate the role foreign assistance \nplayed in helping our colonies become the great Republic it is today. \nWithout\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\nFrench military and economic assistance the will of the American \nRevolutionaries would have been broken long before our final push was \nfought to gain a free, independent, and sovereign republic.\n  To cut and run today, especially in light of our recent successes, \nwould be equivalent the U.S. colonies fighting without French \nassistance.\n  Simply put, without foreign military assistance to this country none \nof us would be standing here today in the world's greatest deliberative \nbody and the bell of liberty would never have rang.\n  So, today, I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to step \nup, look in the mirror, and recall how our very own country was \nestablished. Failure to stay the course on this endeavor is short-\nsighted, hypocritical, and goes squarely against the principles and the \nvery reason this country was conceived and founded upon.\n  Mr. President, we have much to be thankful for today. As such, I urge \nmy colleagues to help give the Iraqi people what this country so \ndesired in 1776, freedom.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5828-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4939, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4939) making emergency supplemental appropriations for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for other \n     purposes, having met, having agreed that the House recede \n     from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and \n     agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to \n     the same, signed by a majority of the conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the supplemental appropriations bill has had \na long and arduous course getting here. I congratulate the chairman and \nranking member for working so hard to get it here.\n  This legislation will provide funds to support the brave men and \nwomen who risk their lives every day in Iraq and Afghanistan on behalf \nof our country. The legislation will provide assistance to those in the \ngulf coast still struggling to recover from Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita, and also will help bolster border security and prepare for the \nthreat of bird flu. These matters are all vitally important, so I \nexpect the conference report to win broad support in the Senate. It \nshould.\n  But while I strongly support the goals of this legislation, I also \nhave real concerns about the many Senate-backed provisions that have \nbeen left out of this conference report.\n  For example, the Senate included $648 million to bolster port \nsecurity. One would think that protecting our ports would be a priority \nfor this Congress, given the ongoing threat of terrorism and the \ngrossly inadequate safeguards for our Nation's ports. But the House \nleadership completely rejected any additional funds for port security. \nThat is a serious mistake.\n  We learned during the Dubai Port debacle, the Dubai Port what I call \nscandal in our country, of the inadequacy of the security of our ports. \nWe knew it before that, but it was certainly much worse than we ever \nexpected.\n  The House conferees almost completely eliminated the relief the \nSenate proposed for farmers who have been suffering from recent drought \nconditions. Many of these farmers, particularly in the Midwest, are \nstruggling financially, just as farmers in regions directly affected by \nKatrina. Yet they will be shut out from any assistance under this \nlegislation.\n  This is very typical. Always the farmers, it seems, when there is an \nemergency, look to the Democrats for help, as they should, because if \nhistory is any example--and it usually is--Republicans simply don't pay \nattention to farmers' and ranchers' problems.\n  I have talked about port security, I have talked about the ranchers \nand farmers, but there is something else that was dropped in \nconference, and that is the proposal to beef up VA medical care for our \nNation's veterans. As Senator Murray said yesterday and Senator Akaka \ntoday, our Nation's veterans are in peril, but in this bill the move to \nhelp them was dropped.\n  Another proposal to include compensation to health professionals, \nfirst responders, and others who may be harmed in the future by \nexperimental flu vaccine has also been dropped.\n  I wonder why the majority leadership is so opposed to improving port \nsecurity and helping farmers and veterans. I don't understand. They say \nthey are concerned about cost. It is hard to take such statements \nseriously when we consider what else has happened in the Senate this \nweek. Costs? At the same time the majority was stripping a few hundred \nmillion dollars to bolster port security, to help our farmers, and to \nhelp veterans, they, the majority, proposed spending $1 trillion to \nprovide a windfall to a handful of our Nation's wealthiest families. \nWhen I say ``handful,'' I mean that of a country of 285 million or 290 \nmillion people, they want to help, at the most, 12,000 individual \nestates, less than two-tenths of 1 percent. At the same time they are \nasking for this trillion dollars that would have to be borrowed--of \ncourse, we have borrowed from China, Japan, Saudi Arabia; more than \nhalf the money we use to finance our country's operations is borrowed \nfrom foreign countries. At the same time they are dropping help for \nveterans, farmers, and port security, the majority has proposed a tax \nbreak worth--for example, they say Paris Hilton's tax break alone would \nbe in the $14 million-$15 million bracket.\n  At the same time they are eliminating these programs I have mentioned \nfor farmers, ranchers, veterans, and security for our country, they are \nproposing a tax break for the family of the former Exxon CEO worth $164 \nmillion, all paid for by more debt, largely from countries, as I have \nindicated, such as China, Japan, and Saudi Arabia.\n  So I think we should erase from the equation the majority's \ncommitment to fiscal responsibility. The Republican majority in the \nSenate has proven, along with President Bush, that fiscal \nresponsibility is not part of their mantra. When it comes to helping \naverage Americans and the middle class, Washington leaders are all for \nspending cuts. When it comes to handing out tax breaks that explode the \ndeficit, they insist no billionaire be left behind.\n  I am disappointed by what has been left out of this conference report \nand by the values and priorities these decisions reflect. Still, at the \nend of the day, the items contained in this legislation are vitally \nimportant. We must support our troops. We must assist the gulf coast. \nWe must tighten border security and prepare for a possible bird flu \noutbreak. But this legislation should never be here. Why? Because it \nshould have been included in our regular budget. We are in the fourth \nyear of the war in Iraq--the fourth year--but he didn't put it in his \nbudget. Why? Because it would demonstrate clearly when that budget was \ngiven to us how much more red ink there was in the budget.\n  I read in the papers that Senator John McCain of Arizona is going to \noffer legislation on the bill that we will have before us this \nafternoon, the Defense authorization bill, to no longer let the \nPresident do that, to no longer use the unusual procedure; that is, we \nare in the middle of the war, we have ongoing expenses, not to include \nthese expenses in his budget.\n  As I read the paper this morning, Senator McCain said he is going to\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\noffer legislation to stop that. If that is the case, and I understand \nit, I would certainly join with him. What was done to make this an \nemergency spending bill is wrong. We ought to have that part of the \nbudget and debate it like we do everything else.\n  I am sorry it took so long to get to the point where we are to get \nthe money for the troops, but it is here. I accept that.\n  I want to make one other point about what is so unusual about this \nlegislation. The Senate voted that they would have an extra $7 billion \nto take care of education and labor issues. That is the Health-\nEducation-Labor Subcommittee that is operated by Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin. We have an extra $7 billion. Even with that money, it \nwouldn't keep up with last year's numbers. But the House didn't want \nthat. Therefore, the House and Senate couldn't agree in an open \nhearing, like we usually have with a conference report. So what \nhappened--sometimes in the middle of the night--is that item was \ndropped, and they came up with something called a deeming resolution, \nwhich is a mechanism for setting the total level of discretionary \nspending for the upcoming fiscal year, totally apart from the normal \nbudget. It is used only when the normal budget process breaks down. It \nobviously hasn't broken down.\n  A deeming resolution is an admission of failure and used as a last \nresort. Yet here we are only a few weeks after the House completed its \nbudget, and the majority is already throwing up hands in defeat. \nApparently, they are not even going to produce a budget. That is a sad \ncommentary on the state of affairs.\n  Mr. President, I will use my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is a sad state of affairs in \nWashington. It is very clear that a point of order lies against this \nsupplemental. That means someone could raise a point of order, and it \nwould take under rule XXVIII a simple majority to overrule because it \nis clear it would properly lie. It remains to be seen if anyone is \ngoing to raise that point of order, but clearly it is available to \nanyone in the Senate.\n  I hope in the future we can have a regular process for budgeting and \na regular process for conference committees to meet. We have talked \nabout doing that before. Under the Republican majority, conferences are \nnot really the way we used to do them--publicly. The Republicans run \nthese committees privately. There are no public votes most of the time. \nIt is a sad commentary how they have run things here, but as I said \nbefore, during the 4\\1/2\\ years the President has been in office--I \nguess it is 5\\1/2\\ years now, I am sorry--we have not had three \nbranches of Government. We haven't had legislative, executive, and \njudicial branches of Government. We have had two. We have had the \nexecutive and judicial branches. There have been no Presidential \nvetoes. There has been no need for a Presidential veto because the \nPresident gets anything he wants, as indicated with this legislation \ngoing forward now.\n  I hope my friends in the majority will once again recognize \ncongressional oversight is important, to have some oversight hearings \nto find out what is going on in Iraq, to find out what is going on with \ndomestic spying, to find out what is going on with global warming and \nother issues of that nature, and not have a deaf ear to our \nresponsibilities as a legislative branch of Government, a separate but \nequal branch of Government, as so defined by our Founding Fathers.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we are here today discussing the \nemergency supplemental conference report, which appropriates over $70 \nbillion for Iraq and Afghanistan. Tomorrow we will return to the \nDefense authorization bill that will include more discussion of our \nefforts in those countries. The last week had events that this Senator \nconsiders very positive: the finalization of a new government in Iraq \nwith the naming of Ministers of Defense and Interior, the U.S. \nmilitary's success of killing Al-Zarqawi, and the safe return of the \nPresident just today from Iraq. While we have had these successes, I \nthink it is important for Congress, as we discuss both the supplemental \nbill and the DOD authorization legislation, to keep in mind the \nchallenge ahead of us.\n  While Prime Minister Maliki has moved forward with his new \ngovernment, we know that national security experts warn that Iraq is \nstill in bad shape. I believe that Congress must do its job in holding \nthe administration accountable as we consider these two pieces of \nlegislation and make sure that 2006 is a year of significant transition \nin Iraq. That is, specifically, that while we have understood the \nchallenges and mistakes that have been made, that we need to make sure \nwe are moving forward, and we need to make sure we are turning the \nsecurity efforts over to the new Iraqi Government.\n  While we have seen some promising developments in Iraq in the last \nweek, we need to remind ourselves that sectarian violence in the last \nseveral months has been on the increase, and that the challenge for \nIraqi and U.S. forces remains high. The challenge before us as a \nCongress is to remain vigilant on the accountability of the \nadministration as we consider this legislation I believe is paramount.\n  U.S. ground forces have been stretched and placed under enormous \nstress. Sectarian militias are responsible for waves of increasing \nviolence, and there are now over 1.2 million internally displaced \npersons throughout Iraq. And as I said, while we have had some \nsuccesses, not everything has gone as planned. There has been \nmismanagement, contract abuses, fraud in various levels of our \nreconstruction, and some lack of accountability on exactly how U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars have been spent. Electricity and oil production are \nbelow prewar levels. This all has to change.\n  This year the United States has been spending about $8 billion per \nmonth in Iraq, and Congress has appropriated to date about $320 billion \nfor Iraqi operations. We need to know where the President is going from \nhere.\n  Everyone should be thankful that Saddam Hussein is gone, but we \nshould learn from the mistakes that have been made so far and rebolster \nour efforts to get more international support for what the Iraqi \nGovernment and the United States are trying to accomplish. No matter \nwhere the world community was prior to the U.S. involvement in Iraq, \neveryone should rise to help the new Iraqi Government meet our growing \nchallenges. So this Senator wants to make sure that we are reaching out \nand being effective at a broader international effort.\n  I call on President Bush to name a special envoy to Iraq to promote \nregional diplomacy and to make sure the United Nations and the World \nBank are fully engaged. The President could name someone with the \nstature and leverage of former President Bill Clinton or former \nPresident George H.W. Bush, who was so instrumental in building an \ninternational coalition before the first gulf war. I believe that again \ntoday diplomatic collaboration is vital. A special envoy could help \ngarner the international support for both Iraqi reconstruction and \nsecurity. As I said, regardless of what foreign governments thought \nabout the administration's decision to go to war, everyone should share \nthe same desire to help Iraq succeed as a sovereign nation. The \ninternational donor community has pledged approximately $13.5 billion \nfor Iraq and for reconstruction efforts but has only delivered about \n$3.5 billion of that total. That must change. If nothing else, a U.S. \nenvoy could make its primary mission the financial contribution by \nthese countries to help shoulder the burden of stabilizing this very \nimportant region of the world.\n  Second, I believe the United States should not hesitate in calling a \nDayton-like summit with our allies, with Iraqi neighbors, with the \nUnited Nations, to make sure we are moving forward on answering any \npolitical and security questions that will help in stabilizing the \nregion. We should also support the Arab League's plan to hold its own \ninternational conference on reconciliation in Iraq. The international \ncommunity should work together to help the Iraqis reach a comprehensive \nagreement to guarantee regional security, protect Iraq's borders, \nsupplant the militias with Iraqi Security Forces, and revive the \nreconstruction efforts, especially in Baghdad. We cannot allow the \npolitical process to drift. The international community must demand \nthat\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\nIraqis continue making compromises necessary to end the sectarian \nviolence and to make sure that any amendments to the Iraqi \nconstitution, if necessary, take place in short order.\n  Third, I believe that the United Nations should become more involved. \nThe United Nations should encourage the creation of a U.N. High \nCommissioner for Iraq similar to the U.N. High Representative for \nBosnia, which was created to work with the international community to \nensure a peaceful, viable state in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Creating a \nU.N. High Commissioner of Iraq could open up the doors for countries \nthat might have otherwise been hesitant to participate. The U.N. can \ncall on its wide network of trained personnel and specialized \nresources, saving U.S. taxpayers money and providing a genuine boost \nfor our efforts in Iraq.\n  We must also make sure that we are serious about last year's \namendment, the Warner-Frist amendment, which declared that ``2006 \nshould be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty \nwith Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security creating \nthe conditions for phased redeployment of the United States from \nIraq.'' We pushed for greater oversight and required the administration \nto provide Congress with quarterly reports, and while we have received \nsome information, the latest reports have not had sufficient \ninformation about sectarian divisions and the risk of civil war and our \nresponse to those risks.\n  The Department of Defense aims to train and equip about 325,000 Iraqi \ntroops and police by the end of the year. I want to make sure that \nCongress, in our budget process, holds them accountable for meeting \nthese goals. For the sake of the U.S. troops that are on the ground, we \nmust make sure that the Iraqi government knows that we want the \nsecurity responsibilities transitioned to them. And we must make it \nclear that the United States is not going to stay in Iraq indefinitely.\n  I take Prime Minister Maliki at his word. He basically has said that \nthe Iraqi forces could take complete control of security within the \nnext 18 months and that the new Iraqi Government could deal with the \nmilitias and that the Iraqi Security Forces would take control as \nquickly as possible. I think we need to continue to push that issue and \nto make sure that we are meeting the milestones that will help that to \noccur as soon as possible.\n  We also need to make sure that the efforts on reconstruction move \nforward. The United States should help the Iraqis concentrate on \nsecurity and development efforts in certain areas to ensure that we are \ndemonstrating meaningful economic progress. I think again particularly \nin Baghdad.\n\n  Protecting the Iraqi people and the civilian infrastructure should be \nour highest priority. Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds alike must have faith \nin their government's ability to provide access to reliable \nelectricity, clean water, and proper sanitation.\n  We must remember that we have to honor our commitment to our troops--\nthe U.S. military who have sacrificed so much. And no one on the Senate \nfloor will ever forget the awful cost of war. In Iraq, the loss of \nnearly 2,500 members of our Armed Forces, and I am deeply concerned \nabout the 18,000 that have been wounded.\n  And just as our troops have been stretched to the limit, it is time \nfor us to realize that our capacity for veterans' health care has also \nbeen challenged. Based on credible projections from the independent \nbudget, composed by Veterans Service Organizations, the Federal \nGovernment is underfunding veterans' health care by at least $2 billion \nand the demands on the system are growing.\n  In March, the VA told Congress they are seeing 38 percent more Iraq \nwar veterans than they had budgeted for. So what is the impact? Some \nveterans are waiting more than 18 months just to get access to VA \nhealth care, and thousands of others across the country are waiting for \naccess to care. As of the last month, more than 2,900 veterans in \nWashington State were waiting over 30 days to gain access to outpatient \ncare that they deserve and have not been able to get because we have \nnot adequately funded the veterans' health care system.\n  Some experts suggest that one-third of the soldiers coming home from \nIraq seek mental health services, and we need to make sure that we are \nadequately funding mental health. A lack of capacity in the veterans' \nmental health system has caused a VA official recently to remark that \nwhen it comes to mental health the waiting list renders care virtually \ninaccessible. I believe this is unacceptable and that we have to do our \njob and do not shortchange veterans' health care. We must give those \nwho have stood up for us the access to care that they deserve.\n  The United States must make sure that it does not ever condone \nindiscriminate or deliberate killings of civilians. The overwhelming \nmajority of men and women in uniform are honorable and understand the \nrules of war and requirements of the Geneva Conventions. Any \naccusations of misconduct must be handled fairly by the military \njustice system. We should also play our oversight role here in Congress \nand make sure that Congress is not leaving the investigation of this \nissue simply up to the Department of Defense.\n  We need to make sure that Congress is also investigating this issue \nand providing the accountability and oversight that everyone deserves. \nWhether it is detainee abuse or Haditha, we need to make sure that the \nU.S. image is not damaged and our efforts to win the hearts and minds \nboth in Iraq and the war on terror are not hurt. We must make sure that \nwe have aggressive oversight and accountability of all agencies of the \nFederal Government.\n  The United States should be an example of leadership committed to \ntreating people humanely and abiding by the rule of law and promoting \nopportunity and a common vision.\n  I know that recently when British Prime Minister Tony Blair was here, \nhe gave a speech that said: This should be a moment of reconciliation \nnot only in Iraq, but the international community. The war split the \nworld. The struggle of Iraqis for democracy should unite it.\n  I believe that is what we must move forward on now too as we consider \nthese two pieces of legislation. Congress must be aggressive in its \noversight and accountability on these goals for 2006 and in turning \nover control to the Iraqi people. And we must make sure that we engage \nthe international community to help us move forward in this effort. The \nUnited States should lead the way, but it should do so with sufficient \ninternational support.\n  And then I believe we must get on to our larger goals, one that the \n9/11 commission recommended to us when it said: Just as we did in the \nCold War, we need to defend our ideals abroad vigorously. If the United \nStates does not act aggressively to define itself in the Islamic world, \nthe extremists will gladly do the job for us.\n  So besides these objectives, we need to move forward in fighting \nterrorism by promoting American ideals.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend my colleague from \nthe State of Washington for her statement. I believe that she has \noutlined several things that should be taken into serious consideration \nby this administration. A special envoy would be I think a dramatic and \nimportant step forward in changing the battlefield in Iraq to a more \nconstructive environment. I also think the idea of the United Nations \nappointing a high commissioner for this purpose will also be extremely \nhelpful. I associate myself with her remarks, and I thank her for her \nobservations on this war in Iraq.\n  The President visited Iraq yesterday. It was a surprise visit. I am \nsure it did a great deal to help the morale of our soldiers to know \nthat our President would take this dangerous journey to be there with \nthem, even if it was for a brief period of time. I am looking forward \nto the President's report to the American people today on what he found \nand what he proposes. We are all hopeful that this war will come to an \nend soon, that American troops will come home, and that at some point \nvery, very soon, we truly will have our mission accomplished.\n  This morning's newspaper informs us that we have lost 2,493 of our \nbest and bravest young men and women serving this United States in \nIraq. I asked a member of my staff to check when we lost 2,000 \nsoldiers, and the date was October 25 of last year. It appears that in\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\na very short period of time, we will pass the 2,500 mark. At the time \nthat we recorded the 2,000th military death in Iraq, I asked, along \nwith other Senators, for a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate to acknowledge their great contribution to our country and in \nrespect for their memory. When the time comes that 2,500 have given \ntheir lives, I will make that same unanimous consent request. Since \nthere are no Republican Senators on the floor at this moment, I won't \nmake it at this time, but I want the majority to know that I think, on \na bipartisan basis, Senators from both parties should come to the floor \nwhen we have recorded the 2,500th death in Iraq and observe a moment of \nsilence in memory of our fallen warriors and in prayer for their \nfamilies whose lives will never be the same because of their loss.\n  At that time too we should reflect on those who have gone to serve \nand have returned broken in body and some in spirit. Over 2,000 have \ncome back from Iraq with serious head injuries. Many of them are \nstruggling now to regain the basic faculties and strengths which they \nneed to lead a normal life. Another 15,000 or 16,000 soldiers have \nreturned who have lost an arm or leg or other grievous injury. They, \ntoo, are struggling with their families and with the help of the \nVeterans Administration to get back to a position where their lives can \nreturn to normal.\n\n  We know we are not spending enough money at the Veterans \nAdministration. We promised these men and women, if you swear an oath \nto the United States, if you wear our uniform and our colors, if you \nwill march behind the flag for America's security and interests, we \nwill stand with you. When you come home, we will be there. If you need \nhelp in a hospital, we will provide it. If you need help paying for \nyour education or your future, we will help you.\n  We are not keeping our promise. In too many cases across America, the \nVeterans Administration is not adequately staffed, not adequately \nprepared to meet the returning veterans' needs.\n  I have seen it in my State. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a \nserious problem. Men and women who are in combat are under extreme \nstress. They are involved in actions which can leave a lasting imprint \non their minds. They are separated from their families, some for long \nand repeated periods of time, and some come back needing a helping \nhand. They need to sit down with a friendly counselor, a professional \nwho can bring them back through some of the terrible experiences they \nhave had.\n  I have met with these soldiers, these Marines and others. They are \nbrave enough to stand up and say, I need help, and we need to help them \nso that their lives will be restored to normal. Unfortunately, the bill \nwe are now considering, the supplemental appropriations bill, doesn't \ninclude an adequate amount for our Veterans Administration. We tried to \nadd it in the conference committee. There was a motion made by the \nSenator from Washington, Patty Murray, to put more funds into the \nVeterans Administration so we would not shortchange our soldiers. It \nwas defeated.\n  We have been through this before. It was only last year we went \nthrough the same debate, and finally, after several months, the Bush \nadministration came in and said: I guess we just don't have enough \nmoney for the veterans. And we added some. Why do we go through that \nevery year? We know these veterans are returning and they need our help \nand we need to have the professionals there to give them that helping \nhand.\n  It is unfortunate that this supplemental appropriations bill is the \nway we fund this war. This is at least the fourth time we have had such \na bill. These bills are supposed to be for unforeseen emergencies--\nhurricanes, earthquakes, things that occur that God has wrought and we \nhave to deal with but not for things that we can ordinarily anticipate; \nthat is what our budget is for.\n  The administration every single year takes the cost of the war and \nputs it in an emergency bill, saying: We were surprised; we still have \na war going on.\n  We should not be surprised. We know that we have been in Iraq now for \nover 3 years and that we are likely to be there for some time to come. \nPutting this in a supplemental appropriations bill allows the \nadministration to say it is not part of the ordinary budget; therefore, \nit is not part of the budget, not part of the budget deficit. That is \nnot true.\n  This $90-billion-plus bill is added to the debt of this Nation, and \nwe should be honest with the American people about it. This bill is not \nan honest portrayal of the true cost of this war.\n  I am also really disappointed; when there are natural disasters \nacross America, one of the first victims is usually an American farmer. \nThese are people trying to make a living growing our food and fiber, \nand changes in the weather, whether it is a drought or a flood, can \nmake all the difference in the world in their success. I cannot tell \nyou how many times in my congressional career I have been asked to come \nto the rescue of farmers across the United States in virtually every \nState in the Union, and I have done it because I know my agricultural \ncommunity is vulnerable as well and a time may come when they need \nhelp.\n  This is such a time. Last year we had a drought in the State of \nIllinois, a terrible drought that cost us dramatically when it came to \nour corn crop and other production. I sat down with the Secretary of \nAgriculture and said, Why don't you help our farmers? We always help \nfarmers in these situations.\n  He said: I looked at the statistics and, on average, the farmers in \nIllinois are just fine.\n  On average? Farmers don't farm on average. They farm their acreage. \nOn average you may have one prosperous farmer near one who was wiped \nout in the drought. On average both of them did just fine, but we know \nthe reality. The reality is that one farmer and his family are \nsuffering.\n  I urged this administration to do their best to help when it came to \nthis disaster assistance. Over 6,000 producers nationwide wrote to my \noffice and the offices of Senators Pryor, Lincoln, Dorgan, Salazar, \nDayton, and Johnson urging this disaster assistance. Major farm \norganizations supported us. This drought we faced last year was the \nworst in over a century. At least 10 counties in Illinois sustained a \n20 percent loss in corn yield. The value of the Illinois corn crop was \ndown $1.1 billion. The Illinois Department of Agriculture estimates \nthat drought of 2005 lowered yields and resulted in a $443 million loss \nto producers.\n  Now the farmers, coming back in the field, face extraordinarily high \nenergy prices because America does not have an energy policy. There has \nbeen no leadership in Washington. The cost of fertilizer, the cost of \ndiesel fuel, the cost of gasoline has gone up dramatically, up to $25 \nan acre for farmers over the last several years right out of the bottom \nline.\n  What we asked for in this bill was to give the farmers a helping hand \nas we have for the farmers in the Gulf Coast States. I see my colleague \nand friend, the Senator from Louisiana. The farmers in that State we \nhave helped, as we should, and Mississippi and Alabama, as we should. \nBut I think, when it comes to this national challenge, that we should \nhave stepped forward to help farmers across the board. This bill does \nnot do that, and I am disappointed.\n  There is another element in this bill which I think needs to be \naddressed.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). There are 5 minutes and 48 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, that element relates to what is known as \nthe deeming resolution. That is Senate talk for the budget resolution, \nwhich is kind of the broad outline of how we will spend money this \nyear. Instead of passing the budget resolution as we ordinarily do, at \nthe last minute in this conference committee the Republican leadership \nin the House and Senate plugged this resolution into this spending \nbill. It has been done before but not very often. It is an unusual \napproach. What it means is the overall spending limitations for the \nwhole budget are now plugged into this special appropriations bill.\n  There is nothing sinister or wrong about that on its face, until you \nlook at the resolution itself. What they put in as the resolution is \nPresident Bush's budget. Let me tell you that budget, sadly, is some \n$16 billion below the budget resolution that the Senate approved on a \nbipartisan basis.\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\n  Let me give an example of what the President's budget will cut. These \nare choices that have been made and will be made in the weeks ahead. \nOne of the areas that troubles me most is President Bush's proposal to \ncut funding at the National Institutes of Health. That is the agency of \nour Government that does research on medical diseases and challenges: \nLou Gehrig's disease, autism, heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes--\nthe list goes on and on. President Bush's budget cut $1 billion from \nthe National Institutes of Health since 2003 and continues to cut \nfunding there.\n  There was a bipartisan commitment in Congress that we would \ndramatically increase medical research, believing that most families in \nAmerica would applaud that expenditure of their tax dollars, and I \nthink they would. Now, if we are going to follow the President's \nbudget, we will be cutting back on medical research. Any family that \nfaces a serious medical illness understands that research is the one \nlifeline you cling to. You pray for the best outcome, you hope for the \nbest doctor, but you are also counting on the National Institutes of \nHealth and other medical research to be looking for that cure.\n\n  Why would we cut back on it? And we do.\n  This President's budget also low-balls the spending for the Veterans \nAdministration. As I said before, last year they were proven wrong. It \nmeans that instead of acknowledging the obvious, when we promise our \nsoldiers we will be with them when they come home we try to shortchange \nit and then catch up with them later. It is no way to run a government. \nIt is no way to keep your promise to the men and women in uniform who \nserved our country so well.\n  There is one another particular issue as well that the President's \nbudget threatens about which I am concerned. We passed the budget \nresolution and the Senate recognized that the global AIDS epidemic was \na major priority. Our budget included a bipartisan amendment to \nincrease funding for the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria by \n$566 million. On average, $100 million contributed to the global fund \nwill mean 630,000 people around the world will have chemically treated \nnets around their beds to avoid malaria, one of the No. 1 killers of \nchildren in the developing world; 150,000 treatments for malaria for \neach $100 million to the global fund; 80,000 treatments for \ntuberculosis; 370,000 people with HIV tests; 11,000 people with AIDS \ntreatment.\n  This resolution strips $16 billion out of the budget that we just \npassed, and that means there will be less money to fight these global \nepidemics.\n  Why should we care? We should care, not just because of basic values \nthat many of us hold that they are our neighbors, they are our brothers \nand sisters, but also because if disease is rampant in the world it \nwill visit the United States. If the avian flu becomes an epidemic \nmoving from animals to humans in some part of the world, we will have \n21 days before it spreads around the world.\n  A century ago many of these diseases didn't survive the voyage on the \ntrip from the old world where now they survive the 8, 10, and 12-hour \nairplane trips and come into cities and towns and counties all around \nthe world, including the United States, so our efforts on public health \naround the world are not only for the right reason, they are also to \nprotect us.\n  As this President's budget cuts back on spending, threatens the \nspending for the global fund, unfortunately, people will die as a \nresult of it and, unfortunately, we will live in a more vulnerable \nworld.\n  Budgets are about choices and usually hard choices, but the Senate \nmade those choices in March. Unfortunately, the bill before us from \nthis conference committee reverses that decision and makes threatening \ncuts in the National Institutes of Health in the areas of veterans care \nand in global AIDS, to mention just a few.\n  This President's budget had the deepest cuts in education of any \nPresident in the last several years at a time when we need schools to \nbe the very best for the 21st century to create the opportunity that \nour people and our children certainly deserve.\n  Members of the Senate are faced with a quandary. Here is a bill that \nfunds the war. Even those of us who voted against the war believe we \nhave to provide the resources so our soldiers have the equipment and \ntraining and supplies they need to come home safely with their mission \naccomplished, and I voted for every penny the President has asked for \nthat purpose. But within this is a budget resolution with which I do \nnot agree. If you could split your vote on this, I certainly would, \nvoting for the money for the soldiers but voting against this budget \nresolution which will force us to make cuts in critical areas of \nimportance for America's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nsupplemental.\n  As I begin, I would like to underscore some of the points the Senator \nfrom Illinois just made about the disturbing deficiencies in this \nparticular supplemental relative to the underfunding of many ongoing \ncritical issues that he so eloquently outlined. But I would like to say \nthat there are some extraordinarily helpful items in this supplemental, \nwhich is why I am going to support it, why I was pleased to be a part \nof crafting the supplemental through the appropriations process as a \nmember of that committee, and why I would like to say a particular \nthank you to the senior Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd, and--I \nsee the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on the floor--to thank \nthe Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, for his work in fashioning \nthrough this Senate a bill that will bring so much help and urgently \nneeded support to the gulf coast.\n  It is not too soon for us to do this, considering hurricane season \nstarted last week and there is a tropical storm out in the gulf as we \nspeak here on the floor. Throughout all the gulf coast, from Pascagoula \nall the way to Beaumont and in parts of Florida as well, of course, \npeople are sitting on pins and needles, hoping and praying that this \nseason that we are entering is not as catastrophic as the one we just \nleft and looking to this Congress, looking to this Senate, looking to \nthe House, looking to our Governors of our States, to give them support \nand encouragement. That is what this supplemental bill will do.\n  Within this supplemental bill, despite the real shortcomings that \nSenator Durbin has outlined and the real dilemma for those who want to \nsupport the troops in Iraq and support real disaster funds, there is an \nunfortunate choice of having to cut some overall funding that is \ncritical to the country. But, from our perspective, representing the \nState of Louisiana--and trying to speak as well as I can for the whole \ngulf coast--we have to get this supplemental passed today.\n  The leadership of the Appropriations Committee has tried, on the \nSenate side, to push a robust, strong supplemental bill through to help \nthe people of the gulf coast.\n  I would like to spend just a moment talking about some of the things \nthat we were successful with in this bill, starting with $3.7 billion \nto repair and armor hurricane-protected levees throughout Louisiana, in \nthe southeastern part of our State as well as other parts of our State.\n  The reason this is so critical is, as I have said many times, it \nwasn't the hurricanes which necessarily did us in in Louisiana, \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, but what really put us at risk and what \nreally caused substantial damage and loss of life--1,300 people died in \nthe last hurricane season in the United States, a record we could not \neven believe we would hit or a number we would hit, not in the year \n2006, not with the warning we have, not with all the sophisticated \ntechnology we have today, but 1,300 people lost their lives in large \nmeasure because the Federal levee system collapsed. It broke in \nmultiple places because of underfunding over the years and because of \nlack of integrity in the design. That report was released only 12 weeks \nago. Repairing those levees, armoring them, and building them better, \nwe are not able to do on a wish and a prayer. We need to do that with \nreal money, and the real money is in this bill.\n  I thank Senator Cochran and the administration for stepping up and \nrealizing that their original request was\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\nbillions of dollars short. Without this extra money, the people of \nsouth Louisiana and in large measure the gulf coast of Mississippi--\nwhich, by the way, is protected by the levee systems and the coastal \nsystem of Louisiana--would be very vulnerable. We have added almost $2 \nbillion through the process from the original $1.9 billion. Without the \nstrong support of Senator Byrd and Democratic Members as well as the \nleadership of Senator Cochran, this would not have been possible.\n  I also wish to say that a very strong part of this bill we will find \nin the $5.2 billion for community development block grants. The \noriginal request by the administration was only about $4 billion. While \nwe were extremely happy for that because it was directed to Louisiana, \nwe were able to put an additional $1 billion for community development \nblock grants to make sure that Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, to some \ndegree Florida, and, of course, Louisiana get the help they need, not \nthrough FEMA, which even on its best day is not working very well, not \nthrough other agencies that have not been designed or are not \nfunctioning well, but directly to our Governors and to our legislators \nand local officials who can put this community development block grant \nto good use--rebuilding 200,000 homes in Louisiana that were destroyed, \n10 times more than Hurricane Andrew, which was the most expensive storm \nto hit Florida or the United States prior to Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. We are very grateful and very hopeful that this community \ndevelopment block grant funding can go to rebuilding, to setting up a \nnew approach to rebuilding houses.\n  The saddest thing was that many people didn't have insurance because \nthey weren't in the flood plain. They didn't have insurance because \nthey had already paid for their homes. Their homes were paid in full, \non high ground, not in a flood plain. Then the levees broke, and \nmiddle-income families, wealthy families, and poor families lost their \nlargest asset--their security for their retirement, their emotional \nsecurity, having worked a whole lifetime to build assets of a home, \nwashed away. For some parents and for some grandparents, this was the \nway they were going to send their children or grandchildren to college. \nGone. Without this community development block grant, they have no hope \nof restoring their asset or rebuilding their equity--no hope.\n  Mississippi has developed a plan that is slightly different from \nLouisiana's plan. I am not sure either one of them is perfect, but it \nis the plan they came up with. Our job is to get them the money and \nurge them to do the very best they can with giving people a start.\n  This is just a picture of one house. I am sure Senator Cochran and \nSenator Lott have others. I will literally show you pictures of homes \nof all different shapes and sizes. Over 275,000 of them look like this. \nAgain, it wasn't just a regular hurricane, which we are used to in the \ngulf. When the levees broke and a tsunami, a wave of 20 feet of water, \npoured into the city of New Orleans out of Lake Pontchartrain, this is \nwhat was left. That is what people came back to.\n  People ask: Senator, why isn't everybody scurrying around rebuilding? \nWell, if this were my house--and my brothers' and sisters' houses look \nlike this; four of them lost their houses; this is what they look like. \nWhen they showed up, I, frankly, know how they felt. They do not know \nwhere to begin. Even if they can clean up their house, every house to \nthe left and every house to the right and every house as far as the eye \ncan see looks like this, and they are not sure they want to be the only \none back in the neighborhood, with no water, no lights, et cetera.\n  This is a problem of huge magnitude for the gulf coast. As I said, \nthis is not a place which is inconsequential to the Nation; this place \nis the heart of America's energy coast. One of the reasons the price of \noil is so high is because these hurricanes shut down the oil and gas \nindustry for the most part in the gulf when they hit. Anytime a \nhurricane comes to the gulf, we have to relocate within 24 hours about \n6,000 to 7,000 oil workers who make their living on these platforms out \nin the gulf. These are cities out in the gulf. Every time those waves \nkick up, to great credit to the industry, I am not sure we had one loss \nof life. I could be wrong, but I am not sure. I am almost sure there \nwas no loss of life to the workers here because we got them off of \nthose rigs, tied those rigs down, and buckled down for those storms. \nWhen the storms pass, we all go back out and we set this up again.\n  Not only were these storms category 4 and 5 and we are still only 75 \npercent up, but the communities that serve them--like the community of \nSt. Bernard where a lot of people live who work in these oilfields lost \n59 percent of their houses, and 90 percent of all their businesses were \ndestroyed because the levees broke. We are asking these people who live \nin those houses which you just saw to go out to these rigs every day to \nwork to turn the lights on in this Chamber. They do a real good job of \nthat. I am proud of the work they do. But this supplemental will help \nthem rebuild their homes, rebuild their schools, and rebuild their \nbusinesses. The least we can do is pass it without any more time lapse \nto give them a chance to get back.\n  I hope members of the Appropriations Committee and the authorizing \ncommittees will really grab this opportunity; that is, we fought to get \nsome additional money in this bill, and we ended up with $400 million \nfor some alternative housing.\n\n  Let me say as a Senator from Louisiana that I have been through these \nstorms. Can we please move past the plan to put people in trailers? It \nis costing the Federal Government $70,000 to put people in a trailer. \nWe could practically build a house for $70,000 and let people live \nthere temporarily until they can get back into their real houses. It is \nan extraordinary waste of money. We are wasting it at rates that \nstagger people. We have to think about a new way of not putting \neverybody in trailers.\n  Another problem with putting people in trailers is when the next \nhurricane season comes along, their trailers could literally blow away \nif they are not tacked down the way they should be, or secured. And \nFEMA has just let all the people living in trailers know that they are \nnot to take the trailers with them. Even though they are travel \ntrailers, they cannot take them with them if they have to evacuate \nbecause they might steal them.\n  Here we are going to have thousands of people who are living in \ntrailers which cost $70,000 each to hook up--and contractors made a lot \nof money off of this system--and the people who have to live in them \nonly get a little bit of space to live. Some are living in them with \nthree or four children, which makes for an exciting opportunity for \nfamilies. These trailers cannot be moved when the hurricane comes. I \nhope the winds don't get up to 150 miles an hour because we will have a \nlot of trailers flying around. I don't know what is going to happen \nthere.\n  I am so happy that we could fight for this $400 million. That sounds \nlike a lot of money, but considering we are spending billions of \ndollars on trailers, to think maybe we could do this a better way next \ntime--that is in this bill.\n  Another part in this bill which we fought hard to keep--and we got \nknocked down quite a bit, but we managed to save a piece of it--was for \nthe colleges and universities. Mississippi has two colleges that were \nvery severely damaged. I believe that is correct. I could be wrong. If \nI am, I will correct the record. But Louisiana has 12 major \nuniversities--Tulane, Loyola, the University of New Orleans, Xavier, \nDillard, McNeese on the western side--and 45,000 people are employed by \nthese universities, and there are 40,000 students at these \nuniversities. Dillard University, one of the historic Black colleges in \nour country, a private college with an excellent reputation, small--the \nkids are still at the Hilton Hotel taking classes and eating their \nmeals in the dining room of the Hilton Hotel because their whole campus \nwas destroyed. Their insurance is slow. They are having a hard time \ngetting back. But it is a beautiful, historic campus.\n  We have $50 million in this bill to try to give out grants. They have \nborrowed as much as they can. Their boards of directors are fighting to \nkeep these universities up and running. Besides the great history of \nthese universities, they are the economic engine that is going to pull \nthe gulf coast up from its knees and pull it back. If not our \nuniversities, who is going to do the job?\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\nInstead of having our universities lay off people, our universities \nshould be hiring people. These are people getting good jobs that pay \n$50,000 and $100,000. We need our researchers, teachers, and our \nprofessors leading the way, and we need our students leading the way to \nrebuild this great part of America. We have some money in this bill for \nthat. I am proud that we got bipartisan support for that effort on the \nSenate side.\n  Finally, I wish to mention two other things. In the city of New \nOrleans, where the water flooded 80 percent of the east bank of the \ncity, one of the facilities we lost was the veterans hospital. We have \nover 400,000 veterans in Louisiana. I think we probably have about \n300,000 in Mississippi. Between the gulf coast of Mississippi and New \nOrleans, we had a very good system of health care for our veterans, who \nreally deserve our very best. All Americans deserve good health care, \nbut for men and women who spent their early years, their teenage years, \nin their early twenties in foxholes, the least we can do for them for \ndefending this country and holding up the flag--today is Flag Day--is \nmake sure when their hospitals and clinics are destroyed that we not \nonly build them back but we build them back better and stronger. If \nthey were too close to the coast, we will move it back.\n\n  This hospital was safely in downtown New Orleans, not anywhere near a \ncoast, not anywhere near a lake, not anywhere near the ocean. Because \nthe levees broke, that building was flooded, and now we have veterans \nwithout a hospital.\n  The money for that hospital is in this bill. My colleagues have \ncommitted to pass the prerequisite authorization we need to get that \ndone. We will build up in the next couple of months a better health \ncare system for veterans in the gulf coast, and do it smartly with \ntaxpayer money because we are partnering with LSU and perhaps even with \nTulane to do a very interesting build of this new hospital that serves \nveterans and the public alike as we rise up with a better health care \nsystem for the gulf coast.\n  Finally, small businesses. I don't know what makes me sadder. I can't \neven decide what is the saddest thing about this because it is all so \nsad. We lost 20,000 businesses. Just as people lost their home, their \ngreatest asset, people struggle their whole life to build a business. \nIt might not have been a huge business, but it was their business. It \nmight not have been a $50 million business, but it employed three or \nfour people. It made a living for the business owner, and it \ncontributed to the society and to the strength of the community. Many \nof those businesses are gone.\n  We have been very slow to recognize the extraordinary magnitude of \nthis disaster, saying to our businesses: Just go to the Small Business \nAdministration and get a loan.\n  I will spend 1 minute on this. Senator Kerry and I sat through 3 \nhours of testimony, 7 hours on the ground at a small business tour in \nNew Orleans. I want to tell you what people said: Senator, this makes \nno sense to me. I got my loan. I asked for a $400,000 loan. I applied \nfor it. After 4 or 5 months, I finally got approved. But I don't really \nneed $400,000. My husband and I decided we really only want to borrow \nabout $200,000 because we do not want to take on that much debt. We are \nafraid we can't really pay it back. But the Small Business \nAdministration told us we have to borrow the $400,000 because if we \ndon't, we cannot get a loan.\n  That is what is going on whether people want to believe it or not. \nAnd it gets worse. Not only are they forced to borrow more money than \nthey need and more money than they really want, the Small Business \nAdministration only sends them, say, $20,000 of the $400,000. Guess \nwhat their monthly amortization payment is on. It is not on the $20,000 \nthat they have in hand, they have to pay based on the total amount. \nEvery month, they are paying principal and interest on the $400,000, \nnot the $20,000 they have in hand. That is the system under which our \nsmall businesses are operating.\n  I am begging the Senate to send more money, not through the regular \nchannels, but this money will go through a different channel to give \ndifferent grants and loans to these businesses in hopes we can save \nmany of them. Some of them have been lost and can never be rebuilt. The \nbusiness owners have moved and gone to other places. But there are many \nextraordinarily brave business owners who not only want to build their \nbusinesses back but build their communities back. The least we can do \nis give them programs that actually meet them halfway, that really \nwork, and stop burying them in paperwork and redtape, rules that make \nno sense. It is enough to make someone want to quit. I would not blame \nthem. But people are not going to quit in the gulf coast.\n  As we pass the supplemental, it adds to some additional funding we \nalready passed. We will keep working until we get it right, building a \nbetter school system, a better health care system, building levees and \nsupport to protect this area because the people of the gulf coast \ncontribute much more than they take to the strength of this national \neconomy.\n  Off of this coast, wealth is created not just for the people who live \nthere but for this Nation. We are going to prepare ourselves for this \nnext hurricane season, pass the supplemental, and look with confidence \nto the future as we continue to make progress.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Has the time allocated under the order for the \nDemocratic side been used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Harkin has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to proceed at this point to \npoint out some of the changes made in the conference committee which \nenabled us to get a conference report agreed to between the House and \nSenate conferees and to be consistent with the requirements of the \nadministration.\n  The administration had sent a pretty clear message that a veto of \nthis conference report could be expected if the total amount exceeded \nthe amount requested by the President for emergency appropriations for \nthe war on terror and other needed expenses to help with the recovery \nfrom the hurricanes that damaged the gulf coast area of our State.\n  The Senate Committee on Appropriations had numerous amendments \noffered during the markup of this legislation, many of which were \nrelated to other issues and other needs, all of which our committee \nthought were legitimate and requests which should be met.\n  In the conference with the House, it became apparent we were going to \nhave to yield on some provisions we agreed to and put in our bill. The \nHouse, likewise, recognized their bill was not perfect either, it could \nbe improved, and some of the Senate suggestions for additional funding \nin some areas were agreed to by the House.\n  We wound up with a conference report which recommends $94.43 billion \nfor operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, principally in connection with \nthe war on terror; hurricane recovery benefits are made available, \nprincipally to the gulf coast region of our country; preparations for a \npossible pandemic flu problem, which has been a cause for concern in \nwhich funds were requested by the administration specifically for that \npurpose; and other activities related to these principal subjects.\n  The level of funding is $14.47 billion below the Senate-passed bill \nbut is $2.48 billion above the House-passed bill.\n  There are some specific areas of interest that were debated in the \nSenate which I am pleased to report were recognized by the conference \ncommittee as worthwhile expenditures and investments of Federal funds. \nPrincipally, in our State of Mississippi, the Navy retirement home \nlocated in Gulfport, MS, which was virtually destroyed by the \nhurricane, there was no specific request made by the administration for \nfunding of that. The House hadn't put money in the bill to deal with \nthat specific issue. The Senate did include substantial funding, over \n$100 million, to deal with that problem. The conferees agreed, yielded \nto the Senate on that issue. The administration has indicated it will \nnot veto the bill over that provision.\n  There are other similar provisions along the line where the Senate \nhad insisted that funds be included. Agriculture disaster assistance, \nfor example, had not been requested by the administration.\n  While keeping with the challenge to restrict the funding for benefits \nrelated to damages caused by hurricanes, we did provide, for example, \n$37.5 million\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\nfor the Foreign Service Agency to respond to damages caused by the \nhurricanes of 2005. Neither the President's request nor the House-\npassed bill included similar funding.\n  Of this spending, $5 million is for additional salaries and expenses \nincurred by the Foreign Service Agency to respond to damages, and $32.5 \nmillion is for the Emergency Conservation Program. Real benefits are \ngoing to flow from this conference report because of action the Senate \nhad taken and defended successfully in conference with the House. We \nare assured the administration will use these funds to try to help \nthose landowners and those involved in production agriculture recover \nfrom the devastation of these hurricanes.\n  There are other individual accounts, including one for $25 million \nfor the working capital fund of the Department of Agriculture. This was \nrequested by the President, I point out.\n  This conference report reflects a fair compromise between what we \nwere trying to do in the Senate bill, point out some areas we thought \nhad been underfunded or left out of other requests by the \nadministration for disaster relief, and still deal with the reality \nthat we have to be responsive and we have to stay within the restraints \ndictated by good conscience, good government.\n  This conference report meets that challenge. I am pleased to be able \nto present it on behalf of the Committee on Appropriations for the \nSenate and urge it be agreed to.\n  I don't know if any Senators have requests for time for debate of \nthis bill, but inasmuch as there is time remaining on the Democratic \nside, I will reserve the remainder of the time allocated to our side of \nthe aisle.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we under an \norder right now with a time limit? I have the floor, but I would like \nto know how much time I am allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Fifteen minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I want to say I have a great friendship \nwith, a liking of, and respect for the chairman of our committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi. It is always a tough job when \nyou are bringing an appropriations bill out on the floor, especially a \nsupplemental. And I respect the effort that has gone into this. \nHowever, I must say that there are a lot of things that I find very, \nvery problematic about this appropriations bill.\n  Again, there are some critical provisions included in this bill. \nThere is funding for our Nation to prepare for a possible avian flu \npandemic. Obviously, there is funding for our men and women in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and we want to support them in every way, with the \nequipment they need to maximize their safety. There is also funding for \nthe U.S. Institute of Peace democracy-building activities in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. So there are things in here that are very necessary that \nwe must provide.\n  On the other hand, however, there are some very disturbing and I \nthink sort of ominous precedent-setting things that are in this bill \nthat could lead to some real problems down the road.\n  I am extremely disappointed this bill includes a deeming resolution \nfor the budget. First of all, it should not be in here. Now, I tried to \nexplain a deeming resolution to one of my constituents the other day. \nTry to explain it to someone. Try to explain it to someone who is not \nsort of in this body--a ``deeming'' resolution. You see, we pass a \nbudget, but then the budget cannot get passed by the House, so, \ntherefore, we then are going to pass a deeming resolution to deem \nsomething that we cannot pass as passed because we deem it passed.\n  Now, just try explaining that to the average citizen of this country. \nThey would think we have lost all our marbles in trying to do something \nlike this. I am hopeful we will reach some point in the Senate and the \nHouse where this is absolutely forbidden in the future: putting \nsomething like a deeming resolution on an emergency supplemental.\n  Now, we want to pass an emergency supplemental for the reasons I just \nmentioned, but then to have to swallow something which makes no sense \nwhatsoever and which, quite frankly, is harmful and which the Senate \nrejected before flies in the face of what I think is legitimate \nlegislative activity.\n  So the Senate voted 2 months ago overwhelmingly in favor of an \namendment that Senator Specter and I offered--bipartisan--to add $7 \nbillion to the President's budget. The Senate voted 73 to 27. That is a \npretty overwhelming vote around here: 73 to 27. The aim was clear: to \nallow Congress to fund our education, health, human services, and labor \nbill. And it was not an increase but just to fund it at the same level \nas in fiscal year 2005, 2 years ago. It was not radical. We were not \nasking for a lot, not asking for the keys to the Treasury.\n  We said: Let's just spend the same amount of money we did 2 years \nago, not even accounting for inflation.\n  The Senate said: Let's stop cutting the programs that support working \nfamilies, people with disabilities, and students who cannot afford \ncollege. Let's end the cuts to research on cancer and other diseases.\n  Seventy-three Senators agreed. They voted that way. Then the Senate \nreconfirmed its position in conference. When this deeming resolution \nwas proposed, Senator Byrd offered an amendment that proposed the same \nthing as what we passed in the Senate--the Specter-Harkin amendment. \nAgain, a majority of the Senate conferees voted to add the $7 billion. \nTwo times the Senate demanded this additional funding for health, \neducation, and labor programs, and human services.\n  Now, where is the $7 billion? Where did it go? It just vanished--\nvanished. It is gone. The deeming resolution--again, try explaining \nthat to someone, to the average person. The deeming resolution that is \nin this bill is at exactly the same level as the President's budget, \nwhich we rejected in the Senate 2 months ago.\n  So what happened? The conferees from the majority party went behind \nclosed doors and stripped out the $7 billion. It is as if the 73-to-27 \nvote in the Senate never even happened.\n  So what does this mean? What is the impact? Well, let's look at what \nhappens. Under this now, the President's budget will cut funding for \ncancer research by $40 million. Eighteen of the 19 National Institutes \nof Health will face reductions.\n  This deeming resolution will now cut Social Services Block Grants by \n$500 million. It completely eliminates the Community Services Block \nGrant program. These are the two biggest discretionary programs for the \npoor. They are kind of the glue that holds the human services delivery \nsystem together.\n\n  The number of children served by Head Start will be reduced. The \nMeals on Wheels Program will be cut.\n  In education, this deeming resolution, now following the President's \nbudget, will have the largest cut to Federal education in 26 years. The \nNo Child Left Behind Act will be underfunded by $15.4 billion. Title I, \nserving our most needy children in school, will be frozen at last \nyear's level.\n  I could go on and on, but this is what we mean by passing a deeming \nresolution on the supplemental.\n  At a time when Congress has just passed an additional $70 billion in \ntax cuts, mostly for the wealthiest in our country--and we had an \neffort a week ago to eliminate estate taxes, but, fortunately, we \nstopped it. But I hear it may come back, another tax cut that will \nbenefit only 3 families out of every 1,000 families in America. We are \ngoing to have another attempt, and that will cost us, I understand, a \nhalf trillion dollars over 10 years. And it will go only to the \nwealthiest in our society. Yet we are going to cut Meals on Wheels, \nHead Start, cut education, title I, eliminate Community Services Block \nGrants, cut funding for the National Institutes of Health.\n  What is going on here? Have we taken leave of our senses? This \ndeeming resolution, as I said, was not in the House bill, and it was \nnot in the Senate bill. There is a rule. We are supposed to\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\nlive by rules in our society. We have laws. People obey laws. We have \nrules to live by so we know what the game is, so we know what we are \nexpected to do.\n  We have a rule that says anything that is added in conference that \nwas not in either bill is subject to a point of order. A point of order \nnow lies on this floor against this bill.\n  Now, why isn't anyone raising the point of order? Well, I am told \nthat the point of order will not be raised because the Chair, you see, \nwill have to agree with the point of order that this violates rule \nXXVIII; therefore, the whole bill then falls.\n  What does that mean? Why, it means they would have to go back to \nconference and strip out the deeming resolution. That might take a \ncouple of hours. Then it would come back, and then we would have a \nsupplemental appropriations without this ``deeming resolution.''\n  So why isn't rule XXVIII being invoked? Why aren't we raising the \npoint of order? I understand that what would happen is the Chair would \nuphold the point of order, the majority party would move to override \nthe ruling of the Chair--and that takes 51 votes--and I am told the \nmajority party would have the 51 votes to override the ruling of the \nChair, and that would do away, basically, with rule XXVIII.\n  Well, what is so wrong with that? What is the good of having a rule \nif you do not abide by the rules? I am reminded of one of my favorite \nlines from ``Finnegan's Rainbow.'' It is a play. It goes like this: For \nlife is like cricket. We play by the rules. But the secret which few \npeople know that keeps men of class far apart from the fools is to make \nup the rules as you go.\n  That is what we are doing around here. We are making up the rules as \nwe go. You never know from one year to the next what the rules are \ngoing to be. The rules are only what the majority party deems the rules \nought to be at any given point in time. That is no way to run a \ndemocracy. It is no way to run a legislative chamber. It is no way to \nrun the Congress.\n  So we have this threat: If you raise a point of order--which should \nbe raised--that whole rule falls. I question whether the rule is even \nworth having any longer.\n  A couple of other notes.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me just note that upon the passage of \nthis supplemental appropriations bill, Congress will have provided over \n$318 billion for the war in Iraq--almost all of it through emergency \nsupplemental appropriations.\n  Now, again, we must support our troops. They have no control over how \ntheir operations and equipment are funded. So we want to support them. \nBut I have grave concerns about the way the Bush administration has \ngone about funding the war--only through emergency supplemental \nappropriations.\n  The war in Iraq has gone on for 3 years now. There have been eight \nseparate emergency supplemental appropriations measures to fund our \noperations in Iraq.\n  This is how an emergency is defined by our own budget rules: \n``Suddenly, quickly coming into being . . . not building over time . . \n. an urgent, pressing and compelling need requiring immediate action . \n. . unforeseen, unpredictable and unanticipated and not permanent.''\n  That is how our budget rules define ``emergency appropriations.'' \nThree years? War in Iraq? It is unforeseen, unpredictable, \nunanticipated, sudden? Wait a minute, this does not meet the definition \nof ``emergency.'' It is not unforeseen.\n  Why isn't the President sending us, then, a regular budget at the \nbeginning of the year to fund the war in Iraq and Afghanistan? Because \nthey do not want to admit how much money they are spending there. They \nwant to mask it.\n  I am going to support this bill. I will vote for it because it has \nsome things in it and because I want to make sure our troops have the \nequipment. But I want to go on record as saying I also have a \nresolution that I introduced in the Senate that says three things. It \nsays: No. 1, we will not establish permanent bases in Iraq; No. 2, we \nwill not seek to control the oil in Iraq; and, No. 3, that we ought to \nbegin redeploying our troops out of Iraq by the end of this year.\n  So this may be the last time I will vote for any appropriations for \nthe Iraq war, because I believe we should start withdrawing and \nredeploying our troops by the end of this year. I want to give them \neverything they need for their safety and their well-being, but enough \nis enough. And I also want to make it clear that this may be the last \ntime I will ever vote for an emergency supplemental appropriation for \nthe war in Iraq.\n  If it comes to the regular appropriations process, we will have our \nhearings. We will see what is happening. But under an emergency, we \ndon't do that. The war in Iraq, we were told by Mr. Wolfowitz before it \nstarted, would be paid for by oil; the cost to the American people \nwould be minimal. That is what Secretary Rumsfeld told us. We are up to \n$318 billion and counting. It is time that Secretary Rumsfeld and this \nadministration start making some tough decisions about what they can \ncut out of the Pentagon's bloated annual budget in order to fund the \nwar in Iraq.\n  Quite frankly, we know there is a lot of waste, fraud, and abuse \ngoing on in Iraq. It has to end. As long as we keep having emergency \nsupplemental appropriations, we will never eliminate the waste, fraud, \nand abuse.\n  We all strongly support our troops. I will vote for this bill because \nit contains funding for the troops, for avian flu, and other items, but \nit is time that the war in Iraq only comes through the regular \nappropriations process. It is time for us to start getting our troops \nout of there by the end of this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator allow me to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest for the purpose of getting time? I ask unanimous consent that \nupon all time being yielded back or all time being used relative to the \nsupplemental, that I be recognized for 15 minutes under morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, may I ask what the unanimous consent \nrequest was? I couldn't hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator requested 15 minutes as in morning \nbusiness at the conclusion of the debate on the supplemental.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the right, only if I could ask that the same 15 \nminutes be allotted to the ranking member of our Budget Committee, the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I withdraw my request, then. I find that to be a request \nthat has very little relevance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is not my intention to use all of the \ntime available to this side. I have had no requests for speaking time \nfor any Senator on our side on the conference report. So the \ndisagreement can be obviated very quickly with my assurance that I am \ngoing to speak for no more than 3 or 4 minutes, and then I was going to \nyield back all the time remaining under this conference report under my \ncontrol. I advised the Senator from New Hampshire of that. That is why \nhe made the request, because it was not going to infringe on anybody's \ntime, considering the order under which we are operating.\n  I will proceed to conclude the debate on the conference report and \nlet everybody work out their differences on who speaks next and for how \nlong.\n  I am pleased we were able to get a bipartisan agreement on this \nconference report. Senate conferees worked together, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to identify the priorities, to have suggestions fully \nconsidered and fairly considered. I am proud of the work product of our \nCommittee on Appropriations in the Senate. I am particularly grateful \nfor the support of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, who is \nthe ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations. He cooperated in \nevery respect in terms of scheduling hearings, working to make sure \nthat our\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\ncommittee had all the facts we needed to proceed to making a decision \non the President's request.\n  Our staff members are the very best. We are very fortunate in the \nSenate to have the benefit of the services of Keith Kennedy, who is \nstaff director of the Appropriations Committee, and his counterpart on \nthe other side, Terry Sauvain, is equally dutiful and dependable in his \nefforts on behalf of our committee. Chuck Keiffer managed much of the \nfloor activity and was at the markup session that we had that ran way \npast midnight the night we were completing action on this conference \nreport. He was very supportive of the efforts and the needs of our \ncommittee. Senator Ted Stevens, former chairman of the full committee, \nis chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. He and his \ncounterpart, Dan Inouye, are two of the finest Senators who have ever \nserved in the Senate. Their responsibility was to deal with the request \nrelating to defense issues. This was mainly a Defense appropriations \nrequest the President submitted for the war on terror. But there were \nother provisions as well related to that conflict and our effort to \ndefend our security interests. There were State Department accounts \ninvolved. We had the benefit at the hearings of the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of State, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, all talking about the needs for funding of our activities to \nprotect our country's security.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee that has responsibility for those \naccounts in the State Department and foreign operations is Mitch \nMcConnell, who is a distinguished Senator from Kentucky and our \nassistant leader. He turned in yeoman work, along with his counterpart \non the other side, Pat Leahy of Vermont. These are examples of how the \ncommittee came together, Republicans and Democrats, and made the \ndecisions that had to be made, negotiated hard and diligently with the \nHouse to work out differences between our two bills and considered \nevery request the administration made of the Congress for these \nappropriations.\n  I want to single out two other subcommittee staff members. All of the \nclerks worked hard because almost every subcommittee had a role to play \nin shaping the final outcome. But on the Defense Subcommittee, Sid \nAshworth, who is the clerk, Charlie Houy, who is the Democratic \ncounterpart on that committee, are so dependable and so experienced and \ndedicated to their jobs, it reflects great credit on the Senate for \npeople such as those I have mentioned today who worked so hard on this \nconference report. I am delighted to be associated with them and \nhonored to chair the committee. They make my job so much more easy than \ncould possibly be imagined because of their skill and their \nprofessionalism and the hard work they turned in to achieve the result \nwe did, not just to pass this bill but to serve the interests of our \ncountry.\n  I am happy to recommend this conference report to the Senate. I yield \nback the remainder of the time available under the order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5837-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5837-S5866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There was some \nindication that he would be willing to accept a proposal I had to make \na slight modification, in which case I would hope we could proceed to \neither an acceptance by voice vote or schedule a vote at a time so \ndesired by the leadership of the Senate.\n  I assume at some point in time I will be able to obtain information \non that point. Absent that, I see my distinguished colleague, the \nSenator from Michigan. I was advising the Senate that the pending \namendment is the Lautenberg amendment. On another committee where we \nwere together in a markup session, there was some indication that he \nwould be amenable to a modest modification to bring his amendment in \nparallel with what the committee had done. That is the pending \nbusiness. We then turn to an amendment by the Senator from Virginia \nwhich I would like to discuss with my senior colleague in a minute or \ntwo before we turn to that. Unless there is a matter to address the \nSenate on, I would suggest we place a quorum call in for a few minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I may ask the Senator from Virginia, did the Senator \nfrom New Jersey want to debate his amendment further?\n  Mr. WARNER. I was not able, in a busy markup session, to ascertain \nthat.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Maybe we could ascertain that. He is on his way to the \nfloor. I know he was willing to make the modification. It is helpful to \nput the date of his amendment in line with our bill, the fiscal year, \nas I understand it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nLautenberg-Stabenow amendment. I understand Senator Levin has offered \nit and Senator Lautenberg will be coming shortly to speak on our \namendment.\n  This is an incredibly important amendment for the men and women who \nare currently serving us so bravely, courageously around the world. We \nall know that prescription drug costs are one of the largest drivers of \nhealth care costs, rising every year at double or even triple the rate \nof inflation. This is certainly an area where I have been focused for \nmuch of my Senate career--on the high cost of prescription drugs. We \nall know that is the case.\n  Like every manufacturer, small business, and State Medicaid Program, \nthe military is facing the same challenges of controlling prescription \ndrug prices. Instead of supporting policies that would lower \nprescription drug prices, such as reimportation of prescription drugs \nfrom other countries like Canada, which is very close to Michigan, or \nfocusing on more generic, lower cost drugs that can be brought to the \nmarket and create competition to bring down prices, or allowing \nMedicare to negotiate pricing, unfortunately, this administration wants \nto put the costs on the backs of our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies. I strongly oppose that policy.\n  The President's budget proposed increasing the prescription drug \ncopays for our troops and their families, almost doubling copays for \nboth generic and brand-name drugs.\n  The proposed pharmacy copay increases represent a 70-percent increase \nfor military beneficiaries over the next 5 years--far in excess of the \n24-percent increase in military pay, or the 14-percent increase in \nretiree pay over the same period. These increased copays will affect \nActive-Duty members of the Armed Forces and their families, members of \nthe Guard and Reserve and their families, and retired members of the \nArmed Forces and their families, as well as surviving spouses who are \nenrolled in TRICARE and get their prescription drugs from retail \npharmacies.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate Defense authorization bill only rejects the \nincreases if people use mail order pharmacies for their prescriptions. \nWhile\n\n[[Page S5838]]\n\nmail order may work for some, many military families cannot wait 2 \nweeks or more to get the medicine they need right now. The vast \nmajority of our military families purchase their drugs at pharmacies. \nOf all TRICARE prescriptions filled, about 43 percent are through \nretail, going to local pharmacists, 51 percent are through military \npharmacies, and only 6 percent are through mail order.\n  Unfortunately, in Michigan, there are no military pharmacies for the \n64,000 military men and women and their families who call Michigan \nhome. So this will impact the families in Michigan who are serving us \nabroad--the troops as well as their families.\n  Are we going to tell an Active-Duty mother to wait 2 weeks to get the \nantibiotics that her children need? Are we going to say to our troops \nthat their family should have to pay more for prescriptions while they \nare serving and protecting us in Iraq?\n  The Lautenberg-Stabenow amendment makes sense. It would temporarily \nfreeze retail copays at their current rate through the end of next \nyear. I understand there has been a request from the chairman of the \nCommittee on Armed Services to change that to the end of the fiscal \nyear. I don't object to that. The amendment is consistent with the \ncommittee's findings that military beneficiaries should be held \nharmless from TRICARE fee increases until Congress is satisfied that \nthe Defense Department has done all it can to constrain health care \ncosts, without shifting the costs to our military families.\n  Clearly, Madam President, we have not done all we can to cut health \ncare costs, and we ought not to be shifting this burden to our military \nfamilies. If we don't pass this important amendment, our soldiers and \ntheir families will be asked to pay an additional $200 million next \nyear for their medicine.\n  I was fortunate enough to spend Memorial Day with our troops in Iraq \nand saw firsthand, as so many of my colleagues have, their dedication \nand courage under incredibly difficult circumstances. We have an \nobligation to support these men and women, and that means not raising \ntheir prescription drug copays while they are fighting to protect us.\n  I hope the Senate will unanimously support this effort that would \nstop the doubling of copays for our military families for their \nmedicine. I am hopeful that we will be able to do that as soon as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I will give a little background, if I \ncould, about this subject matter and area of inquiry.\n  The Department of Defense initiated early on this year, and part of \nlast year, a fairly dramatic increase in TRICARE premiums for military \nretirees and family members. The TRICARE program is, I think our \nmembership knows, a military health care system for Active-Duty people \nand also for those who are retired, up to age 65. This is a provision \nfor those 65 who can continue during Medicare eligibility.\n  The health care part of the military budget is just growing leaps and \nbounds. Our chairman is sort of the champion of the TRICARE program, \nand it has been a wonderful program for military members and their \nfamilies and retirees. But in 2015, it is going to be 12 percent, if \nnothing changes in the entire military budget. It is on an \nunsustainable course. We have not had a premium increase since \nTRICARE's inception.\n  I will take a back seat to no one in wanting to help the troops, but \nthe best thing we can do is create a benefit that is sustainable and \nnot have to pick between health care benefits and armament and new \nweapons and all of the operational needs of the military, which are \ngoing to be eventually squeezed. In committee, Senator Nelson and \nmyself, along with the chairman and ranking member, said to the \nDepartment of Defense: Stop, don't pass go, no fee increases.\n  We are going to have the GAO and other groups look at ways to save \nmoney before you have to ask for fee increases. And, secondly, give us \nsome idea if the Department of Defense numbers are accurate. Are they \naccurate in terms of the growth explosion in the cost of this program? \nSo we are going to get information to make a good decision and \nbasically put a hold on the fee increases for participation of TRICARE.\n  That got us into the area of prescription drugs. One of the things \nthat we have done for military members, and retirees in particular, is \nwe have made prescription drugs very affordable and reasonably priced. \nWhat we are trying to do to save money is to allow an increase in \nretail prescription drug costs, which have again been static since the \ninception of the program, from $3 to $5 for a 30-day prescription for \ngeneric drugs, from $9 to $15 for a 30-day prescription of brand drugs. \nTo counter that, we were going to have a zero copayment for those who \nchose to get their prescriptions filled through the mail. If you had a \nmaintenance prescription, a drug need that would be recurring, and you \nused the mail system, there would be no copay at all.\n  What we are trying to do there is get people into purchasing drugs in \na way that is cost effective for the military and have some cost \nincrease to keep the program sustainable. That is what this debate is \nabout.\n  I appreciate the chairman, who has been a great leader in this, \nworking with Senator Lautenberg to try to find a way to get us past \n2007.\n  I will end on this note. This problem is going to get worse. Over \ntime, the military health care footprint within the Department of \nDefense budget is on an unsustainable course. TRICARE is a great \nprogram, but we are going to have to look at ways to make it more \nefficient, look at cost savings and, eventually, we are going to have \nto go back to the military community and ask for some increased \nparticipation to make this sustainable for the next generation of \nmilitary retirees and their families. If we don't, we are going to be \nin a dilemma we would not want to be in as a nation, having to pick \nbetween operational needs and health care needs.\n  As a member of the Guard and Reserve--and I have done some time on \nactive duty--I want to be as generous and as fair with the benefit \npackage as the country can afford, but no benefit can be locked in time \nwithout some reevaluation and adjustment. After 2007 passes, we are \ngoing to have to start making hard choices. I promise all the Members \nof this body and those who may be listening to the military community \nthat we are going to do it in a way that is acceptable, humane, \nrational, and not ask more than people can bear. The idea of trying to \nhave a zero copayment if you would get your prescriptions filled \nthrough the mail is a great idea. It will be good for the military \nmembers participating in the prescription drug program, and I am \nconvinced--and we will see after this year--that it will save a lot of \nmoney, specifically for those drugs recurring in need.\n  The increases on the generic and brand names through the retail \nsystem are appropriate, and we will revisit that issue after this year.\n  I just want the Members of the body to know that if we don't get \nahead of the growth of TRICARE and try to implement changes in a \nsystematic, incremental way, we are going to wind up one day where this \nbody in the next decade is going to have to make some draconian \nchoices. The way to prevent making draconian choices is to phase in \nchanges that the force can accommodate and that will relieve the \npressure on TRICARE. It is a wonderful program, and it needs to be on a \nsustainable footing. Right now it is on an unsustainable path. We will \nfind out more information about how to reform it at the end of this \nyear.\n  Madam President, I say to the chairman of the committee, I appreciate \nall the effort he has given to create TRICARE. He worked in a \nbipartisan manner to create a health care program that has been very \nvaluable to the men and women in the military, their families, and \nparticularly retirees. This program, like every other program at the \nFederal level, is going to have to be looked at anew in terms of \nsustainability. I look forward to working with the chairman and others \nto make it sustainable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague. For \nyears, Senator Graham has been on the Armed Services Committee and has\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\nreally specialized in health issues and other issues relating to the \nwelfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. I, \nlike him, share concerns about the rising costs of these programs. How \nwell he and I understand that there is only so much money allocated \nunder the process of our budget to the men and women in the Armed \nForces. They need equipment. They need training. They need housing. \nThey need medical care. If we constantly begin to chip away, it ends up \nthose moneys are withdrawn from the modernization account.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, if I may add, the projections are that \nthe military health care program will be $65 billion in costs by 2015, \n12 percent of the DOD's budget. We will be getting a real hard look to \nsee if those moneys are accurate and ways to save money. Madam \nPresident, 2007 will be a year in which we look at the true cost \ncomponent of TRICARE projected out in the future and try to think of \nways to make it sustainable, because if the projections are anywhere \nnear accurate, this program becomes unsustainable over time. It is \nworth saving, and I think anyone in the military would want it to be \nsaved. We are just going to have to be honest with them about the cost. \nThey cannot be locked in time forever.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4205, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment be the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I send a modification to the \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking consent to modify the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4205), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 707. TEMPORARY PROHIBITION ON INCREASE IN COPAYMENTS \n                   UNDER RETAIL PHARMACY SYSTEM OF PHARMACY \n                   BENEFITS PROGRAM.\n\n       Subsection (a)(6) of section 1074g of title 10, United \n     States Code, as amended by section 702(b) of this Act, is \n     further amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(D) During the period beginning on October 1, 2006, and \n     ending on September 31, 2007, the cost sharing requirements \n     established under this paragraph for pharmaceutical agents \n     available through retail pharmacies covered by paragraph \n     (2)(E)(ii) may not exceed amounts as follows:\n       ``(i) In the case of generic agents, $3.\n       ``(ii) In the case of formulary agents, $9.\n       ``(iii) In the case of nonformulary agents, $22.''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I wish to now discuss my amendment, \nwhich is fair and simple. It prohibits increases in the pharmacy \ncopayments of our military families and military retirees they purchase \nat retail pharmacies.\n  These families are part of the military's health insurance program \ncalled TRICARE.\n  The price of everything going up so rapidly now hardly seems the time \nto ask the people who have sacrificed for our country--many who have \nbeen in harms way--to pay more for their prescription drugs. It is \nincomprehensible.\n  My amendment, cosponsored by Senators Stabenow, Bingaman, Harkin, \nLincoln, Menendez, Mikulski, Landrieu, Lieberman, Kerry, and Murray, is \nvery simply a prohibition on increasing, at this point in time, the \ncopayments that veterans and active duty families have to pay for \nprescription drugs.\n  The amendment is very simple. It says no, n-o, at increase on \npharmacy copays through the end of fiscal year 2007.\n  We ask military our families to make enormous sacrifices for our \ncountry, and now we want to saddle them with higher health care costs? \nIt doesn't make sense. The administration is proposing to increase the \ncost of TRICARE prescription drug copayments from $9 to $15 for brand-\nname drugs. This is, indeed, a hardship. It means that over a 5-year \nperiod, prescription drug prices will rise by 70 percent for military \nfamilies--far outstripping the 24-percent increase in military pay or \nthe 14-percent increase in retirement pay over the same period. If we \ndon't stop this increase we will have taken away those increases that \nthey worked so hard to get.\n  If you can go to a military base to purchase your prescriptions you \ndon't need to pay a copayment, but in the real world that is always not \npossible. Too many veterans and military families don't live on or near \na base, particularly when it comes to the National Guard and Reserve.\n  In New Jersey, for instance, there are seven military installations, \nbut only three have pharmacies and none of these facilities are in the \nnorthern part of the State. Driving long distances, especially with gas \ncosting $3 a gallon or more, is not the solution.\n  Families and veterans have the option of getting prescription drugs \nat no cost by mail order. But many times people can't wait for a week \nor two to fill a prescription. If you have a sick child at home who \nneeds an antibiotic right away, who will wait for mail delivery. Also, \nmany people, especially older veterans, prefer to get their \nprescription drugs from the local pharmacy where they can also get \nconsultations with pharmacists and other services. TRICARE \nbeneficiaries deserve the ability to choose where they want to go to \nget their prescriptions.\n  Retail pharmacies account for about 43 percent of the prescription \ndrugs purchased through TRICARE. One large pharmacy chain estimated \nthat it fills more than 7 million TRICARE prescriptions every year. \nClose to 9 million individuals are enrolled in the TRICARE program. The \nincreases proposed by the administration would affect a large number of \nmilitary families and veterans.\n  We know how the Guard and Reserves have been disproportionately \naffected by deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. To raise their health \ncare costs, I think that is unconscionable.\n  John F. Kennedy said:\n\n       To govern is to choose.\n\n  Last Thursday, all but two Republican Senators voted to repeal the \ninheritance tax permanently, a move that would cost $989 billion over \n10 years. Remember that fewer than one-half of 1 percent of all estates \nincur tax liability. We are talking about a tax break for the \nwealthiest Americans, the very people presumably who benefit the most \nfrom the freedom that our men and women in uniform protect. Now we are \nbeing told that we cannot afford to freeze these copayments that these \nmen and women have to make and their families have to pay for the \nmedicines they need. It is really unbelievable.\n  CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says my amendment will cost \n$290 million in fiscal year 2007.\n  In good conscience can we repeal the inheritance tax on the super-\nrich while imposing a pharmacy tax on our men and women in uniform, our \nveterans, and their families.\n  American's appreciate so much the sacrifices asked of our Nation's \nmilitary families and veterans. I'm certain they would be willing to \ncover the cost of my amendment.\n  This amendment freezes pharmacy copayments at their current levels. \nIt will send a message to our military men and women. It will tell them \nthat just as they protected us, we are concerned about them and their \nfamilies. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to advise the Senator that we \nhave carefully examined the amendment and we are prepared to accept it \non this side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I appreciate that and am pleased \nthat we are going to make a statement here that we don't want those \npeople who are on TRICARE, to have to pay more at this time. It just \nwould be the wrong thing to do.\n  I am not surprised that the Senator from Virginia, with a sound \nmilitary record and having been involved in Government for many years \nin terms of military affairs, stands up and delivers that agreement. I \nthank him very much, and I thank my colleague from Michigan also, for \nthe opportunity to introduce this amendment. Without further ado, I \nassume that it will now be accepted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, for those following the debate, I \ncertainly would acknowledge that the Senator\n\n[[Page S5840]]\n\nfrom New Jersey had a distinguished record in World War II in the U.S. \nArmy in Europe and understands very well, through firsthand experience, \nthe hardships faced by those particularly in the enlisted ranks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First let me commend the Senator from New Jersey for his \nleadership in this matter and for his identifying a real problem which \nneeds to be corrected. It would be, it seems to me, unconscionable for \nus to be increasing these copays in the middle of a conflict. For the \nmen and women in the military and their families to face additional \ncopays at this point is very, very inadvisable. I thank Senator \nLautenberg of New Jersey for identifying this problem, and to all of \nhis cosponsors, the same thank you and gratitude is owing. I very much \nsupport the amendment, and I hope it will be promptly adopted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4205), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4211\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I believe we now return to amendment No. \n4211.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \ndistinguished President pro tempore of the Senate, Senator Stevens, be \nmade a cosponsor, and the distinguished ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, be made a \ncosponsor of amendment No. 4211.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we are going to accept this amendment by \nvoice vote. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4211) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to speak on this amendment \nthat will direct the first ship of the Navy's future class of air \ncarriers, heretofore known as CVN-78, shall be named the USS Gerald \nFord, in honor of our great statesman and leader, whose distinguished \ncareer of service to our Nation has spanned more than six decades. I \ncan think of no finer tribute to our Nation's 38th President and indeed \nto the United States Navy than to add his name to a warship.\n  Gerald Ford joined the Navy in February of 1942, along with millions \nand millions of other Americans who responded to the call following \nPearl Harbor. It was just weeks after Pearl Harbor that he volunteered, \nin those first dark hours of the United States' entry into World War \nII. Leaving behind a family and a profession to serve in a distant \ncorner of the globe, he exemplified his generation often referred to as \nthe greatest generation and truly all generations of young Americans \nwho have sacrificed to defend our freedom--be it freedom from tyranny \nor freedom from terror.\n  As a young lieutenant, Gerald Ford came within inches of being swept \noverboard while selflessly performing his duties in the raging storm \nthat battered Admiral ``Bull'' Halsey's fleet during action in the \nPhilippine Sea. He was aboard a small aircraft carrier at that time. It \nwas the USS Monterey, CVL-26. That ship, the Monterey, earned 10 battle \nstars for her role at Makin Island, Kwajalein, Truk, Saipan, the \nPhilippines, and other major engagements in the Pacific theater. \nLieutenant Ford had volunteered for that service aboard that ship and \nsailed in harm's way with many others. This memorable footnote in \nhistory of that one action where he selflessly performed lifesaving \nduties aboard his ship would instill in the future President a lifelong \nrespect and appreciation for the hardships and dangers that surround \nour brave men and women in uniform. His military experience proved \ninvaluable to his service as commander in chief and President of the \nUnited States.\n  Following World War II, Gerald Ford again answered duty's call, \ngaining election in 1948 to the House of Representatives where he would \nultimately serve our Nation for a quarter of a century. During those \ntumultuous years in our history, as Congress acted on grave and often \ndivisive issues surrounding the Cold War, nuclear weapons policy, war \nin Korea and Vietnam, the assassination of a beloved President, the \ncivil rights movement, and the resignation of a Vice President of the \nUnited States, Congressman Ford distinguished himself by his calm, \nsteady guidance, his plain-spoken wisdom, his extraordinary character, \nand his openness. He was respected by all for his decency.\n  These qualities propelled Gerald Ford to the forefront of his party. \nFrom 1965 to 1973, as minority leader of the House of Representatives, \nhe was a unifying force in the Congress, serving not merely his party \nand constituency, but reaching across the aisle to find common ground \nand resolve for the greatest issues of the day.\n  The history of the ensuing years is well known as a turning point in \nour modern history as a Nation, when the great system of checks and \nbalances forged into our Government framework by the Founding Fathers \nmet one of its greatest challenges. There was neither past precedent \nnor a clear path forward for the change of power that would take place. \nThere was only certainty that the man who was to ultimately assume the \nresponsibility of the office of the President of the United States must \nbe a leader of uncommon integrity, one who would reach ably across the \naisle as a leader of all the people, and one whose credibility at home \nand abroad would be a unifying force--a foundation for the future.\n  In that hour of crisis, when public confidence in the Office of the \nPresident had ebbed, and the division between the executive office and \nthe Congress had widened to its greatest extent in a century, our \nNation placed its hope and trust in Gerald Ford to restore the faith of \nthe people of the United States in the Office of the President of the \nUnited States and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.\n  President Gerald R. Ford brought closure to the crisis with \ncharacteristic straight talk at his inauguration in August of 1974, \nwhen he humbly declared to the American people that: ``Our long \nnational nightmare is over. Our Constitution works.'' With those words, \nour Nation moved forward under his leadership.\n  During his administration, President Ford's policies at home pursued \nthe path of healing and rebuilding--addressing the wounds of Watergate \nand the end of the war in Vietnam. He halted the postwar decline of our \nArmed Forces and set an early course for our Nation's defense posture, \nwhich proved a well-placed step toward ending the Cold War.\n  Abroad, President Ford worked to achieve peace in the Middle East, to \npreserve detente with the Soviet Union, and to limit the spread of \nnuclear weapons. Furthermore, with a clear vision towards a prevailing \nfreedom in Eastern Europe, President Ford advanced the cause of human \nrights and perhaps charted a way and new course for these people long \noppressed under the Soviet regime with the signing of the final act of \nthe conference on security and cooperation in Europe, commonly known as \nthe Helsinki Agreement.\n  In the three decades since departing the White House, President Ford \nhas continued his relentless pursuit of the ideals which mark America's \ngreatness. To this day, Gerald Ford remains an international ambassador \nof American goodwill, a champion for higher education, a strong \nsupporter of human rights, an ardent proponent of strong national \ndefense and international leadership by the United States, and a \ntrusted adviser to the succession of Presidents who have built upon his \nfoundation.\n\n[[Page S5841]]\n\n  I believe my colleagues will agree that it is entirely fitting that \nCVN-78 be named for a former carrier sailor, the USS Gerald Ford.\n  I acknowledge the help and guidance and assistance of many in \nbringing up this amendment, notably among them John March, a friend of \nmine and an acquaintance, a fellow public servant. We both came out of \nWorld War II and met at Washington and Lee University. He went on to \nbecome a distinguished Member of the House of Representatives, serving \nthere for 14 years. Then he was counsel to President Ford at the time \nof these difficult decisions that I have referred to. He then served as \nArmy Secretary, and I think to date he is the longest serving Army \nSecretary in the history of our country.\n  Likewise, a wonderful man, former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird. \nHe was Secretary when I was privileged to serve under him as Under \nSecretary and Secretary of the Navy, again a lifelong friend and \nadmirer of Gerald Ford. Also, the Ford Foundation members, and so many \nothers. I spoke with Vice President Dick Cheney yesterday. Indeed, he \nwas Chief of Staff to President Ford in his years of the Presidency, \nand Don Rumsfeld also served and was appointed by President Ford as \nSecretary of Defense when he first served with great distinction.\n  So I introduce this amendment, now acted upon by the Senate, with the \ndeepest sense of humility and gratitude to this fine man who touched my \nlife, who helped form my career, who held a Bible on the steps of the \nSenate with me when I was sworn in as head of the Nation's \nbicentennial, having then just stepped down as Secretary of the Navy; \nagain served under President Ford in that capacity, to take on the \ndirection of that brief chapter of America's history where our country, \ntogether with 22 other nations, recognized the magnificent achievement \nof our great framework of Government beginning in 1776.\n  So I do so, and I am very heartened that I am joined by the \ndistinguished President pro tempore of the Senate, Senator Stevens, who \nhas been a lifelong friend. It is not entirely coincidental that I am \njoined by my distinguished colleague, friend, and coworker here in the \nvenue of the Armed Services Committee for these 28 years that we have \nserved together, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, from whence \nGerald Ford came to serve his country as Congressman and Vice \nPresident.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the timeline of \nPresident Gerald R. Ford's life and career be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Timeline of President Gerald R.

Madam President, first let me thank the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee for his wisdom in identifying an appropriate \nway--one of the many, but very appropriate ways--we can honor President \nFord. Jerry Ford is a dear friend to Members of Congress and probably \nthousands of others. Regardless of party, he was someone who knew how \nto reach across the aisle. It was a matter of pride for him to reach \nDemocrats as well as Republicans, to pull together in common causes.\n  We are particularly proud of Jerry Ford in Michigan. He is a proud \nson of Michigan. He went to the University of Michigan. He represented \na district in west Michigan for a long period of time in the Congress. \nHis Presidential library and his Presidential museum are both in \nMichigan, and they are the objects of a great deal of reverence, not \njust for the people of Michigan but for people who visit Michigan as \nwell.\n  He came to be President at a time when we needed a healer, when we \nneeded someone who would unify this Nation in a time of great turmoil.\n  We were in the middle of the Watergate crisis and the Watergate \ncrimes. It was fortuitus that it would be Jerry Ford who would become \nPresident when President Nixon resigned.\n  Senator Warner has read from one line of Jerry Ford's remarks on \ntaking the oath of office as President. I thought I would close by \nreading a few other lines because he captured the sentiment and the \nfeel of our Nation at a very critical moment in our history. Jerry Ford \nstarted his remarks on taking his oath in August of 1974 by saying:\n\n       The oath that I have taken is the same oath that was taken \n     by George Washington and by every President under the \n     Constitution. But I assume the Presidency under extraordinary \n     circumstances never before experienced by Americans. This is \n     an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our \n     hearts.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I have not sought this enormous responsibility, but I will \n     not shirk it. . . . It is only fitting then that I should \n     pledge to [all of the people] that I will be the President of \n     all of the people.\n\n  A little later in his remarks, in addressing the people of other \nnations, he said:\n\n       I pledge an uninterrupted and sincere search for peace. \n     America will remain strong and united, but its strength will \n     remain dedicated to the safety and sanity of the entire \n     family of man, as well as to our own precious freedom.\n\n  And then he said:\n\n       I believe that truth is the glue that holds government \n     together, not only our Government but civilization itself. \n     That bond, though strained, is unbroken at home and abroad. \n     In all my public and private acts as your President, I expect \n     to follow my instincts of openness and candor with full \n     confidence that honesty is always the best policy in the end.\n\n  And then he added, as Senator Warner has quoted:\n\n       My fellow Americans, our long, national nightmare is over.\n\n  The only other line I would choose to quote from his remarks is the \nfollowing. It speaks so much of Jerry Ford and what he stood for and \nthe reason he is held in such affection and esteem by all of our \npeople, particularly by the people of Michigan.\n\n       As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more \n     painful and poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us \n     restore the golden rule to our political process, and let \n     brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate.\n\n  So spoke Jerry Ford, and that is the way he lived his life.\n\n[[Page S5845]]\n\n  I am delighted that Senator Warner has taken the lead, as he has, to \nso identify this new class of nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. I thank \nhim again for his graciousness, his sensitivity, and his wisdom in \nidentifying this specific class of aircraft carriers to be named after \na truly great man and wonderful son of Michigan, Jerry Ford.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my dear friend, Senator Levin. I \nam deeply moved by this occasion, as you can tell. This is my last \nopportunity as chairman of the committee to present a bill to the \nCongress, and to have this amendment a part of the bill is very \nspecial, and to be joined by the distinguished Senator from Michigan to \nshare in the honors of putting this to the Senate. You and I earlier \ndiscussed the traditions of naming ships. I draw on my knowledge as \nformer Secretary of the Navy that it more often originates in the \nexecutive branch, for which I have the greatest respect. But somehow I \nfelt it appropriate, since President Ford is a truly remembered part of \nthe legislature of America, the legislative branch, having served so \nlong there, that the naming of this ship have its origin here in the \nCongress which he so dearly loved. So we have joined together for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And as Vice President, we will also claim him as a Member \nof the Senate as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. Oh, yes, once upon a time he occupied that chair, I say, \nwith respect to the Presiding Officer, the President of the Senate, the \none and only function and duty enumerated in the Constitution of the \nVice President.\n  Madam President, I invite any other Senators who so wish to be added \nas cosponsors. I have asked unanimous consent that their names be added \nas they indicate to the Chair, the Presiding Officer, their desire and \nthat be kept open until the hour of, say, 5 o'clock tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I think we are concluded on the \namendments. We are proceeding in an orderly fashion. The amendment \npending is that of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin; am I correct, \nor has that been put forward yet?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if we could inquire of the Chair whether the \nDurbin amendment has been offered. I don't believe it has yet. We \nagreed yesterday it would be next in line; however, there is an effort \nbeing made to work out the Durbin amendment, and I suggest Senator \nDorgan be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Durbin amendment has not been entered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We asked Senator Dorgan to come over and take over that \nspot.\n  Mr. WARNER. We ask that following that, we try to alternate \namendments. The next amendment would come from our side, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Pennsylvania be recognized for \npurposes of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I wonder if we could keep \nSenator Durbin in line after Senator Santorum, subject to the work \nbeing completed on his amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Sure, the amendment would come next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me thank Senators Warner and Levin for their \nleadership on this legislation. This is a very difficult task, to put \ntogether the authorization for military expenditures and military \noperations.\n  I want to especially say I just walked in while they were talking \nabout naming an aircraft carrier after former President Gerald Ford. \nThat is a wonderful thing to have done. Gerald Ford gave great service \nto his country in the Congress, as Vice President, and as President of \nour country. I join them in acknowledging the significant achievements \nof President Ford and what he accomplished not only for himself but for \nthis country as well. It is a great way to honor him, by naming an \naircraft carrier for him.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4230\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration. This amendment is sent to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Bingaman, Boxer, Dayton, Feingold, \nJohnson, Kerry, Kohl, Lautenberg, Leahy, Mikulski, Nelson of Florida, \nPryor, Reid of Nevada, Harkin, and Wyden. I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Johnson, \n     Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, \n     Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reid, Mr. Harkin, and \n     Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 4230.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator allow me a brief unanimous consent \nrequest? The distinguished Senator from Michigan and I wish to alert \nthe Senate that following Mr. Dorgan's amendment comes the amendment of \nMr. Santorum and then Mr. Durbin. So the order of amendments is Dorgan, \nSantorum, then we come back to Senator Durbin, and then I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator McCain be recognized for the purpose of offering \nan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I advise the Senate we are, as we say in the Navy, well \nunderway on this bill. The Senator from Michigan and I are anxious to \nlearn from Senators their desire to have amendments. We will do the \nbest we can to accommodate them because it appears now we will be able \nto remain in session somewhat longer this evening than originally \nanticipated due to the cancellation, I understand, of the White House \npicnic. I will consult with the leadership. It is my hope we can work \non into the early evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This amendment is a rather comprehensive amendment. I \noffer it on behalf of a good many of our colleagues.\n  I wish to describe why I offer this amendment. As I do that, I wish \nto acknowledge the outstanding work done by my colleagues, Senator \nWarner and Senator Levin, in dealing with all of these issues. There is \nan area, however--given what has happened with respect to wartime \nexpenditures in the military and also contracting outside of the \nmilitary in the issue of reconstruction spending in the country of \nIraq--there is an issue which I believe is of great seriousness. I \nthink we have had some of the most significant waste, fraud, and abuse \nin the history of this country just in recent years, with a massive \namount of money that is pushed out of this Congress, pushed out of the \nadministration into the hands of contractors, into the hands of \nsubcontractors, and then subcontractors, and subcontractors from them \nin the country of Iraq. There is a massive amount of waste, fraud, and \nabuse. The fact is, we are not dealing with it the way we should.\n  I want to show a picture. This picture shows a fellow standing here \nwhom I have actually met. This is a picture that was taken in the \ncountry of Iraq. These are one-hundred-dollar bills, wrapped in Saran \nwrap. This is $2 million. These one-hundred-dollar bills were wrapped \nin Saran wrap to be the size of a small football. This fellow, by the \nway, said they actually threw some of these around as a football there \nin this office.\n  What they were doing here as they took this picture, they were \npreparing to pay a contractor in Iraq named Custer Battles, named after \ntwo men, Mr. Custer and Mr. Battles. Why were they paying in cash? \nBecause, according to this fellow, the word was: You bring a bag, we \npay in cash. He said it was like the Wild West. So here is a couple of \nmillion dollars. This was going to go to Custer Battles. Let me just \ntell the story of Custer Battles. I will abbreviate it, but the story \nis these two guys show up in Iraq. They don't have a great deal of \nexperience, have very little money, but they decide they are going to \nbe a company now. They are going to be a company in Iraq, and they are \ngoing to provide security. They start bidding on security contracts. \nAll of a sudden, they are given\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\na contract to provide security at the Baghdad airport. The money starts \nrolling in. It turns out, before this is all over with, from what I \nhave learned, Custer Battles Company got more than $100 million in \ncontract money for various things. This is just a part of the payment--\nin cash.\n  They have been charged with criminal behavior and fraud and other \nthings. The allegations were that they took the forklift trucks off the \nBaghdad airport, put them in a warehouse, repainted them blue, and then \nsold them back to the Coalition Provisional Authority which was then \nrunning Iraq, which, of course, was us because the CPA was created by a \ndocument signed by the Secretary of Defense. So this company allegedly \ntook the forklift trucks that existed at the Baghdad airport, for which \nthey were providing security, put them in a warehouse someplace, \nrepainted them, and then sold them back to the CPA. They also then \ncreated offshore subsidiaries in Lebanon and elsewhere to run money \nthrough and beyond.\n  We had a hearing on this subject. Here is what the director of \nsecurity at the Baghdad airports said in a memo to the Coalition \nProvisional Authority that hired Custer Battles:\n\n       Custer Battles have shown themselves to be unresponsive, \n     uncooperative, incompetent, deceitful, manipulative and war \n     profiteers. Other than that, they are swell fellows.\n\n  That is a direct quote, yes. Let me read it again.\n\n       Custer Battles have shown themselves to be unresponsive, \n     uncooperative, incompetent, deceitful, manipulative and war \n     profiteers. Other than that, they are swell fellows.\n\n  Why do I raise this issue? It has been on ``60 Minutes.'' We have had \na hearing about it. It is an example of what has been happening in \ncontracting, particularly in Iraq.\n  Let me just say that the minute you talk about contracting in Iraq, \nyou have to talk about Halliburton. The minute you talk about \nHalliburton, there will be those who will say: Aha, you are trying to \ntalk about Vice President Cheney, aren't you? No, not true. Vice \nPresident Cheney is long gone from Halliburton. This is all about \nHalliburton in Iraq. It has nothing to do with Vice President Cheney.\n  I want to go through some stories because they are very important.\n  There is a woman who was the top civilian contracting official at the \nCorps of Engineers over at the Pentagon. Her name is Bunnatine \nGreenhouse. Some have written about Bunnatine. She received a top \nevaluation over two decades from her superiors as one of the top \nprocurement people in this country. She knew the law. She knew the \nprocedure. She had worked over two decades and had always received top \nrecommendations from her superiors. She was tough as nails and \ndedicated to safeguarding the taxpayers' money.\n  Then the Pentagon decided to award a very large no-bid, sole-source \ncontract to a Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & Root, something \ncalled ``Restore Iraqi Oil,'' or the RIO contract, which a number of my \ncolleagues are familiar with.\n  Mrs. Greenhouse protested that the way this was done was in violation \nof proper contracting procedures. She later found that Halliburton was \nfound by auditors to have overcharged $61 million on a piece of the \ncontract for fuel delivery, and instead of taking the company to task \nfor Defense Department auditors finding $61 million in overcharges, the \ntop leadership of the Corps of Engineers rushed to Halliburton's \nassistance and provided the company with a waiver for the overcharges, \na waiver of normal cost reporting rules, concluding that the prices \nwere fair and reasonable. That waiver was provided without the approval \nof the top contracting official who was required to have signed it.\n  They kept the top contracting official, Mrs. Greenhouse, in the dark, \nand did so deliberately. She learned about the waiver when she read \nabout it in the newspaper. When she spoke up, she was bypassed, \nignored, and then ultimately forced to resign or be demoted.\n  This is what she told us. This relates to meetings that were held in \nthe Pentagon prior to bidding. Halliburton was present in the meeting. \nShe complained about the meetings being in violation by the way of the \nrules. Here is what Bunny Greenhouse said:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse relating to \n     contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and \n     improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of \n     my professional career.\n\n  This from the top civilian contracting official in the Corps of \nEngineers.\n  Does anybody care about this?\n  This woman, by all accounts, was judged to be at the top of her \nprofession, with outstanding reviews always, until she blew the whistle \non what she believed were abuses in contracting. When she blew the \nwhistle, then things started to change very, very quickly.\n  She was demoted for having the courage to tell the truth. When she \nspoke out, they decided that they would replace Mrs. Greenhouse with a \ndifferent Pentagon official. That different Pentagon official is now in \nthis job. That person has over 40 years of Government service, but has \nnone of that service related to procurement. So that person was \nselected to take this job knowing nothing about the job. They now have \nthat person in training, going to school and training.\n  We have had plenty of examples of cronies. I believe seven of the top \njobs in FEMA were filled not with people who knew anything about \ndisasters but with cronies, people who needed a job. Stick them at \nFEMA. And then a hurricane hits and we have an agency that does not \nknow what it is doing because you have a bunch of cronies involved in \nthat agency.\n  Now we have a woman who was the top procurement official who blew the \nwhistle on improper contracting, on both the Pentagon and also the \ncompany, and for that she was demoted and replaced by someone who is \nnot certified as an acquisition professional and doesn't have the \nability. She is now, according to General Strock, ``being brought up to \nspeed on what it is she needs to know as a contracting official.''\n  That is absurd.\n  Let me describe some of the firsthand eyewitness issues in Iraq.\n  Brand new $85,000 trucks that were left on the side of the road \nbecause of a flat tire and then subsequently burned; 25 tons, 50,000 \npounds, of nails ordered by Kellogg, Brown & Root, the wrong size, that \nare laying in the sands of Iraq; ordering hand towels for soldiers \nembroidered with the ``KBR'' logo, so they could double the price of \nthe hand towels paid for by the American taxpayers; 42,000 meals a day \ncharged to the taxpayers by Halliburton, by KBR, 42,000 meals a day \nbeing served to the troops each day paid for by taxpayers for the \nsoldiers and only 14,000 are actually served; leasing an SUV in Iraq \nfor $7,500 a month; serving food at a cafeteria in Iraq for the \nsoldiers, and a man named Roy who was the supervisor in the food \nservice kitchen said that the food was date-stamped ``expired.'' In \nother words, it had a date stamp, which meant the food wasn't good \nanymore, and he was told by superiors that it doesn't matter. Feed it \nto the troops. It doesn't matter that they had an expired date \nstamped--feed it to the troops.\n  What we have discovered is pretty unbelievable. I will not go on at \ngreat length because I have done it before about the water contracts. \nWe have direct testimony from physicians, Army doctors, and others \nabout providing nonpotable water for shaving, brushing teeth, and so on \nthat is in worse condition as water than the raw water coming out of \nthe Euphrates River.\n  What was going on with respect to this contracting is unbelievable. I \nhave just mentioned a couple of companies. There are more. I will not \ngo on at great length.\n  I think when you are at war, when a massive quantity of money is \nbeing pushed out the door, that we ought to decide to get tough on \nthose who would be engaged in war profiteering. The amendment I have \noffered has a number of provisions in it.\n  First, it punishes war profiteers with significant punishment. It is \na piece of legislation that has been introduced separately here in U.S. \nSenate. That legislation was previously introduced by Senator Leahy, \nbut it is now made a piece of this larger piece of legislation.\n  We have a provision that would crack down on contract cheaters by \nrestoring a rule that this administration rescinded, which the previous \nadministration put in place as a rule, that says that if a contracting \ncompany exhibits\n\n[[Page S5847]]\n\na pattern of failing to comply with the law, they can be debarred and \nsuspended. That ought to be the rule. If you have a pattern of cheating \nyou ought to be suspended.\n  I have seen circumstances where we have had major defense contractors \nover in criminal court being judged guilty on the same day that they \nwere over in the Pentagon signing a new contract. It is a slap on the \nwrist, a pat on the back. That isn't the way we ought to be dealing \nwith this.\n  Punishing war profiteers, cracking down on contract cheaters, forcing \nreal contract competition--it gets back to what Mrs. Greenhouse \nindicated. You can't do these no-bid, sole-source contracts for \nbillions of dollars and decide it does not matter to the taxpayer. Of \ncourse, it matters. They are going to end up paying through the nose--\nand that is exactly what has happened.\n  There is another provision that would end cronyism in key positions. \nI know it doesn't deal just with defense with respect to that, but we \nought to be expecting that people have some qualifications when they \ncome to their job. The top procurement official at the Corps of \nEngineers has to be sent to training because she doesn't have the \nbackground. Why do they have the opening? Because they demoted the \nperson that had the background, was given excellent recommendations in \nevery performance evaluation, but was demoted because she had the \ncourage to stand up and call the old boys network wrong when they tried \nto violate contracting rules.\n  The amendment also strengthens whistleblower protection. I think it \nis really important that we strengthen protections for those who have \nthe courage to stand up as whistleblowers and are willing to tell us \nwhat is happening when waste, fraud, and abuse occurs. I think we need \nto know about it and take action.\n  I have offered previously--and will again--legislation that would \nestablish a Truman committee here in the U.S. Senate. The Truman \ncommittee was established in the 1940s when the Senator from Missouri \nwent around this country to military bases and discovered substantial \nwaste and fraud.\n  We should do that again. I believe we ought to have a Truman \ncommittee. I have offered it I think three times on the floor. I will \noffer it again.\n  But this amendment is different. This amendment is called Honest \nLeadership and Accountability in Contracting. It is a separate bill by \nover 30 my colleagues here in Senate, and I offer it in total as an \namendment to the underlying Defense authorization bill.\n  My hope is we can have a discussion about this. I have simply \nscratched the surface about waste, fraud, and abuse that we have \nuncovered. It is pretty unbelievable. The American taxpayer shouldn't \nstand for it, and neither should the U.S. Congress, and we ought to \ntake action right now on this piece of legislation. There is no better \ntime than right now to decide we are going to do something about this \non behalf of the taxpayers of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the ranking member, together with our \nleadership, had hoped to have a vote. That will not occur at this time. \nWe are contemplating having that vote, which would be on the Dorgan \namendment, at 3:45 today. At this time, I cannot speak to the finality \nof that. The leadership is considering that issue. In the meantime, I \nwill address the Dorgan amendment.\n  The committee has been active in exercising oversight on the \nDepartment of Defense contracting, particularly in Iraq, and held a \nhearing earlier this year focused specifically on recent findings of \nthe Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction. In addition, \nthe committee held several acquisition reform and general contract \noversight hearings this year.\n  I was particularly taken by some of the remarks of the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan. We do not take lightly the \nmessage that he spoke to today. The Special Inspector General for Iraqi \nReconstruction was established by Congress in October 2004 to provide \noversight of the Iraqi relief and reconstruction fund and all \nobligations, expenditures, and revenues associated with reconstruction \nand rehabilitation activities in Iraq.\n  The SIGIR oversight is accomplished via independent audit, field \ninspections, and criminal investigations into potential fraud, waste, \nand abuse funds. The SIGIR submits quarterly and semiannual reports to \nCongress, the latest of which contains 29 audits of specific projects \nand activities. The SIGIR operates a hotline for reports of possible \nwaste, fraud, and abuse and has uncovered criminal activity that has \nbeen referred for prosecution.\n  There are three separate GAO reviews ongoing specifically to review \ncontracting practices in Iraq--DOD's efforts to identify and resolve \ncost issues on Iraqi reconstruction contracts, Iraq reconstruction \ncontracts, and agency competition requirements for Iraq reconstruction \ncontracts since fiscal year 2004.\n  The proposed amendment covers a range of policies introduced under \nthe jurisdiction of multiple committees, including Homeland Security, \nGovernmental Affairs, Judiciary, and Armed Services. Careful \nconsideration and deliberation is required on a number of proposed \nprovisions in the amendment. For example, one provision in the \namendment addresses the issue of the role of contractors in performing \ninherently governmental functions. Definitions of ``inherently \ngovernmental functions'' and the role of contractors in supporting the \nFederal workforce in a variety of duties is an important issue, the \nresolution of which would have wide-ranging consequences and impacts. \nIt deserves investigation and debate, not a few pages with a larger \namendment attached to a major bill.\n  Another provision addresses broad workforce policy issues. The \namendment contains a number of other problematic provisions with \nundefined terms of statutory requirements and disclosure requirements \nwith questionable benefits. I know the committees of jurisdiction, \nincluding Judiciary and Governmental Affairs, will also want to review \nthe details and impact of the proposed legislation and to relate it to \nthe current statute and regulations. The Armed Services Committee \nconducted oversight on the larger policy issues related to emergency or \ncontingency contracting and held a previous hearing in May 2004 \nspecifically on contract management in Iraq.\n  The committee has also held a number of Iraqi related hearings and \nbriefings where Iraqi contracting issues have been discussed.\n  Frequent bipartisan staff briefings on Iraqi contracting have been \nconducted with DOD, GAO, DOD IG and SIGIR officials. Issues identified \nin the May 2004 hearing and in these briefings related to security \ncontractors in Iraq and insurance costs have been the subject of \nlegislation in the last two authorization bills. This year's \nauthorization bill builds on these reforms with legislation specific to \neffective and accountable management of large programs and projects in \nhostile environments.\n  Problems identified such as improper billing, overcharges, and fraud \nagainst the government are addressed through existing mechanisms to \nidentify these acts and punish those who defraud the government. For \nexample the False Claims Act provides for criminal and civil sanctions. \nIt is important we adhere to due process protections for debarments and \nsuspension of contractors.\n  Department of Defense 7640.2--Contract Audit Followup system--\nimplements OMB Circular A-50--requires tracking of all audit reports \nwith significant audit findings and is monitored by the DOD Inspector \nGeneral, and includes semi-annual reports to Congress. Virtually all \nDefense Contract Audit Agency audits are subject to this followup \ntracking system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4234\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4234.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n[[Page S5848]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I spoke about \nyesterday and which I wanted to bring to the floor. I think it is a \nvery important one. It is an amendment that is embodied in the bill I \nintroduced last year dealing with Iran. It now has 61 cosponsors.\n  We have had lots of debates on the floor of this Senate. We have not \nhad a debate on what I believe is the greatest foreign policy threat to \nthis country at this time; that is, Iran, what our policies should be \ntoward Iran, and what we as a Congress and the Senate should do with \nrespect to supporting the President's policy or modifying the \nPresident's policy with respect to Iran.\n  This legislation which I have introduced as an amendment brings \ntogether a couple of pieces of legislation into this one amendment. \nBefore I describe what the amendment is about, let me describe what I \nbelieve is the problem that faces us and then lay out a prescription of \nwhat Congress can do in the interim to support the process of a \ndiplomatic or peaceful solution to the problem that I am about to \ndescribe.\n  It is not a surprise to anyone reading the papers that Iran is in \npursuit of a nuclear weapon. They are fairly clear about their desire \nto gain more nuclear technology. They have been very clear about their \ndesire to enhance their ability to reprocess uranium. It is also clear \nto observers that they are doing so with the intent of developing \nnuclear weapons.\n  As a result of that, the United States has been engaged in \ndiscussions, both with multinational organizations, as well as with \nsome of our allies who are similarly concerned about this attempt by \nIran to develop this type of capability, to get them to cease to do so. \nWe have had attempts by the Russians to get them to rely on them for \nthis technology. We have now seen recent efforts by the United States \nand a group of countries to approach Iran in multilateral talks about \nthe possibility of getting a different type of nuclear reactor there \nthat does not lead to the potential for development of nuclear weapons. \nWe have seen a whole host of attempts on the part of the world to keep \nnuclear weapons out of the hands of this regime.\n  The question is, Why? What is the great concern about Iran? Why do we \nhave more concerns about them than, say, other countries in the Middle \nEast and in southeast Asia which have, in fact, developed nuclear \nweapons?\n  The answer to me is obvious, but it is important we lay that out as \nto what the great threat to this world is if Iran has the nuclear \ncapability they seek to develop.\n  We are fighting a war right now and everyone focuses on the war in \nIraq. Certainly that is important and that is the major field of battle \nright now, but the war in Iraq is part of a broader war. The President \ndescribed it as a war on terror. I prefer to describe it as a war on \nIslamic fascism, Islamic extremism. The President has referred to it as \nIslamic totalitarianism. It is a movement within Islam, within the \nMiddle East, within southeast Asia, but it actually goes beyond the \nMiddle East and southeast Asia that believes in, eventually, the \ndomination of the entire world, the Islamization of the entire world \nunder this rather radical ideology, this fascist ideology.\n  This is not one particular group or one particular faction that is in \ncharge. This is not one group--al-Qaida or Islamic jihad or the nation \nState of Iran--but it is a mosaic of different organizations, some of \nwhich are not necessarily allied with each other but coordinated with \neach other.\n  We saw that the other day when Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi was killed. We \nsaw Hamas come forward and call this al-Qaida leader a brother in the \nstruggle. These are not organizations, at least from all of our \nintelligence, that are closely tied, but they have a common theme. Even \nthough they have different views of Islam, they have a general idea of \na war, a jihad, against the West and against the infidels, if you will.\n  So we have this mosaic of different organizations, different Islamic \nfascist organizations. They are commonly called within the media \nterrorist organizations. Terrorism is just the tactic they use. What \nties them together is not just their terrorism but their ideology. \nAlthough there are different strains and different ideas, they are tied \ntogether in a common theme at a common enemy, more importantly.\n  The largest piece of this mosaic, the dominant piece of this mosaic--\nand it is the dominant piece because it happens to be the biggest piece \nwith the biggest wallet, the most resources--is Iran. The mosaic is a \nbig mosaic, but the major piece which tends to touch all of the other \npieces in one way or another is Iran. Iran not only supports these \norganizations--some of them very directly, others very indirectly--but \nit is itself a threat to the world.\n  How do we understand what this threat is to America? We only need to \nlook at the new leader of the country: Ahmadinejad is the new \nPresident. To Americans, the President is the leader of the country. In \nIran, the President is an important position but traditionally has not \nbeen the most important position within the country of Iran. However, \nit seems to be that Ahmadinejad has taken that position to a new level \nbecause of his support from the ruling clerics within the country. As \nwe know, this is a country ruled by these clerics, these mullahs. And \nthe lead mullah is a spiritual adviser to Ahmadinejad, a supporter of \nhis. He has been very forthright about what his design is. He has been \nvery forthright. He has stated publicly that he would like to wipe out \nIsrael off the face of the Earth. This is a leader of a country that is \ntrying to develop nuclear weapons, that has the resources and the \ncapability if not stopped to do so, that has been very clear about its \ndesire to use these weapons to eliminate the State of Israel.\n  He has also made a lot of other comments that would lead one to \nbelieve he does not want to stop there with respect to his designs on \nthe war against the ``infidels.''\n  So we have in the person of this President a character that has the \nresources, is developing the technology, has the desire, and wants to \nuse this capability if it was developed, and has said so publicly, \nrepeatedly. That is a pretty serious threat. In fact, I can think of no \nother threat that is more serious than that. This man and this country \nis actively pursuing the development of these weapons. I don't know of \nanyone in the world who does not believe that is what Iran is doing.\n  The Senate has, so far, not taken any action to try to deter that \ndevelopment, to try to change the political dynamic within Iran. \nObviously, we have not taken any action to pursue any military force to \nstop them from doing so.\n  These are our three options, the way I see it: to get some sort of \npolitical dynamic going on within the country to change the regime; to \nimpose sanctions or to get collaboration with other governments to stop \nthem from developing these weapons; or, third, a military option.\n  I don't think we are prepared at this point to offer a military \noption, but with this amendment I am offering the other two. I am \noffering an amendment that will both support and codify Executive Order \nsanctions already in place against Iran; impose additional sanctions, \nnot on Iran but on other entities that are doing business with Iran; \nand then try to impose a prohibition on importing into this country \nnuclear fuel assemblies made outside of this country if they do \nbusiness with Iran.\n  Companies have to make a choice whether they want to do business with \nIran or whether they want to do business with the United States. That \nis the sanctions part of it. So we need to enact these provisions \nbecause a lot of what is in place right now is done through Executive \nOrders. Part of the amendment directs the President to cut off foreign \nassistance to the host country of a company investing more than $20 \nmillion in Iran's energy sector; allow the President to waive that \nunder certain circumstances--and, by the way, that is a prospective \ninvestment. It is very important we send a signal to companies and \ncountries that if they are going to continue to support this \ndevelopment within Iran, there are consequences to the country and to \nthe company for continuing to do that.\n\n  There are a variety of different sanctions we place in this \nlegislation. By the way, the sanctions portion of this legislation has \nalready passed the House of Representatives. It passed by a vote of \nover 300 votes in the House--well over 300 votes in the House. So the\n\n[[Page S5849]]\n\nHouse has already spoken on this issue, has already said we want to \ncodify the sanctions that are in place. We want to impose new sanctions \non companies and countries that do business with Iran, particularly in \ntheir energy sector, and we want to make companies choose between doing \nbusiness in the United States with respect to the nuclear program \nversus Iran and the nuclear program.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the Senator state the time when the House cast that \nvote?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. April of this year.\n  Mr. WARNER. It seems to me that vote preceded some remarkable \ndevelopments which have taken place in the international forum within \nour country. With the great leadership of the Secretary of State, \nCondoleezza Rice, we have taken some strong initiatives to try and \nresolve primarily the issue of the desire to proceed with the weapons \nof mass destruction effort, but there are a lot of collateral \nramifications to these important talks.\n  The House vote is of record, but we should let our colleagues know \nthat vote took place way before what I regard as rather dramatic \ndevelopments with respect to the international consortium of nations--\nGreat Britain, France, United States, and now recently both Russia and \nChina participating in some way.\n  Does the Senator think the amendment is wise in light of what is \ntaking place now?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would say that the developments have \nbeen--I would not call them dramatic. I would say they are modest in \nthis respect: they are modest in the sense that the United States, for \nthe first time, has decided to join with other countries in making an \noffer to Iran. The wisdom of that can be debated.\n  What would be dramatic is if Iran would seriously consider doing what \nis being suggested, and I don't see any indication they are willing to \ndo so nor do I anticipate their willingness to do so.\n  My concern is--and the President has been very clear about this--that \nIran is already jockeying around, seeming to extend the time for \nconsideration and drawing this out, certainly, to their advantage. If \nyou are developing a program, and you are actively pursuing developing \na capability, the longer you can stall any action by your adversaries \nto stop you from doing so, buying that time is of great value to Iran.\n  What we are seeing with this development already, Iranians are trying \nto buy time.\n  The President has said, and I am not sure the other countries have \nbeen quite as firm as the United States has--that they have weeks, not \nmonths, to make this decision.\n  However, I have seen no indication that the Iranians are anywhere \nnear accepting this proposal. I will make the argument that this is \nactually a very good time for the Senate to speak and say we see this \nas a very serious issue, that we need to at this point speak into this \nvery critical juncture.\n  I would say it is more important now that we have this vote, or more \nimportant now that we pass this, to show the Iranians that both \nChambers support this President in his desire, our country's desire, a \nbipartisan desire, to see that Iran does not develop this capability. \nThe Senate going on record, codifying sanctions, increasing sanctions \nand, the point I did not get a chance to discuss but I will \nmomentarily, funding prodemocracy, authorizing funding for prodemocracy \ngroups, and for more communication, public diplomacy within the country \nof Iran to communicate to the dissidents within Iran and encourage the \ndissidents within Iran is exactly the kind of message we want to send \nif we want to force the Iranians' hand to actually come to the table.\n  I think pulling this back, in my mind, would be seen by the Iranians \nas a sign that the U.S. Senate does not support this President, does \nnot support getting tough. Because the President has been very clear: \nIf the Iranians do not come to the table here, they are going to seek \nresolutions at the U.N. to begin the process toward a different way of \nresolving this dispute--maybe that is the best way to put it--in a way \nthat could be a lot more confrontational.\n  So I think the Senate speaking at this moment is actually critical \nfor us to force the Iranians' hands. I am not particularly hopeful, by \nthe way, that the Iranians will come to the table or will agree to any \nof the provisions that the groups have laid out. I understand why the \nPresident has done so. I do not believe they have any desire to comply.\n  I think it is important for us not to blink. I think this is a moment \nfor us to deal with this issue, to debate it here, and to vote on it or \nto approve this amendment to send a very clear message to the Iranian \nGovernment that we stand four square behind this President and this \nadministration in doing what we can here at this point in time both \nfrom the standpoint of sanctions as well as supporting a change of \nregime from within Iran.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Yesterday, the Senate had an opportunity to visit with the \nSecretaries of State and Defense. I believe my distinguished colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania was there, as was I. And while those discussions are \nprivate in nature, I just simply say that with those discussions, \ncombined with other discussions and communications I have had with the \nDepartment of State, I am somewhat more encouraged about the prospects \nof the negotiations now taking place than perhaps my colleague from \nPennsylvania.\n  My main concern is, given the fragility of the situation with regard \nto these negotiations, the almost overriding importance of the question \nof the weapons-of-mass-destruction issue, and the need to have Iran \npublicly begin to cooperate with the IAEA and other organizations to \nprevent the proliferation of that type of weapon--I just wonder, had \nthe Senator thought about maybe an effective date of this amendment to \ngive some reasonable period of time for these negotiations to take \nplace as to the effective date of the amendment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what I would certainly say to the \nchairman is, this is the Defense authorization bill. We will probably \nbe here the remainder of this week and maybe going into next week \nfinishing this bill. Usually, the Defense authorization bill takes \nmonths to be able to discern the differences between the two bodies, of \nwhich this amendment, pending in this legislation, will be part of that \ndiscussion.\n  So I do not anticipate there will be any final resolution to this \nparticular amendment that I am offering until several months. If the \nPresident is serious about what the President has said, that they do \nnot have months but weeks, I do not anticipate that anything we do here \ntoday will have any impact on the deadline or any of these \nnegotiations.\n  I think what they will do is signal to the Iranians that not only is \nthe House serious about this, but even now that they are engaged \npotentially in a negotiated settlement, that the Senate is serious \nabout pursuing this if, in fact, the Iranians do not come forward with \nan agreement.\n  If there is an agreement, we may want to take another look at this. \nBut I do not think any harm is done by passing this legislation and \nputting us in the conference so if, in fact, things do not go well or \nif, in fact, we believe--whatever the result is of these negotiations--\nthat it is important for us to go on record on some of these or all of \nthese things, that we are in a position to produce a bill relatively \nquickly and send that message.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly respect the views of my \ncolleague who once served on the Armed Services Committee. I regret \nthat the Senator felt there were other areas where he could serve his \ncountry other than in our committee. But we still consider him a member \nof the committee.\n  The Senator is quite accurate that it is likely that this bill will \nbe before this body into next week. I am hoping to conclude next week. \nThen, of course, there will be a period of time thereafter in which we \nwill have a deliberation between the two bodies in the conference.\n  But I would like to have some additional time today for purposes of \nconsultation. I assure the Senator, he has a right to move forward, as \nhe has sought to do at this time. I say to the Senator, if you can \nindulge the chairman in trying to schedule such action\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\nas may take place on this amendment at some point today, a little later \nthan now, I would be appreciative of that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have tremendous respect for my former \nchairman. I say to the Senator, I served 8 absolutely remarkable and \nwonderful years on your committee, and got to serve under Senator \nThurmond and then your great leadership. I certainly will do everything \nI can to work with you to make sure we can come to some agreement as to \nhow we can dispose of this amendment, whether it is a vote or whether \nit is accepted or whatever the case may be. I am certainly not going to \npush for a vote today if that is not what you desire. But, obviously, \nthis is a very important issue.\n  I remind the chairman there are 61 cosponsors on a similar piece of \nlegislation, and it has very broad support here in this body from both \nsides of the aisle. It passed, as I said, with well over 300 votes in \nthe House. And this issue is quite timely. So I would be happy to \nsuspend any request for votes until we can negotiate how we would \ndispose of this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He is recognized as \none of the leaders of our party, and he is very cooperative with regard \nto all legislative matters.\n\n  My understanding is the Dorgan amendment is the pending amendment; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Santorum amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see. And we did not move on the Dorgan amendment as of \nyet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Dorgan amendment was set aside.\n  Mr. WARNER. Set aside. At the appropriate time, will the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, when he completes his remarks, \nmove to have this amendment set aside for the time being?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to do so after we have had discussions \nabout how we can dispose of this amendment, absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I see our colleague from Maine, a member of the \ncommittee, and in due course I expect, after the completion of the \nSenator's remarks, the Senator from Maine can be recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. President, if I can just finish the explanation of the \nlegislation, I talked about the sanctions portions of this legislation. \nThe final component of the legislation deals with what we call the pro-\ndemocracy side. This is very interesting. I introduced this legislation \nlast year. Actually, I introduced it 3 years ago. It provided, at the \ntime we introduced it 3 years ago, $10 million for the pro-democracy \ncomponent of this.\n  I felt very strongly this was really the key to this legislation. In \nfact, just meeting a few weeks ago with a student dissident who had \nrecently escaped from Iran, I am even more convinced there is a strong \nanti-regime movement within Iran. There is a very strong pro-American \ncomponent of the Iranian population that understands the tremendous \neffort that our country has put forward in Iraq and Afghanistan, and, \nlike most people around the world, seek self-determination and freedom. \nIt is very important for us to communicate that in unequivocal terms.\n  One of the concerns I have with the diplomatic efforts being taken \nright now is that we are potentially muddying the waters somewhat with \nrespect to our opinion of the regime in Iran. I want to make it very, \nvery clear that personally that regime is the greatest threat to this \ncountry and must be removed. That is how I feel. Now, that is not in \nthis legislation. But that is, to me, one of the highest national \nsecurity priorities of this country.\n  I think the best way to do that under the current circumstances is to \nsupport pro-democracy groups, to support groups that would like to see \nchanges within Iran and peaceful changes.\n  The one gentleman I met with just recently, a couple weeks ago, was \nvery clear about the intention of at least the student movement within \nIran to be a peaceful movement, similar to what happened in the old \nSoviet Union. They believe they can, in fact, rally support. But they \nneed support. They need resources. They need to communicate. One of the \nthings this legislation does is provide not $10 million but $100 \nmillion for that purpose. The reason I talk about the difference is \nthat in the interim the President, thankfully, took some of the \nprovisions of the Iran Freedom Support Act, which is the bulk of this \namendment that I am proposing today, and proposed that in the emergency \nsupplemental that he sent up and that we will be voting on, in all \nlikelihood, tomorrow. So that money is being appropriated, in this \ncase, before it is being authorized. But this is the authorization, and \nsets an authorization level of $100 million, which is what the \nPresident's request was.\n  Excuse me, the President's request was $75 million. We make it $100 \nmillion.\n  So we think this is important to send another strong signal that we \nsupport efforts for peaceful change within Iran, that we support those \nwho on the evening of 9/11 stood in the city of Tehran in candlelight \nvigils in support of Americans. We support the Iranian people who would \nlike to see the oppression end in that country that they have suffered \nunder now for over 25 years. So this is a vitally important component \nof this authorization, and it is a very important signal to the people \nof Iran.\n  When I met with that student leader a few weeks ago, he told me how \nevil this regime was on a personal level, not only with his \nimprisonment for leading student protests, but also with the current \ngroup of students who are, in the eyes of the regime, a great threat to \nthe future of that regime. He talked about how his sister, who is a \nstudent at one of the universities in Iran, recently had to sign a \ndocument as a condition of attending the university. The document was a \ncommitment to be a suicide bomber.\n  So now every student in colleges within Iran has to sign a document \npledging their commitment to be a suicide bomber. In fact, shortly \nafter those documents were signed in every university in Iran, they \nconducted training courses for the students on how to strap on and \ndetonate a suicide bomb.\n  This is the enemy we are confronting. This is why I think it is \nimportant for us to step forward now and have this debate, to step \nforward now and pass this legislation, to send a signal now, while they \nare deciding whether to engage the United States and the free world in \nthe pursuit of peaceful nuclear energy as opposed to nuclear \nwarheads. It is important for the Senate to act. This is our moment in \nhistory. This is the great threat that faces us. This is the war we are \ncurrently engaged in, and this is the principal player on that stage \ntoday. We must act.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, is the floor open to debate on the \nunderlying bill, or would the Presiding Officer advise me as to the \npending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may debate the underlying bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in strong support of the fiscal year 2007 National Defense \nAuthorization Act. This legislation provides essential resources to our \ntroops, whether they are engaged in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, in \ntraining and service at home, or in deployments in other countries \naround the world. I thank my colleagues, the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senators Warner and \nLevin, for putting together an excellent bill and also for their strong \ncommitment to our Nation's Armed Forces.\n  Through the leadership of Chairman Warner and Senator Talent, the \nSeapower Subcommittee chairman, the legislation before us strengthens \nour Nation's shipbuilding program by authorizing construction of eight \nnew ships and by providing $12.1 billion in shipbuilding moneys, an \nincrease of $1.5 billion above the President's request. This \nlegislation wisely focuses on the declining size of the Navy fleet and \ntakes significant strides toward strengthening the shipbuilding \nprogram. It also provides some much needed stability for the industrial \nbase that will be called upon to build and sustain the current force \nand the future fleet.\n\n[[Page S5851]]\n\n  The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Mullen, has put forward a 313-\nship long-range Navy shipbuilding plan that is a genuine effort to \naddress longstanding congressional concerns that Navy shipbuilding has \nbeen inadequately funded and has lacked stability from year to year. \nPast instability has made it difficult for shipbuilders to plan their \nbusinesses. That degree of instability, coupled with less-than-economic \nproduction rates, has contributed to significant cost growth in naval \nshipbuilding programs. The CNO's plan, combined with more robust \nfunding from Congress, will begin to reverse the dangerous decline in \nNavy shipbuilding.\n  I am pleased that this bill provides full funding for the DD(X) \ndestroyer program, including split funding of the first two ships' \ndetailed design and construction. The DD(X) is so important to our \nfuture national security. This ship will have high-tech capabilities \nthat currently do not exist on the Navy's surface combatants. These \ncapabilities include far greater offensive and precision firepower, \nadvanced stealth technologies, numerous engineering and technological \ninnovations that will allow for reduced crew size and thus help to \nreduce the lifecycle cost of the ship and sophisticated, advanced \nweapons systems such as the electromagnetic rail gun.\n  Constructing the first two DD(X)s in 2007 and 2008 will contribute to \nthe sustainment of our Nation's highly skilled shipbuilding workforces, \nincluding the employees at Bath Iron Works in my home State of Maine. I \nam very proud of these highly skilled workers and their contributions \nto our Nation's defense. Split funding between the first two DD(X) \nships is a key component of the CNO's 313-ship plan and will make an \nimportant contribution to stabilizing a critical naval shipbuilding \nprogram, allowing for a more steady plan for the fragile dual-source \nservice combatant shipbuilding industrial base, and achieving long-term \nprogram affordability through stability and other ongoing Navy and \nindustry initiatives.\n  Split funding for the DD(X) also supports cost-effective construction \nactivities at both of our shipbuilding yards that concentrate on \nsurface combatants. That will help stabilize and preserve two shipyards \nin order to meet future Navy requirements. If there were ever any doubt \nabout the need to have two shipyards capable of constructing surface \ncombatants, surely those doubts were put to rest by the extensive \ndamage that Hurricane Katrina caused at the Ingalls Shipyard. We simply \ncannot afford to have only one shipyard that is capable of responding \nto the needs of our Navy for capable advanced surface combatants. That \nis why it is so critical that our procurement strategies recognize that \nand are developed and designed to sustain both yards.\n  In doing so, we are helping the Navy meet its needs. Our naval fleet \nhas been declining for far too many years. This bill will take a \nsignificant step toward stability and meeting the requirements that \nexist.\n  The high priority placed on the DD(X) program in the Senate version \nof the Defense authorization bill stands in stark contrast to the House \nDefense authorization bill that recommends full funding for the \nprocurement of only one DD(X) and does not adopt the critical split \nfunding approach. Failure to support the budget for two DD(X)s would \nexacerbate the production gap facing BIW in Maine and would pose a \nsignificant risk to the DD(X) program that the CNO has so strongly \nendorsed and that the committee has consistently supported. Navy \nofficials testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that \nauthorizing only one DD(X) in fiscal year 2007 would result in the \nfollowing negative consequences.\n  First, it would cause significant program delay and disruption. \nSecond, it would increase program costs. Third, it would have a \nnegative impact on the shipbuilder industrial base. Fourth, it would \ndefer the planned competitive contract awards from 2009 until at least \n2011. And, finally, it would force the Navy into a lead-follow scenario \nthat would require an additional $450 million in shipbuilding funds. \nApproval of split funding is, therefore, critical to moving the DD(X) \nprogram forward. It strives to keep both DD(X) shipbuilders on an equal \nfooting during this key transitional period.\n  Furthermore, the House version of the DOD authorization bill \nrecommends reducing the overall DD(X) program to only two ships, a \nsignificant decrease from the Navy's requirement for a minimum of seven \nDD(X)s as part of the 313-ship plan. At one point a couple of years \nago, the Navy said it actually needs 12 DD(X)s. I still believe the \nmilitary requirements suggest that that is the accurate number. But for \nthe House committee to slash the number of ships under this program to \ntwo would seriously jeopardize our national security. I hope we will \nproceed with the Senate's much better plan to proceed with a minimum of \nseven DD(X) ships.\n  I am also pleased that the committee agreed to my request for $25 \nmillion in funding to accomplish planning and engineering for the \nmodernization of the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyer class. This \nprogram, which has been in effect in the past few years, is already \nshowing significant promise of significant savings to the Navy by \napplying some of the technology that is being developed for the \ndestroyer of the 21st century, the DD(X), and backfitting the DDG. This \nhas the potential, for example, to reduce crew size on the retrofitted \nDDGs by about 30 to 40 sailors. That certainly is significant as well.\n\n  The Senate's fiscal year 2007 Defense authorization bill also \nincludes funding for other important defense-related projects that \nbenefit Maine and our national security. For example, it includes \nadditional funding for the Mark V fast patrol boat that is being \ndeveloped at a shipyard in Maine, in conjunction with the University of \nMaine. It also provides $2 million to the University of Maine's Army \nCenter of Excellence in order to continue the design and testing of \nlightweight ballistic panel tent inserts made from composite materials. \nThese potentially lifesaving panels protect our troops from insurgent \nattacks when they are sheltered in temporary dining or sleeping \nfacilities in hostile environments. This is particularly important to \nthe State of Maine because we lost National Guardsmen in Iraq who were \neating in an unprotected mess tent. Had we had those composite \nballistic inserts for this tent, truly, I believe, lives and injuries \nwould have been saved and avoided.\n  The legislation also authorizes $9.6 million for the Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard and Drydock Waterfront Support Facility in Kittery, ME. This \nwill replace the current submarine support center that is more than 60 \nyears old and poorly designed for current use.\n  This legislation also provides much needed funds for other national \npriorities. The legislation authorizes incentive payments for civilian \nhealth care providers who provide services to TRICARE beneficiaries in \nrural and medically underserved areas. I know that is a concern of the \nPresiding Officer as well. Any of us who represent rural States realize \nhow difficult it is to ensure an adequate supply of health care \nproviders.\n  It also follows on the Senate's action earlier this year by repealing \nprovisions of the Survivor Benefit Plan that require the offset of \nmilitary retirement annuity payments by amounts received for dependency \nand indemnity compensation. It authorizes acceleration of the effective \ndate of the paid-up provision from October 1, 2008, to October 1, 2006, \nfor retirees who reach age 70 and have paid premiums for 30 years.\n  Finally, let me again, since the distinguished chairman is now in the \nChamber, commend him for his extraordinary leadership and dedication to \nthe men and women who are serving in our Armed Forces. We are very \nfortunate to have such a talented and committed chairman and ranking \nminority member as we do on this committee. I am very proud to be a \nmember. I offer my full support to the important legislation before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nMaine. She is a valued member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nShe has taken enormous interest in shipbuilding. Obviously, she has one \nof the world's finest yards in her State. Nevertheless, naval power and \nseapower are of great interest to the Senator from Maine. I thank her \nfor her remarks and her strong participation as a member of the \ncommittee.\n\n[[Page S5852]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time, it is our hope and \nexpectation that we will have another amendment soon brought to the \nfloor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4230\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to particularly commend the Senator \nfrom North Dakota for sections 1521 and 1522 of his amendment which \naddress the issue of competition in contracting. This is an issue that \nI have been concerned about since I worked with Senator Bill Cohen to \nenact the Competition in Contracting Act in 1984.\n  Sections 1521 and 1522 in Senator Dorgan's amendment build on the \nprinciple that the Federal Government, taxpayers, and Government \ncontractors all benefit from the competitive award of Federal \ncontracts. I was pleased to work with Senator Dorgan and his staff in \ndrafting these particular provisions of his amendment.\n  Over the last 10 years, the Government Accountability Office, the \nDepartment of Defense Inspector General, and others have documented \nnumerous shortcomings in the application of competition rules by \nFederal agencies. These problems have included, one, numerous \nunjustified sole-source awards under Government-wide, multiple-award \ncontracts. Some studies have indicated that more than 50 percent of \nsuch awards have been made on a sole-source basis. Second, the award of \nhuge what are called indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, or IDIQ, \ncontracts--some of them in the billions of dollars--go to individuals, \nindividual contractors, rather than multiple contractors.\n  These single awards--these indefinite delivery and indefinite \nquantity contracts--basically give a single contractor the right to \nsole-source award of innumerable highly lucrative projects. Such \ncontracts include the highly visible contracts awarded to Halliburton \nrelative to Iraq.\n  Sections 1521 and 1522 of the Dorgan amendment would address these \nproblems by prohibiting, with limited waiver authority, the issuance of \nlong-term, open-ended contracts, like Halliburton's LOGCAP contract, to \na single company. Federal agencies would be required to issue such \ncontracts to more than one company so that they could compete with each \nother for work, unless the agency makes a determination that it is not \npractical to do so and reports that determination to Congress. That \nsection of the amendment would also extend to civilian agencies a \nlegislative provision that we wrote 4 years ago to eliminate abusive \nsole-source awards and ensure competition when Department of Defense \nofficials place work orders under multiple-award contracts, and we \nwould authorize bid protests for task orders in excess of $500,000 \nunder multiple-award contracts.\n  So I commend our colleague from North Dakota for offering this \nimportant amendment. I support this amendment. I hope the Senate will \nadopt it and not table it because it includes many important reforms \nand changes in our contracting process to address some of the abuses \nthat have been identified by the expert agencies that we actually \nutilize and hire to do these kinds of reviews.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida desires to speak \nregarding the National Guard. For that purpose--oh, yes, Mr. President, \nI had indicated to the distinguished Senator from Texas that she could \nspeak. She wanted how much time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I wanted 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why doesn't the Senator from Texas go first.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The two Senators will be recognized in that order?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. The Senator from Texas and the Senator from Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                      Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior \nSenator from Virginia for allowing me to take this time to speak about \nthe supplemental appropriations bill. I certainly want to start by \nsaying that I think the authorization bill that is before us is a good \nbill that will authorize the spending for our troops in the field. I \nplan to speak separately on that later in the week.\n  Today, I want to talk about the supplemental appropriations bill that \nthe Senate will pass at 10 o'clock tomorrow because this is a very \nimportant emergency supplemental. Obviously, the majority of this bill, \n$70.4 billion, is for our military. It is to make sure that we support \nour men and women in the very important mission that we have asked them \nto do. I cannot imagine sending our troops into harm's way and not \nassuring that they have the equipment they need to do the job. So we \nare doing that in this bill--$70.4 billion for uparmoring of vehicles, \nfor more aircraft, and the Bradley fighting vehicle upgrades that they \nso desperately need.\n  I am going to take this opportunity to say what a tremendous \nachievement we have had this week with the death of Abu Mus'ab al-\nZarqawi, the head of the operation in Iraq that was behind the heinous \ncrimes on the streets of Iraq day after day after day that we have been \nseeing. The man who was the mastermind of those atrocities is now gone. \nIt is a significant victory for the intelligence capabilities of our \ncountry and our military personnel who achieved this remarkable feat. I \nhope this will begin another phase in the stabilization of Iraq.\n  Clearly we need to assure that our troops have what they need to do \nthe job. Part of what is in this supplemental appropriations bill is \nmoney for training of Iraqi troops, because if we are going to \nstabilize Iraq, it is going to be with Iraqi security forces. That is \nwhat the Iraqis want, it is what we want, it is what our allies want, \nand it is certainly what the people of the world who believe in freedom \nwant for the people of Iraq.\n  The other part of the bill is one that is very important to my home \nState of Texas, as well as to Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and the \nother States that have suffered so much from hurricanes last season. We \nhave never seen the ravages of a hurricane like we saw after Katrina \nand then Rita following so closely after that.\n  This bill, for the first time, has begun to acknowledge the part that \nmy home State of Texas played in this recovery effort. We had a \nsituation we have never had before in the history of our country. The \nfirst hurricane, Hurricane Katrina, did not hit Texas, but Texas had a \nmajor part in the disaster recovery. That is because 500,000 people \nwere moved from Louisiana to Texas almost overnight. It was the biggest \nmigration from one State to another in our country's history.\n  It has been a costly endeavor for the people of Texas, one which they \nhave stood up and handled with grace beyond any imagination. But it is \ntime that we reimburse the people of Texas because some of our \ncommunities are having to increase taxes to carry the burden, and that \nis not right. It was a natural disaster for which Texans stepped up to \nthe plate, because we are a neighboring State, to try to handle, and \nnow we have suffered the consequences. This bill helps us in that \nrecovery effort.\n  The first part that is so important for us is the equity in \nreimbursement rates for the communities hit by Hurricane Rita. Since \nHurricane Rita hit in September of 2005, the counties on the Louisiana \nside of the Sabine River have been able to put up 10 percent, with a \n90-percent Federal reimbursement. This has been very helpful to the \npeople of Louisiana. But on the other side of the Sabine River, where \nthe same hurricane hit, our counties have had to put up 25 percent of \nthe cleanup. The result is that much debris has never been cleaned up.\n  Furthermore, we have infrastructure that has not even begun to be \nrepaired. Some counties, in doing the original cleanup, contemplated \nbankruptcy. They have talked now about having to raise the property tax \nrates to pay for the cleanup, and some have borrowed money and issued \nbonds to try to do the cleanup. Bond issues should never be used for \nthat kind of an emergency or any kind of operational expenditure.\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\nBonds are for capital expenditures. They knew that it was not good \npublic policy, but they had no alternative because these are counties \nwhich are rural, not rich in property values, and it was a huge strain.\n  In this bill, those 22 counties in East Texas will get the \nreimbursement rate that has been given on the Louisiana side. I am so \ngrateful to the Senate for doing this in a way that does allow equity \nfor the first time since last September. This has been such a relief to \nthese counties. I have had calls from mayors and county judges who were \nalmost giving up hope because they did not know how they would manage \nthis crisis, and now they see light at the end of the tunnel.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this bill. I know the bill will \npass. I particularly thank Senator Cochran, Senator Byrd, Senator \nGregg, Senator Collins, Senator Specter, Senator Lieberman, and Senator \nKennedy. It was these Senators who helped us get through the equity in \nreimbursement that will so help our East Texas counties.\n  The other part of this hurricane relief bill is in the educational \narea. When we had half a million evacuees, we were looking at, of \ncourse, educating their children. After an initial enrollment of 43,000 \nchildren, mostly in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin, some in \nthe East Texas counties that also were hit by Rita, we did agree in a \nprevious supplemental to reimburse these school districts. We \nauthorized impact aid of $6,000 per student to cover the cost of \neducation for students displaced by Hurricane Katrina. However, they \nwere only able to do the reimbursement at a rate of $4,000. So these \nschool districts were taking a hit of $2,000 per student. The current \nsupplemental bridges that gap, which is a huge help for these \ncommunities.\n  Just to give one an idea of the impact of Hurricane Katrina on Texas, \nit is normal to see a two-page ad in a newspaper that advertises \npolling locations for elections. One would see in any normal election \nin a county all of the polling places on election day. This newspaper I \nam holding up doesn't seem to look that unusual. It is a list of \npolling places for the New Orleans mayor's race. What is interesting is \nthis is the Houston Chronicle. This same ad over two pages appeared in \nthe Dallas Morning News. That is because the number of Katrina evacuees \nwho were going to vote and did vote in the New Orleans mayor's race was \nsignificant enough, with a 500,000-person migration after that \nhurricane, to make a huge difference.\n  There is also a picture on the front page of the Houston Chronicle \njust before that mayor's race with a billboard for New Orleans mayor, \nRay Nagin.\n  We can tell just from these anecdotal pieces of evidence that this is \nan evacuation which is affecting Texas to a huge extent.\n  The $235 million in this bill will help these school districts make \nup for the deficit they have been funding all year and, again, raising \nproperty taxes in Texas to pay for it will not now be necessary.\n  We are going to monitor the enrollment of the number of \nschoolchildren in these school districts this fall to see if we have \nlarge numbers of displaced schoolchildren--because schools are not yet \nfully open in New Orleans--and we will come back and ask for more \nsupplemental funds for the Katrina evacuees who are not planning to \nmake a permanent home in Texas but are still in our education system.\n  Because of the fairness of the conference committee--and I \nparticularly mention Congressman Kevin Brady, Congressman Ted Poe, \nCongressman Hal Rogers, and Congressman Henry Bonilla for helping us \nput forward the case that needed to be made for Texas to show that we \nhad to have some equity in the East Texas counties that were hit by \nRita, as well as the educational community that was so affected by the \nevacuees who came to our State immediately after Katrina. This is going \nto go a long way toward helping them.\n  We are also hoping to have some of the money for infrastructure \nreimbursement after Hurricane Rita that is also included in this bill, \nbut it is at the discretion of the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  This is a balanced bill. It is the first time we have been able to \nrecognize that though a State wasn't hit by the first natural disaster, \nit nevertheless had a huge impact on the economy of the State. Our \nState stepped up to the plate, and this bill begins to equalize the \nburden our State has carried.\n  I appreciate my colleagues listening to me. I appreciate their help \nin the original Senate bill. I appreciate the members of the conference \ncommittee who did so much to help, and I certainly appreciate the \nchairman, Senator Cochran, Senator Byrd, Senator Gregg, Senator \nCollins, Senator Specter, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Kennedy for \nhelping us create the equity that will exist when this conference \nreport is agreed to tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4237\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4237, which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Martinez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4237.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that States likely to be effected by the hurricane \n   season in 2007 are afforded a priority in funding for replacement \n                   equipment for the National Guard)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 114. REPLACEMENT EQUIPMENT FOR THE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD.\n\n       In allocating amounts authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 101(5) for other procurement for the Army for the \n     procurement of replacement equipment for the National Guard, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall afford a priority in the \n     allocation of such funds to the States likely to experience a \n     hurricane during the 2007 hurricane season.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBill Nelson of Florida be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? It was my \nunderstanding that the Senator from Florida was going to speak on an \nexisting amendment or some other subject, and he now has offered an \namendment?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is a lineup of amendments to which we had previously \nagreed. It was not my understanding the Senator would be offering an \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have been \ntrying to work with the Senator from Florida to revise a draft I saw.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it seems to me, if the Senator withdraws \nthe amendment, the managers can work with him and then the Senator from \nFlorida can speak to the generic substance of the amendment, which I \nbelieve is a very important amendment.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I have no problem doing that. I will be glad to \nwithdraw the amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4237, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 4237.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator has additional \ncopies of the amendment he can share.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, the Senator from \nFlorida is now in the process of rewriting it. I suggest we wait until \nhe has decided on the version he would like to submit at the \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. That will be fine. I was under the impression Senator \nLevin had seen the amendment. I will make sure he gets a copy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I very much appreciate it.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes on the subject of the amendment \nand come back to the issue of calling it up at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida is recognized.\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, the issue of the ongoing war on terror \nand the very important role the National Guard is playing in this \neffort is the subject of my amendment. I wanted to start first by \ncongratulating President Bush, who visited Baghdad yesterday. The \nPresident once again is showing his commitment and his leadership in \nthis difficult fight. He went to Iraq to show his support for the now-\nformed Iraqi Government and again to offer his support to the brave men \nand women who are fighting this war and offer his support to them and \ntheir families.\n  The last 7 days have been historic. The bringing to justice Abu \nMus'ab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida's No. 2 figure in the world, second only to \nOsama bin Laden, was great news for freedom-loving Iraqis and for the \nmen and women of the U.S. Armed Forces who have patiently and \nmethodically hunted this terrorist to his end, and most of all a \ncrucial step for us in winning the war on terror. For U.S. special \noperations forces, this was yet another impressive victory in removing \nan enormous obstacle to peace in Iraq and victory of our Armed \nForces. By capturing Saddam Hussein, tracking and killing his sons, \nUday and Qusay, and now killing Zarqawi, our special operations forces \ncontinue to effectively serve the cause of freedom. Iraq is a better \nplace for these actions, and America will be safer as well.\n\n  The President recently reminded us that the fight is far from over. \nAs he has said from the beginning, this war on terror will not be easy \nor short. Blindly hoping for victory will not result in victory. As \nAmericans, we must be firm in our determination to the task at hand. As \nthe President said while talking to the troops in Baghdad yesterday, \nthe sooner Iraqis can take up the fight, the sooner our soldiers can \ncome home.\n  Defeatism and hand-wringing and finger-pointing does not constitute a \nstrategy for victory. We cannot and will not be defeated militarily. \nThe only way we will be defeated is by our own lack of resolve. If we \nhad listened to detractors who told us to cut and run, al-Zarqawi would \nbe alive and planning his next killing and the future of a radical \ncaliphate in Iraq. The constant talk about withdrawal and the ceaseless \npursuit of establishing a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops \ndirectly undermines the mission. It undermines morale. Why would we \never want to alert our enemies and give them our precise plans? A \ntimetable is only tied to the success of our forces and the political \nsituation on the ground. While we all wish to see the end of the \nstruggle and our troops' safe return home, this must not be determined \nby an arbitrary deadline that signals retreat in defeat. After all the \nIraqis have achieved--peaceful democratic elections, an interim and now \npermanent government, a police force, and building of the armed \nforces--how could we think about abandoning this struggle and mission \nbefore we meet with success?\n  The clear goals of this war--to protect America and our vital \nnational interests, to rid the world of radical Islamic terrorists, to \nreshape the Middle East and bring democracy to one of the darkest and \nmost historically undemocratic corners of the world--is Wilsonian in \nits vision and Churchillian in its urgency. I commend President Bush \nfor his leadership, Secretary Rumsfeld for his diligence, Generals \nAbizaid and Casey, the commanders on the field, and the soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines in the theater for their perseverance, \ncompetence, and for their honor; also, our Secretary of State and our \nvery capable Ambassador Khalilzad for their success and the way they \nhave assisted the formation of a new government.\n  In relation to the continuing war on terror, there is one issue I am \nconcerned with, and that is the process by which our National Guard \nunits are currently being reequipped. Today, we have a situation in our \nNational Guard units from Florida--and I imagine National Guard units \nfrom many other States--which are sent to war with their own equipment; \nthat is, the men and women, the trucks, the tanks, the helicopters, the \nhumvees, and all the gear leave the State and go to protect Americans \nserving in Afghanistan and Iraq. However, when the tour of duty is \nover, the Guard returns home and the equipment stays behind. This is \nunderstandable, since in a war zone and in desert conditions, vital \nequipment needs to be replaced sometimes more quickly than new \nequipment can get to the region. As you might imagine, the National \nGuard then has a resulting deficit of equipment, which is a temporary \nsituation but nonetheless a crucial delay in their completion of their \nequipment inventory.\n  With the arrival of this year's hurricane season, I have urged the \ncitizens in our State of Florida, where we are currently and have been \npreviously consistent victims of recent hurricanes, as well as other \nhurricane-prone States, to do everything they can to prepare for \npotential storms. But even with the best preparedness, storms have a \nway of taking unexpected turns, and as we have seen over the past three \nyears, the National Guard plays a crucial role in helping stabilize \nareas in the immediate hours and days following the disastrous \nhurricanes we have experienced recently.\n  For instance, last year alone, the Florida National Guard deployed \n5,800 troops within the State of Florida and along the gulf coast \nduring 4 major hurricanes. To support Hurricane Katrina recovery \nefforts, the Florida Guard sent 2,500 troops to Mississippi as part of \nthe emergency compact agreement the States have with the Guard. They \nhave done their job with dedication and competence.\n  The point is that during hurricane season, during the war on terror, \nwe cannot sustain the National Guard without prioritizing equipment \nreplacement. They need this equipment for training. They need this \nequipment for those times when they are needed to be activated in \nhonoring their State and Federal missions here at home.\n  The Guard wears many hats and plays a vital role in fighting the war \non terror and in responding to catastrophes here at home. I have \noffered an amendment to ensure that their reequipment is not deferred. \nThe amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to place a priority on \nproviding replacement equipment to Guard units, particularly in those \nStates which are prone and historically have been shown to be frequent \nvictims of hurricanes.\n  The first named storm of the season, Tropical Storm Alberto, just \nvisited the State of Florida. NOAA has told us that we are in for an \nactive hurricane cycle that could last for a decade or more. From New \nEngland to Texas to Louisiana to Florida, hurricane-prone States \nrequire National Guard units that will be able to meet important \nmissions abroad and at home. Meeting this mission requires prioritizing \ntheir reequipping.\n  So at the right time and in the right order, I intend to bring up \nsuch an amendment, which I hope will have broad support in the Senate \nwhere I believe all of us understand and appreciate the very vital and \ncrucial role the National Guard continues to play, not only in the \ncrucial war on terror but, equally important, providing that \nirreplaceable line of assistance at home during the times of hurricanes \nand other natural disasters.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, is the pending amendment the Dorgan \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to table the Dorgan amendment. I \nask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to table occur at \n3:45 this afternoon; provided further that between now and 3:45, \nSenator Dorgan be recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that there will be a \nmotion, perhaps a motion to table--in any\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\nevent, a vote on my amendment at 3:45. I had asked that I be allowed \ntime to speak once again on the amendment.\n  It is an obligatory statement to come to the floor and congratulate \nthe chairman and the ranking member, but in this case I will always \nmean it. The work of my friend and colleague from Virginia, as chairman \nof this committee, is really excellent work. So, too, is the work of \nSenator Levin from Michigan. I always say this is a big, big piece of \nlegislation, a difficult piece of legislation. The Defense \nauthorization bill is a real piece of work to put together. It is made \neven more difficult during wartime to stretch for all of the needs--\nunlimited wants with limited resources. So I come here understanding \nthat there are things in this legislation that are very important that \ninure to the credit of the chairman and the ranking member.\n  I want to describe something that is not in the legislation, however, \nand the opportunity to offer it to this legislation at this time is \nvery important. This bill will authorize the expenditure of a great \ndeal of money. That is not new. We have authorized the expenditure of a \nlot of money for a lot of things, particularly with respect to the \nmilitary expenditures in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years--\nsomething close to $350 billion. That is with a ``b,'' $350 billion has \nbeen spent. That was virtually all done as emergency appropriations, \nnot paid for with anything, just added on top of the debt.\n  Even as we have done that, we in the Congress have also voted for $18 \nbillion in reconstruction funding in the country of Iraq. That $18 \nbillion in reconstruction for the country of Iraq has gone out in \nvarious contracts and been spent. What we are hearing now, as a result \nof a massive amount of money being spent in a fairly short period of \ntime, is the most hair-raising tale of waste and fraud and abuse that I \nhave ever heard.\n  I dare say that never in the history of this country has so much \nmoney been wasted so quickly. And, yes, there is fraud involved, there \nis abuse involved, and it is the case that there is a dramatic amount \nof taxpayers' money that is now being wasted.\n  I went through this morning a description of what is happening in \nsome areas. In our policy committee, we held hearings over 3 years \nabout this issue. This is a photograph which I showed this morning of \nthis man, the man with the brown belt. He was actually in his office in \nIraq. These are $100 bills wrapped in Saran Wrap. This represents $2 \nmillion, and it was to be paid to a company called Custer Battles, \nnamed after Mr. Custer and Mr. Battles. They are two folks who went to \nIraq to seek their fortune--one I believe a former Army Ranger. Neither \nhad experience as contractors, but they knew there was a lot of money \nto be made. They went to Iraq to set up a company. They got there, and \nthe first contract, I believe, which they received was to provide \nsecurity at the Baghdad Airport, which at that point wasn't open.\n  As they provided security at the Baghdad Airport, whistleblowers came \nforward who were working for them and said: What is going on here is \nreally pretty awful. In fact, one of the whistleblowers was threatened. \nSomeone threatened to kill him for speaking out. But they said it is \nwrong and awful. This company that had the contract for security at \nBaghdad Airport took forklift trucks off the airport, which belonged to \nthe airport, put them in a warehouse, painted them blue, and sold them \nback to the Coalition Provisional Authority. It is the sort of thing \nthat was going on.\n  This picture of $100 bills wrapped in Saran Wrap was $2 million that \nwas paid to this company called Custer Battles. This fellow who was in \ncharge of that money said there was a basement with a vault in this \nbuilding in Iraq where he said he thought billions and billions of \ndollars in cash was stored.\n  The message to the contractors in Iraq was: Bring bags because we pay \nin cash. Bring a sack because we pay cash.\n  Then there is the story about a contract for air-conditioning a \nbuilding in Baghdad. The contract goes to a subcontractor, which goes \nto another subcontractor, and a fourth-level subcontractor. And the \npayment for air-conditioning turns out to be payments to four \ncontractors, the fourth of which puts a fan in a room. Yes, the \nAmerican taxpayer paid for an air-conditioner and, after the money goes \nthrough four hands like ice cubes travel around the room, there is a \nfan put in a room in Iraq.\n  I mentioned this morning that every time you talk about this you have \nto talk about Halliburton. Every time you talk about Halliburton, they \nsay you are talking about Vice President Cheney. Not true. He hasn't \nrun Halliburton for many years, but this company received very large, \nno-bid, sole-source contracts worth billions of dollars and massive \namounts of money have been wasted.\n  Investigators and inspectors at the Department of Defense discovered \nthis contractor had overcharged. The contracts were in some cases \nawarded under questionable circumstances.\n  I described just a few of the examples today, such as $85,000 new \ntrucks that had a plugged fuel pump and left by the side of the road--\nbrand new--to be burned; $85,000 brand new trucks with a flat tire, \nleft beside the road to be torched.\n  It is pretty unbelievable, the stories we have heard about what is \ngoing on with these contractors in Iraq.\n  The buyer for Kellogg, Brown & Root, a subcontractor for Halliburton, \ncame and testified. He was a purchaser stationed in Kuwait. His job was \nto purchase things that the Army needed in Iraq. He was told you should \npurchase hand towels for the military. So he gets about the business of \nbuying hand towels--tens of thousands of hand towels, except he was \ntold by his bosses, KBR, don't buy just the ordinary hand towels. We \nwant to have them embroidered ``KBR,'' for Kellogg, Brown & Root, \ntherefore doubling the price. Buy the towels, doubling the price. It \ndoesn't matter. The taxpayer is paying for all of this, and it has \ncost-plus. Don't worry, be happy. Charge as much as you can.\n  And $7,500 a month to lease an SUV; $45 a case for Coca-Cola. It \ndoesn't matter. The taxpayer is paying the bill. Order 25 tons of \nnails, 50,000 pounds, the wrong size, doesn't matter, lay them on the \nsand in Iraq. Nobody will know. Just 25 tons of nails.\n  The stories are pretty unbelievable.\n  Frankly, one of the great surprises to me is that the Pentagon has \nnot been very interested.\n  A guy named Rory came over here. He was actually in Iraq. He was a \nfood service supervisor at Kellogg, Brown & Root. He was a supervisor \nin the food service kitchen. He said the convoys of trucks that were \nhauling food in would occasionally be attacked. There was shrapnel in \nthe back of the trucks. They were told to go back and pick the shrapnel \nout of the food, save the bullets as souvenirs for the supervisors, but \npull the fragments out of the food and put the food in the food line. \nAnd then he said: Routinely we would have food that had an expired date \nstamp. This food is good until August 22nd, expired; routinely expired \nfood. What did the supervisor say? It doesn't matter. Just feed it to \nthe troops.\n  I am surprised that Secretary Rumsfeld, for example, didn't become \napoplectic about that. You would think he would have a seizure when \nthey were paying contractors to feed the troops and to feed them \noutdated food and nobody seems to care very much; or feeding 42,000 \npeople, according to the billing record, and only 14,000 people were \neating.\n  I come from really small town of 300 people. We have one little \nrestaurant. You could miss a cheeseburger, or two or three. But to miss \n28,000 meals when you say you fed the troops that you didn't feed? In \nmy hometown, we have a word for that sort of thing.\n  It is unbelievable what is going on and the stories. These aren't \nstories that we have heard second or third-hand. Rory, for example, \nworked there, lived there, served food there in the cafeteria. He was \ntold this.\n  He said this on the record: When the auditors come around to your \nbase in Iraq and come to your food service operation, you dare not talk \nto them. If you talk to Government auditors, you are going to be in \nsome real trouble. One of two things will happen. You will either \nbe fired or you are going to be sent to an area that has intense \nfighting. It turns out that Rory was sent to Fallujah in the middle of \nhostilities there because he had the gall to talk to\n\n[[Page S5856]]\n\nGovernment auditors who were asking questions about what was happening \nin the food service operation.\n\n  No one in this Chamber believes this sort of stuff ought to go on. It \nshouldn't happen. Yet, I think there is so much money being spent with \nbig, sole-source, no-bid contracts being let.\n  I described this woman this morning. I am going to do it again \nbecause I have met her several times now. I think what has happened to \nher is a crying shame. Bunnatine Greenhouse, the highest civilian \nofficial in the Corps of Engineers, rose to become the highest civilian \nofficial to serve in the Corps of Engineers. Well-educated, smart, with \na great career that every supervisor said was excellent by every \nevaluation, this woman knows what she is doing. She is an outstanding \npublic servant. But she ran into some trouble.\n  The trouble was she saw contracts being let that violated contract \nprovisions. She saw meetings being held in which big companies were \npart of the meetings, talking about the new contracts that were going \nto be let. She began to complain, saying: You are violating the rules \nof contracting. The old-boy network didn't like that at all. Bunnatine \nGreenhouse got into trouble for speaking out. She was demoted. This \nwoman who had the courage to speak out against waste, fraud, and abuse \npaid for it with her job.\n  She said:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse relating to the \n     contracts awarded to Kellogg, Brown & Root represents the \n     most blatant and improper contract abuse that I have \n     witnessed during the course of my professional career.\n\n  A career, I might add, was judged--not by the Department of Defense--\nto be outstanding by people outside of the Department of Defense who \nworked with her. For that, she paid with her job. And nobody seems to \ncare.\n  By the way, this job is now being filled by someone who is \nunqualified. The general who made the decision to fill this job with \nsomeone unqualified said it is true the person they put in that job to \nreplace Bunnatine Greenhouse doesn't have the necessary experience, but \nshe is now being trained.\n  That is really helpful. I assume that is what they were doing down at \nFEMA when they put something like seven of the top FEMA officials in \nplace who were cronies who had no experience in disaster preparedness \nor relief. I guess they were being trained too. The problem is \nHurricane Katrina hit and that agency was a mess.\n  We don't need cronyism. We need good, strong professional people who \nhave the courage to speak out when they see something wrong.\n  The amendment that I have offered is very simple. The amendment that \nI have offered deals with war profiteering. Nobody in this Chamber \nbelieves that anybody ought to be justified in profiteering from war. \nIf there are people profiteering from war, there ought to be strong \nsanctions.\n  This amendment includes a number of different pieces of legislation. \nThe war profiteering amendment is one which Senator Leahy constructed \nin the last Congress and brought forward. That is a portion of this \namendment. The amendment deals with contract abuse, requiring \ncompetition in contracting.\n  Also, the amendment has protections for whistleblowers. We ought to \ncare about that.\n  There are about six or eight provisions of this amendment that I \ndescribed earlier today. But I want to conclude with this.\n  I mentioned earlier the Custer Battles company. They are the subject \nat this point of criminal prosecution.\n  The Custer Battles folks are the two men named Custer and Battles. \n``60 Minutes'' just did a program on them on CBS. We held hearings \nabout Custer Battles. They went to Iraq, as I said earlier, and got a \ncontract for security at the airport. They eventually ended up being \npaid more than $100 million in contracts. These are people without \nexperience in contracting. They went to Iraq to seek their fortune and \nto get contracts. And they did.\n  Here is what the Baghdad airport director of security said in a memo \nto the Coalition Provisional Authority. That was us. We were running \nIraq before they created their new government. Here is what the Baghdad \nairport director of security said:\n\n       Custer Battles have shown themselves to be unresponsive, \n     uncooperative, incompetent, deceitful, manipulative and war \n     profiteers. Other than that, they are swell fellows.\n\n  Isn't that unbelievable? Does anybody dare say now that we didn't \nknow what was going on over there? They knew.\n  What is still now going on over there is unbelievable.\n  What we need at this point on behalf of the American taxpayers and on \nbehalf of the troops who put on the uniform and serve this country, and \nwithout question put their lives on the line, what we need on their \nbehalf is an understanding that we are doing the right thing here.\n  This piece of legislation, this authorization bill, is a good bill. \nIt will be a better bill with this amendment because this amendment \nplugs a very big hole that exists with respect to contracting and \nprofiteering.\n  I mentioned earlier today that I have previously offered and will \nagain offer an amendment that establishes a Truman Committee here in \nU.S. Senate. I wasn't around, of course, during the Truman Committee. \nThe Truman Committee was established in the early 1940s at a time when \na Democratic Senator with a Democratic President in the White House \nsaid we have to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse. And he did on a \nbipartisan basis. They put together a special committee, and they sunk \ntheir teeth into this issue of waste, fraud, and abuse. It was \nunbelievable what they discovered. The country was better and stronger \nas a result of it.\n\n  I bet sometimes FDR gritted his teeth over the investigations. But it \nwas not about the White House at all; it was about making sure the \ntaxpayers were getting their money's worth, making sure we were doing \nthe right things for the troops. The same is true now.\n  I don't offer this with any political intent at all. It is just that \nI sat hour after hour after hour and listened to stories--yes, some of \nthem about Custer Battles, some about KRB, some about Halliburton, and \nsome about other companies--and I have seen unbelievable stories and \nheard unbelievable stories about waste, fraud, and abuse. I see very \nlittle desire at the Pentagon to sink their teeth into it and fix the \nproblems.\n  The woman who had the courage to stand up and blow the whistle has \nlost her job. This is not a very hospitable place for people willing to \nhave the courage to speak out. We ought to stand up for Bunny \nGreenhouse and say we need more like her. When you see something wrong, \nyou report it. When you see something bad, you stop it. We need more \npeople like her.\n  This amendment is not about her; it is about protecting people who \nhave the courage to stand up for our interests and who care about what \nis being spent, what is being done, who care about when we are being \ndefrauded and when people are war-profiteering.\n  I ask consent that Senator Kennedy and Senator Clinton be added as \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that this \namendment is not aimed at the White House. It is not aimed at some \npolitical objective. It is certainly not aimed at the chairman and \nranking member of this bill. This is aimed at trying to find common \nsense in the way we deal with these issues, especially in wartime.\n  I mentioned this morning that common sense is sometimes described as \ngenius in work clothes. Common sense could take us a long way if we \njust applied it in these circumstances. We understand what happens when \na company gets a special deal--by the way, you get a big old contract \nworth billions of dollars, you do not have to bid on it, and we will \nnegotiate the terms later. I understand what happens then. That is like \nleaving the till open. The stories that come from it are unbelievable. \nOn behalf of the American taxpayer, we ought to do something about it.\n  Perhaps my colleague wishes to respond.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to my \ncolleague. I spoke earlier about what our committee had done. The \norganization is now in place to try to monitor the situations the \nSenator has enumerated.\n\n[[Page S5857]]\n\n  We will proceed to a vote at 3:45. I will at that time seek to be \nrecognized for the purpose of tabling the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this \njuncture a paper provided by the Department of Defense, a copy of which \nI hand to my distinguished colleague, which recites the Department's \nunderstanding with regard to the career of this woman to whom the \nSenator has referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Information Paper\n\n       Effective August 27, 2005, Ms. Greenhouse was removed from \n     her position in the Senior Executive Service (SES) as the \n     Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting at the U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and placed in a GS-15 \n     position. Her removal was required by Title 5, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, Section 359.501, because she had \n     received two final performance ratings of ``less than fully \n     successful'' within three consecutive years.\n       The two performance ratings at issue covered the rating \n     periods from October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2002 and \n     from October 1, 2002 through December 31, 2003. The second \n     rating period was extended for three months to ensure that \n     Ms. Greenhouse was afforded a minimum of 120 days working \n     under a set of approved performance standards and to give her \n     additional time to demonstrate successful performance. \n     Further, because USACE officials had proposed Ms. \n     Greenhouse's removal from the SES, both of these ratings were \n     reviewed by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for \n     Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA-AL), who has \n     functional responsibility for all Army acquisition \n     activities, and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for \n     Manpower and Reserve Affairs, who has responsibility for \n     management of the SES.\n       On October 5, 2004, Lieutenant General (LTG) Carl Strock, \n     Commanding General, USACE, advised Ms. Greenhouse that she \n     would be removed from the SES and placed in a GS-15 position \n     effective November 13, 2004, based on her receipt of two \n     final ratings of ``less than fully successful'' performance \n     within three consecutive years. By letter of October 21, \n     2004, to then Acting Secretary of the Army, R.L. Brownlee, \n     Mr. Michael Kohn, an attorney representing Ms. Greenhouse, \n     requested an investigation into alleged procurement \n     irregularities within USACE and implied that Ms. Greenhouse \n     faced removal from the SES because of her disclosure of these \n     irregularities. Acting Secretary Brownlee directed suspension \n     of the removal action until a sufficient record was available \n     to address the matters raised in Mr. Kohn's letter. \n     Concurrently, Mr. Brownlee directed the forwarding of Ms. \n     Greenhouse's allegations of contracting irregularities to the \n     Inspector General, Department of Defense (IG, DoD) for action \n     as appropriate. There is no record that these allegations \n     are, or have been, the subject of USACE Inspector General \n     inquiry, as set forth in your letter; as detailed below, \n     however, we believe that the IG, DoD is continuing its \n     criminal investigation into procurement matters of interest \n     to Ms. Greenhouse.\n       On June 3, 2005, LTG Strock forwarded a memorandum through \n     the Department of the Army Inspector General (DAIG) to the \n     Secretary of the Army, requesting authorization to proceed \n     with the removal of Ms. Greenhouse from the SES and placement \n     in a GS-15 position within Headquarters, USACE. In support of \n     his request, LTG Strock enclosed an analysis prepared by his \n     staff that demonstrated that Ms. Greenhouse's removal from \n     the SES was based solely on her ``less than fully \n     successful'' performance. This record was reviewed by the \n     Department of the Army Inspector General who forwarded it to \n     the Director, Investigations of Senior Officials, Office of \n     the DoD Inspector General (IG, DoD). On June 13, 2005, the \n     Director advised that ``The criminal investigation into \n     procurement matters of interest to Ms. Greenhouse is \n     continuing. However, there is no basis to delay actions \n     concerning Ms. Greenhouse pending the outcome of that \n     investigation.'' Further, the Director found no basis to \n     delay the proposed removal because of a possible reprisal \n     allegation.\n       Because of the ongoing IG, DoD criminal investigation, it \n     would have been inappropriate for the DAIG to inquire into \n     that matter. However, the DAIG reviewed for regulatory \n     compliance the two ``less than fully successful'' evaluation \n     reports upon which the proposed removal was based and \n     concluded that the USACE had satisfied applicable regulatory \n     requirements. Accordingly, on July 14, 2005, the Army \n     determined that a sufficient record existed to determine that \n     Ms. Greenhouse's removal from the SES was grounded in a \n     documented record of less than fully successful performance, \n     and not because of any allegations she made of contracting \n     irregularities or her decision to testify before Congress.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are awaiting the arrival of Senator \nMcCain. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recognize Senator \nMcCain upon his arrival at the floor.\n  The Senator may wish to ask unanimous consent to place further \nmaterial into the Record after he has had an opportunity to examine \nthat paper. There may be some material the Senator believes should be \nadded.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might just respond briefly, I don't think this is a \nsubstantive answer to the very serious allegations raised by Ms. \nGreenhouse--not just in her statements, but in other documentation \nabout improper meetings, about improper actions by the Corps of \nEngineers, in violation of their own regulations. Nowhere do I see the \nPentagon officials or General Strock willing to address those in their \nspecifics. I will await their response to that, as I have waited now \nfor 2 years, but that answer is not yet forthcoming.\n  It is perfectly fine to have this printed in the Record. I will, \nduring this debate, evaluate it and also respond to it, but even with \nthis, we have never gotten a straight answer from the Pentagon about \nthese issues. They are very anxious and interested in making sure there \nare no waves around this on contracting because they have their own way \nof doing things, and if it does not work out, that is tough, they do \nnot want news coverage.\n  Mr. WARNER. I got unanimous consent to have this printed in the \nRecord but as a courtesy gave the Senator a copy thinking the Senator \nmay wish to supplement it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the courtesy of Senator Warner, and I may do \nso at an appropriate time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, these days it seems rare that we debate a \nnonpartisan issue. Too many of the items that Congress considers have \nmore to do with spin than substance, are based more on politics than \npolicy. It is a disturbing trend and that is why I am proud to rise as \na cosponsor of the amendment introduced by my colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan.\n  The issue addressed by the Senator's amendment--the fleecing of \nAmerican taxpayers by war profiteers and corrupt contractors--should \ndisturb every American. My colleague from North Dakota constructed his \namendment, which is based on legislation that I have also cosponsored, \nin reaction to testimony presented at several hearings he held on \ncontracting fraud. At those hearings, witnesses presented example upon \nexample of blatant misuse of taxpayer dollars. Witnesses testified \nabout abuse ranging from the towels given to our troops to the meals \nthey were served. At every opportunity, no-bid contract winners took \nadvantage of the fact that we are at war to fill their own coffers. \nThat is not a partisan issue--that is a crime.\n  It is a crime that requires punishment, and it is a crime that we \ncould prevent with greater transparency and accountability. That is \nwhat this amendment would do. The amendment establishes penalties of up \nto 20 years in prison and at least $1 million in fines for war \nprofiteering. It also prohibits the award of Federal contracts to \ncompanies that have a history of failing to comply with the law. \nFinally, the amendment requires real competition: For any contract \nworth more than $10 million, contractors would be allowed to compete, \nrather than have all the work automatically go to a single contractor.\n  This is a commonsense approach to an appalling problem. When we ask \nour troops and their families to make the ultimate sacrifice, it is \nrepugnant to think that there are those who seek to profit off that \nsacrifice. Contract fraud does more than cost the taxpayers money--it \nabuses their confidence. We owe it to our troops, and to the American \npublic, to do all we can to protect such abuses. Senator Dorgan's \namendment is a step in that direction, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4241\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of my friend from \nVirginia for a very brief two amendments, one which will be very \nbrief--I do not believe he will object too strenuously--and that is to \nname this act after the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia.\n  I ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4241 for\n\n[[Page S5858]]\n\n     himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Levin, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Roberts, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, \n     Mr. Reed, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Talent, Mr. Nelson of \n     Florida, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Graham, \n     Mr. Dayton, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. Clinton, \n     Mr. Thune, Mr. Allard, and Mr. Allen.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To name the Act after John Warner, a Senator from Virginia)\n\n       On page 2, strike lines 1 through 3, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``John \n     Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2007''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Senator John Warner of Virginia was elected a member of \n     the United States Senate on November 7, 1978, for a full term \n     beginning on January 3, 1979. He was subsequently appointed \n     by the Governor of Virginia to fill a vacancy on January 2, \n     1979, and has served continuously since that date. He was \n     appointed a member of the Committee on Armed Services in \n     January 1979, and has served continuously on the Committee \n     since that date, a period of nearly 28 years. Senator \n     Warner's service on the Committee represents nearly half of \n     its existence since it was established after World War II.\n       (2) Senator Warner came to the Senate and the Committee on \n     Armed Services after a distinguished record of service to the \n     Nation, including combat service in the Armed Forces and high \n     civilian office.\n       (3) Senator Warner enlisted in the United States Navy upon \n     graduation from high school in 1945, and served until the \n     summer of 1946, when he was discharged as a Petty Officer 3rd \n     Class. He then attended Washington and Lee University on the \n     G.I. Bill. He graduated in 1949 and entered the University of \n     Virginia Law School.\n       (4) Upon the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Senator \n     Warner volunteered for active duty, interrupting his \n     education to accept a commission in the United States Marine \n     Corps. He served in combat in Korea as a ground officer in \n     the First Marine Air Wing. Following his active service, he \n     remained in the Marine Corps Reserve for several years, \n     attaining the rank of captain.\n       (5) Senator Warner resumed his legal education upon \n     returning from the Korean War and graduated from the \n     University of Virginia Law School in 1953. He was selected by \n     the late Chief Judge E. Barrett Prettyman of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n     as his law clerk. After his service to Judge Prettyman, \n     Senator Warner became an Assistant United States Attorney in \n     the District of Columbia, and later entered private law \n     practice.\n       (6) In 1969, the Senate gave its advice and consent to the \n     appointment of Senator Warner as Under Secretary of the Navy. \n     He served in this position until 1972, when he was confirmed \n     and appointed as the 61st Secretary of the Navy since the \n     office was established in 1798. As Secretary, Senator Warner \n     was the principal United States negotiator and signatory of \n     the Incidents at Sea Executive Agreement with the Soviet \n     Union, which was signed in 1972 and remains in effect today. \n     It has served as the model for similar agreements between \n     states covering the operation of naval ships and aircraft in \n     international sea lanes throughout the world.\n       (7) Senator Warner left the Department of the Navy in 1974. \n     His next public service was as Director of the American \n     Revolution Bicentennial Commission. In this capacity, he \n     coordinated the celebration of the Nation's founding, \n     directing the Federal role in all 50 States and in over 20 \n     foreign nations.\n       (8) Senator Warner has served as chairman of the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the United States Senate from 1999 to \n     2001, and again since January 2003. He served as ranking \n     minority member of the committee from 1987 to 1993, and again \n     from 2001 to 2003. Senator Warner concludes his service as \n     chairman at the end of the 109th Congress, but will remain a \n     member of the committee.\n       (9) This Act is the twenty-eighth annual authorization act \n     for the Department of Defense for which Senator Warner has \n     taken a major responsibility as a member of the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the United States Senate, and the \n     fourteenth for which he has exercised a leadership role as \n     chairman or ranking minority member of the committee.\n       (10) Senator Warner, as seaman, Marine officer, Under \n     Secretary and Secretary of the Navy, and member, ranking \n     minority member, and chairman of the Committee on Armed \n     Services, has made unique and lasting contributions to the \n     national security of the United States.\n       (11) It is altogether fitting and proper that his Act, the \n     last annual authorization Act for the national defense that \n     Senator Warner manages in and for the United States Senate as \n     chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, be named in his \n     honor, as provided in subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would name the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 after the chairman of \nthe Committee on Armed Services, our distinguished friend and colleague \nfrom Virginia, John Warner. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenators Frist, Levin, Inhofe, Kennedy, Roberts, Byrd, Sessions, \nLieberman, Collins, Jack Reed, Ensign, Akaka, Talent, Bill Nelson, \nChambliss, Ben Nelson, Graham, Dayton, Dole, Bayh, Cornyn, Clinton, \nThune, Allard, and Allen.\n  I am certain that there is not a Senator in this Senate who would not \nagree that Senator Warner, with his grace, courtliness, bipartisan \nattitude, and kindness to all, represents the finest traditions of the \nSenate. All Senators know that the defense authorization bill occupies \na major place in the annual legislative calendar and takes substantial \ntime to complete. Those Senators who do not have the privilege of \nserving on the Committee on Armed Services may not realize the \ntremendous amount of work that goes into hearings, formulation of \nlegislative proposals, preparation for markup, and actual markup of \nthis bill--the largest annually recurring piece of legislation in \nCongress. When one adds to this the oversight of the largest department \nin the Government, and the processing of thousands of military and \ncivilian nominations each year, the demands on the chairman of the \ncommittee and the need for leadership are obvious. For 6 years, John \nWarner has provided that leadership, and done it in a manner that has \ngained him universal respect.\n  John Warner is, first and foremost a Virginian--a lifetime resident \nof that Old Dominion that has stood at the center of American history \nfor over two centuries and has given Nation so many of its eminent men, \nfrom Washington forward. John Warner has continued that tradition of \nservice to country from his youth. The son of a decorated Army \nphysician in World War I, John Warner left high school to enlist in the \nNavy late in World War II. He served until 1946, when he was discharged \nas a petty officer 3rd class. Like millions of other young Americans, \nhe then attended college on the G.I. bill, graduating from Washington \nand Lee University in 1949. He then entered the University of Virginia \nLaw School. He interrupted his education to serve in the Korean war, \nvolunteering for active duty and accepting a commission in the Marine \nCorps. He served in the combat zone as a ground officer in the First \nMarine Air Wing, and remained in the Marine Corps Reserve for several \nyears. Upon returning from the Korean war, he resumed his legal \neducation, graduating from the University of Virginia Law School in \n1953.\n  Upon graduation, John Warner's outstanding qualities were recognized \nwhen he was selected to serve as the law clerk to the late Judge E. \nBarrett Prettyman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit, one of the most outstanding jurists of the period. \nMany years later, Senator Warner would be instrumental in naming the \nU.S. Court House in Washington, DC, for his old mentor. After his \nclerkship, John Warner became an Assistant United States Attorney in \nthe District of Columbia, and later was engaged in the private practice \nof law.\n\n  In 1969, President Nixon nominated John Warner to serve as Under \nSecretary of the Navy. The Senate confirmed the nomination, and he \nserved as Under Secretary until he was confirmed and appointed as the \n61st Secretary of the Navy in 1972. During his tenure as Secretary, the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union signed the Incidents at Sea \nExecutive Agreement, for which he was the principal United States \nnegotiator and signatory. This agreement remains in effect today, and \nhas served as a model for similar agreements governing naval vessels \nand aircraft around the world.\n  After leaving the Department of the Navy in 1974, John Warner's next \npublic service was as chairman of the American Revolution Bicentennial \nCommission. He oversaw the celebration of the Nation's founding, \ndirecting the Federal Government's role in a commemoration that \nenbraced all 50 States and over 20 foreign nations.\n  In 1978, the voters of Virginia elected John Warner to a full term in \nthe United States Senate. Upon beginning his service in 1979, he was \nelected a member of the Committee on Armed Services. Upon leaving the \nchairmanship next year, he will have served on\n\n[[Page S5859]]\n\nthe committee for 28 years, almost half of the committee's existence. \nSenator Warner served as chairman of the committee from 1999 to 2001, \nand again since 2003. He also served as ranking member from 1987 to \n1993, and again from 2001 to 2003. For 14 years of American history, \nyears that saw the end of the cold war, the first gulf war, the attacks \non September 11, 2001, and the global war on terror, John Warner has \nserved in a leadership role on the committee.\n  No Member of this body has done more for our national security than \nJohn Warner. As sailor, Marine officer, Under Secretary and Secretary \nof the Navy, and United States Senator, he has always answered his \ncountry's call. The dignified and evenhanded way in which he has \npresided over the business of the committee has enabled it to continue \nits noble tradition of being an island of bipartisanship in an \nincreasingly unpleasant political era. I submit that it is exceedingly \nappropriate that this year's defense authorization act, the last which \nJohn Warner will manage as chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, \nbe named in his honor.\n  If my colleagues will indulge me for just another moment, I would \nlike to relate a personal story, and that has to do with when I \nreturned from prison in Vietnam. John Warner was then serving as \nSecretary of the Navy. Secretary Warner greeted us all with the \ngreatest warmth and affection, but very importantly in my case I had \nrequested to attend the National War College as the next tour of duty. \nThat meant objections for several very good reasons, and yet then-\nSecretary Warner made sure I was allowed to attend that institution of \nhigher learning. He and I have remained friends and comrades since the \nday I returned home in March of 1973, now some 33 years.\n  It has been a privilege and an honor to hold my dear friend, John \nWarner, in my highest esteem and affection. This is a very small token \nfor the esteem in which all of us hold John Warner as a great and \nwonderful leader of this Senate. I could go on for many hours \nrecounting the many wonderful achievements he has made for the people \nof Virginia and for the people of this Nation, but I will refrain from \ndoing so as I know many of my colleagues will want to add their voices \nand sponsorship of this amendment to name the Defense authorization \nbill for 2007 in his name.\n  I ask the vote to be held at the appropriate time, and whether the \nyeas and nays are called for would be up to my colleagues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am deeply moved by the thoughtful \nremarks of my longtime friend. I express my everlasting gratitude first \nand foremost for that friendship and, indeed, the friendship of your \nfather, commander and chief of the U.S. Forces in the Pacific, who \nhelped guide me in those difficult days of Vietnam when I was entrusted \nwith the Department of the Navy.\n  I say to my friend, it is my fervent hope when I step down as \nchairman, as prescribed by the rules of our caucus, I will have the \nprivilege to nominate you to become the next chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. And I am confident that will be confirmed in our \ncaucus and eventually by the full Senate and that you will lead this \ncommittee to greater levels and higher achievements, as has been the \ncase of almost every step of your career.\n  I wish you well and also your family, dear friend.\n  Now, Mr. President, I believe we are going to turn to another \namendment by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, and I am \nprivileged to be a cosponsor of that amendment.\n  I commend the Senator. This is a very important step that you are \ninitiating with regard to the future of how financing the Department of \nDefense is handled in the Congress of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleague from \nArizona and to cosponsor his amendment to name this year's Defense \nauthorization bill after our good friend, Senator John Warner, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  This tribute is eminently well deserved. Senator Warner has had a \nlong and distinguished career of outstanding service to our Nation. He \nenlisted in the Navy at the end of World War II and served with \ndistinction. He then attended Washington and Lee University on the GI \nbill. He volunteered for active duty during the Korean war and served \nas an officer in the Marine Corps, interrupting his studies at the \nUniversity of Virginia Law School.\n  After graduation, he had an impressive legal career. He clerked for \nChief Judge Barrett Prettyman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit and became a Federal prosecutor in the \nDistrict of Columbia before entering private practice.\n  He then returned to Government service as Under Secretary of the Navy \nin the Nixon administration, and I was honored to support his promotion \nto be the 61st Secretary of the Navy in 1972.\n  He was elected to the Senate in 1978 and was a natural for the Armed \nServices Committee. I joined the committee in 1983, and it has been a \nvery great privilege to serve with him and learn from him for the past \ntwo decades. No one cares more about our national defense or our men \nand women in uniform. As chairman of the committee, he has the immense \nrespect of all of us. His leadership ability, eloquence, and dedication \nhave served the Senate, our Armed Forces, and the Nation brilliantly.\n  These annual Defense authorization acts demonstrate our chairman at \nhis best, and naming this bill for him is a fitting tribute to his \nextraordinary leadership and the enduring respect and affection that \nall of us have for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend again for his kind \nwords. If I am so fortunate as to succeed him, I would obviously rely \non him for his continued guidance and stewardship.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4242\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration. The amendment is on behalf of myself, Senator \nWarner, Senator Levin, Senator Graham, Senator Byrd, Senator Gregg, \nSenator Hagel, Senator Chambliss, Senator Collins, Senator Coburn, \nSenator Conrad, and Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. Levin, Mr. Graham, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Gregg, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Chambliss, Ms. Collins, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Conrad, \n     and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 4242.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require regular budgeting for ongoing military operations)\n\n       At the end of subtitle I of title X, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. BUDGETING FOR ONGOING MILITARY OPERATIONS.\n\n       The President's budget submitted pursuant to section \n     1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, for each fiscal year \n     after fiscal year 2007 shall include--\n       (1) a request for funds for such fiscal year for ongoing \n     military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       (2) an estimate of all funds expected to be required in \n     that fiscal year for such operations; and\n       (3) a detailed justification of the funds requested.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment would require regular \nbudgeting for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The \nwar on terror has been going on for nearly 5 years, since that tragic \nday in September 2001. Yet since that time the administration has \nsought to fund the war operations almost entirely through emergency \nsupplemental appropriations measures instead of through its annual \nbudget submissions.\n  The most recent supplemental measure, which the Senate is expected to \npass soon, is the ninth supplemental bill since September 2001. With \nits enactment, we will have provided over $420 billion to pay for \nongoing military operations, reconstruction, and training of Iraqi \nsecurity forces--defense spending that I fully support. And all of that \nmoney is designated as ``emergency'' expenditures--provided without any \noffsetting revenues, as if it were free money. But it is not. It is not \nfree money.\n  I think we can fund this war--and, indeed, win this war--while also \nbudgeting for the war. We know the war is\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\ngoing to cost more than the $420 billion to date, and we know the war \nis not going to end as quickly as most of us would prefer. In fact, \nmany of us see ongoing operations in Afghanistan for an extended period \nof time, hopefully at a low level, hopefully taken over by NATO, \nhopefully Americans not in a major role. But certainly as long as NATO \nis involved, we will continue to see American participation. But we \nneed to continue, and we need to continue our military operations until \nthe job is done. Withdrawing our military presence prematurely is not \nan option in my view, the view of many of my colleagues, nor the view \nof the President or his advisers. We are in it to win.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's unwillingness to budget for the \nwar through the regular process means that neither the White House nor \nthe Congress is making the tough decisions about how we are going to \npay for the ongoing wars. If we continue down this same path, that job \nwill be left to future generations because the expenditures are being \nmade regardless, and eventually their impact on our budget will have to \nbe addressed. The longer we wait to make the tough decisions, the \nbigger the problem will become, and the more difficult making those \ntough decisions will be.\n  Our Nation's future economic success rests in part on the decisions \nwe make today--and the ones we put off. We are facing some dire fiscal \nchallenges in the days ahead. According to the Government \nAccountability Office, the unfunded Federal financial burden--such as \npublic debt, future Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid payments--\ntotals more than $46 trillion, or $156,000 per man, woman, and child in \nAmerica. According to David Walker, the head of the GAO, for a family, \nthis burden is ``like having a $750,000 mortgage--and no house.''\n  But instead of fixing the problem--and fixing it will not be easy--we \nare only succeeding in making it bigger, more unstable, more \ncomplicated, and much more expensive. And adding hundreds of billions \nof dollars that are more conveniently designated as ``emergency'' \nexpenditures--so they do not have to be budgeted for along with other \nnational priorities--is only making our fiscal problems that much \ngreater.\n  Somehow the concept of true emergency funding bills has gotten lost \nalong the way. Take the most recent supplemental appropriations bill. \nThe President requested a total of $94.5 billion to fund our operations \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as additional funding to aid in the \nrecovery efforts along the hurricane-affected gulf coast and other \nurgent needs.\n  I believe the war funding is the largest amount yet proposed in what \nis now almost a routine series of supplemental requests to fund this \nongoing war. A Senate-passed bill provided $108.9 billion in spending--\n$14.4 billion above the level the President has indicated he is willing \nto sign. Despite the efforts of several of us to trim that bill of \nunrequested earmarks and questionable spending, the Senate did not have \nthe will to do so prior to the bill's passage. It wasn't until \nconference, with the looming threat of a sustainable veto, that the \nbill was trimmed. But the fact remains that the funding provided for in \nthat bill is enormous, and it would be more fiscally responsible to be \ndealt with in the annual authorization and appropriations bills.\n  Of course, that supplemental is only the most recent example of why \nthis amendment is necessary. Since 2001, the administration and \nCongress have routinely funded our ongoing operations in Afghanistan \nand Iraq through emergency supplemental appropriations bills. In \naddition, many defense-related activities that should have been \nfinanced through the normal appropriations process have been funded \nthrough these emergency supplementals. And in the process, more and \nmore nondefense-related spending has also been creeping into these \nbills, greatly undermining the budget process.\n  There are several criticisms of the supplemental appropriations \nprocess that I hope the Senate will agree are egregious enough to lend \noverwhelming support for the adoption of the amendment.\n\n  First, unless we take action, ``emergency'' funds will continue to be \nemployed as a way to add spending above that contained under the budget \ncaps. It has become all too routine for the administration to omit what \nshould be normal spending items for the budget it sends to Congress in \nFebruary. Instead, the administration relies on supplementals to fund \ncritical ``must-pass items,'' such as operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, as well as more routine defense spending. Congress then \napproves these requests and regularly tries to augment them with \nnonemergency, nondefense items.\n  Second, supplemental appropriations have diminished responsible \nbudget decisions and proper oversight by Congress. Put aside for a \nmoment that authorizing committees are not consulted with regard to \nsupplemental appropriations in the same manner that occurs during the \nnormal annual budget process. Emergency supplemental appropriations \nrequests are not forwarded to Congress with the same level of budget \njustification and details that are routinely sent to Congress when the \nPresident's annual budget is forwarded in February of each year. If the \nauthorizing and appropriations committees are not allowed to scrutinize \nfully the effectiveness of defense programs and are unwilling to end \nprograms that are not effective, we will continue to have an \nineffectual budget.\n  Third, budgeting annually through emergency supplemental \nappropriations bills encourages pork-barrel spending. I think the 2-\nweek debate on the most recent supplemental is fresh in everyone's \nmind, so I will not mention the many provisions that objections were \nraised against. But the fact is, unrequested add-ons which ultimately \nmake it into the final supplemental appropriations conference reports \nare almost never the subject of a hearing in the authorization and \nappropriations committees. They are seldom, if ever, subjected to a \nrecorded vote in a committee or on the floor of the House or the \nSenate. These items very often are not even included in legislation \ninitially passed by the House or Senate but are instead added by a \nconference committee.\n  Here is a very important aspect of this which I hope all my \ncolleagues will pay attention to because unless we look back in \nhistory, it is hard for us to understand how egregious this process has \nbecome.\n  For the Korean war, which lasted 3 years, there was one supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  During the 11-year Vietnam war, there were four supplemental \nappropriations bills. As soon as troop levels in Southeast Asia stopped \nclimbing, the Johnson and Nixon administrations requested funding for \nongoing operations in the regular Defense authorization and \nappropriations bills.\n  Since 9/11, there have been nine supplemental appropriations bills, \nin 5 years, to fund the ongoing war on terror, including two in each of \nthe years of 2002, 2004, and 2005. Over 90 percent of the funding for \nIraq and Afghanistan ongoing operations--ongoing operations--has been \nfunded through one to two emergency supplemental appropriations bills \neach year for the past 5 years. It now totals over $420 billion in \nemergency supplemental funding.\n  So we pass budgets, we put caps on budgets, and then we add $80 \nbillion, $90 billion, $100 billion--in total, over the last 5 years, \n$420 billion--despite the fact that during this time Congress provided \nover $2.2 trillion for defense-related expenditures in the regular \nannual defense spending bills.\n  We are blowing the budget process. We are carving gigantic holes in \nthe system. And we are removing the authorizing committees and, to a \ndegree, the appropriating committees from the scrutiny and oversight \nthat is our responsibility. It is not our privilege to oversight the \nspending of our taxpayers' dollars and the authorization and \nappropriation of it; it is our responsibility. When we look at these \nemergency supplementals, we find more and more items which really have \nnothing to do with the war in Iraq. They may be replacements for \nequipment that was used in Iraq, but haven't we reached the point, in \nboth Iraq and Afghanistan, where we can plan ahead in a normal \nbudgetary process?\n  I wish to emphasize, again, if there is a genuine emergency, I will \nbe the first Member of the Senate to suggest and approve of a genuine \nemergency. This in no way--this in no way--reduces the\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\nexecutive branch's or the legislative branch's ability to approve \nemergency supplemental bills if they are genuine emergencies.\n  Now, if someone objects to this amendment, I wonder how we were able \nto need only one supplemental appropriations bill during the entire \nKorean war or why during the entire 11-year Vietnam war there were only \nfour. But somehow, now we have had to have nine emergency supplemental \nbills in 5 years, and it now totals over $420 billion in emergency \nsupplemental funding.\n  Now, in the interest of straight talk, if I were a member of the \nexecutive branch, I would find this a very convenient way. Isn't it a \nlot easier to just ask for an emergency supplemental and write out the \ndetails of it and have it passed rather than going through the normal \nbudgeting process, which I will admit is somewhat cumbersome? But it \nwas intended to be because of Congress's responsibilities to oversight \nthe taxpayers' dollars.\n  So this amendment is about fiscal responsibility. Most of us have \nvoted in recent years to support several sense-of-the-Senate amendments \nstating that the war should be budgeted for in the regular process. In \nfact, just this past April 27, the Senate voted 94 to 0 to approve such \nan amendment. I have supported that proposition each time it has been \noffered. The amendment before us would put real meaning into the \npositions we have previously voted to support.\n\n  Let me also be clear about what this amendment does not do. It does \nnot seek to prevent any future emergency funding requests for war \noperations. It does require budgeting for the ongoing expenses we know \nare going to occur. If next year, after the budget is submitted in \nFebruary, a totally unforeseen expenditure arises that must be urgently \naddressed, the administration would have the ability to submit a \nsupplemental request. But simple cost-of-doing business expenditures--\ncosts that can be estimated and budgeted for--would not be allowed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend the time \nfor the vote by 5 minutes and that I be recognized at the conclusion of \nthe 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Since my colleagues anticipate a vote, I will be brief.\n  We could sit down now and figure out probably most of the costs for \noperations in the coming year, 2 years, in Afghanistan and Iraq. We \nhave a good idea as to what kind of budgeting we are going to have to \nbe involved in and what the necessary authorization and appropriation \nwill be. I want to emphasize: This amendment in no way impairs the \nability to enact another emergency supplemental if it is required. What \nwe are doing now is an end run around the authorizing, appropriating, \nand budgeting processes, and we are lying to the American people when \nwe say we are only going to spend so many dollars on the various \nfunctions of Government; in this case, on Defense and military \nexpenditures.\n  I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I inquire of the distinguished Senator if he has any \nway of estimating the amount of further debate on this amendment \nbecause we could quite likely schedule it for a vote this evening, \nsubject to his concurrence.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In response, I ask my colleague from Michigan, I don't \nknow of others who have asked to speak on it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand Senator Byrd would like to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My remarks in support of the McCain amendment will be \nfairly brief, but Senator Byrd does wish to speak on the amendment. We \nare trying to ascertain how much time he desires.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine, then I ask unanimous consent that upon the \nconclusion of the scheduled vote, the Chair recognize the Senator from \nArizona for such additional remarks as he may wish to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Stevens be added as \na cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me congratulate Senator McCain, not \njust for his honesty in the budgeting amendment, but also for the \nprevious amendment which he brought up while I was absent from the \nfloor and which I am proud and pleased to cosponsor, which would name \nthis bill after our esteemed colleague, Senator Warner. We will have a \nlot more to say about that later, but it is the right thing to do. I \nknow there will more Members on the Senate floor when we accomplish \nthat wonderful goal.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my longtime colleague and friend, Senator Levin, \nfor his remarks.\n  I advise the Senate at this time we will proceed to the vote. I will \nmomentarily make a tabling motion, and then upon conclusion of the \nvote, we will return to the McCain amendment. It would be my fervent \nhope that we can have a vote on that amendment prior to the time the \nleadership desires that floor activities be terminated.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4230\n\n  I move to table the Dorgan amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKerry) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 169 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Kerry\n     Rockefeller\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 5 o'clock today be equally divided between myself and Senator \nMcCain and the Democratic leader or his designee, with 20 minutes of \nthe Democratic leader time under the control of Senator Byrd, and that \nat 5 o'clock a vote occur in relation to the McCain amendment No. 4242, \nwith no further intervening action or debate, and no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, I wonder if \nthe Senator can make room in there for an additional 3 minutes under \nour control\n\n[[Page S5862]]\n\nso I can speak in favor. We can work that out.\n  Mr. WARNER. I assure the Senator he will have time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to advise colleagues that it may be \nthat we can expedite the vote prior to 5 p.m. So it really, in a sense, \nis no later than 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may we have order, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order in the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is entitled to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia, the West Virginian, the gentleman from West \nVirginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4242\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill that would bring the total amount of \nfunds appropriated for the war in Iraq to $318 billion. That is $318 \nfor every minute--every minute--since Jesus Christ was born. Think of \nit. That is a staggering amount of money. The total amount of funds \nappropriated for the war in Iraq is $318 billion. But that is not the \nwhole story.\n  According to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service, \nthe monthly cost of the war in Iraq is going up, up, up, right into the \nstratosphere.\n  During the opening phases of the war, the cost of the war was \nestimated to be $4.4 billion per month. According to the new CRS \nestimates, that pricetag will rise to an average of $8.1 billion for \neach month of the next year $8.1 billion. In other words, $8.10, or \nmore, for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. How can this be? \nHow is it that after 3 years of war the cost of operations in Iraq has \ngone up by 80 percent?\n  Part of the problem is that funding for the war is being hidden--yes, \nhidden. Where is it?--hidden from the normal budget authorization and \nappropriations process. Instead of the President providing Congress \nwith an estimate of how much the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan--there \nare two of them--how much the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost \neach year, the administration has chosen to hide those costs. Where? In \nemergency spending bills.\n  Since the war in Iraq began in March 2003, the Congress has enacted \neight emergency supplemental appropriations bills. None of these \nmeasures received the full scrutiny--the full scrutiny--that is so \nnecessary for such massive expenditures. The President refuses to \ninclude the full cost of these wars in his regular budget request. \nInstead, the President sends to the Congress emergency requests with \nlittle or no detailed justification.\n  Five times I have offered amendments in the Senate urging the \nPresident to budget for the cost of the two wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Five times. And five times those amendments have been \napproved, most recently on April 24, 2006, by a unanimous vote--hear \nme, a unanimous vote--of 94 to 0. However, the White House has shown no \nsign that it will take the fiscally responsible course of beginning to \nbudget for the cost of the wars.\n  There are two wars going on. One, I supported the war in Afghanistan. \nThe other war in Iraq, I did not support our invasion of Iraq for \nconstitutional reasons.\n  I am pleased to work with my colleague, Senator McCain, to build on \nmy previous efforts to urge the administration to budget for the war. \nWe are there. We are in there. Our men and women are there, and we are \ngoing to support them. I didn't support the policies that sent them \nthere, but I support them, the men and women, our men and women who are \nover there.\n  The amendment before the Senate, of which I am a proud cosponsor, \nwould create a requirement in law to force the administration to give a \nfull year's estimate of the cost of military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. What is wrong with that? The amendment before the Senate, \nof which I am a proud cosponsor, would create a requirement in law--a \nrequirement in law--to force the administration to give a full year's \nestimate of the cost of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n  The amendment also requires the administration to submit a detailed \njustification of the administration's budget request. As the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, I expect that this \njustification would include a breakdown of the funding request by each \nappropriations account and detailed information about prior years' war \nspending. The very last thing that Congress wants to see is a \ngargantuan request of scores of billions of dollars in the form of a \nslush fund or a no-strings-attached transfer account.\n  This is the people's money. Do my colleagues know that? Think about \nit. Whose money is this that we are talking about? It is the people's \nmoney, those people out there who are watching this Senate through \nthose lenses. That is their money, the people's money that we are \ntalking about, and the American public has the right to demand \naccountability.\n  With this amendment, the Senate is charging a fiscally responsible \ncourse which can generate a real debate on the cost of these wars. That \nis a debate that is long overdue--long overdue--and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n\n\n                                Flag Day\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, ``Hats off! Hats off! The flag is passing \nby. Hats off! The flag is passing by.''\n  Those are the powerful words of Henry Holcomb Bennett in his stirring \npoem, ``The Flag Goes By.''\n  I recite those words because today, this day, is June 14, Flag Day. \nYes, Flag Day. There by the President's desk, that flag. This day is \nFlag Day, the day that Americans pause to celebrate and show our \nrespect for our great national emblem, the American flag. This, \nunfortunately, is not a Federal holiday but, in my opinion, is one of \nthe most important days of the year. This is a day filled with so much \nmeaning, so much symbolism, so much history.\n  It was on June 14, 1777, that the Continental Congress adopted the \nFlag Act that established the official flag of the United States of \nAmerica. The 13 Colonies assembled in the Continental Congress took \nthis action because they understood the need for a symbol of our \nnational unity.\n  During the early days of the American Revolution, the Colonial Armies \nwere fighting under the banners of their individual Colonies or, in \nsome cases, of their local militia units. The banner of New England, \nfor example, was the Liberty Tree. Do you remember the Liberty Tree? It \nshowed a green pine tree on a field of white, with the words ``An \nAppeal To Heaven.'' Oh, the Liberty Tree, which showed a green pine \ntree on a field of white, with the words ``An Appeal To Heaven.'' The \nMinutemen from Culpepper County, VA waved a flag with a coiled \nrattlesnake which carried the motto ``Liberty or Death'' and the \nwarning ``Don't Tread on Me.'' The flag of militia units in Charleston, \nSC proclaimed ``Liberty'' in white letters on a field of blue.\n  This diversity of flags seemed to reflect a lack of unity among the \nColonies. Feeling the need to establish a symbol of national unity, on \nJune 14, 1777, 229 years ago today, the Congress resolved:\n\n       That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen \n     stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen \n     stars, white in a blue field, representing a new \n     constellation.\n\n  Mr. President, I have always been impressed with the wisdom and the \nforesight of the Founders of our country, and here again, we can see \ntheir brilliance. The simplicity of that chosen pattern, alternating \nstripes and crisp new stars, white stars on a field of blue, allowed \nour flag to evolve along with the ever-changing map of America. The \nflag they chose has become the most visible symbol of our Nation. The \nflag they chose has become our most beloved and respected national \nicon. That flag symbolizes our Nation's strength, our Nation's honor, \nour Nation's ideals, and our national purpose. It recognizes our \nglorious past while it celebrates a more glorious future.\n  Legends abound regarding who actually created the first American \nflag.\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\nThe American Naval hero John Paul Jones and Francis Hopkinson, a signer \nof the Declaration of Independence, have both been cited as possible \ncreators, as has John Hulbert of Long Island, NY. Tradition, of course, \ngenerally attributes the first flag to Betsy Ross. I like to believe in \nthat version of the story, because it appeals to my sense of the \nAmerican spirit and to my belief that each and every citizen has a \nresponsibility to our Nation. It is a story of the powerful father of \nour country visiting a humble needle woman in her house and asking her \nto undertake the monumental task of making the first American flag.\n  Whoever created the first flag, within a few months of its unveiling, \nthe flag was under fire for the first time in the battles of Bennington \nand Brandywine. A few months later, on November 1, 1777, our national \nbanner went to sea for the first time when Captain John Paul Jones set \nsail in his sloop, the ``Ranger,'' from Portsmouth, NH, for France. \nWhen the French fleet saluted his ship off the coast of that country on \nFebruary 14, 1778, it marked the first time that foreign vessels had \nacknowledged the American flag. With the winning of independence in \n1783, the American flag was recognized as the banner of the United \nStates of America throughout the world.\n  Twenty years later that flag was under fire again, this time in the \nWar of 1812. On the night of September 13, 1814, British ships on their \nway to Baltimore, not far from here, bombarded Fort McHenry, which \nblocked their entry. When morning came--yes, when morning came, the \nstar spangled banner was still waving, revealing to Francis Scott Key \nthat the enemy had failed to penetrate the American lines of defense. \nImpressed by this awesome, awesome, glorious sight, Francis Scott Key \nwas inspired to write the immortal lyrics that Congress later adopted \nas our National Anthem.\n  How we all love to recall the stirring words from the second stanza.\n\n       'Tis the Star-Spangled Banner: O long may it wave O'er the \n     land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\n  In 1824 came that eventful day in Salem, MA, when a group of women \npresented a beautiful 12- by 24-foot flag to Sea Captain William \nDriver, who was about to embark upon a global voyage. After the flag \nwas hoisted from the ship's masthead, Captain Driver looked at the flag \nwaving so heroically in the wind, and he exclaimed, ``Old, Glory! Old \nGlory!'' Ever since that time, the name has been used to symbolize our \nlove and our respect for our national emblem.\n  There it is, Old Glory.\n  In our dangerous and uncertain world, Old Glory has always been \nthere. It was there before you were born, before I was born--yes. It \nwas there, always there, guiding us, inspiring us, giving us hope as \nwell as direction.\n  President Woodrow Wilson--I was born during his administration--\nPresident Woodrow Wilson once remarked, ``Though silent, it speaks to \nus.'' How right he was. Its mere presence stirs emotions. Look at it \nthere by the President's desk. Its mere presence--there it stands--its \nmere presence stirs emotions.\n  The flag embodies our ideals of freedom, justice, and brotherhood, \nvalues that are deeply rooted in the best of our political and \nspiritual emotions and traditions. The flag means home, the safety and \nsecurity of home, and tells us that freedom still lives in this land we \nlove.\n  The flag symbolizes our values and ideals as well as our power, our \neconomic and military might. The flag rallies the courage of American \nmen and women and children.\n  Our flag has been a guide and an inspiration to our Armed Forces. It \nhas inspired our men and women to deeds of valor and sacrifice. Who can \nthink of the American flag without thinking of the marines heroically \nplanting that flag on top of Iwo Jima during World War II or American \nastronauts planting it on the moon or those New York City firefighters \nhoisting the American flag in the rubble of the Trade Towers on \nSeptember 11, 2001?\n  Flag Day was first officially observed in 1877 to celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of the selection of the American flag. For the next 70 \nyears, people and movements across the country promoted efforts to \nestablish a national Flag Day. In one of those attempts, Congressman \nJoseph Goulden of New York, in 1914, introduced legislation to make \nJune 14 a national holiday, to celebrate Flag Day. In testimony to the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, Congressman Goulden explained:\n\n       We would honor ourselves by making it a holiday. I think \n     the love and devotion we all have for the flag and what it \n     represents will tend to make us better citizens.\n\n  And so it was on August 3, 1949, that Congress approved a joint \nresolution that designated June 14 as Flag Day, in commemoration of the \nadoption of the flag of the United States by the Continental Congress.\n  How glad I am that Congress took this action. The American flag sums \nup all the best of our Nation, all that is good and decent in America. \nThroughout our history, it has transcended our differences. It has \naffirmed our common bond as a people and our solemn unity as a Nation.\n  Unfortunately and tragically, some people will always try to use this \nnational icon to stir disunity. This is a shame and a sham because, \nabove everything else, our flag is representative of our national \nunity:\n\n       One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and \n     justice for all.\n\n  ``Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,'' those words, of \ncourse, come from the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, our oath to \ngenerations past and future that we stand together as one great Nation. \nThink of how often throughout the course of the history of our country, \nour Nation, citizens have risen, hands over their hearts, and uttered \nthose words together, knowing that their destinies were interwoven. We \nare bound together like the threads that form the fabric of that flag. \nWe should put our energies to strengthening that bond, not unraveling \nit.\n  That pledge to our flag was originally written in 1892 by Francis \nBellamy and was first used at the dedication of the World Fair in \nChicago. The pledge initially read:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to my flag and the Republic for which \n     it stands, one nation indivisible--with liberty and justice \n     for all.\n\n  The original wording was altered slightly in 1923 and 1924. In 1954--\nand I was there in the House of Representatives when Congress added the \nphrase ``under God'' to the pledge, which President Eisenhower \nexplained:\n\n       In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of \n     religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way \n     we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which \n     forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace \n     and in war.\n\n  That was Dwight Eisenhower.\n  As a result, the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag now reads:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of \n     America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n  So on this birthday of Old Glory, Flag Day, 2006, I join with my \ncolleagues and my fellow citizens in urging that we protect the \nAmerican flag as a force to unite us, not as a tool to divide us. As \nHenry Holcomb Bennett says in his poem, ``more than a flag is passing \nby.''\n\n     Hats off!\n\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,\n     A flash of color beneath the sky:\n     Hats off! The flag is passing by!\n\n     Blue and crimson and white it shines,\n     Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.\n     Hats off!\n     The colors before us fly;\n     But more than the flag is passing by.\n\n     Sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great,\n     Fought to make and to save the State:\n     Weary marches and sinking ships;\n     Cheers of victory on dying lips;\n\n     Days of plenty and years of peace;\n     March of a strong land's swift increase;\n     Equal justice, right and law,\n     Stately honor and reverend awe;\n\n     Sign of a nation, great and strong\n     To ward her people from foreign wrong:\n     Pride and glory and honor, all\n     Live in the colors to stand or fall.\n\n     Hats off!\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums;\n     And loyal hearts are beating high:\n     Hats off!\n     The flag is passing by!\n\n  Happy birthday, Old Glory. Long may you wave. ``O'er the land of the \nfree, and the home of the brave.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I commend our distinguished senior \ncolleague, former majority leader of the\n\n[[Page S5864]]\n\nSenate, for that brilliant speech, most appropriate on this day. I am \ncertain that speech will be carried and viewed by our troops wherever \nthey are in the world. In well over 60-some nations our men and women \nare standing guard tonight, protecting our freedoms.\n  I congratulate you, sir. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished--yes, very \ndistinguished Senator from the great State of Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I fully support the McCain amendment.\n  This amendment would require regular budgeting for ongoing military \noperations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Since 2001, the administration and Congress has funded our ongoing \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan through emergency supplemental \nappropriation bills, as has been the case in previous times in our \nNation's history. As the Congressional Research Service noted in a June \n13, 2006 report, ``Supplementals have been the most frequent means of \nfinancing the initial stages of military operations.''\n  The report continues:\n\n       In general, however, past administrations have requested, \n     and Congress has provided, funding for ongoing military \n     operations in regular appropriations bills as soon as more \n     accurate projections of costs can be made.\n\n  Operations have stabilized to an extent that accurate estimates of \nfuture years' costs of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan may be \nmade. And, it is now time for the administration to present these costs \nas part of the regular budgeting process.\n  Emergency supplemental appropriation requests are not forwarded to \nCongress with the same level of budget justification and details that \nare routinely sent to Congress when the President's annual budget is \nforwarded in February each year. If the authorizing and appropriation \ncommittees are not allowed to scrutinize fully the effectiveness of \ndefense programs, we are not providing the taxpayer with the full \ndiligence due for scrutinizing the President's budget request. While, \nI--and I am sure all my colleagues--fully support our troops, and want \nto ensure they have all the resources they need, we must also provide \nstrong budgetary oversight.\n  We have not always funded our war efforts through routine \nsupplemental appropriations measures. It is worth examining history to \nperceive how the practice has been exploited beyond all reasonable \ndefense, as Senator McCain recently recounted, and it bears repeating:\n  For the Korean war, which lasted 3 years, there was only one \nsupplemental appropriations bill;\n  During the 11-year Vietnam War, there were four supplemental \nappropriation bills. As soon as troop levels in Southeast Asia stopped \nclimbing, the Johnson and Nixon administrations requested funding for \nongoing operations in the regular defense authorization and \nappropriation bills;\n  Since 9/11, there have been nine supplemental appropriation bills in \n5 years to fund the ongoing war on terror, including two in each of the \nyears of 2002, 2004, and 2005. It now totals over $420 billion in \nemergency supplemental funding.\n  Most of us have voted in recent years to support several Sense of the \nSenate amendments stating that the war should be budgeted for in the \nregular process. Just this past April 27, the Senate voted 94-0 to \napprove such an amendment. I fully supported that proposition each time \nit has been offered. Now, this amendment before us would put real \nmeaning into the positions we previously voted to support.\n  Let me also be clear about what this amendment does not do. It does \nnot seek to prevent any future emergency funding requests for war \noperations. But it does require budgeting for the ongoing expenses we \nknow are going to occur. If next year, after the budget is submitted in \nFebruary, a totally unforeseen expenditure arises that must be urgently \naddressed, the administration would have the ability to submit a \nsupplemental request. But simple ``costs of doing business'' \nexpenditures--costs that can be estimated and budgeted for, but are \nmore conveniently funded without any offsets--would not be allowed.\n  I simply say that this amendment goes a long way to restore the \nproper balance, as we lay down our Senate procedures in committees, \nbetween the authorizing process and the appropriators. I do not suggest \nin any way that the appropriators intentionally encroached on the \nauthorizing process. To the contrary. It was because of the exigencies, \nthe difficulty in predicting the expenditures associated with the \ncurrent military operations that necessitated these large \nappropriations. But this amendment will go a long way to restore that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I know my distinguished colleague from Michigan has a few words, and \nthen we will go to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be brief. First, let me thank the \nSenator from West Virginia. He, as always, speaks eloquently. If I can \nmake the claim, he speaks for all of us when he talked about our flag \nand what it means to him. I think he reflected the spirit of every \nMember of this body. I thank him for it.\n  I also thank Senators Byrd and McCain. The McCain-Byrd amendment, \nwhich restores honesty and truthfulness to our budget process by \nreflecting the cost of war, is absolutely essential if we are going to \nhave a realistic budget. Regardless of whether one supports or doesn't \nsupport our going to war or how the operations have taken place, it is \ncritically important that we pay the cost and know what we are paying \nfor and that the budget reflect those costs.\n  The effort has been made year after year to do that but so far \nwithout success because it was not put into law. This amendment of \nSenator McCain and Senator Byrd will put this requirement in law. It is \nessential. I commend both of them for it.\n  I believe all Members of this body, regardless of the differences we \nmay have about our policy on Iraq, should agree that we should budget \nfor and pay for these operations. This week Congress will send to the \nPresident the second FY2006 supplemental which includes another $70 \nbillion on the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, on top of the $50 \nbillion provided in December. That means in the current fiscal year we \nwill spend $120 billion, or $10 billion a month, on these operations--\nand none of it was included in the President's 2006 budget. I can think \nof no clearer evidence of the need for this amendment.\n  In February, I included the following statement in my letter to the \nBudget Committee:\n\n       [T]hese costs should be moved into the regular budget \n     process, rather than continuing to treat them purely as \n     emergency spending. These expenses are not, to use the words \n     of section 402 of last year's budget resolution, \n     ``unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated''. Calling \n     them emergencies does nothing to reduce their impact on our \n     federal deficit and debt. Furthermore, the Quadrennial \n     Defense Review released by the Department of Defense last \n     month asserts that our military is fighting a ``long war'' \n     that ``may last for some years to come''. If this is so, all \n     the more reason to start recognizing the ongoing costs of \n     this ``long war'' in our budget, so we can start paying for \n     it. So far, these costs have been financed entirely by \n     deficit spending. That may be necessary for a short, \n     unforeseen war, but if a ``long war'' is part of our national \n     security reality, it must become part of our fiscal reality, \n     and we must pay for it.\n       There is an additional reason why these costs should be \n     built into our regular budget process. Supplementals are not \n     subjected to the oversight of the authorizing committees. I \n     believe it is time for that to change. The costs of war are \n     enormous, and these costs, starting with the $50 billion \n     budget amendment the administration intends to submit, should \n     receive more oversight, and putting this funding through the \n     normal budget process will help Congress do its oversight job \n     better, which will better serve the American public.\n\n  As I also stated at our Armed Services Committee hearing with \nSecretary Rumsfeld in February that:\n\n       Reponsible budgeting means making choices and setting \n     priorities. This budget request fails that test. It \n     understates the true cost of our defense program because it \n     does not fully recognize or pay for the cost of ongoing \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2007. Funds for those \n     will apparently be requested later this year on an emergency, \n     non-paid for, basis. That is not responsible budgeting. Those \n     costs should be planned on and paid for now. Honest budgeting \n     requires no less.\n\n  It is essential that our budget begin to reflect reality and \nrecognize the enormous cost of these ongoing military operations. I \ncongratulate Senator\n\n[[Page S5865]]\n\nMcCain and Senator Byrd for this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors to this amendment: Senators Snowe, \nEnsign, Lieberman, Obama, Inouye, Akaka, and Salazar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am submitting an amendment today that \naddresses the issue of military assistance to foreign countries. \nSenators Warner and Levin have tried to be responsive to an \nadministration request for increased funding and flexibility in \nproviding assistance to countries that are partners with us in the war \nagainst terrorism. I applaud their efforts and will enumerate the \nproblems that I do not have with the overarching purpose of section \n1206.\n  I agree that there should be a new program that specifically \naddresses the shortcomings that many of our partners in the war against \nterror face in tracking and finding terrorists on their soil or in \nnearby seas.\n  I understand that current security assistance programs, the Foreign \nMilitary Financing program, for example, require a long lead time, \nsometimes 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years from request to delivery of equipment. \nThere are urgent cases now where we need to respond more quickly than \nwe currently can.\n  Nor do I object to providing significant funding for the program. The \nrequest of the administration for $750 million does not seem exorbitant \ngiven the threats that we are trying to address. Nonetheless, I respect \nthe opinion of my fellow authorizers on the Armed Services Committee \nthat there is only $400 million that can be devoted to the problem at \nthis time from the Defense budget.\n  While on the ground floor of organizing such a new activity, however, \nmy concern is that we get the decisionmaking mechanism right. We must \nmake certain that the recipients chosen, the design of the programs, \nand implementation are in the best foreign policy interests of the \nUnited States. We are in this war on terror for the longterm. This is \nan important program that will go through many changes. Recipient \ncountries will change. Areas of the globe where it must focus may \nchange. The propensity of subsequent administrations may change as they \nhave to make their own hard choices.\n  We need to get the basics right now so that we are not faced with a \nsituation some years down the road where we have Cabinet Secretaries at \nodds, struggling with decisions on which countries should receive the \naid, when it should be delivered, and how it should be implemented.\n  Those are decisions that we must insist be overseen by the Secretary \nof State on behalf of the President. Foreign policy must drive foreign \nassistance decisions. We cannot have military aid decisions drive \nforeign policy.\n  This amendment provides the funding that the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee has authorized for the new program while safeguarding the \nprimacy of the State Department in guiding and overseeing the program. \nMy amendment this year builds on an amendment offered by Senator Inhofe \nlast year on the same subject. That amendment passed the Senate \nunanimously when it was accepted by Senators Warner and Levin as the \nproper way to proceed. It, unfortunately, emerged from conference \naltered to authorize a Department of Defense program that is ``jointly \nformulated'' with the Secretary of State and requiring the Secretary of \nDefense to ``coordinate'' with the Secretary of State in program \nimplementation. My amendment is more explicit. While the Inhofe \namendment allowed a direct transfer of funds from the Defense \nDepartment to the State Department, this amendment explicitly creates a \nnew counterterrorism train-and-equip account that is designed for use \nby the Department of Defense but is under the authority of the State \nDepartment. The Department of Defense would be authorized to contribute \nto and withdraw from the fund and would implement the train-and-equip \nprograms funded by the account. Proceeding this way would clarify lines \nof authority and would safeguard the Secretary of State's role as the \nPresident's chief foreign policy advisor and manager of bilateral \nrelationships.\n  My amendment retains an important interagency study due at the end of \nthis year on the issue of military assistance that was contained in \nlast year's section 1206.\n  The Department of State is now better organized to manage the new \naccount established in this amendment. We can expect decisions to be \nmade quickly and efficiently. Randy Tobias is now double-hatted. He has \nbeen named as the Secretary's foreign assistance advisor in addition to \nhis role as the Administrator of USAID. Under his overall guidance, the \nDepartment can perform the necessary coordination both with Ambassadors \nin the field and with regional bureaus to ensure that such a program \nwould be a constructive addition to the bilateral relationship with the \nrecipient country and would contribute to regional stability. These are \njudgments that our Government must make about every foreign assistance \nprogram and the President is best advised on these matters by the \nSecretary of State.\n  I hope that my fellow Senators will take a serious look at this \nproposal and join me in offering it as an amendment to the bill. While \nthe current language of section 1206 requires Secretary of State and \nambassadorial involvement, it is difficult to legislate cooperation \nbetween agencies. A blurring of roles is inevitable if section 1206 \nstands unamended, at a time when foreign policy needs to be coherent, \npersuasive, and successful in the war against terror.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4252\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I spoke yesterday about the terrible \ncourthouse shooting that took place in Reno on Monday, and what we can \ndo in the Senate to help prevent such incidents. In order to move that \nprocess forward, I will offer the text of Court Security Improvement \nAct of 2005 as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill.\n  First, however, I would like to take a moment to update everyone on \nJudge Chuck Weller's condition. Judge Weller, if you remember, was hit \nby a sniper's bullet while standing in the window of his Reno office.\n  According to the latest reports, the judge is in ``good spirits'' and \n``out of the woods.'' The bullet seems to have missed his vital organs, \nand for that, we all thank God.\n  Now that Judge Weller seems to be stabilizing, it is incumbent on all \nof us to do whatever it takes to prevent\n\n[[Page S5866]]\n\nsimilar violence--whether in Reno or any other city. Judges like Chuck \nWeller, their clerks and jurors must be free to serve without threats \nto their lives.\n  The amendment I will offer would improve protections for both Federal \nand State judges. I want to thank Senators Specter and Leahy for all \nthe work they have done in putting this legislation together, and for \ncosponsoring it today.\n  On the Federal level, the amendment allows for better cooperation \nbetween the judiciary and the U.S. Marshal Service. It also puts in \nplace strong measures to protect the personal information of those who \nsit on the Federal bench.\n  At the State level, the amendment would authorize Federal grants to \nimprove security at State courts, like the Reno Family Court where \nJudge Weller works.\n  These Federal grants might be used by States to strengthen courthouse \ninfrastructure, such as adding bullet-proof windows, or it might be \nused to hire additional security personnel in the courthouse. In the \nwake of Monday's shooting, I know the city of Reno and the Washoe \nCounty Commission are looking into both of these steps, and I also know \nthey could use our help.\n  States such as Nevada should always take the lead in protecting their \nown judicial officers, but we can and should make the Federal \nGovernment a better, stronger partner.\n  In our country, we have 32,000 State and local court judges and \napproximately 2,400 Federal judges. Our democracy depends on these men \nand women. They must be able to do their jobs and uphold the law \nwithout fearing for their safety.\n  The time for us to act is now, not after another wake-up call.\n  The shooting of Chuck Weller is a terrible tragedy, but by passing \nthis legislation, we can ensure at least some small measure of good \nresults.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to remember the sacrifices \nof James Lee Krull, Richard Bruce Apland, Victor Art Rabel, David Aaron \nRitzschke, and Richard Lee Lohse, five individuals from Herman, MN, who \ngave their lives for the United States during the Vietnam war.\n  On July 9, 2006, the Herman High School Class of 1967 will gather at \nthe Vietnam War Memorial to remember and memorialize the 36th \nanniversary of the death of classmate James Lee Krull, as well as four \nother brave men from Herman who during the Vietnam war made the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  James Lee Krull was born on November 23, 1949, the older of two \nchildren to Mr. and Mrs. Lean Krull. He attended high school in Herman, \nMN, and graduated with the class of 1967. After graduating from high \nschool he studied welding at Alexandria Technical College and in 1969, \nhe was engaged to be married to Donna Hutchinson.\n  He began his tour of duty in Vietnam on March 11, 1970, as an Army \ncorporal serving as a medic with the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1st \nCavalry Division.\n  On July 9, 1970, Jim died from wounds he received on June 14, 1970, \nwhile on patrol in Cambodia.\n  Jim was a highly decorated soldier. Prior to his death, Jim was \nawarded the Army Commendation Medal for heroism, the Purple Heart, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Vietnam \nCampaign Medal, and the Expert badge with automatic rifle bar. \nPosthumously he was awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Army \nCommendation Medal, and the Combat Medical Badge.\n  Herman, MN, also lost other sons in Vietnam, who we should pause to \nrecognize today.\n  PFC Richard Bruce Apland of the 82nd Airborne died on January 19, \n1969, as a result of injuries suffered while serving in Vietnam.\n  LCpl Victor Art Rabel of the Marine Corps died on February 23, 1969, \nas a result of injuries suffered while serving in Vietnam.\n  PFC David Aaron Ritzschke of the Marine Corps died on July 15, 1967, \nas a result of injuries suffered while serving in Vietnam.\n  PFC Richard Lee Lohse of the 101st Airborne died on May 12, 1968, as \na result of injuries suffered while serving in Vietnam.\n  James Lee Krull once wrote, ``many great men have come from small \ntowns, and now here I am.'' These five men embody this statement. It is \nbecause of this kind of heroism that America remains the greatest \nnation the world has ever known.\n  Again, I thank James Lee Krull, Richard Bruce Apland, Victor Art \nRabel, David Aaron Ritzschke, and Richard Lee Lohse for their sacrifice \nand extend my heartfelt sympathy to the families and friends of those \nbrave men.\n\n\n                 Marine Lance Corporal Richard Z. James\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few moments \ntoday to reflect on the life of Marine LCpl Richard ``Rick'' Z. James. \nRick epitomized the best of our country's brave men and women who \nfought to free Iraq and to secure a new democracy in the Middle East. \nHe exhibited unwavering courage, dutiful service to his country, and \nabove all else, honor. In the way he lived his life--and how we \nremember him--Rick reminds each of us just how good we can be.\n  Rick was born to Carol and Kenneth ``Jake'' James of Seaford in \nNovember 1985. He had two older siblings, Jeff and Tina, and a younger \nbrother, Jonathan. Rick was a 2004 graduate of Seaford Christian \nAcademy, where he played soccer, basketball, and baseball. His friends \nand family remembered him at his memorial service, describing Rick as \nhaving a playful, somewhat mischievous nature and as an enthusiastic \nathlete who thrived on competition and gave his all on the playing \nfield. Fellow U.S. Marine Cpl. Kevin Martens of Salisbury described his \nfriend of 10 years as ``fun, energetic, always trying\n\n[[Page S5867]]\n\nto make people laugh. He was a great guy to be around.''\n  His enthusiasm and thirst for excitement led to his decision to join \nthe Marines shortly before graduation from Seaford Christian Academy in \nJune of 2004. His mother Carol stated, ``That's all he ever wanted to \ndo, and he was thrilled when he was doing military duty.'' Rick's \nfather, when speaking to several hundred friends, family, and members \nof the community gathered for his son's memorial service, said that \n``He always wanted to have the hardest job. In baseball, he wanted to \nbe the catcher. In soccer, he wanted to be center-midfielder. He wanted \nto be involved.'' Above all, Mr. James reminded us that ``Rick had a \ndream and he followed it.'' He then urged us all, ``If you have a \ndream, follow it.''\n  This was Rick's second tour of duty in Iraq serving with Kilo \nCompany, 3rd Battalion, 8th Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine \nExpeditionary Force. The day the young lance corporal lost his life, he \nwas providing security at an over-watch position within a building when \nhe was struck by small arms fire near Ramadi, Iraq. Ramadi is one of \nthe most dangerous spots for our troops in Iraq where, according to an \nembedded reporter on assignment for USA Today, ``about 8 out of 10 of \nKilo's foot patrols engage in contact with the enemy.'' On a daily \nbasis, our marines in Ramadi face threats of sniper attacks and \ncatastrophic roadside bombs.\n  Rick James grew up in the tightly knit community of Seaford, DE. News \nof Rick's death rocked the community, as he was the second Marine from \nSeaford to die in a week's span, and the town's third Iraq war fatality \nsince operations began in 2003. With two funerals within days of one \nanother, the city of Seaford turned out in force to support the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers, lining the streets with American \nflags, in a demonstration of overwhelming compassion and patriotism.\n  One always wonders how a family survives a tragedy like this. After \nspending time with Rick's loved ones, it was very clear to me that this \nfamily, and their son Rick, found their strength through an unwavering \nfaith in God and the support of their family, friends, and community. \nPastor John Reynolds, the lance corporal's cousin said, ``Rick had a \npassion for his family. Rick had a passion for the Marine Corps. Rick \nknew beyond a shadow of a doubt that if something were to happen he'd \nspend eternity with his God. Rick died offering himself for the sake of \nothers.'' Pastor Donnie Reynolds who spoke at the service for Rick \nperhaps said it best. ``Rick did not just exist. He lived out God's \nplan. I believe Rick James is an American hero.'' The evening before, \nduring a quiet moment as we paid our respects to the family, Rick's \nfather said, ``People now refer to his son as a hero, but he has always \nbeen a hero to me.''\n  I rise today to commemorate Rick, to celebrate his life, and to offer \nhis family our support and our deepest sympathy on their tragic loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5867-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FLAG PROTECTION AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today, Flag Day, in support of S.J. \nRes. 12, which seeks to establish a constitutional amendment to ban the \ndesecration of our flag.\n  From the time of our Revolutionary War to this very moment, Old Glory \nhas been the undying symbol of our Nation. While it is a symbol that \nhas many different meanings to many different people, it is the one \nsymbol that represents the hopes and dreams of millions of people who \nhave fled tyranny in another land and fought to preserve freedom here \nat home. More than anything else, it represents the selfless sacrifices \nof previous generations who have willingly laid down their lives so \nthat we can live in the most prosperous and free nation in the history \nof the world.\n  As a Marine, I served under our flag as I proudly do now as the \nSenator from the great State of Montana. Thus, I know a thing or two \nabout what our flag stands for--as does most every veteran who served \nand sacrificed under our flag, or who has fired and been fired upon in \ncombat defending what our flag stands for. Countless millions of \nAmerican soldiers have done and continue to do the same. As we speak, \nthere are over 14,000 Montanans in the service of their country, 1,365 \nof whom are now serving overseas.\n  It is simply an insult to these brave Americans that the sacrifices \nthey have made in the name of liberty under the American flag are spit \non by people who would burn, trample, or otherwise willfully desecrate \nour flag. While we rightly honor the brave men and women who have \nsacrificed their lives, we do not yet honor the symbol for which those \nsacrifices were made by protecting our flag. That is why we need a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Some argue that that it is a form of speech. However, it is sad that \nsomeone cannot defend their arguments or clearly state their national \nhatred without setting a fire? Frankly, if the totality of your \nargument can be summed with gasoline and matches, then you just do not \nhave much of an argument to begin with.\n  Even more striking is that these people, devoid of new ideas, resort \nto tactics used by our enemies abroad. Look at the video of those who \nwould destroy us--protests in Iran, for example. Our enemies burn our \nflag while calling for our deaths because they know it is our symbol \nThey want to destroy us and have no respect for our freedoms and way of \nlife. Sadly, there are some in this country that, while they may or may \nnot share that goal, do share that tactic.\n  We owe it to the generations who came before us and to the brave men \nand women who protect us now to protect the symbol which meant so much \nto them. Far too many have sacrificed too much serving under our flag \nfor me to sit on the sidelines and do nothing. That is why I see it as \nmy duty to voice my support on behalf of all Montanans for a \nconstitutional amendment prohibiting flag desecration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5867-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5867-S5868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RETIREMENT OF SUPERINTENDENT JAMES McCANN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize James McCann, a \ntireless and dynamic educator, on his retirement after 40 years of \nservice in Michigan. For 20 years, Jim has served as district \nsuperintendent of the Lamphere School District with unparalleled \nleadership and vision. His efforts have led to numerous opportunities \nfor his teachers, staff, students, and their families, as well as \nothers across Michigan, and have earned the Lamphere School District \nmany awards and achievements over the years. I know I join many in \nMichigan in congratulating him on a stellar career that has spanned \ndecades and has inspired generations of students to strive for \nexcellence.\n  After earning a teaching degree from Eastern Michigan University and \na master's degree in educational administration from the University of \nMichigan, Mr. McCann has focused his efforts in southeast Michigan. He \nbegan as an educator with the Archdiocese of Detroit. Five years later, \nhe accepted a position with the Lamphere Schools. During his tenure \nwith the Lamphere Schools, he served as an administrative assistant, \nassistant principal, and a principal at various schools in the \ndistrict, and in 1986, he was named the district superintendent.\n  Jim's passion for integrating technology into the classroom has \nearned him national recognition, and I am familiar with Jim's energetic \nand passionate approach to educating young people. I have been \nprivileged to work with Jim on an effort to enhance learning across \nMichigan, and that project has benefited greatly from his innovation \nand enthusiasm.\n  In 1982, Jim attended a summer institute at Harvard University that \nemphasized the importance of using technology to teach multiple \nlearning styles. Recognizing an urgent need to train teachers and staff \nin the district in computer networking, programming and software use, \nhe developed an innovative plan to install cable and wiring in \nclassrooms and to provide a 2-week training program for his teachers. \nThis innovative approach led to Lamphere being the first district in \nMichigan to have Internet access in the classroom, which occured in \n1992.\n  Jim has been the chairman of the Oakland County Superintendents' \nCommittee for Instructional Technology since 1992 and through this \nposition has helped to improve and advance the use of educational \ntechnology in schools throughout Oakland County. In 1996, he was \ninstrumental in bringing\n\n[[Page S5868]]\n\nthe JASON Project to Michigan. This effort established the Lamphere \nSchool District as a JASON Project Primary Interactive Network site for \nMichigan. As host for JASON, Lamphere Schools helped thousands of \nMichigan students experience exciting scientific adventures. In 2001, \nMr. McCann received the first-ever ``Tech-Savvy Superintendent Award'' \nfor his leadership and vision in the area of educational technology, \none of only 10 educators nationwide to earn this distinction by \n``eSchoolNews.''\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating James McCann on \nhis retirement. I am proud to recognize his contributions to education \nand the indelible mark he has made in teaching with technology in \nMichigan. I wish him and his family many more years of good health and \nhappiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5868-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RURAL HOSPITAL AND PROVIDER EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to emphasize the importance of \nenacting into law S. 3500, the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act \nof 2006. I would also like to thank the chairman of the Senate Rural \nHealth Caucus, Senator Thomas, along with Senators Roberts, Conrad, and \nHarkin, for taking the lead on this important piece of legislation.\n  There should be no difference between the quality of care that my \nconstituents in South Dakota receive and constituents in urban States \nsuch as New York receive. Cancer, diabetes, and other diseases do not \ndiscriminate between people in rural or urban areas and there should be \nno discrimination between the health care services available in Lemmon, \nSD, and health care services available in New York City.\n  The Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act extends and builds upon \nthe important rural equity provisions included in the Medicare \nModernization Act. These provisions can mean the difference between \ntraveling 5 miles to the Wagner Community Memorial Hospital or 110 \nmiles to Avera McKennan Hospital in Sioux Falls. These provisions--in \nmore graphic terms--can mean the difference between a fatal heart \nattack and the successful stabilization of a heart attack patient.\n  In order to give a better picture of the benefits of this \nlegislation, I would like to tell you a little bit about the challenges \nof ensuring health care access in South Dakota. My State has 66 \ncounties and an average of 9.9 persons per square mile. The national \naverage for individuals per square mile is 79.6.\n  Of these 66 counties, 44 are classified as medically underserved \nareas, areas that have insufficient health resources, manpower, or \nfacilities to meet the medical needs of the population. The sheer \nvastness of South Dakota poses significant challenges in meeting the \nhealth care needs of our population. The Rural Hospital and Provider \nEquity Act includes hospital, physician, home health, ambulance, and \ntelehealth provisions that can make the distances of South Dakota more \nmanageable and give my constituents access to the quality health care \nthey deserve.\n  This legislation contains many provisions that will allow critical \naccess and sole community hospitals, as well as rural doctors, to \ncontinue providing services to individuals who need it most, I would \nalso like to highlight the telehealth provisions included in this bill \nthat would continue serving rural beneficiaries and expand access to \nthe type of care provided in more urban areas.\n  Telehealth uses telecommunications and information technologies to \nprovide health care services at a distance. It provides individuals in \nremote underserved areas access to specialists and other health care \nproviders through the use of technology. Additionally, the practice of \ntelehealth brings medicine to people--people who live in medically \nunderserved areas and people who are too frail or too ill to leave the \ncomfort of their homes.\n  Section 19 of the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act requires the \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to create \ndemonstration projects that would encourage home health agencies to \nutilize remote monitoring technology. Utilizing technology in the home \nhealth setting would reduce the number of visits by home health aides \nwhile still providing quality care.\n  Each demonstration project is required to include a performance \ntarget for the home health agency. This target would be used to \ndetermine whether the projects are enhancing health outcomes for \nMedicare beneficiaries, as well as saving the program money. Each year, \nthe home health agency participating in the pilot would receive an \nincentive payment based on a percentage of the Medicare savings \nrealized as a result of the pilot project.\n  The demonstration projects would be conducted in both rural and urban \nsettings because medically underserved areas exist across the country. \nThree projects, however, are required to be conducted in a State with a \npopulation of less than 1 million.\n  Although numerous studies have praised the ability of telehealth to \ndeliver care to individuals in remote areas, it has been continually \nunderutilized and hampered by legal, financial, and regulatory \nbarriers. Section 20 of the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act \ndirects the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \nwork with health care stakeholders to adopt provisions allowing for \nmultistate practitioner licensure across State lines for the purposes \nof providing telehealth services. This provision is a step in the right \ndirection of breaking down the barriers that prevent the adoption of \ntelehealth.\n  Technology is improving each and every day and health care systems in \nrural America should be taking advantage of technology to provide \nquality health care in remote underserved areas. The telehealth \nprovisions included in the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act help \npromote the adoption of technology and have the potential to expand \naccess to quality health care.\n  Individuals living in rural areas like my State of South Dakota \ndeserve the same caliber of health care that individuals living in \nurban areas receive. The Medicare Modernization Act was a great start \nto placing rural health care providers on the same level playing field \nwith providers located in urban areas. The Rural Hospital and Provider \nEquity Act continues and expands this level playing field, ensuring \nthat rural Americans have access to high-quality health care services.\n  I thank Senator Thomas for his leadership on this and other rural \nhealth issues and encourage my colleagues to support this important \npiece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5868-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5868-S5869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTERNET SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S. 3499, the \nInternet SAFETY Act, a bill that I have co-sponsored with Senator Kyl \nand other Members of this body.\n  This legislation targets child pornographers, and it continues the \nimportant progress this Congress has made to crack down on those who \ncommit crimes against children.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed S. 1086, which would require \nlifetime registration by sex offenders throughout the United States and \nwould substantially increase punishments for those convicted of sex \ncrimes against children. The House has passed its own sex offender \nbill, which contains many sensible provisions. And the two Chambers are \nnegotiating to resolve their differences. Hopefully we will soon reach \nan agreement--and a tough, smart bill will be reported to the \nPresident.\n  I firmly believe there is only one way to deal with those who prey on \nchildren: they must be caught sooner, punished longer and more \nstringently, and they must be watched much more closely than they are \ntoday. I began advancing this law enforcement theme while I served as \nTexas attorney general. There, I created a specialized unit known as \nthe Texas Internet Bureau to coordinate and direct efforts to fight \nInternet crimes such as fraud, child pornography, and privacy concerns. \nThe Texas Internet Bureau successfully identified several Internet \npredators that were caught, prosecuted and convicted.\n  I will continue to work in the Senate to ensure that law enforcement \nagencies have every tool they need to bring these criminals to justice. \nThe Internet SAFETY Act will play an integral part in bringing child \ncrime predators to justice.\n  This bill creates a new Federal offense for financially facilitating \naccess\n\n[[Page S5869]]\n\nto child pornography on the Internet, mandates penalties for Web site \noperators who insert words or images into their internet source codes \nwith the intent to deceive persons into viewing obscene material on the \ninternet; and requires commercial Web site operators to place warning \nmarks prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission on Web pages that \ncontain sexually explicit material.\n  It is critical that this legislation become law. The supposed \nanonymity of the Internet has apparently emboldened child \npornographers. The availability of child pornography on the Internet is \nstaggering, as is the presence of those who would prey on innocent \nchildren. To illustrate this point, consider that in 1998 the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline received 3,267 \nreports of child pornography. In 2004, the CyberTipline received \n106,119 of these reports, marking more than a thirtyfold increase in \nchild pornography reports in just a 6-year period. This is more than a \ndisturbing trend, and it shows no sign of slowing down.\n  The Internet is uniquely suited to facilitate the creation and \nreplication of pornographic images of children, as well as the speed \nand anonymity to distribute them. And, not surprisingly, criminal \nenterprises spring up for the purpose of distributing child pornography \nand feeding the insatiable desire of those who target children.\n  Let me provide an example from my home State of Texas. Several years \nago, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, in cooperation with Dallas's \nInternet Crimes Against Children, ICAC, task force, was able to locate \nand dismantle a multimillion-dollar child pornography enterprise \nconducting business over the Internet. This effort, dubbed Operation \nAvalanche, resulted in over 7,000 searches and more than 4,000 arrests \naround the world.\n  This Congress simply cannot stop working until we are certain that we \nhave provided all of the resources necessary to stop those who commit \ncrimes by exploiting children. And so this bill, in addition to \nproviding additional legal authorities, also creates an Office on \nSexual Violence and Crimes Against Children within the Department of \nJustice to coordinate sex offender registration and notification \nprograms, directs the Attorney General to provide grants to state and \nlocal governments for child sexual abuse prevention programs, and \nauthorizes 200 additional child exploitation prosecutors in U.S. \nattorneys offices around the country and 20 additional Internet Crimes \nAgainst Children, ICAC, task forces.\n  I urge my colleagues to study this bill carefully. I am hopeful that \nwe can garner enough support to quickly bring it to a vote and pass it \nout of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5869-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SUMMER OF PEACE: AMONG THE NIMIIPUU\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today as cochair of the Lewis and \nClark Bicentennial Congressional Caucus, which has helped communities \nand tribes across the country commemorate the bicentennial of the Lewis \nand Clark expedition. Our goal is to provide resources that promote and \nenhance tourism opportunities that reflect unique local \ncharacteristics, interests, and history along the Lewis and Clark \nTrail.\n  Over the last 3 years, America has commemorated this historic journey \nto the West, celebrating culture and life. This Saturday, we will again \nrecognize the daring journey of the Lewis and Clark expedition that \nhelped discover the West and her vast resources and viewscapes we enjoy \ntoday.\n  The Summer of Peace Signature Event in Idaho is an opportunity for \nall of us to evaluate the long chain of cause and effect that links \npast, present, and future.\n  From the journal entries, we have learned the explorers were not only \ndiscoverers and describers of the unknown land, but also sightseers \nwhose experiences depended on the good will and assistance of \nstrangers.\n  The Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the Nimiipuu, Nez Perce, \naboriginal homelands in September of 1805, and with this first chance \nencounter, they were met with caution. After crossing the daunting \nRocky Mountains, the explorers were in dire need of food and shelter. \nThey described the Nimiipuu as friendly, hospitable, and gracious hosts \nwho assisted the expedition.\n  Without the assistance of tribes such as the Nimiipuu, Lewis and \nClark and their party would have likely become lost or died from \nstarvation. The expedition itself heavily relied on those who inhabited \nthe land--their survival depended on American Indians' willingness to \nshare knowledge about the land, its resources, and practical routes \nacross it.\n  Today, the Nez Perce, Lemhi Shoshone, and other American tribes are \nworking diligently to preserve the heritage and culture that was such a \nlarge part of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and that played such a \nsignificant role in the history of the West. The leadership of these \ntribes of yesterday and today has helped shape the identity of America \nand the West.\n  The Nez Perce Tribe in particular has become very closely involved \nwith the commemoration, and has been an integral part of planning and \npreparing for Idaho's part of the celebration, including events like \nthe Summer of Peace Signature Event. This event not only honors the \ncontributions of the Nimiipuu then, it recognizes the tradition of \npeaceful and meaningful relationships that characterize the American \nWest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5869-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5869-S5870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HAROLD KELLER PUBLIC SERVICE LEADERSHIP AWARD\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, each year many of America's best \nand brightest high school students come together to compete in the John \nC. Stennis National Student Congress. For nearly 30 years Harold Keller \nhas been the driving force behind this event, which has provided \nthousands of young people an opportunity to develop leadership skills \nand learn about Congress.\n  Harold Keller is known as ``Mr. Congress'' within the National \nForensic League, which encompasses the National Student Congress as \npart of its comprehensive national speech and debate program. Each year \nhe has worked tirelessly to make the week-long competition run smoothly \nand fairly. But perhaps more importantly, he has also made time to \nprovide personal encouragement and guidance to many of those who take \npart.\n  It is this commitment and compassion that has made him not only an \nintegral part of the National Student Congress but also a memorable \nforce in the lives of many students who have participated through the \nyears.\n  In addition to his leadership of the Student Congress, Harold Keller \nis a tireless champion of speech and debate education throughout the \nNation. He has spent many weekends away from home conducting local and \ndistrict tournaments and seminars. Despite retiring as a speech and \ndebate teacher at West High School in Davenport, IA, in 2003, Mr. \nKeller continues his service on the Executive Council of the National \nForensic League and continues to provide leadership and inspiration not \nonly to students, but also to teachers and coaches who view him as a \nmentor. It was in recognition for his lifelong efforts that the \nNational Forensic League inducted him into its Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. Keller has faithfully lived his life by the philosophy expressed \non a poster which hangs in his office quoting the words of Forest \nWitcraft:\n\n     A hundred years from now it will not matter what my bank \n           account was,\n     The sort of house I lived in or what kind of car I drove.\n     But the world may be different because I was important in the \n           life of a child.\n\n  When the 2006 John C. Stennis National Student Congress convenes in \nGrapevine, TX, June 18-23, with over 420 competitors from throughout \nthe United States, the Stennis Center for Public Service, which \nsponsors the event, will honor Harold Keller by establishing the Harold \nKeller Public Service Leadership Award. Beginning next year, the Keller \nAward will be presented annually to a former Student Congress \ncompetitor who has made significant contributions to his or her \ncommunity, State, or Nation through public service leadership. The \nHarold\n\n[[Page S5870]]\n\nKeller Award will recognize individuals who have best applied the \nlessons learned through participation in the Student Congress to become \noutstanding leaders in public service.\n  There is perhaps no better way to recognize and honor Mr. Keller's \ncommitment and leadership than through this award. Each year, the \nwinner will return to the National Student Congress to serve as a role \nmodel and inspiration to the newest class of participants.\n  In recognition of the establishment of this award and of Mr. Keller's \nmany years of selfless leadership, the Stennis Center will present him \nwith a replica of the small, handleless gavel which sits on the rostrum \nof this Chamber today. This gavel, a very significant symbol of the \nSenate, was used by Vice President John Adams to call the first Senate \nto order in 1789 in New York and has, according to tradition, rested on \nthe rostrum of the Senate during its meetings since then. The replica \nof the original ivory gavel is sculpted from marble that was once part \nof the Capitol.\n  It is hoped that Harold Keller will receive the replica of this \nhistoric Senate gavel as a symbol of our gratitude for his patriotism \nand tireless leadership in providing opportunities for young men and \nwomen to prepare for public service. Ultimately, however, the greatest \nreward for him, and for our Nation, must be the quality and character \nof the leadership that will come from those who benefited from his hard \nwork, teaching, and guidance.\n  We pay tribute to Harold Keller for the wonderful leadership \nopportunities he has provided over the past three decades for American \nyouth participating in the John C. Stennis National Student Congress, \nand congratulate him on the well deserved honor of having a national \naward for public service leadership established in his name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5870-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. CAROL CARTWRIGHT\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a \ndistinguished leader in the field of higher education, Dr. Carol \nCartwright, president of Kent State University in Ohio. Dr. Cartwright \nis stepping down after 15 years of valuable service in her role as \npresident.\n  Dr. Cartwright is a visionary, who oversaw significant growth at Kent \nState during her tenure as president. She provided guidance as Kent \nState dramatically increased enrollment, research development, and \ncommunity outreach. Dr. Cartwright has left a lasting impression on \nhigher education in Ohio, and I thank her for her commitment, drive, \nand optimistic spirit. She has served as an inspiration to both her \nstudents and her peers.\n  Not only has Dr. Cartwright provided outstanding leadership during a \ntime of change at Kent State, but she also has worked to expand the \ninstitution's relationship with the surrounding community. For example, \nshe helped establish a meaningful partnership between Kent State and \nthe Oak Clinic for Multiple Sclerosis in Green to help discover why \nmultiple sclerosis, MS, which typically strikes during the early adult \nyears, is four times more prevalent in northeast Ohio than anywhere \nelse in the world. Dr. Cartwright's dedication to Kent State's research \nfacilities and equipment improvements allowed for this collaboration \nand will help people in the region receive treatment, regardless of \nincome. Physicians and researchers will be able to work toward a better \nunderstanding of MS, the development of new treatments, and the \nultimate goal of finding a cure.\n  Dr. Cartwright's commitment to the community led her to focus on \nimproving the quality of education for children well before the \ncommencement of their college years. Kent State has become a national \ncenter for research on the use of technologies for teaching and \nlearning. The College and Graduate School of Education is home to the \nResearch Center for Educational Technology, which opened in 1999. The \ncenter provides a network for university researchers and K-16 educators \nwho are working to understand the impact of technology on teaching and \nlearning.\n  These are but a few examples of the years of work that Dr. Cartwright \nhas contributed to Kent State University and the entire State of Ohio. \nIn a recent interview in Crain's Cleveland Business: On the Web, Dr. \nCartwright said, ``I'm driven by the opportunity to make a difference. \nIn the end, I will be honored if--in their own way, building on their \nown example, or their own experience--people will say `she made a \ndifference for Kent State.' ''\n  Indeed, Dr. Cartwright has made a significant difference to Kent \nState University and thousands of students. I thank her for her vision \nand dedication to students, faculty, community members, and all those \nindividuals who have been or will someday be positively affected by her \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5870-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING JEAN PICKER FIRSTENBERG\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to offer my sincere \ncongratulations, commendation, and gratitude to Ms. Jean Picker \nFirstenberg, who announced last week that she will be stepping down as \nchief executive officer of the American Film Institute after 26 years \nof dedicated and exceptional leadership.\n  During a tenure lasting nearly three decades, Jean's vision and \nleadership has placed AFI at the forefront of national recognition with \nrespect to the history of film in this country. Her efforts \ndramatically widened the scope and magnitude of AFI's activities, and \nshe has proven instrumental in moving the organization through times of \ntremendous change at AFI and in the film world as well.\n  Founded in 1967, AFI was established to educate the next generation \nof American filmmakers and preserve the Nation's film heritage. Jean \nnot only fulfilled this vital need but worked to greatly expand AFI's \nmission. Thanks to her efforts, AFI now stands as the largest nonprofit \nfilm exhibitor in the country, represents a preeminent voice \ncelebrating excellence in American film and television, and has proudly \nchampioned new film and television media.\n  Perhaps Jean's greatest challenge came when the National Endowment \nfor the Arts funding which had been AFI's primary source of financial \nsupport since the organization's inception disappeared virtually over \nnight. But thanks to Jean's firm dedication to our Nation's film \nheritage and her boundless energy, she transformed AFI into the self-\nsufficient entrepreneurial organization it is today with a strong and \ndiverse financial foundation.\n  Beyond placing AFI on firm financial grounding, Jean's tenure has \nalso seen myriad accomplishments that will forever cement her legacy at \nAFI and in the film and television world. Under her direction, AFI \nacquired the beautiful campus in Los Angeles it calls home, greatly \nexpanded its educational opportunities, and opened the Silver Theater \nand Cultural Center in nearby Silver Spring, MD.\n  Jean Firstenberg is an American treasure, and her presence as head of \nAFI will be sorely missed. It is truly a pleasure to honor and thank \nher for all she has done for film in America, and I am deeply proud to \ncall her my friend. She plans to spend more time now traveling and \nwriting, but she will always be the strongest of advocates for \nAmerica's rich artistic heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5870-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5870-S5871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF CRESBARD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \n100th anniversary of the founding of the city of Cresbard, SD. \nCresbard, which is a small, friendly community, is home to various \nbusinesses, in addition to a museum and an excellent community center.\n  Cresbard was originally located about 3 miles northwest of its \npresent location and named after John A. Cressey and George A. Baird. \nIn 1883, Mr. Baird circulated a petition for establishment of the \nCresbard post office which was located in Mr. Cressey's home. On June \n15, 1892, Mr. Cressey granted James A. Ward a right-of-way for the \nDuluth, Pierre, and Black Hills Railroad. The railroad grade was built \nacross the counties of Faulk, Hughes, Sully, Hyde, Edmunds, and Brown. \nDespite this attempt, tracks were never laid.\n  In 1906, surveyors for the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad came \nthrough, and men from the Dakota Town Lot Company began to develop \nlocations\n\n[[Page S5871]]\n\nalong the newly proposed right-of-way. In 1907, the residents of \nCresbard finally heard the sound of a train whistle.\n  Although having an economy that is predominately agriculturally \nbased, Cresbard is now considered home by several businesses including \na post office, hotel/restaurant, automotive service station, and a \nbank. Cresbard is also home to several churches, and is viewed as a \nhaven for hunters from October through December each year.\n  I am pleased to announce that Cresbard will be celebrating its \ncentennial from June 30 to July 2. The centerpiece of this anniversary \nwill be the all-school reunion. There are numerous other events \nscheduled including a car show, hot air balloon rides, 10K run, \nsoftball tournament, and street dance. These activities should serve as \na reminder to the citizens of Cresbard that the community spirit is \nalive and well.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to publicly honor Cresbard on this \nmemorable occasion. This celebration is a great way of recognizing \nCresbard's long and productive history, and I am pleased that the \ncitizens of Cresbard, past and present, are being honored and \ncelebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5871-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING RUTH ZIOLKOWSKI ON HER 80TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize and \nhonor Ruth Ziolkowski on the occasion of her 80th birthday.\n  Ruth Ziolkowski deserves great recognition for her dedication to the \nestablishment of the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation. She is the \npresident of the board of directors and chief executive officer of the \nfoundation, which is a nonprofit educational and cultural project \nestablished in 1949. Ruth assumed leadership of the project after the \n1982 death of her husband, Crazy Horse sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski. \nWork on the memorial is now a family endeavor, with many of \nZiolkowski's five sons and five daughters working as a team to advance \nthe project.\n  Native American leaders chose the figure of Crazy Horse for his \ndevotion to serving his people and preserving their culture. He was \nknown not only for his skill in battle but also for his loyalty to his \npeople. Ruth Ziolkowski, in many ways, reflects his character.\n  When completed, the Crazy Horse Memorial will be the world's largest \nsculpture. In 1998, the completion of the face of Crazy Horse made it \nthe world's largest single sculpted portrait. However, the goals of the \nCrazy Horse Memorial Foundation go beyond completion of the physical \nstructure. The foundation works for reconciliation and harmony between \nraces, and provides services such as the Crazy Horse Memorial Native \nAmerican Scholarship Program, which assists students from the nine \nSouth Dakota reservations.\n  Ruth Ziolkowski holds honorary doctorate degrees from South Dakota \nSchool of Mines and Technology and the University of South Dakota. In \n1997, she received the Free Spirit Award from the Freedom Forum, which \nis a nonpartisan, international foundation dedicated to free press, \nfree speech, and free spirit. In addition, Korczak and Ruth Ziolkowski \nhave been accepted into the Hall of Fame of Sales and Marketing \nExecutives International, Inc.\n  On June 26, 2006, Ruth Ziolkowski's 80th birthday, there are plans to \nbring the mountain alive with Legends in Light, a multimedia laserlight \nshow that tells the story of Native Americans and their contributions \nthroughout the centuries. The celebration's magnitude can only strive \nto match the vast contributions the Ziolkowski family have made to \nensuring that the dream behind the Crazy Horse memorial comes true.\n  Mr. President, I wish to publicly recognize Ruth Ziolkowski's \nachievements, and wish her the best on this special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5871-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CATHERINE CIARLO\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the \nsignificant accomplishments of Cranston School Superintendent Catherine \nCiarlo. Superintendent Ciarlo is retiring on June 30 after 46 years of \nworking tirelessly to educate and raise the academic achievement of \nRhode Island's students.\n  After graduating cum laude from Rhode Island College with a \nbachelor's degree in elementary education, Catherine entered the \nclassroom as a reading teacher the beginning of her lifelong commitment \nto developing and improving the literacy skills of Rhode Island's \nchildren.\n  Horace Mann, considered by many historians to be the father of modern \nAmerican education, once said, ``Teachers teach because they care. \nTeaching young people is what they do best. It requires long hours, \npatience, and care.'' Superintendent Ciarlo consistently exhibited all \nof these qualities, devoting her life to leading the Cranston school \nsystem to new scholastic heights and maintaining a steady focus on \nproviding her students with a high-quality, first-class education.\n  Catherine was appointed superintendent of Cranston Public Schools in \n1997. During her tenure, she has helped foster a strong community of \nlearning for all Cranston students. A potent symbol of her successful \nefforts as Cranston superintendent is the district's most current State \nreport card where it met or exceeded proficiency targets in math and \nliteracy across all grades and racial subgroups, and for both ESL \nstudents and those with disabilities. These scores are also an emblem \nof what is likely to be Catherine's most enduring legacy her passionate \ndedication for ensuring that students whom traditionally might have \ngotten lost in the shuffle were given the necessary support to enable \nthem to thrive academically.\n  Superintendent Ciarlo's contributions have been recognized in the \npast, most notably in 2005, when she was named Rhode Island's \nSuperintendent of the Year and as a finalist for National \nSuperintendent of the Year. Countless students owe their academic and \nprofessional success and achievements to Superintendent Ciarlo's \nefforts. Educators such as Catherine form the backbone of American \nsociety, providing our children with the essential tools to succeed in \nan ever-expanding global economy and keeping the United States \ncompetitive in the world.\n  I have a special place in my heart for the Cranston School System. \nFor many years my father worked there, ultimately as the supervisor of \ncustodians. He would be very proud of ``his system'' under the expert \nleadership of Catherine Ciarlo. So am I.\n  Thank you for your exemplary service, Catherine, and for your \nimportant contribution to the education of Rhode Island's students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5871-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5871-S5872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING THE AGRICULTURE FUTURE OF AMERICA ON ITS 10TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nAgriculture Future of America, AFA, on its 10-year anniversary. AFA was \nfounded by R. Crosby Kemper, Jr., to encourage and support college \nstudents who are preparing for careers in agriculture.\n  AFA is forming the future of agriculture by preparing the industry's \nfuture leaders today. This organization more than any other I know of \ngives young professionals access to industry leaders and training from \nprofessional corporate consultants while they are still in college. In \njust 10 years, the organization and its members have established an \noutstanding reputation in the agriculture industry. AFA members can be \nfound in respected positions throughout agriculture and the business \nworld. They are recognized by companies as reliable, effective leaders \nwho can meet the challenges posed by an ever-changing economy.\n  R. Crosby Kemper, Jr., recognizes the potential of college students \ncoming from rural America especially when coupled with opportunity they \notherwise might not have. Mr. Kemper founded AFA with the vision to \ncreate an organization that would catalyze further development of these \nyoung adults on a professional level. As I travel around Missouri and \nto other areas, I see that our farmers are aging. We need effective \nyoung professionals to be prepared to take over the reins. AFA creates \na professional network that respects individuals and promotes lifelong \nlearning as well as building of lifelong alliances.\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\n  As I have said so many times before, Americans enjoy the safest, most \naffordable and most abundant food supply of any country in the world. \nThat is due to the efforts of farmers in Missouri and across the \nMidwest. AFA is producing leaders who will help us maintain this \nposition as a world leader in production agriculture.\n  I want to thank the leaders of AFA and its members for their \ncommitment to agriculture. They understand why it is important we \ncontinue to support this vital industry. The U.S. food system is the \nlargest industry in the U.S. and is the leading export sector of our \neconomy. Few things are as important to America's future as the health \nand safety of our food system.\n  Agriculture is also one of the leading industries in Missouri; more \nthan 14,000 jobs are directly created by agriculture. This number \ndoesn't even include the thousands of jobs supporting this industry. \nThankfully, AFA is there to help men and women who are interested in \nagriculture realize their potential in an exciting and vital industry.\n  Congratulations to AFA members and leadership on this landmark \noccasion. I look forward to working with you as an organization and as \nagriculture leaders in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5872-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF TEA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the city of Tea, \nwhich is celebrating its centennial this year.\n  The community of Tea began as a small German agricultural village \noriginally named Byron. However, when a railroad was built between \nSioux Falls and Yankton, a stop was added in the community and the \nresidents decided to establish a local post office. The Postal Service \nadvised the residents that the name ``Byron'' was already taken by \nseveral other locations and suggested that they come up with a new town \nname. At a town meeting, the residents had listed several possibilities \nwhen they decided to take a tea break. The name ``Tea'' was offered and \neventually selected as the town's name. Now, 100 years later, the \ncommunity of Tea continues to be a place where residents make everyone \nfeel welcome.\n  It gives me great pleasure to rise with the citizens of Tea in \ncelebrating their centennial anniversary and wish them continued \nsuccess in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5872-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5872-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5872-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:21 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4894.

A bill to authorize the Moving to Work Charter program to \nenable public housing agencies to improve the effectiveness of Federal \nhousing assistance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Moving to \nWork Charter Program Act--legislation that would expand the successful \nMoving to Work demonstration project. Unfortunately, today's housing \nprograms do not always meet the needs of local communities, and public \nhousing agencies are subjected to one-size-fits-all regulations. \nNational rent policies often times do not satisfy distinct \ncharacteristics of individual housing markets. Therefore, my \nlegislation will increase flexibility for PHAs to address their local \nhousing needs.\n  Congress authorized the Moving to Work demonstration program in 1996, \nand the program has received temporary extensions since then. While the \ndemonstration was originally intended to only be authorized for 3 \nyears--its success has led to continued support from Congress. Moving \nto Work, or MTW, has been successful due its innovative and locally-\ndesigned approach to housing. Under the program, agencies are given \nappropriate flexibility to design programs that not only provide \naffordable housing, but aid residents in becoming self-sufficient. When \nMTW\n\n[[Page S5877]]\n\nwas established there were three main goals--achieving greater cost-\neffectiveness, giving housing residents tools to become self-\nsufficient, and increasing housing choices for low-income families. \nWhen one looks at the accomplishments of the agencies that have \nparticipated in the program, it is clear that MTW was instrumental in \ntheir success in meeting these goals. For this reason, I am eager to \napply MTW's proven model to worthy agencies across the country.\n  My legislation would establish a permanent Moving to Work Charter \nProgram that would include up to 250 PHAs. Participating agencies would \npossess the same flexibility to design and implement innovative \napproaches as current MTW participants. While PHAs would have broader \ndiscretion, they would still be required to assist substantially the \nsame number of low-income families they currently serve. The local \nflexibility and independence permitted under MTW will allow agencies to \nbe more responsive to their local conditions, demands, and priorities. \nEvery community has its unique housing needs that are not always best \naddressed by current HUD regulations.\n  When looking at current national rent policies, it is evident we have \na system in place that encourages dependency, by creating disincentives \nfor individuals to work. Under current law, when an individual's income \nincreases, their rent automatically increases. In essence we are \npunishing residents for earning more money--money that allows them to \nlive more responsibly and independently. MTW gives agencies the ability \nto establish rent policies that will encourage residents to increase \ntheir income, because they can keep more of their income. In my own \nstate of New Hampshire, the Keene Housing Authority has created a step \nrent program where tenant contributions to rent are increased on a \nyearly basis. While their income may increase, their rent will not. \nThis creates an environment where residents are encouraged to work. \nIncreases in tenant rent contributions are phased in each year, \nproviding more certainty for tenants. At the same time, they are \npreparing residents for entry into the housing market by giving them \njob training support, tools for financial planning, and homeownership \nopportunities. This program has resulted in real income growth for \nresidents, without a significant increase to their rents.\n  The results speak for themselves. At the Keene Housing Authority 46 \npercent of families were working full time when their MTW program \nstarted. Today, 65 percent are working full time. They have also issued \nmore section 8 subsidies than before and have assisted more families in \nneed. MTW has allowed Keene Housing Authority to meet the immediate \nhousing needs of their tenants, while also helping their tenants become \nmore independent.\n  The MTW program also gives PHAs the ability to merge their funding \nstreams--which is ideal for modernizing or redeveloping their housing \nstock. PHAs can combine these funds so long as they maintain assistance \nto the same number of families, and use their funds to continue their \nefforts to provide affordable housing. Through merging funding streams, \nPhiladelphia has been able to better leverage their federal dollars, \nand in turn construct hundreds of additional units.\n  Through community partnerships and innovative thinking at the local \nlevel, the Philadelphia PHA has been able to reach more low-income \nresidents, while at the same time reinvigorating community development \ninitiatives. Every community has distinctive housing needs--no one \nknows those local needs better than the housing agencies that are \nworking every day to provide affordable housing options for community \nmembers. MTW allows its participants to maximize efficiency and direct \nresources where they feel they are most needed to address specific \nlocal needs. I specifically want to thank Senator Santorum for working \nwith me on this legislation. Obviously, he has seen first hand the \nsuccess of MTW in this State of Pennsylvania, and I appreciate his \ninput on this bill.\n  Additionally, I would like to thank Senator Carper for his support of \nthis legislation. He has also witnessed the benefits of the MTW program \nin the State of Delaware. The Delaware State Housing Authority's MTW \nprogram has been tremendously successful in providing families with the \ntools to become more independent while still providing affordable \nhousing. I look forward to working with both Senator Santorum and \nCarper in moving this legislation forward.\n  By bringing more PHAs into MTW under my bill, more agencies will \nbenefit from streamlined annual reporting and administrative \nprocedures. By doing so, PHAs can focus more of their attention on \nmeeting the housing needs of those they serve. Redundant and burdensome \nreporting requirements are time-consuming and unnecessary and take the \nattention away from residents. Under this legislation, PHAs will be \nable to work with HUD to develop more appropriate reporting \nrequirements that compliment their housing services. For example, PHAs \nwill have the ability to merge their waiting lists, modify inspection \nstandards, and modify lease requirements. Small PHAs and large PHAs are \nvastly different--HUD should be able to work in collaboration with \nindividual PHAs to determine which requirements pertain to certain \nagencies. Streamlined reporting will enable PHAs to establish local \nbenchmarks and more purposefully evaluate their programs' effectiveness \nin providing affordable housing.\n  My legislation has the support of the local agencies across my State, \nas well as the endorsement of the Public Housing Authorities Directors \nAssociation, the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, and the \nNational Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. I remain \ncommitted to working with the PHAs throughout the legislative process \nto achieve greater flexibility, while ensuring that individuals and \nfamilies have continued access to affordable housing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 3510. A bill to amend the National Science Foundation \nAuthorization Act of 2002 to authorize grants for Partnerships for \nAccess to Laboratory Science (PALS); to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Allen, to introduce a bill designed to improve the \nscience learning experience for students in low-income and rural \nschools across the country. Investing in education is about investing \nin our future. Today's young people will be facing a new world when \nthey enter the workforce--a world that is globally integrated and where \ntechnology has transformed the boundaries of human capital. Our tax \nforms, blueprints, and x-rays can all be analyzed halfway around the \nworld. The greatest asset we have in this country is our collective \nintellect, and the Nation's competitive future will depend on us \nnurturing the intellect of the next generation of Americans.\n  In order to be competitive in the coming decades, we need to ensure \nthat we have given our students the tools to be successful in science, \nengineering, mathematics, and technology. The Protecting America's \nCompetitive Edge, PACE, Acts, which I am proud to be a cosponsor of, \nhelps provide the tools at all levels of our educational system, from \nkindergarten through graduate school and beyond. Unfortunately, I am \nconcerned that we may not be paying enough attention to those students \nthat are already in the greatest danger of not reaping the full \nbenefits of America's innovative future, such as minorities, women, and \nstudents in low-income or rural schools.\n  For example, according to the National Science Foundation, only 7 \npercent of our scientists and engineers are Hispanic, African American, \nor Native American, despite the fact that they make up 24 percent of \nthe total population. A minority scientist is also far less likely to \nachieve a post-graduate degree. By 2020, one-quarter of the Nation's \nschoolchildren will be Hispanic, and another 14 percent will be African \nAmerican. That's 40 percent of our precious human capital, and we can \nnot neglect that tremendous resource when we talk about improving our \ncompetitiveness for the future. No business could afford to leave 40% \nof its capital sitting idle, and neither can the United States.\n  That is why I introduced an amendment during the committee markup of \nthe PACE-Energy bill, joined by Senator Allen, which will create a \nseries\n\n[[Page S5878]]\n\nof outreach programs designed to get more minority elementary and \nsecondary students excited about science, to make them want to enter \nthese fields that will be such a crucial part of our economic future. A \nprogram like this called Hispanic Engineering Science and Technology \nWeek, HESTEC, has been operating very successful for the past few years \nas the University of Texas--Pan American, and I hope to see that \nsuccess replicated throughout the Nation.\n  But these types of programs are only one part of getting students \nhooked on science. We can spend all the time in the world telling \nstudents how exciting it is to be a scientist, but unless we actually \nlet them experience that excitement--unless we let them discover the \njoy of scientific discovery first-hand--we will still lose them. And \nthat is the job of the science laboratory class. A well-designed, well-\nequipped, well-staffed high school laboratory can be an incredibly \ninvigorating and illuminating experience for a student. It can teach \nthem far more about scientific principles than they can learn from a \nbook or in a lecture, and more importantly, it teaches them the thrill \nof actually being a scientist. That, more than anything else, can mean \nthe difference between a student who goes on to become a chemist, an \nengineer, or a medical researcher, and one who loses interest in \nscience forever.\n  Unfortunately, a recent report by the National Academy of Sciences, \ncalled ``America's Lab Report: Investigations in High School Science,'' \nmade some findings that are extremely troubling for those of us who \nwant to provide all of our students an equal opportunity to succeed in \nscience and technology. It found that schools that have high \npercentages of minorities and low-income students are ``less likely to \nhave adequate laboratory facilities'' and ``often have lower budgets \nfor laboratory equipment and supplies'' than other schools. The study \nalso found that students in those schools ``spend less time in \nlaboratory instruction than students in other schools.'' Rural schools \nhad some of the same problems.\n  We cannot expect our country to be adequately prepared for the future \nunless all of our students are adequately prepared for the future. And \nunless we do something to improve the laboratory experience for our \nlow-income, minority, and rural students, we simply won't be prepared. \nThat is why I am proud to introduce the partnerships for access to \nlaboratory science bill, originally championed by Congressman Hinojosa, \nwhich would authorize partnerships between high-need or rural school \ndistricts, higher education institutions, and the private sector, with \nthe goal of revitalizing the high school science labs in those schools. \nThe bill authorizes $50 million in matching grants to help fund \ncomprehensive science instruction improvement plans, with the grant \nmoney able to be used for such things as purchasing scientific \nequipment, renovating laboratory space, designing new experiments or \nmethods of integrating the laboratory with traditional lectures, and \nproviding professional development for high school science lab \nteachers. This last one is particularly important because one of the \nkey conclusions from the National Academy report is that ``improving \nhigh school science teachers' capacity to lead laboratory experiences \neffectively is critical to advancing the educational goals of these \nexperiences.''\n  We need to do a lot to ensure that our Nation stays competitive \nthroughout the 21st century, and this bill is only one small step. But \nit is a sorely needed step, particularly for those students who need \nour help the most. I invite my colleagues to join us in support of this \nbill, and I look forward to working to enact this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 3515. A bill to amend title II, United States Code, to ensure that \nliable entities meet environmental cleanup obligations, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal recently \nreported on a growing phenomenon across the West--towns and cities are \nstruggling to ensure cleanup from decades of environmental \ncontamination on properties formally owned by Asarco, LLC.\n  For over a century, Asarco mined, smelted, and refined metals at \nsites across the country, leaving behind a legacy of lead, arsenic, and \ncadmium contamination in more than 90 sites in 22 Western States. But \nwhen Asarco filed for bankruptcy in August 2005 suddenly it became \nunclear if these contaminated sites would ever get cleaned up. Asarco's \noutrageous legacy of environmental pollution stretches from Helena, MT, \nto El Paso, TX, and is estimated to total $1 billion nationwide. That \nis money that taxpayers, not the polluting company, may now have to \npay.\n  In my State, Asarco operated a 14-acre site in Everett from the 1800s \nuntil 1912, and two sites in Ruston, a 67-acre property and the larger \n97-acre Superfund site on Commencement Bay. When Asarco declared \nbankruptcy last August, the citizens of Washington State were left with \na $100 million Superfund mess. In Tacoma and Ruston, Asarco contractors \nabandoned cleanup projects midway through, leaving piles of \ncontaminated soil sitting in resident's backyards. Although cleanup \nresumed thanks to emergency removal funds from the Environmental \nProtection Agency, these funds only go so far and eventually taxpayers \nmay have to bear the brunt of the costs.\n  I wish I could say that Asarco is just an exceptionally bad actor, \nbut there is evidence that the company's irresponsible practices are \nmore common than we knew.\n  That is why in October 2002, I asked the Government Accountability \nOffice to examine how corporate polluters might be avoiding their \nresponsibility under existing environmental law. I was pleased to be \njoined in requesting this study by then Environment and Public Works \nChairman Jeffords, Judiciary Chairman Leahy, and Superfund and Waste \nManagement Subcommittee Chairwoman Boxer. The report found that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has faced significant challenges in \nholding polluting corporations responsible for their environmental \ncleanup obligations, partly due to bankruptcy laws that allow companies \nto avoid future cleanup costs on sites that were damaged in the past.\n  In many ways this report confirms what I feared back in 2002, and \nwhat became starkly evident last August, that corporate polluters are \nusing bankruptcy and other regulatory loopholes to get out of their \nenvironmental cleanup obligations. The report has a whole section on \nhow ``businesses can organize and restructure themselves in ways that \nallow them to limit their expenditures for environmental cleanups.'' \nWhether it is using the shield of bankruptcy to evade their \nobligations, or engaging in corporate shell games with foreign \nsubsidiaries, the ``polluter pays'' principle should hold firm.\n  To quote again from the report, ``As a result of EPA's inaction, the \nfederal treasury continues to be exposed to potentially enormous \ncleanup costs associated with businesses not currently required to \nprovide financial assurances.''\n  Fortunately, the GAO provided not only a thorough analysis of the \nproblem but also a set of detailed recommendations on how to tackle \nthese abuses. Based on their recommendations, I authored the Cleanup \nAssurance and Polluter Accountability Act of 2006, which I am \nintroducing today along with Senator Jeffords, the ranking member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee and Senator Boxer, the \nranking member of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on \nSuperfund and Waste Management.\n  My bill: Enables the bankruptcy court to examine 10 years of past\ntransactions--instead of 2 years--between a parent company and its \nsubsidiary for evidence that companies transferred assets to avoid \nenvironmental cleanup responsibilities; requires the National \nBankruptcy Review Commission to evaluate conflicting goals between the \nbankruptcy code and environmental laws and to provide recommendations \nfor action to Congress; reasserts and expands upon the 1980 requirement \nthat the Environmental Protection Agency develop financial assurance \nregulations and ensure that businesses maintain appropriate financial \nassurances, providing evidence that they're able to pay for cleaning up \nof environmental damage\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\nshould it occur; and requires companies subject to financial assurance \nrequirements to report declarations of bankruptcy directly to the EPA \nwith an estimation of environmental damage and an explanation of \ncurrent and former owners or partners of the facility.\n  These measures will go a long way toward closing these costly \nloopholes in our bankruptcy code and protecting tax payers from unjust \ncorporate maneuvering to evade cleanup responsibility at polluted \nsites.\n  Communities across the country continue to bear the burden of \nAsarco's irresponsible behavior. The GAO report confirms that this \nabuse is not specific to Asarco but is increasingly widespread. It will \ntake many more years to clean up the mess that a few bad actors have \nleft behind. We can't afford to stand by and allow another Asarco to \nhappen. We must not ask the taxpayers to continue footing the bill for \nothers' reckless actions. I look forward to working with my \ncongressional colleagues to enact these protections into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5879-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 512--CELEBRATING THE 231ST BIRTHDAY OF THE ARMY AND \nCOMMENDING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARMY AS EXCEPTIONAL INDIVIDUALS WHO \n       LIVE BY THE VALUES OF LOYALTY, DUTY, AND SELFLESS SERVICE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. McCain, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

UNITED STATES PENSION PLANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States and the international community face \n     no greater threat to their security than the prospect of \n     rogue regimes who support international terrorism obtaining \n     weapons of mass destruction, and particularly nuclear \n     weapons.\n       (2) Iran is the leading state sponsor of international \n     terrorism and is close to\n\n[[Page S5888]]\n\n     achieving nuclear weapons capability but has paid no price \n     for nearly twenty years of deception over its nuclear \n     program. Foreign entities that have invested in Iran's energy \n     sector, despite Iran's support of international terrorism and \n     its nuclear program, have afforded Iran a free pass while \n     many United States entities have unknowingly invested in \n     those same foreign entities.\n       (3) United States investors have a great deal at stake in \n     preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n       (4) United States investors can have considerable influence \n     over the commercial decisions of the foreign entities in \n     which they have invested.\n       (b) Sense of Congress Relating to Divestiture From Iran.--\n     It is the sense of Congress that managers of United States \n     Government pension plans or thrift savings plans, managers of \n     pension plans maintained in the private sector by plan \n     sponsors in the United States, and managers of mutual funds \n     sold or distributed in the United States should, to the \n     extent consistent with the legal and fiduciary duties \n     otherwise imposed on them, immediately initiate efforts to \n     divest all investments of such plans or funds in any entity \n     included on the list.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Relating to Prohibition on Future \n     Investment.--It is the sense of Congress that there should \n     be, to the extent consistent with the legal and fiduciary \n     duties otherwise imposed on them, no future investment in any \n     entity included on the list by managers of United States \n     Government pension plans or thrift savings plans, managers of \n     pension plans maintained in the private sector by plan \n     sponsors in the United States, and managers of mutual funds \n     sold or distributed in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1247.

DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress Relating to United Nations Security \n     Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency.--It is \n     the sense of Congress that the President should instruct the \n     United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations \n     to work to secure support at the United Nations Security \n     Council for a resolution that would impose sanctions on Iran \n     as a result of its repeated breaches of its nuclear \n     nonproliferation obligations, to remain in effect until Iran \n     has verifiably dismantled its weapons of mass destruction \n     programs.\n       (b) Prohibition on Assistance to Countries That Invest in \n     the Energy Sector of Iran.--\n       (1) Withholding of assistance.--If, on or after January 1, \n     2007, a foreign person (as defined in section 14 of the Iran \n     Sanctions Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note), as renamed \n     pursuant to section 1247(g)(1)) or an agency or \n     instrumentality of a foreign government has more than \n     $20,000,000 invested in Iran's energy sector, the President \n     shall, until the date on which such person or agency or \n     instrumentality of such government terminates such \n     investment, withhold assistance under the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) to the government of the \n     country to which such person owes allegiance or to which \n     control is exercised over such agency or instrumentality.\n       (2) Waiver.--Assistance prohibited by this section may be \n     furnished to the government of a foreign country described in \n     subsection (a) if the President determines that furnishing \n     such assistance is important to the national security \n     interests of the United States, furthers the goals described \n     in this subtitle, and, not later that 15 days before \n     obligating such assistance, notifies the Committee on \n     International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate \n     of such determination and submits to such committees a report \n     that includes--\n       (A) a statement of the determination;\n       (B) a detailed explanation of the assistance to be \n     provided;\n       (C) the estimated dollar amount of the assistance; and\n       (D) an explanation of how the assistance furthers United \n     States national security interests.\n\n     SEC. 1252.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Iran has pursued a nuclear program with assistance from \n     foreign entities and foreign governments.\n       (2) It is important that Iran not seek to develop nuclear \n     weapons under the cover of a civilian nuclear power program.\n       (3) The Government of Iran has asserted that its nuclear \n     program is for peaceful purposes, however, that Government \n     has supported terrorist organizations and uses harsh rhetoric \n     towards allies of the United States in the Middle East, and \n     the United States has expressed great concern with Iran's \n     nuclear ambitions and has worked with United States allies to \n     end Iran's nuclear program.\n       (4) In October 2003, the Government of Iran promised it \n     would suspend uranium enrichment activities, but broke that \n     promise less than a year later.\n       (5) In November 2004, the Government of Iran, in concert \n     with talks with representatives of the Governments of \n     Britain, France, and Germany (the ``EU-3'') agreed to suspend \n     all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities related to \n     Iran's nuclear program under the terms of the agreement made \n     between the Islamic Republic of Iran and France, Germany and \n     the United Kingdom, with the support of the High \n     Representative of the European Union (the ``Paris \n     Agreement'').\n       (6) The EU-3 agreed to support the United States in taking \n     Iran's nuclear program to the United Nations Security Council \n     if Iran resumed its nuclear activities.\n       (7) In concert with the Paris Agreement, the President \n     announced that the United States will drop its opposition to \n     Iran's application to join the World Trade Organization and \n     permit, on a case-by-case basis, the licensing of spare parts \n     for Iranian commercial aircraft.\n       (8) Iran's uranium enrichment program is likely to be \n     dispersed throughout the country, protected in hardened \n     infrastructure, and highly mobile.\n       (9) The Parliament of Iran passed a nonbinding resolution \n     insisting that the Government of Iran resume developing \n     nuclear fuel.\n       (10) That resolution stated that Iran should develop enough \n     nuclear fuel to generate 20,000 megawatts of electricity.\n       (11) In February 2005, the Atomic Energy Agency of Russia \n     announced that Russia would ship nuclear fuel to Iran's \n     Bushehr nuclear reactor.\n       (12) Russia pledged to provide fuel to this facility for 10 \n     years and, under the commitment, Iran has pledged to return \n     spent fuel to Russia for storage.\n\n[[Page S5889]]\n\n       (13) Russia remains the only major nuclear fuel market \n     closed to outside competition and 100 percent of Russia's \n     nuclear fuel industry is owned by the Government of Russia.\n       (14) Iran is the fourth-largest oil producer in the world.\n       (15) Iran has a wealth of natural gas and crude oil \n     reserves and it is estimated that Iran plans to invest \n     $104,000,000,000 by 2015 in natural gas production and that \n     Iran plans to increase crude oil production to 7,000,000 \n     barrels a day by 2020.\n\n     SEC. 1262. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TRADE RELATIONS WITH STATE \n                   SPONSORS OF TERRORISM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the countries of the world \n     should choose between trading with state sponsors of \n     terrorism or maintaining good trade relations with the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 1263.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of the United States have long demonstrated \n     an interest in the well-being of the people of Iran, dating \n     back to the 1830s.\n       (2) Famous Americans such as Howard Baskerville, Dr. Samuel \n     Martin, Jane E. Doolittle, and Louis G. Dreyfus, Jr., made \n     significant contributions to Iranian society by furthering \n     the educational opportunities of the people of Iran and \n     improving the opportunities of the less fortunate citizens of \n     Iran.\n       (3) Iran and the United States were allies following World \n     War II, and through the late 1970s Iran was as an important \n     regional ally of the United States and a key bulwark against \n     Soviet influence.\n       (4) In November 1979, following the arrival of Mohammed \n     Reza Shah Pahlavi in the United States, a mob of students and \n     extremists seized the United States Embassy in Tehran, Iran, \n     holding United States diplomatic personnel hostage until \n     January 1981.\n       (5) Following the seizure of the United States Embassy, \n     Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the repressive \n     revolutionary movement in Iran, expressed support for the \n     actions of the students in taking American citizens hostage.\n       (6) Despite the May 1997 presidential election in Iran, an \n     election in which an estimated 91 percent of the electorate \n     participated, control of the internal and external affairs of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran is still exercised by the courts \n     in Iran and the Revolutionary Guards, Supreme Leader, and \n     Council of Guardians of the Government of Iran.\n       (7) The election results of the May 1997 election and the \n     high level of voter participation in that election \n     demonstrate that the people of Iran favor economic and \n     political reforms and greater interaction with the United \n     States and the Western world in general.\n       (8) Efforts by the United States to improve relations with \n     Iran have been rebuffed by the Government of Iran.\n       (9) President William J. Clinton eased sanctions against \n     Iran and promoted people-to-people exchanges, but the Leader \n     of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the \n     Militant Clerics' Society, the Islamic Coalition \n     Organization, and Supporters of the Party of God have all \n     opposed efforts to open Iranian society to Western influences \n     and have opposed efforts to change the dynamic of relations \n     between the United States and Iran.\n       (10) For the past two decades, the Department of State has \n     found Iran to be the leading sponsor of international \n     terrorism in the world.\n       (11) In 1983, the Iran-sponsored Hezbollah terrorist \n     organization conducted suicide terrorist operations against \n     United States military and civilian personnel in Beirut, \n     Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Americans.\n       (12) The United States intelligence community and law \n     enforcement personnel have linked Iran to attacks against \n     American military personnel at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia \n     in 1996 and to al Qaeda attacks against civilians in Saudi \n     Arabia in 2004.\n       (13) According to the Department of State's Patterns of \n     Global Terrorism 2001 report, ``Iran's Islamic Revolutionary \n     Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security \n     continued to be involved in the planning and support of \n     terrorist acts and supported a variety of groups that use \n     terrorism to pursue their goals,'' and ``Iran continued to \n     provide Lebanese Hizballah and the Palestinian rejectionist \n     groups--notably HAMAS, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the \n     [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General \n     Command]--with varying amounts of funding, safehaven, \n     training and weapons''.\n       (14) The Government of Iran currently operates more than 10 \n     radio and television stations broadcasting in Iraq that \n     incite violent actions against United States and coalition \n     personnel in Iraq.\n       (15) The current leaders of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \n     and Hashemi Rafsanjani, have repeatedly called upon Muslims \n     to kill Americans in Iraq and install a theocratic regime in \n     Iraq.\n       (16) The Government of Iran has admitted pursuing a \n     clandestine nuclear program, which the United States \n     intelligence community believes may include a nuclear weapons \n     program.\n       (17) The Government of Iran has failed to meet repeated \n     pledges to arrest and extradite foreign terrorists in Iran.\n       (18) The United States Government believes that the \n     Government of Iran supports terrorists and extremist \n     religious leaders in Iraq with the clear intention of \n     subverting coalition efforts to bring peace and democracy to \n     Iraq.\n       (19) The Ministry of Defense of Iran confirmed in July 2003 \n     that it had successfully conducted the final test of the \n     Shahab-3 missile, giving Iran an operational intermediate-\n     range ballistic missile capable of striking both Israel and \n     United States troops throughout the Middle East and \n     Afghanistan.\n\n     SEC. 1272. DECLARATION OF CONGRESS REGARDING UNITED STATES \n                   POLICY TOWARD IRAN.\n\n       Congress declares that it should be the policy of the \n     United States--\n       (1) to support efforts by the people of Iran to exercise \n     self-determination over the form of government of their \n     country; and\n       (2) to actively support a national referendum in Iran with \n     oversight by international observers and monitors to certify \n     the integrity and fairness of the referendum.\n\n     SEC. 1273. ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY IN IRAN.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The President is authorized, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, to provide \n     financial and political assistance (including the award of \n     grants) to foreign and domestic individuals, organizations, \n     and entities that support democracy and the promotion of \n     democracy in Iran.

Q.) Khan; and\n       (4) officials and representatives of the United States \n     should--\n       (A) strongly and unequivocally support indigenous efforts \n     in Iran calling for free, transparent, and democratic \n     elections; and\n       (B) draw international attention to violations by the \n     Government of Iran of human rights, freedom of religion, \n     freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press.\n       (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Department of State $100,000,000 to carry out activities \n     under this section.\n       (2) Offset.--The amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 1405(1) for the Army for operation and maintenance \n     for additional costs due to Operation Iraqi Freedom and \n     Operation Enduring Freedom is hereby decreased by \n     $100,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 1274.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``John \n     Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2007''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Senator John Warner of Virginia was elected a member of \n     the United States Senate on November 7, 1978, for a full term \n     beginning on January 3, 1979. He was subsequently appointed \n     by the Governor of Virginia to fill a vacancy on January 2, \n     1979, and has served continuously since that date. He was \n     appointed a member of the Committee on Armed Services in \n     January 1979, and has served continuously on the Committee \n     since that date, a period of nearly 28 years. Senator \n     Warner's service on the Committee represents nearly half of \n     its existence since it was established after World War II.\n       (2) Senator Warner came to the Senate and the Committee on \n     Armed Services after a distinguished record of service to the \n     Nation, including combat service in the Armed Forces and high \n     civilian office.\n       (3) Senator Warner enlisted in the United States Navy upon \n     graduation from high school in 1945, and served until the \n     summer of 1946, when he was discharged as a Petty Officer 3rd \n     Class. He then attended Washington and Lee University on the \n     G.I. Bill. He graduated in 1949 and entered the University of \n     Virginia Law School.\n       (4) Upon the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Senator \n     Warner volunteered for active duty, interrupting his \n     education to accept a commission in the United States Marine \n     Corps. He served in combat in Korea as a\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\n     ground officer in the First Marine Air Wing. Following his \n     active service, he remained in the Marine Corps Reserve for \n     several years, attaining the rank of captain.\n       (5) Senator Warner resumed his legal education upon \n     returning from the Korean War and graduated from the \n     University of Virginia Law School in 1953. He was selected by \n     the late Chief Judge E. Barrett Prettyman of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n     as his law clerk. After his service to Judge Prettyman, \n     Senator Warner became an Assistant United States Attorney in \n     the District of Columbia, and later entered private law \n     practice.\n       (6) In 1969, the Senate gave its advice and consent to the \n     appointment of Senator Warner as Under Secretary of the Navy. \n     He served in this position until 1972, when he was confirmed \n     and appointed as the 61st Secretary of the Navy since the \n     office was established in 1798. As Secretary, Senator Warner \n     was the principal United States negotiator and signatory of \n     the Incidents at Sea Executive Agreement with the Soviet \n     Union, which was signed in 1972 and remains in effect today. \n     It has served as the model for similar agreements between \n     states covering the operation of naval ships and aircraft in \n     international sea lanes throughout the world.\n       (7) Senator Warner left the Department of the Navy in 1974. \n     His next public service was as Director of the American \n     Revolution Bicentennial Commission. In this capacity, he \n     coordinated the celebration of the Nation's founding, \n     directing the Federal role in all 50 States and in over 20 \n     foreign nations.\n       (8) Senator Warner has served as chairman of the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the United States Senate from 1999 to \n     2001, and again since January 2003. He served as ranking \n     minority member of the committee from 1987 to 1993, and again \n     from 2001 to 2003. Senator Warner concludes his service as \n     chairman at the end of the 109th Congress, but will remain a \n     member of the committee.\n       (9) This Act is the twenty-eighth annual authorization act \n     for the Department of Defense for which Senator Warner has \n     taken a major responsibility as a member of the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the United States Senate, and the \n     fourteenth for which he has exercised a leadership role as \n     chairman or ranking minority member of the committee.\n       (10) Senator Warner, as seaman, Marine officer, Under \n     Secretary and Secretary of the Navy, and member, ranking \n     minority member, and chairman of the Committee on Armed \n     Services, has made unique and lasting contributions to the \n     national security of the United States.\n       (11) It is altogether fitting and proper that his Act, the \n     last annual authorization Act for the national defense that \n     Senator Warner manages in and for the United States Senate as \n     chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, be named in his \n     honor, as provided in subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4242.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 512, which was submitted \nearly today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 512) celebrating the 231st birthday \n     of the Army and commending the men and women of the Army as \n     exceptional individuals who live by the values of loyalty, \n     duty, and selfless service.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our U.S. \nArmy. On June 14, 1775, our Founding Fathers formed the U.S. Army out \nof a desire to defend their liberties. The Continental Army that \nemerged in the midst of our war for independence laid a foundation for \npatriotism, tenacity and courage that remains at the care of the Army \nof today. Since that time, American Soldiers have fought in more than \n10 wars, from the American Revolution to the global war on terror. This \n231st birthday serves as a reminder that today's Army continues to \nstand as the guardian of our nation's freedom. Today, we salute the \nbrave men and women who call the Army home, and those soldiers that \nhave served and died before them, in a celebration of their ``Call to \nDuty.''\n  The American soldier has always been the centerpiece of the Nation's \ndefense. Coupled with the desires to maintain our democracy and \nfreedom, these soldiers continue to march to the sound of the guns by \nputting ``boots on the ground'' in more than 120 countries around the \nworld today. From Valley Forge to New Orleans, from Gettysburg to the \nMarne, from Sicily and the beaches of Normandy to Inchon and the Ia \nDrang Valley, from Kuwait to Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi \nFreedom, the American Soldier: brave, professional and determined, has \nnot faltered in his duty and stands ready to answer the next call.\n  Since 1775, millions of men and women, from all backgrounds and parts \nof our Nation, have raised their right hands and taken an oath to \nsupport and defend our Constitution. Today's 231st birthday reminds us \nthat these soldiers are the backbone of our society. Living each day by \nthe ``Warrior Ethos,'' these men and women personify the Army values of \nloyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and personal \ncourage.\n  No tribute to our men and women in uniform, whether they are from \nAlabama or elsewhere, would be complete without mentioning their \nfamilies. America salutes our military families and the unspoken burden \nthey bear when their husbands and wives, fathers and mothers or sons \nand daughters are called away to steamy jungles or unforgiving deserts \nto defend this great nation and our way of life. The love and support \nour soldier's families provide through their support and strength. We \nremember also their sacrifices and the long days they spend apart.\n  To those currently serving, our thoughts and prayers are with you and \nyour families on this 231st Army birthday. Humbled by your sacrifice \nand awed by your achievements, we continue to find comfort in knowing \nyou are an eminent presence: resolute in standing watch over our \ndemocracy and freedoms. Celebrate this Army birthday and continue to \nlive to a higher standard through the Army values and the Warrior \nEthos.\n  Our celebration of the 231st Army birthday reminds us all of the \nsacrifice so many have made in the preservation of our Nation. These \nwords are but a small token of the appreciation and thanks that are \nowed for the dedication to duty and sacrifice these brave men and women \nmake on a daily basis. These soldiers deserve our gratitude, our praise \nand most importantly our continued support as they continue to drive on \nwith the mission. Happy Birthday to our Army.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr President, I rise today in honor of the Army's 231st \nbirthday. For over two centuries, the Army has served this Nation with \nhonesty, courage, and dignity, and it is my privilege to take this \nopportunity to commemorate its birth. Both in times of peace, and in \ntimes of war, the U.S. Army has been poised and ready to answer the \ncall of duty to defend our Nation. All of our Army units--Active, Guard \nand Reserve--share the heritage of the first Continental Army which \nfought so valiantly for the principles of justice, freedom and \ndemocracy. The commitment and duty of the Army soldiers who have risked \ntheir lives to preserve our freedom have left an indelible mark on this \nnation. During the Army's 231 year history, tens of thousands of these \nbrave men and women have sacrificed their lives on distant battlefields \nto keep our nation safe. I salute them for their service to this \ncountry.\n  I also pay tribute to the families of those soldiers who risk their \nlives for our Nation. Too often the important role that families play \ngoes unacknowledged but their faith and devotion are vital to the \nArmy's success. The families of our soldiers have my deepest \nappreciation for the sacrifices they make and for the support the give \nour troops.\n  As this Nation continues to fight in the global war on terror, the \nArmy has been key to providing the Joint force the capabilities it \nneeds to persist in its struggle for liberty and democracy. Through the \nefforts of the U.S. Army the world has been made a more secure, \nprosperous, and better place for all of mankind. As I witnessed, \nfirsthand, during my recent trip to Iraq, the men and women serving in \nthe Army who so courageously defend our Nation represent the best of \nwhat our country has to offer and have my deepest respect. Thank you \nfor your selfless service. It is an inspiration to us all.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to wish the U.S. Army happy \nbirthday. It was 231 years ago today, June 14, 1775, that the \nContinental Army of the United States was formed.\n  Over the past 231 years, millions of men and women have served in the \noldest branch of our Armed Forces. Their honor, courage, sacrifice and \nservice are the foundation of America's greatness.\n  The Army principles of ``Duty, Honor, Country'' is America. Every \ngeneration of Americans who have served in the U.S. Army from the \nContinental Army to our fighting men and women serving today in Iraq \nand Afghanistan have been shaped by these principles. The United States \nArmy has shaped lives just as it has shaped our history.\n  The U.S. Army has protected our democracy and helped make the world \nmore secure, peaceful, and prosperous.\n  On this 231st birthday of the U.S. Army, we also recognize and thank \nthe individuals who have sacrificed and served our country. They \ninspire us and will continue to serve as role models for future \ngenerations.\n  ``Happy Birthday'' to the U.S. Army. And, in the Army's great rich \ntradition and as a proud Army veteran, I proclaim my annual Senate \nfloor ``HOOAH!''\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 512) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 512\n\n       Whereas, from the first Continental Army under General \n     Washington to the beaches of Normandy and the city streets of \n     Iraq, the Army has protected the flame of democracy;\n       Whereas the citizens of the United States continue to enjoy \n     freedom and spread the light of democracy because the men and \n     women of the Army have stood through adversity, remained \n     steadfast in the most difficult of circumstances, and bravely \n     fought against the enemies of peace throughout the world;\n       Whereas the sacrifices of those men and women of the Army \n     have called all citizens\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\n     of the United States, both public and private, to the highest \n     forms of citizenship;\n       Whereas the Army maintains its presence in 120 countries \n     across the world, including Saudi Arabia, Korea, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the accomplishments of the Army in the Global War \n     on Terror have demonstrated the courage and strength of the \n     men and women of the Army;\n       Whereas, in Iraq, the Army has brought freedom to a \n     population once under tyrannical control, allowing the \n     citizens of Iraq to enjoy the recent election of officials, \n     the formation of a constitution, and the formation of the \n     government under Prime Minister al-Maliki;\n       Whereas the men and women of the Army continued to provide \n     stability and security to Iraqis by killing Abu Musab al-\n     Zarqawi, who was commonly known among terrorists as the \n     ``prince of al-Qaeda'';\n       Whereas Iraq has become a better place and a great ally, \n     which was evident when the ambassador of Iraq presented his \n     credentials to the Secretary of State for the first time in \n     15 years; and\n       Whereas those great accomplishments add to the longstanding \n     tradition of the Army and attest to the extraordinary \n     capability of the men and women who serve the United States: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) salutes the men and women of the Army;\n       (2) commends the men and women of the Army as exceptional \n     individuals who live by the values of loyalty, duty, and \n     selfless service; and\n       (3) recognizes that those great citizens--\n       (A) are the reason why the Army continues to stand as the \n     best military force in the world; and\n       (B) continue to perform amazing tasks and uphold the \n     honored traditions of the Army by adhering to the principle \n     expressed by General Douglas MacArthur when he proudly \n     declared that ``Americans never quit.''.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today, the significance of this resolution \nis something that needs the attention of this body. We are today \nhonoring the 231st birthday of the U.S. Army.\n  Throughout the centuries, the noble service of Army soldiers has \ndefended this great Nation. From the first Continental Army under GEN \nGeorge Washington, to the beaches of Normandy, to the city streets of \nBaghdad, America's Army has protected the flame of freedom. Their \nsacrifice calls us all--both public and private--to the highest \nstandard of citizenship. We enjoy our freedoms because they have been \nsteadfast through the most difficult of circumstances and continue to \nspread the light of democracy to the darkest corners of the world. We \nstand here today because they continue to willingly put their lives in \nharm's way.\n  The Army's history is one of success. During the Mexican-American War \nour country expanded westward to the Pacific and south to Texas. The \nPhilippine and Spanish-American Wars demonstrated the Army's courage \nagainst strong insurgent forces and created the vital posts that exist \ntoday in Southeast Asia. The Army continued to fight bravely in World \nWar I and World War II to defeat the Central powers and the Axis in \nEurope and the Pacific. With the rise of Communism, the Army once again \nanswered freedom's call in Korea and Vietnam.\n  Today, these courageous soldiers continue the great tradition by \nserving across the world in the war on terrorism. While the Army \nmaintains a presence in 120 countries across the world in countries \nsuch as Djibouti, Korea, and Kosovo, the vast majority of our efforts \nhave been focused in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I just returned from my 11th trip to the Iraqi AOR. While I was over \nthere I observed firsthand the progress being made by our troops. The \nArmy has taken the bulk of the responsibility, and much of what we have \naccomplished we owe to their outstanding service.\n  The Army has brought freedom to a population once under tyrannical \ncontrol. Freedom shines through the recent election of officials, the \nformation of a constitution, and formation of the first permanent \ngovernment under Prime Minister al-Maliki. Recently, the first Iraqi \nAmbassador in 15 years presented his credentials to the Secretary of \nState. We have taken out the ``prince of al-Qaida,'' al-Zarqawi. These \ngreat successes add to the longstanding tradition of our military.\n  Having just returned from that area, and having been there 11 times, \nand having talked to our U.S. Army soldiers, as well as with the other \nservices, it is incredible that they are so much like they were in the \npast. I recall when I was first drafted into the U.S. Army. It was so \nlong ago that I was drafted with Elvis Presley. And he had a little \nbetter duty than I did. Nonetheless, you learn something when you \nbecome an active member of the U.S. Army. You learn a type of \ndiscipline and a type of tradition, and that tradition stays with you \nall the rest of your life.\n  It was not long ago that my fellow Army veteran, Senator Danny Akaka, \nand I formed the Army Caucus to bring attention to the work of the Army \nin the past, the present, and in the future.\n  To let you know how things change, I can remember only 12 years ago, \nwhen I was serving in the other body, in the House Armed Services \nCommittee, someone testified at that time that in 10 years we would no \nlonger need ground troops. To let you know some of the problems we \nhave--and the fact is, yes, there are a lot of smart people around--but \nnobody knows what contingencies we will have to be facing in the \nfuture. And I can assure you, as we proceed into the future, as we \nmodernize our equipment, it will be in use again, and the U.S. Army \nwill come through, as they always have since the days of George \nWashington.\n  As the Army continues to fight for freedom today and peace tomorrow, \nI salute each Army soldier for their sacrifice, dedication, and \nperseverance in protecting America. These soldiers are exceptional \nindividuals who live by the values of loyalty, duty, and selfless \nservice. It is in this spirit that the Army continues to uphold its \nhighest values and take its rich tradition into the next 231 years.\n  May God bless the United States Army.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5898-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REFERRAL OF DISCHARGED NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 491\n\n       Whereas Ignacy Jan Paderewski, born in Poland in 1860, was \n     a brilliant and popular pianist who performed hundreds of \n     concerts in Europe and the United States during the late 19th \n     and early 20th centuries;\n       Whereas Paderewski donated the bulk of the proceeds of his \n     concerts to charitable causes, including the establishment of \n     the American Legion's Orphans and Veterans Fund;\n       Whereas, during World War I, Paderewski worked for the \n     independence of Poland and served as the first Premier of \n     Poland;\n       Whereas, in December 1919, Paderewski resigned as Premier \n     of Poland, and in 1921 he left politics to return to his \n     music;\n       Whereas the German invasion of Poland in 1939 spurred \n     Paderewski to return to political life;\n       Whereas Paderewski fought against the Nazi dictatorship in \n     World War II by joining the exiled Polish Government to \n     mobilize the Polish forces and to urge the United States to \n     join the Allied Forces;\n       Whereas, on June 29, 1941, Paderewski died in exile in the \n     United States while all of Europe was imperiled by war and \n     occupation;\n       Whereas, by the direction of President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt, the remains of Paderewski were placed alongside \n     the honored dead of the United States in Arlington National \n     Cemetery, where President Roosevelt said, ``He may lie there \n     until Poland is free.'';\n       Whereas, in 1963, President John F. Kennedy honored \n     Paderewski by placing a plaque marking his remains at the \n     Mast of the Maine at Arlington National Cemetery;\n       Whereas, in 1992, President George H.W. Bush, at the \n     request of Lech Walesa, the first democratically elected \n     President of Poland since World War II, ordered the remains \n     of Paderewski to be returned to his native Poland;\n       Whereas, on June 26, 1992, the remains of Paderewski were \n     removed from the Mast of the Maine at Arlington National \n     Cemetery and returned to Poland 3 days later;\n       Whereas, on July 5, 1992, the remains of Paderewski were \n     interred in a crypt at the St. John Cathedral in Warsaw, \n     Poland; and\n       Whereas Paderewski wished his heart to be forever enshrined \n     in the United States, where his lifelong struggle for \n     democracy and freedom had its roots and was cultivated, and \n     now his heart remains at the Shrine of the Czestochowa in \n     Doylestown, Pennsylvania: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the accomplishments of Ignacy Jan Paderewski \n     as a musician, composer, statesman, and philanthropist;\n       (2) on the 65th anniversary of his death, acknowledges the \n     invaluable efforts of Ignacy Jan Paderewski in forging close \n     ties between Poland and the United States; and\n       (3) recognizes Poland as an ally and strong partner in the \n     war against global terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/14/senate-section/article/S5899-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 2006\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Following \nthat vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the DOD \nauthorization bill, and we hope to be able to process a number of \namendments throughout the day.
