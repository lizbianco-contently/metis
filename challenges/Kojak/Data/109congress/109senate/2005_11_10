Mr. President, yesterday the world received the sobering \nnews that a series of three explosions struck Jordan's capital city of \nAmman. At least 57 innocent civilians were killed in the immediate \nblast, and well over 100 were wounded.\n  In an apparently coordinated attack, terrorists targeted three large \nhotels that are frequented by Americans. Indeed, when I traveled to \nJordan, I stayed at one of those hotels, as many in this body have in \nthe past. One of the blasts occurred during a wedding party of over 300 \nguests. We have seen over the course of the night and the morning those \npictures displayed on television.\n  On behalf of the Senate and the American people, I express my \nheartfelt condolences to the victims, their families, and the Jordanian \npeople. I condemn in no uncertain terms the perpetrators of this \ngrievous attack. It is an attack on all free peoples. It is an attack \non civilization. Together, we will help the Government of Jordan, if \nrequested, to hunt down the criminals responsible for this egregious \nevent and bring them to justice.\n  Throughout the global war on terrorism, Jordan has been our steadfast \npartner, a reliable partner of our country. King Abdullah has bravely \nspoken against Islamic terrorism and extremism in the Arab world. Under \nhis leadership, Jordan has demonstrated their commitment to peace, \nstability, and moderation.\n  Yesterday's violence against the Jordanian people is another reminder \nof the indiscriminate brutality and vicious nature of the terrorist \nenemy. My Senate colleagues and I renew our call on the international \ncommunity to redouble its efforts to defeat the terrorists and \ndismantle their networks. Defeating terrorism is the duty of all \ncivilized nations. It is the challenge of our age.\n\n[[Page S12632]]\n\n  The United States stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of \nJordan during this difficult time. We share their grief and their \ndetermination to bring the killers to justice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12632-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tomorrow and through the weekend, we will \nbe celebrating Veterans Day. I thought it was appropriate that I come \nto the Chamber this morning for two purposes. First, as chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee in the Senate, I have had the distinct \npleasure of working with the VA and working with veterans across this \ncountry over the last year to not only provide them the services they \nneed to improve their lives but to recognize the changing scene of \nveterans health care and the new veterans that are being created out of \nthe conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan and the kind of care and service \nthose brave young men and women will need as they return home, some of \nthem certainly not as physically or mentally whole as we would like.\n  Because of their tremendous service to our country in the war on \nterrorism, I can say very proudly that this Congress and our committee \nand the Veterans' Administration have clearly stepped up to do what is \nright and appropriate in the recognition of the time-honored care we \nhave provided for our veterans down through the decades and down \nthrough the conflicts in which America found itself, in the \npreservation of our freedom and the advancement of all peoples around \nthe world.\n  Idaho played a unique role this year, and I am here today to talk \nabout the Idaho National Guard 116th Brigade Combat Team that is now \nreturning from service in Iraq. For the last 18 months, these brave men \nand women have made a tremendous sacrifice to be away from their \nfamilies and friends to defend our Nation and work to build a stable \nand free Iraq. For that, I am extremely grateful to all of them.\n  It is important to remember that the soldiers of the National Guard \nare civilians first and soldiers second. They are our doctors and our \nbusiness men and women, plumbers, farmers, teachers. Yet they have all \nanswered their country's call to action during this time of need. The \nskills these civilian soldiers bring to the table have proven to be \ninvaluable as our soldiers work side by side with the Iraqi people to \nrestore the critical infrastructure, establish a thriving economy, and \npromote a free and prosperous system of government.\n  Earlier this year, I had the privilege, once again, to visit Iraq--it \nwas my second time while we have been engaged there in the war on \nterrorism--fulfilling a promise I had made to the 116th as I and the \ndelegation and the Governor saw them off now over a year ago. So I was \nextremely proud to be there and to see this phenomenally enthusiastic \ncivilian soldier in his or her work area as they did what they do so \nvery well in a very courageous and skillful manner.\n  These civilian skills not only were essential to provide the security \nfor the Iraqi people, but they also provided the essential ongoing \nconstruction efforts. I was humbled to have that opportunity to meet \nwith these fine young men and women on the battlefield in Iraq and to \nexpress the gratitude of the people of the State of Idaho and our \nNation for these efforts.\n  I also have enormous respect for what they did, but what is \nphenomenal is the feedback we received from the Iraqi Government \nofficials regarding the work of the 116th. As I say, these are unique \nsoldiers. The Iraqi people saw that and understood that these were \nreally civilians who had tremendous talents in civilian life, and they \nincorporated that not only in the protection and the soldiering that \nwent on over there but in the rebuilding of the infrastructure about \nwhich I talked. These soldiers faced a very difficult and dangerous \ntask of maintaining the peace and stability in some very hostile \nenvironments. Yet they continued their mission, and they handled it \nwith tremendous honor.\n  The members of the 116th have spent 12 months in Kirkuk and other \nareas within that region. Their mission was to provide for the security \nof the people of Iraq against insurgents and terrorist attacks, \nestablishment of self-reliant government institutions, and the \nreconstruction of the basic and critical infrastructure. Their two \noverriding missions were overseeing the successful national elections \nin January and the national referendum vote on October 15. Both of \nthese missions were tremendously successful. We know about that. This \nis exactly what our President had proposed and laid out before us.\n  While Americans and Members of Congress are tremendously anxious \nabout the war currently going on in Iraq, the reality is we are on \nschedule and on course to do exactly what we set out to do to help the \ncitizens of Iraq in standing up for government, providing a \nrepresentative form of government, and stabilizing that area of the \nworld. The 116th from Idaho, these tremendous civilian soldiers, \nparticipated in that, and I must tell you that in representing the \nlargest deployment from the State of Idaho that has ever happened to \nour National Guard, we stand as Idahoans today tremendously proud of \nthe work they did.\n  The good news is, they are coming home, and most of them will be home \nfor Thanksgiving. We will be glad to see them back with their families \nand back in their communities and reassuming their civilian lives and \ndoing that not only for the Idaho National Guard but for all guardsmen \nand reservists around the country. As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, working with the Secretary of the VA, holding hearings in \nIdaho and other places around the country, we want to make sure that \nthis transition back into civilian life is as seamless as possible.\n  These are men and women who have been at war. To simply step out of a \nwar zone and step into their community is not going to be an easy task. \nYet that is exactly what a civilian citizen soldier does. Whether it is \nthe Idaho 116th or whether it is the tens of thousands of other guards \nmen, women, and reservists around the country, we owe them a phenomenal \ndebt of gratitude for the work they have done.\n  You see, we have a system within our military that it is not just the \nactive soldier who serves so well, but it is that citizen soldier, our \nfriends and neighbors in our communities across the country, such as \nthe 116th of Idaho, who continue to serve and, in a time of war, serve \nwith honor and dignity.\n  As we celebrate Veterans Day tomorrow and this weekend, recognizing \nthose who have stood in harm's way and in many instances have given \ntheir lives so our lives could be freer, let's remember those currently \nserving in Iraq, be it the active soldier or be it the Guard or \nReserve, for they are all one and their missions are all the same. The \n116th of Idaho Brigade Combat Team has made Idaho extremely proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12632-4", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12632-S12635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE WAR IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation for \nSenator Craig's comments. I think they are so appropriate as we \napproach Veterans Day tomorrow, November 11. As he said, it is \nimportant that we give gratitude to these soldiers. But it is also very \nimportant--maybe even more important--that this Senate and this \nCongress give our support to them, we back them up, we affirm them in \nthe courageous service they are giving and not undermine what they are \ndoing by thoughtless and unfair criticisms. That is what is on my heart \ntoday and I\n\n[[Page S12633]]\n\nwant to talk about it a little bit. I think it goes to the core of our \nintegrity and our personal self-discipline as Senators.\n  I have to say, with great respect, that politics on too many \noccasions has overridden our commitment in this Senate to the soldiers \nwho serve on the battlefield. We are a free and open society. We value \nand protect free and public debate in our country, and in the Senate \none has the freedom to say or write almost anything he or she desires, \nwhether wise or foolish. To secure and maintain that freedom and our \nother freedoms, on many occasions we have sent our soldiers to battle \nhostile forces around the globe.\n  Over 1 million personnel have died in combat to preserve the freedoms \nand liberties we take for granted today. Young soldiers, volunteers, \nand draftees have been called over the years to defend the values and \nliberties our Nation cherishes. As Senators, we are a key part of the \nprocess by which this Nation authorizes hostilities and calls them up. \nIf there is any maturity of judgment in us at all, we understand that \nsuch a decision, when we make it, is a grave one and we know the lives \nof our military personnel will be placed at risk when we send them out. \nHistory and common sense tells us so. Any Senator not understanding \nthis is not fit for the office they hold.\n  It is my view that there is and are no glorious wars. All war is bad. \nThe Lord did not want His children to fight. But I am resigned to the \nfact that, throughout history, human efforts to maintain peace at any \nprice have failed and that the option of war at certain times becomes \nbetter than the alternatives.\n  Let me speak frankly about the war on terrorism. We in this Senate \nare not children led about like the Pied Piper of Hamelin by President \nBush or Vice President Cheney. We are not and were not ignorant \nconcerning the situation we found ourselves in after 9/11. We cheered \nPresident Bush's strong and determined response to terrorism at that \ntime, and even when he warned us it would be a long, protracted, and \nbitter struggle, which he said repeatedly, the Senate promptly \nauthorized the attack on the Taliban, who oppressed their own people in \nAfghanistan and who harbored and provided training for al-Qaida and \nOsama bin Laden. This Senate supported the President's demand on Mullah \nOmar that the Taliban cease these training bases and turn over bin \nLaden or face military action. We supported that. And when Mullah Omar \nand his oppressors refused, the Senate supported military action \nagainst the Taliban. When the war went so well, virtually everyone was \npleased and said it was a good and proper thing we had done.\n  We are proud of what is happening in Afghanistan today. We have \nsoldiers there, as Senator Craig said, working directly with the people \nof Afghanistan to try to lift them up and give them a period of \nsunshine and peace, after decades of war. These good results happened, \nhowever, not because we voted to authorize force but because this \nNation was able to call on great soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nto go into harm's way, facing what they had to know would be great \ndanger, to execute the policy we voted for and that the President was \nauthorized to execute.\n  The military action in Afghanistan went well. But make no mistake, we \nSenators knew the mission was dangerous and most predicted far more \ncasualties than occurred in that effort. The credit goes to our \nmilitary's brilliant tactics.\n  At this same time, Iraq was continuing its systematic, illegal, and \nunconscionable actions against its own people, against the United \nStates, and against the United Nations--continuing violation of 16 U.N. \nresolutions. These resolutions in essence were a result of Iraq's plea \nfor peace after the coalition forces ejected it from the nation of \nKuwait. Surely this Nation has not forgotten that. Surely this Senate \nhas not forgotten that. Surely we remember that Saddam's Iraq had, by \nsurprise and brutality, attacked and occupied its peaceful neighbor \nKuwait. At that time, with the United States in the lead, the coalition \ndemanded that Saddam withdraw or face military force.\n  In 1991, he refused and, in a brilliant strike, our forces, under the \ncommand of General Norman Schwarzkopf, forcibly ejected Saddam's \nmilitary from Kuwait and liberated that nation. Then Kuwait's was a \nresponsible voice on the world scene, as it is today.\n  To stop the coalition forces from moving to Baghdad to remove him \nfrom office, Saddam made a series of agreements under the supervision \nof the United Nations. He did not keep them, of course. First he \ndeclared he had not lost the war but was in fact the victor. Such a \nstatement was a clear indication of his plans to continue his drive to \ndominate that region and to lead a fight against the west. When a U.N. \nplan was developed to allow the sale of Iraq's oil so food could be \nmade available to the Iraqi people, he cheated on the Oil for Food \nProgram to rebuild his military and his personal palaces, leaving \nmillions of his own people hungry.\n\n  He attacked his own people, brutally repressing the Shiites in the \nsouth and the Kurds in the north. He had earlier used poison gas, a \nweapon of mass destruction, against his own people, the Kurds. He \neffectively ejected U.N. inspectors and refused to provide assurance \nthat he was not creating or was not in possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction. He had previously promised not to possess or develop these \nweapons. He fired missiles regularly at American and British aircraft \nas they sought to enforce the no-fly zones to protect the Kurds and the \nShiites from oppression.\n  In response, President Clinton and President Bush authorized hundreds \nof military responses against Iraq, dropping bombs on military \npositions and carrying out missile strikes. Surely we have not \nforgotten--we were in a state of hot hostility with Iraq, leading up to \nour decision to remove him from power.\n  The megalomania of Saddam, and his brutality, presented the decent \nnations of the world with a direct challenge. With the growth of \nterrorism that had culminated in the 9/11 attacks, and which threatened \nthe peaceful world, it became clear that the reconstituting of Saddam's \nforces in violation of the United Nations could not be allowed to \ncontinue. Once again, our Nation led a huge international coalition to \ndemand that he comply with the U.N. resolutions. The vote in this \nSenate to authorize that and to insist that he comply and use force if \nhe refused to do so was 78 to 22, with a clear majority of our \nDemocratic Senators in support to authorize military force with or \nwithout U.N. approval if Saddam refused to comply with these \nresolutions.\n  Our decision was not taken lightly or in haste. The issue had been \nopenly discussed for months. The Senate debate was full and free. Most \nfelt there was no other option.\n  I remember the Economist magazine of London said the embargo was \nfailing. We either give up or fight. They concluded in their editorial: \nOur choice is to fight. The British Government reached the same \nconclusion, as did many others.\n  Of course, our vote was consistent with the 1999 resolution of this \nSenate signed by President Clinton to make it the official policy of \nour Government to effect a regime change in Iraq, so bad had Saddam's \nactions become even at that time. Still, there was no rush to war. \nPresident Bush powerfully made his case abroad and at the U.N. \nCountless efforts were undertaken to bring Saddam into compliance, but \nthey all failed. The demands on Saddam became more and more direct, the \nwarnings more and more explicit, and his utter refusal to comply with \nthe agreements on weapons inspections and other U.N. resolutions became \nmore and more obvious. He had made up his mind. The stark reality \nbecame clear. He would not ever voluntarily comply.\n  He thought he could break the coalition, that we would not invade, \nthat he could continue on with his fantasy that Iraq, under his \nleadership, would dominate this whole region of the world. Please \nremember, the Senate vote consisted not just of a majority of the \nDemocratic Members but it included the Democratic Party's Presidential \ncandidate, its Vice Presidential candidate, its leader, its former Vice \nPresidential candidate, and then and current leaders. The decision was \na bipartisan decision. Only then did we send our finest soldiers into \nharm's way--a bipartisan decision, after extensive debate by this body.\n  Our soldiers, as a result of this process, were then directed to \nengage and\n\n[[Page S12634]]\n\ndefeat one of the world's largest armies, to effect a regime change in \nIraq. The men and women of our military heard their Nation's call, as \nthey have for so many years. They responded with professionalism, \ncourage, and determination. The challenge was great. The initial \nhostilities and military actions went exceedingly well, but it was very \ndangerous and there were important threats that they faced throughout \nthat effort. Saddam's forces were vast, but they collapsed relatively \nquickly in the face of our aggressive forces executing General Frank's \nsuperb battle plan. While the effort was fraught with dangers, as our \nmedia told us every night, and indeed there was considerable tough \nfighting, our soldiers were again magnificent. We all rejoiced to see \nthe Iraqi celebrations break out.\n  Some said, What happened to the celebrations? They were there. We saw \nthem on TV, to see the fall of the statue of Saddam. The coalition then \nset about to help this exhausted nation, brutalized by decades of \noppression, rebuild itself with freedom and prosperity.\n  While the initial military conflict went better than we could have \nhoped, our vision for a prosperous and democratic Iraq is still on \ntrack. But it definitely has presented more difficulties than most of \nus anticipated. It has been hard. It has been difficult. Suicide \nbombers persist in their hateful bombings. Terrorists are still active \nagainst our forces and the people in Iraq, attacking their own people. \nStill, despite the violence, initial elections were completed with blue \nfingers held high and a separate election ratified the Constitution. \nNow the first democratic elections are set for December and are on \ntrack.\n  Vicious, terroristic suicide bombers remain. While they will be able \nto inflict suffering and fear on the people of Iraq and death on our \nsoldiers, their efforts are and must be doomed. The terrorists offer no \nhope, no plan, no vision. They simply desire, like Saddam, to seize \npower and run Iraq for their own purposes, to control the reins of \npower for their own radical and twisted purposes.\n  But, our military personnel, soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen, \nall one force, have performed magnificently. I have been to Iraq three \ntimes, and visited with active, Guard and Reserve units. I talked to \nthe soldiers and we are so proud of them. They have not whined or \nadvocated retreat. They want the war to be successful. Every day they \ngo out on patrol placing their lives on the line to carry out the \npolicies and directions we, the Senate, the House of Representatives, \nand the President gave them. Our soldiers know their civics. They are \nplacing their lives on the line for America. Because in this Republic, \nthe proper governmental authorities of the people have spoken.\n  Consistently, they tell me, their parents, and their friends that \nthey believe in what they are doing. They know the Iraqi people want a \nbetter life. They, by countless acts of kindness and courtesy, amid the \nviolence and strain of war, work to create good will, to explain \ndemocracy, and promote harmony. They want to help the Iraqi people to \nhave a better life, and then, then they want to come home.\n  You bet they want to come home. But they truly desire that our noble \ngoal, their mission for a better Iraq, be realized.\n  Who, more than our soldiers, knows the dangers from hidden and sneak \nattacks? Who knows the reality on the ground better than they? \nCertainly not the television networks constantly focusing on violence \nand contention who drop in and bug out.\n  But, colleagues, the greatest concern our soldiers have is that this \nSenate, our Congress, will lose its nerve and pull back before the job \nis done. You see, losing our nerve will undermine what they have \naccomplished by blood and sweat.\n  While remarkably steadfast and determined, they do not like what they \nsee and hear from Congress or the media. Their successes ignored, the \nproblems exaggerated. Their errors are highlighted. I am particularly \nconcerned that our Senate debate in recent months has become infected \nby personal animosity and political venom. The rhetoric coming out of \nCongress is astounding. It was somewhat understandable last year, when \nwe were in a Presidential election campaign, that the political \nlanguage would be overheated. But, now, after the American people have \naffirmed President Bush's leadership by reelecting him with the first \nmajority vote for President in many years, there seems to be a blind \nforce driving some of my Democrat colleagues to prove their votes for \nmilitary force in Iraq were wrong, and that our election was not an \naffirmation of our Nation's bipartisan Iraqi policy, but that this \npolicy was a result of ``lies.'' What false and damaging rhetoric this \nis. I urge my colleagues to remember that the world, our enemies, and \nour soldiers fighting for our policies are listening. While there were \nintelligence failures, our leaders did not lie us into war. We Senators \nheard the same intelligence estimates and we voted to authorize war. \nThe truth is this: We all heard the intelligence and we authorized \nthose hostilities. Some of the intelligence was wrong, but it was not \nwrong that an unleashed Saddam, freed from his box, would again become \na dangerous threat to world peace. That is a true fact. That is a \nstrategic issue we faced. As we wrestle over the intelligence failures \nthat occurred, we must not overreact. This Senate should never parrot \nthe false charges of our enemies. If we make errors, confront them \nhonestly and fix them. But undermining our Nation's position in the \nworld, encouraging the enemy to falsely believe the U.S. is divided, \nand leading the enemy to believe that we may quit if they can just kill \na few more American soldiers or marines is wrong, wrong, wrong. \nPolitical animosity in some cases seems to have so infected our \nrhetoric that criticism has become not constructive but destructive.\n\n  So my plea to my colleagues is insistent. Please remember that the \nworld hears what we say here. Please remember that exaggerated \npolitical charges can do more than sting officials at home. The world \nhears what is said, and many believe what is being said.\n  This war was not based on a lie. I have explained how we came to our \nfinal vote. The issue of the existence of weapons of mass destruction \nin Iraq was important, but it was the strategic recognition that an \nunrepentant and triumphant Saddam, unloosed from the U.N. embargo and \nin acting violation of 16 U.N. resolutions, was the fundamental threat \nto us and to the world. And we certainly all knew that weapons of mass \ndestruction would surely be his easiest tool for international \nintimidation.\n  The United Nations' final report when they exited the country \nconcluded that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and virtually all \nintelligence agencies in the world, including the French that certainly \nwere not under, our control agreed. The Intelligence Committee report, \nphase I, unanimously passed 17 to 0, concluded, however, that the \nintelligence given to the President and Congress was wrong in part. The \nreport specifically concluded that President Bush was not lying to the \nAmerican people. And, importantly, the report concluded that the \nintelligence community was not pressured to alter or shape their views \nto please the President or anyone else.\n  Another major report, the Robb-Silberman Report--Senator Robb, a \nformer Democratic Member of this body, was cochairman--on weapons of \nmass destruction, was clear. They found ``no evidence of political \npressure to influence the Intelligence Community's pre-war assessments \nof Iraq's weapons programs . . . analysts universally asserted that in \nno instance did political pressure cause them to skew or alter any of \ntheir analytical judgements. We conclude that it was the paucity of \nintelligence and poor analytical tradecraft, rather than political \npressure, that produced the inaccurate pre-war intelligence \nassessments.''\n  So why do our colleagues continue to promote what I believe are \nfalsehoods? Why call the President and the Vice President liars? Why \naccuse them of sending soldiers to death based on some secret agenda? \nWe debated it openly here for months. For the life of me, I can't \nunderstand it. We all--all of us--know the facts today; we knew the \nsituation then; we know the score. There was no mystery when we voted \nto authorize military force, nor is there mystery now. The going, \nthough, is tough in Iraq now. The need, therefore, is even greater for \nus to all work\n\n[[Page S12635]]\n\ntogether to meet the challenge and successfully conclude our policies \nto create a better, positive, democratic, and prosperous future for \nIraq. We must pull together and focus on the goal we endorsed when the \nwar started.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, tomorrow our country is going to be \ncelebrating Veterans Day. Together, across the country, we will be \nhonoring the service and sacrifice that so many Americans have made to \nkeep all of us safe and free.\n  Tomorrow, in the State of Washingon, I am going to join with local \nveterans at a breakfast for the Compass Center, which provides services \nto homeless veterans.\n  I will be at a ``Service of Remembrance'' at the Evergreen-Washelli \nMemorial Park in Seattle, and I will visit the Washington Soldiers Home \nin Pierce County.\n  I am looking forward to those events and the chance to share my \nthanks with those who have sacrificed so much.\n  Veterans Day is not just a ceremonial holiday. It is not just an \noccasion for us to thank others for what they have done for us. It is \nalso a time to ask if we have done enough for those who serve our \ncountry. And that is a very timely occasion today with so many veterans \ncoming home from places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, and with an aging \nveterans population that needs more care today.\n  So today I ask: Are we keeping our promise to those who served our \ncountry? Do our politicians and our budgets reflect the great debt that \nwe owe to so many veterans?\n  I want to try to answer that question by looking at how we treat our \nveterans who need health care and how we budget for their needs and how \nwe treat our Guard and Reserve members.\n  First of all, we recognize we have an obligation to those who serve \nus. When they signed up to serve our country, we agreed to take care of \nthem. They kept their part of the bargain, and now we need to keep \nours.\n  In my home State of Washington, we have made a tremendous \ncontribution to that effort. I am sad to report that 102 servicemembers \nfrom Washington State have made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our \nNation in this war in Iraq. They have earned a place of eternal honor \nin a rollcall of freedom.\n  We owe them and their families a debt that can never be fully repaid.\n  Many other veterans have come home to us with serious injuries, both \nvisible and invisible. They need our help as well.\n  Today, more than 6,500 Washington State citizens are serving in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Since 2001, more than 1 million Americans have served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and of those 20,000 have been from my home State of \nWashington.\n  Back in March, I traveled to Iraq and Kuwait. I had the opportunity \nto meet with a number of our Washington State National Guard who are \nserving our country there. I saw firsthand they were all operating \nunder tremendously difficult and dangerous conditions. I also saw how \nevery one of them was professional and fully committed to completing \ntheir mission.\n\n  We need to do right by everyone who serves us because we made a \npromise and because it keeps our military strong. The way we treat our \nveterans today affects our ability to recruit new soldiers tomorrow. \nBut don't take my word for it. Listen to what George Washington once \nsaid:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \n     proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier \n     wars were treated and appreciated by their country.\n\n  Those are the words of George Washington. They are just as true today \nas when he said them.\n  Let's look at how well we are keeping our promise, starting with \nhealth care. We can all be proud the VA provides some of the best \nhealth care available anywhere in America. We have a great health care \nsystem in the VA, but we don't fund it like a priority. Every year it \nis a struggle to get Congress to provide the funding that is needed. \nThat is why we need to make veterans health care spending mandatory so \nit is not subject to budget games every year.\n  This year we had a big fight to make sure veterans did not lose their \nhealth care. Starting last February, I began warning that the lines \nwere growing at the VA and we needed to do more. I pointed to the many \nveterans who were returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan who needed \ncare. Three times I offered amendments to boost VA funding in the \nSenate. And three times they were voted down. For months the VA and the \nadministration assured us that everything was fine.\n  But then in June we learned that the VA was facing a massive \nshortfall of $1 billion. Again, I introduced a bill to provide the $1.5 \nbillion in supplemental that the VA needed for funding. That time it \npassed.\n  Today, the House and the Senate are in negotiations to set the final \nveterans health care budget for fiscal year 2006. I am very concerned \nwe will not provide enough funding. Yesterday, I joined with leaders \nfrom six national veterans service organizations to send a message. \nTogether, we said we are watching. We expect the House and the Senate \nto keep their commitment to America's veterans. Any dollar below the \nSenate level is $1 taken away from a veteran. It is a VA clinic that \nwill not be constructed. It is a VA doctor who will not be hired. It is \na veteran who doesn't get the care America promised them when they \nenlisted. We cannot leave our veterans without care; we have to stick \nwith the Senate budget in the final appropriations bill.\n  I am also very concerned about how we treat those who have challenges \nsuch as post-traumatic stress disorder. Instead of focusing on getting \nhelp to those who need it, today the VA is moving to scrutinize and \nstigmatize our veterans with post-traumatic stress syndrome. That is \nwhy I worked with Senators Durbin and Obama to put language into the \nSenate VA bill that will require the VA to explain its plan to Congress \nand to hold veterans harmless, except, of course, in cases of fraud. \nThose protections have to stay in the final bill that emerges from this \nconference. We will be watching.\n  As I think about the way we treat veterans health care, it is pretty \nclear we need to do two more things. First of all, the VA has to \nprovide an accurate accounting of how it is spending the money we have \nprovided. It needs to give us a clear picture of the needs it is seeing \nthroughout the country. Second, the Bush administration needs to start \nsending realistic budgets, no more gimmicks, no games--send a 2007 \nbudget that is based on real numbers and real needs. They need to send \na budget that takes care of both our aging veterans and our veterans of \ncurrent operations. When I look at our budget and our priorities, I \nknow we have a lot more work to do to keep our promise to our American \nveterans.\n  Another area that concerns me is how we are treating our Guard and \nReserve members, especially when they come home from the battle front. \nIn this war, we are relying on Guard and Reserve heavily. It is \nestimated that 40 percent of those on the ground in Iraq are citizen \nsoldiers. Unfortunately, today the support services for the Guard have \nnot kept pace with the way we are now relying on them in this war. They \ndid not often have access to employment services or job training or \nfamily support or health care when they return home.\n  This past summer, I held a series of roundtables around the State of \nWashington. I heard from Guard and Reserve members who had come home, \nwho could not find a doctor that accepts TRICARE. I heard about \nreservists who returned home and fell through the cracks without the \npayments or support they were promised. I heard from veterans who could \nnot find a job when they came home to this country after serving so \nhonorably.\n  Our transition services are left over from the Cold War. They do not \nwork for a military that now today relies so\n\n[[Page S12636]]\n\nheavily on Guard and Reserve members. I fear this administration is \nmoving the cost of war on to businesses and families who are our Guard \nmembers. I believe they have already sacrificed enough. To do our part, \nwe have to update transition and employment services that we bring to \nthe returning Guard and Reserve members.\n  As I evaluate today how we were treating our veterans, one thing is \nclear to me: America's military personnel are providing the highest \nlevel of service to our country, but we have got some work to do to \nmake sure our support of them, when they come home, is equal to the \nservice they have provided. I am committing to keep a promise our \ncountry has made. I ask for the support and leadership of every member \nof the Senate to do the same. We owe our veterans nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I commend my friend from the State of \nWashington for an excellent statement and comment. She has been a \ntireless worker in terms of veterans' rights.

I certainly want to work with her in \nevery possible way to make sure those efforts are achieved for people \nnot only in the State of Washington and Massachusetts but all across \nthe country.\n  Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Earlier this week, Madam President, several of our \nRepublican colleagues came to the Senate and attempted to blame \nindividual Democratic Senators for their errors in judgment about the \nwar in Iraq. It was little more than a devious attempt to obscure the \nfacts and take the focus off the real reason we went to war in Iraq. \nMadam President, 150,000 American troops are bogged down in a quagmire \nin Iraq because the Bush administration misrepresented and distorted \nthe intelligence to justify a war that America never should have \nfought. The President wrongly and repeatedly insisted that it was too \ndangerous to ignore the weapons of mass destruction in the hands of \nSaddam Hussein and his ties to al-Qaida.\n  If his march to war, President Bush exaggerated the threat to the \nAmerican people. It was not subtle. It was not nuanced. It was pure, \nunadulterated fear mongering based on a devious strategy to convince \nthe American people that Saddam's ability to provide nuclear weapons to \nal-Qaida justified immediate war.\n\n  The administration officials suggested the threat from Iraq was \nimminent and went to great lengths to convince the American people that \nit was. At a roundtable discussion with European journalists last \nmonth, Secretary Rumsfeld deviously insisted:\n\n       I never said imminent threat.\n\n  In fact, Secretary Rumsfeld told the House Committee on Armed \nServices on September 18, 2002:\n\n     . . . some have argued that the nuclear threat from Iraq is \n     not imminent--that Saddam Hussein is at least 5-7 years away \n     from having nuclear weapons. I would not be so certain.\n\n  In May of 2003, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer was asked whether \nwe went to war because we said WMD were a direct and imminent threat to \nthe United States. And Fleischer responded, ``Absolutely.''\n  What else could National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice have been \nsuggesting other than an imminent threat, extremely imminent threat \nwhen she said on September 2, 2002:\n\n       We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.\n\n  President Bush himself may not have used the word ``imminent,'' but \nhe carefully chose strong and loaded words about the nature of the \nthreat, words that the intelligence community never used to persuade \nand prepare the Nation to go to war against Iraq.\n  In the Rose Garden on October 2, 2002, as Congress was preparing to \nvote on authorizing the war, the President said the Iraqi regime ``is a \nthreat of unique urgency.''\n  In a speech in Cincinnati on October 7, President Bush specifically \ninvoked the dangers of nuclear devastation:\n\n       Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the \n     final proof--the smoking gun--that could come in the form of \n     a mushroom cloud.\n\n  At an appearance in New Mexico on October 28, 2002, after Congress \nhad voted to authorize war and a week before the election, President \nBush said Iraq is a ``real and dangerous threat.''\n  At a NATO summit on November 20, 2002, President Bush said Iraq posed \na ``unique and urgent threat.''\n  In Ft. Hood, TX, on January 3, 2003, President Bush called the Iraqi \nregime ``a grave threat.''\n  Nuclear weapons. Mushroom cloud. Unique and urgent threat. Real and \ndangerous threat. Grave threat. These words were the administration's \nrallying cry to war. But they were not the words of the intelligence \ncommunity, which never suggested the threat from Saddam was imminent or \nimmediate or urgent.\n  It was Vice President Cheney who first laid out the trumped-up \nargument for war with Iraq to an unsuspecting public. In a speech on \nAugust 26, 2002, to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, he asserted:\n\n     . . . We now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to \n     acquire nuclear weapons . . . Many of us are convinced that \n     Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon.\n\n  As we now know, the intelligence community was far from certain. Yet \nthe Vice President had been convinced.\n  On September 8, 2002, he was even more emphatic about Saddam. He \nsaid:\n\n       [we] do know, with absolute certainty, that he is using his \n     procurement system to acquire the equipment he needs in order \n     to enrich uranium to build nuclear weapons.\n\n  The intelligence community was deeply divided about the aluminum \ntubes, but Vice President Cheney was absolutely certain.\n  One month later, on the eve of the watershed vote by Congress to \nauthorize the war, President Bush said it even more vividly. He said:\n\n       Iraq has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes \n     . . . which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. \n     If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an \n     amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a \n     single softball, you can have a nuclear weapon in less than a \n     year. And if we allow that to happen, a terrible line would \n     be crossed . . . Saddam would be in a position to pass \n     nuclear technology to terrorists.\n\n  In fact, as we now know, the intelligence community was far from \nconvinced of any such threat. The administration attempted to conceal \nthat fact by classifying the information and the dissents within the \nintelligence community until after the war, even while making dramatic \nand excessive public statements about the immediacy of the danger.\n  In October of 2002, the intelligence agencies jointly issued a \nnational intelligence estimate stating that ``most agencies'' believe \nthat Iraq had restarted its nuclear program after inspectors left in \n1998 and that if left unchecked, Iraq ``probably will have a nuclear \nweapon during this decade.''\n  The State Department's intelligence bureau, however, said the \n``available evidence'' was inadequate to support that judgment. It \nrefused to predict when ``Iraq could acquire a nuclear device or \nweapon.''\n  About the claims of purchases of nuclear material from Africa, the \nState Department's intelligence bureau said that claims of Iraq seeking \nto purchase nuclear material from Africa were ``highly dubious.'' The \nCIA sent two memoranda to the White House stressing strong doubts about \nthose claims. But the following January 2003, the President included \nthe claims about Africa in his State of the Union Address and \nconspicuously cited the British Government as the source of that \nintelligence.\n  Information about nuclear weapons was not the only intelligence \ndistorted by the administration. On the question of whether Iraq was \npursuing a chemical weapons program, the Defense Intelligence Agency \nconcluded in September 2002 that:\n\n     . . . there is no reliable information on whether Iraq is \n     producing and stockpiling chemical weapons, or whether Iraq \n     has--or will--establish its chemical warfare agent production \n     facilities.\n\n  That same month, however, Secretary Rumsfeld told the Committee on\n\n[[Page S12637]]\n\nArmed Services that Saddam has chemical weapons stockpiles.\n  He said, ``We do know that the Iraqi regime has chemical and \nbiological weapons of mass destruction,'' that Saddam ``has amassed \nlarge clandestine stocks of chemical weapons.'' He said that ``he has \nstockpiles of chemical and biological weapons'' and that Iraq has \n``active chemical, biological and nuclear programs.'' He was wrong on \nall counts.\n  Yet the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate actually \nquantified the size of the stockpiles, stating that ``although we have \nlittle specific information on Iraq's CW stockpile, Saddam probably has \nstocked at least 100 metric tons and possibly as much as 500 metric \ntons of CW agents--much of it added in the last year.'' In his address \nto the United Nations on February 5, 2003, Secretary of State Colin \nPowell went further, calling the 100 to 500 metric ton stockpile a \n``conservative estimate.''\n  Secretary Rumsfeld made an even more explicit assertion in his \ninterview on ``This Week with George Stephanopoulos'' on March 30, \n2003. When asked about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, he said:\n\n       We know where they are. They're in the area around Tikrit \n     and Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat.\n\n  The administration's case for war based on the linkage between Saddam \nHussein and al-Qaida was just as misguided.\n  Significantly, here as well, the Intelligence Estimate did not find a \ncooperative relationship between Saddam and al-Qaida. On the contrary, \nit stated only that such a relationship might develop in the future if \nSaddam was ``sufficiently desperate''--in other words, if America went \nto war. But the estimate placed ``low confidence'' that, even in \ndesperation, Saddam would give weapons of mass destruction to al-Qaida.\n  But President Bush was not deterred. He was relentless in playing to \nAmerica's fears after the devastating tragedy of 9/11. He drew a clear \nlink--and drew it repeatedly--between al-Qaida and Saddam.\n  On September 25, 2002, at the White House, President Bush flatly \ndeclared:\n\n       You can't distinguish between Al Qaeda and Saddam when you \n     talk about the war on terror.\n\n  In his State of the Union Address in January 2003, President Bush \nsaid, ``Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and \nstatements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and \nprotects terrorists, including members of Al Qaeda,'' and that he could \nprovide ``lethal viruses'' to a ``shadowy terrorist network.''\n  Two weeks later, in his Saturday radio address to the Nation, a month \nbefore the war began, President Bush described the ties in detail, \nsaying, ``Saddam Hussein has longstanding, direct and continuing ties \nto terrorist networks. . . .''\n  He said:\n\n       Senior members of Iraqi intelligence and Al Qaeda have met \n     at least eight times since the early 1990s. Iraq has sent \n     bomb-making and document-forgery experts to work with Al \n     Qaeda. Iraq has also provided Al Qaeda with chemical and \n     biological weapons training. An Al Qaeda operative was sent \n     to Iraq several times in the late 1990s for help in acquiring \n     poisons and gases. We also know that Iraq is harboring a \n     terrorist network headed by a senior Al Qaeda terrorist \n     planner. This network runs a poison and explosive training \n     camp in northeast Iraq, and many of its leaders are known to \n     be in Baghdad.\n\n  Who gave the President this information? The NIE? Scooter Libby? \nChalabi?\n  In fact, there was no operational link and no clear and persuasive \npattern of ties between the Iraq Government and al-Qaida. A 9/11 \nCommission staff statement in June of 2004 put it plainly:\n\n       Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that \n     any ties existed between Al Qaeda and Iraq. We have no \n     credible evidence that Iraq and Al Qaeda cooperated on \n     attacks against the United States.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission Report stated clearly that there was no \n``operational'' connection between Saddam and al-Qaida. That fact \nshould have been abundantly clear to the President.\n  The Pentagon's favorite Iraqi dissident, Ahmed Chalabi, is actually \nproud of what happened. ``We are heroes in error,'' Chalabi said in \nFebruary 2004. ``As far as we're concerned, we've been entirely \nsuccessful. That tyrant Saddam is gone and the Americans are in \nBaghdad. What was said before is not important. The Bush administration \nis looking for a scapegoat. We're ready to fall on our swords, if he \nwants.''\n  What was said before does matter. The President's words matter. The \nVice President's words matter. So do those of the Secretary of State \nand the Secretary of Defense and other high officials in the \nadministration. And they did not square with the facts.\n  The Intelligence Committee agreed to investigate the clear \ndiscrepancies, and it is important that they get to the bottom of this \nand find out how and why President Bush took America to war in Iraq. \nAmericans are dying. Already more than 2,000 have been killed and more \nthan 15,000 have been wounded.\n  The American people deserve the truth. It is time for the President \nto stop passing the buck and for him to be held accountable.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am delighted to do that. We will have \na 6-minute extension on each side in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if the Senator will entertain a \nquestion, we will allocate my time on the question, as I propound it, \nand to the extent he responds will be on his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I was grievously concerned when the \nSenator said we are locked down in a quagmire in Iraq. I have made a \nnumber of trips there and completed a trip there several weeks ago with \nSenator Stevens and Senator John Kerry.\n  Our troops are not in a quagmire. They are fighting a very courageous \nwar against international terrorism. The movement sparked by Osama bin \nLaden, Zarqawi, and others is a worldwide movement. It goes from Spain \nto Indonesia. And they have selected, in the last 6 or 8, maybe a \nyear's time, Iraq as the focal point to where they will challenge the \nfree nations of the world in this struggle against terrorism.\n  By no means, by no stretch of any measure of military analysis, can \nit be said that our troops are bogged down in a quagmire. They are \nfully mobile. They are working better than ever with the Iraqi security \nforces, largely trained by the coalition forces, who are now fighting \nside by side with coalition forces and engaging the enemy wherever they \ncan find them.\n  Iraq is a nation with vast borders which are unsecure. There is \nreally no way to secure them to the point you can stop total \ninfiltration. But these infiltrations of insurgents throughout the \nworld are responding to a worldwide challenge to the free nations. We \nawakened in the last few days, or in just 24 hours or less, to an \nattack in Jordan, again sparked by the worldwide move in terrorism, \nagainst the Kingdom of Jordan.\n  So I say to my friend, I would hope that this comment about ``in a \nquagmire'' is not relative to the courageous performance of the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces in this war on terrorism in Iraq. They are \nfully mobile. They are selecting their field of battle. They are \nassisted by the Iraqi forces. And they are taking a toll on the \nterrorists.\n  I ask my colleague, do you disagree with that analysis?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S12638]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Madam President, I have nothing but the highest \nregard and respect for those who are involved in the conflict and \nfighting for the United States. I regret sometimes that we have not \nprovided them with the military equipment that we should have. But I \nhave the highest regard and respect for the Armed Forces of the United \nStates, and I have supported, and will continue to support, to make \nsure they have the equipment they need to carry on their mission. They \nare all heroes.\n  The question is the policy. At some time, I will respond, whenever--\nMadam President, what is the time allocation now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 3 minutes, the \nSenator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. Well, that will be the answer. When the Senator is \nfinished, I will be glad to respond generally to his theme.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am perfectly willing to, at this point \nin time, conclude this colloquy. I certainly feel I have had adequate \nopportunity to make my point. So unless the Senator so desires, we will \nproceed on with the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I will make a brief comment in response to the \ngeneral statement that the Senator made and use my own time. And then \nthe Senator can use whatever time.\n  Madam President, we were attacked on 9/11. We were attacked by Osama \nbin Laden. Where is Osama bin Laden today? Since 9/11 we have not \ncaptured him. The focus and attention was in Afghanistan. Nonetheless, \nthis administration took us to war in Iraq. At that time, we had al-\nQaida effectively by the throat and instead we lost that opportunity \nand now have ourselves bogged down in Iraq. That happens to be the \nfact. We have not enhanced the war against terror by being in Iraq. I \nthink we made Iraq a training ground for terrorists.\n  So I differ with my friend and colleague. I think the job should have \nbeen finished in Afghanistan. That is where Osama bin Laden has been. \nBut the idea that the President of the United States--as I illustrated \nin 15 minutes of direct quotes; and I will not repeat them--brought the \nUnited States to war on the basis of the dangers that Saddam Hussein \nhad a nuclear weapon and there was a tie between Saddam Hussein and al-\nQaida is basically wrong. That is not the Senator from Massachusetts \nsaying that. That is the 9/11 Commission saying that.\n  Now, what is so wrong about trying to get the facts on this? The \nreason to get the facts and the reason it is so important--with the \nRockefeller effort and the efforts by my friends, the Senators from \nMichigan and California, to get the facts--is because we do not want to \nrepeat that. We have a dangerous situation in Iran. We have a dangerous \nsituation in North Korea. We do not want to duplicate the mistakes that \nthis country took with its leaders. We do not want to duplicate that. \nThat is why this report is so important.\n  Madam President, I stand by my statement that I think that the war in \nIraq was a grave mistake, that the American people were misled, and \nthat there is ultimately not going to be a military solution. There is \nthe quagmire: a military solution to solve the problem in Vietnam, a \nmilitary solution to try and solve the problem in Iraq. It is not going \nto work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I will simply state to my colleague and \nfellow member of the Senate Armed Services Committee that it is well \nrecognized that certain intelligence that was used by not only our \nPresident but the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the President of \nFrance--we could go on and on--was universally accepted at that point \nin time. History has shown that a good deal of that intelligence turned \nout to be inaccurate.\n  But there were many reasons for going to war in Iraq, not the least \nof which our forces were trying to enforce the United Nations \nresolution prohibiting Iraq from taking certain actions to the north \nand to the south.\n  They were actually firing on our aircraft that were trying to patrol \nand enforce U.N. resolutions. Saddam Hussein ignored consecutive \nresolutions of the United Nations. That whole structure was before the \nworld, and he was flaunting it.\n  Most recently, I note that the United Nations Security Council has \nextended the basis on which operations are now being conducted by the \ncoalition of forces in Iraq today.\n  With regard to the administration, I commend the administration for \nputting out, for example, this report called ``The Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq and Reconstruction.'' It is very truthful with the \nAmerican people and, indeed, the world on the successes and the lack of \nsuccess in certain areas. This administration is being accountable for \nits participation as one of the several nations in the coalition in \nputting the facts down. But when the Senator says it is all for naught, \nI say to myself, Iraq is in a struggle to establish its own government. \nWe have just seen the referendum on the constitution. They have adopted \nthe constitution. The constitution is subject to further rework as the \nnext government stands up in the aftermath of the December 15 \nelections--free elections, free elections that have not taken place in \nIraq in several decades. Much has been accomplished to try to stabilize \nthat nation to enable it to select, by the freedom to vote, its own \ngovernment and the degree to which it wishes to join the rest of the \nnations in exploring the challenges of democracy, particularly in that \narea of the world.\n  I salute the men and women of the Armed Forces who have made this \npossible. Yes, we always hope that diplomacy can solve the disputes \nbetween nations. Diplomacy can be no stronger than the will to back it \nup and enforce the decisions of the diplomats. That has been done \nbravely by the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States \nand other coalition forces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the definition of a quagmire is a \ncomplex or precarious position where disengagement is difficult. That \nsays it, in regard to Iraq. This body understood the reason we went to \nwar with Iraq was because this administration represented that Saddam \nHussein had a nuclear weapon or was on the brink of getting nuclear \nweapons and, secondly, had ties with al-Qaida. Others may draw from \nanother part of history, but I stand by that. Both of those facts are \nnot so. It is important that we understand how we came about using \nthose facts, which we see are not so, to make sure we are not going to \nmake those mistakes in the future.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry as to the status \nof the Senate at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12638-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1042, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1042) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2006 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Dorgan amendment No. 2476, to establish a special committee \n     of the Senate to investigate the awarding and carrying out of \n     contracts to conduct activities in Afghanistan and Iraq and \n     to fight the war on terrorism.\n       Lautenberg amendment No. 2478, to prohibit individuals who \n     knowingly engage in certain violations relating to the \n     handling of classified information from holding a security \n     clearance.\n       Talent amendment No. 2477, to modify the multiyear \n     procurement authority for C-17 aircraft.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, there is a further order for two votes \nto\n\n[[Page S12639]]\n\noccur beginning at the hour of 11:30. I think it would be helpful to \nall Members if the Chair would restate the timing and status of those \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11:30 \nshall be equally divided in the usual form, followed by a vote on the \nDorgan amendment at 11:30, which will be followed by the Talent \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Under the time I control, I yield such time as my colleague from \nAlabama may desire to speak. He will speak as in morning business, to \nreserve the time on the bill, on such aspects of the amendments that he \nso desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2476\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Dorgan \namendment and share some thoughts about that. I think there has been a \nlot of misinformation, and the Senator has been misled in some of the \nallegations he is making and is certainly inaccurate in picturing our \nhandling of the reconstruction effort in Iraq as being a wasteful \nenterprise. So much good has gone on. We need to talk about that. Where \nthere are errors, as I will note, we are taking vigorous steps to \ncorrect them.\n  With regard to Senator Kennedy's remarks, he said it is not the \nsoldiers, it is the policy. We decided the policy. This Senate voted 78 \nto 22 to establish a policy with regard to regime change in Iraq. We \nauthorized the President to execute military action if Saddam Hussein \nfailed to comply, as Senator Warner said, with the U.N. resolutions. We \nhave a policy. He may not like it. He was 1 of the 22 who voted against \nit. But he ought not to be doing things that undermine the established \npolicy of the United States, a policy that was bipartisan. A majority \nof the Democratic Senators supported it. The former Presidential \ncandidate for the Democratic Party, its former Vice Presidential \ncandidate, and another former Vice Presidential candidate all supported \nit. It is our policy. We established it, and we sent our men and women \ninto harm's way to execute it. We don't need Senators undermining their \nability to do their job and placing them at greater risk. It is wrong. \nSome people need to examine their conscience as we come up to November \n11 tomorrow, Veterans Day.\n  I rise to speak on the reconstruction effort. Commander Paquette, who \nworks with me, served in Iraq. He was there when the statue of Saddam \nfell. He had the responsibility for reconstruction in the northern \nthird of Iraq. He is a good man. He put his life on the line for this \ncountry. He did what he believed was right. He didn't waste a dime of \nthe American people's money. He had to pass out cash. That is the way \nyou do business there--not to say there is something wrong with that. \nThey don't have checks and banks. That is how you have to do business \nif somebody does work for you, you pay them in cash.\n  I am not by any means claiming that there have not been abuses, that \ncontractors and others may have taken advantage of the difficult \ncircumstances to exploit their profits. That is, unfortunately, the \nhistory of the world. We need to watch it constantly. I am a strong \nsupporter of that and don't doubt that. But enough is enough. The \nreckless commentary we have been hearing has created in the media and \nwith the American people a distorted view of the reality of what is \nhappening on the ground in Iraq for reconstruction. It is the same \nthing that is occurring with regard to the detainee abuse scandal--\ngreatly exaggerated, without any recognition of the efforts that have \nbeen taken to make sure abuses don't occur.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are requesting yet \nanother investigation. They wish to create a special committee on war \nand reconstruction in the middle of this war. This special committee \nwill look into matters that are already being investigated by the \nGovernment Accountability Office, an independent agency--not a \nDepartment of Defense agency--which we call on in a bipartisan way to \ninvestigate complicated matters. The Department of Defense inspector \ngeneral is investigating all allegations. The Defense Contract Audit \nAgency, the State Department inspector general, the Army's inspector \ngeneral, and other organizations are watching what goes on there and \nconducting investigations into any allegation of fraud or abuse that \nmay be presented. And a special inspector general's office was created \nalready to increase accountability. This is important. It is the \nSpecial Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, commonly called \nSIGIR in the theater.\n  The Senator from North Dakota offers examples of abuse that he claims \nneed another investigation. I honestly believe these charges are \nexaggerated distortions of reality and overlook the great work that is \nbeing done there toward reconstruction. I could stand here and address \nmany of these complaints, but I will take issue with three he has \ncontinually raised in recent months as evidence of the fraud and waste \nhe suggests is occurring. We can consider the overall picture of how \nthings are being done.\n  Point No. 1, the allegation that $85,000 brand new trucks were left \non the side of the road to be torched and looted because they had a \nclogged fuel pump or because they had a flat tire--we have heard that, \nhaven't we?\n  The decision to leave a vehicle behind in a combat zone resides with \nthe convoy commander and his or her best judgment, not the Senate. \nThere are cities in America where people would be hesitant to stay with \na car at night. They would not want to stay there. They may have to \nleave that car if it broke down. Should the convoy commander call AAA? \nHow about that--we are going to call AAA to come fix it. Waiting for a \nrepair crew out there by yourself or a tow truck to arrive or leaving \nthe whole convoy sitting in a hostile area is not a realistic scenario \nfrom a force protection standpoint. Speed and mobility are keys to life \nin the combat zone. Disabled vehicles are always planned to be \nrecovered; however, on occasion, they may be destroyed by insurgents or \ncriminal elements in Iraq if they break down. The life of each military \nmember--what if it was your son or daughter, would you like for them to \nstay with a disabled vehicle--is worth more than any vehicle. I fully \nsupport the decision of our convoy commanders to abandon disabled \nvehicles to ensure the safety of the personnel under their command.\n  Point No. 2, contractors in Iraq are paid in large amounts of bundled \ncash.\n  These are Iraqi contractors who do work for us, and we want to use \nthem wherever possible so that they can create jobs. They are paid in \nlarge amounts of bundled cash, as we heard the charges made. This is \nthe quote:\n\n       When it was time to get paid, just bring a big bag because \n     we are going to give you cash.\n\n  The statement suggests the money is being given away, come and get \nit. That is simply not true. Payments for services in Iraq have to be \nmade in cash. There is no central banking system in Iraq where checks \ncould be processed or allowed for on some electronic fund transfer. A \nmodern bank and currency system is being developed there now, but as of \ntoday, cash is the only way to effectively pay local Iraqis for their \nlabor and materials. The average Iraqi worker performing under a \nGovernment contract is paid in U.S. dollars because that currency is \naccepted throughout that nation. The large bricks of money are needed \nbecause in many small towns and villages, paying workers in one hundred \ndollar bills is not practical. No one in these towns could break a one \nhundred dollar bill, so there was a need for payment in twenties, tens, \nand fives. Paying large contracts in small bills does create a large \namount of dollars and necessitates bundling and transporting of money \nin bags and lockers. How else are you going to do that?\n  When I was in Iraq right after the war and was in the area in Mosul \nwhere Commander Paquette was working, I met personally with General \nPetraeus, commander of the 101st Airborne. He said the best thing he \ncould do was to go out and see a problem in a neighborhood that could \nbe fixed and to have his own discretion to engage a contractor and get \nthat thing fixed. Maybe it is a bridge, a roof at the hospital, a door \non the school.\n  Get it done right then and pay the person who did the work. He said \nthat is the best way we can help create and reestablish this country. \nAnd he asked for more power.\n  Do you think General Petraeus is stealing the money? He was No. 1 in \nhis\n\n[[Page S12640]]\n\nclass at West Point. No, sir, this is a true patriot trying to serve \nour country to help Iraq and fix it up.\n  Point No. 3, they charge this. This is the quote and the charge\n\n       There is massive waste, fraud and abuse going on with \n     respect to contracting in Iraq . . . who is watching over \n     this massive amount of fraud, waste and abuse? Nobody seems \n     to care.\n\n  Nobody seems to care? That is not true. This statement is most \nmisleading of all. It implies that U.S. tax dollars are just being \nwasted with no care or concern. However, 100 audits and management \nreviews have been performed to date by the GAO, the Defense Contract \nAudit Agency, the DOD inspector general, the Army Criminal \nInvestigative Service, and so on. I met with the chief inspector \ngeneral in Iraq, and he is a firecracker. I mean he is a totally \nfocused man, dedicated to his job of establishing accountability and \neliminating fraud.\n  Have there been instances of fraud? Sadly, yes. Those found guilty \nare being punished. Companies defrauding the Government have had \npayments withheld. They have been removed. Investigations and audits \ncontinue and those who violate criminal laws will be prosecuted. The \nDepartment of Defense and other Government agencies in charge of \nreconstruction in Iraq are reacting swiftly to the comments of the \nauditors and incorporating all of the recommended corrective actions.\n  There is even a special investigative body in Iraq, SIGIR, that \nissued the report I believe that Chairman Warner quoted from with \nrespect to the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, a \nspecial inspector general for just Iraq.\n  Yet claims persist that no one cares, there is no oversight and no \naccountability. It is not true. It is a slander on our people whose \nlives are at risk serving our country in Iraq. As with detainee abuse \nallegations, time and again an objective review of the facts is slowly \nrolling back outlandish accusations that we have heard. Iraq is a war \nzone. It is a dangerous place in many areas. For too many in Congress \nand across the Nation we seem to overlook this fact, even while the \nmedia gives us all a daily count of fatalities.\n  As any soldier can tell you, paperwork is not always the first \npriority when someone is in combat. However, we place special trust and \nconfidence in military officers and senior Government officials \noverseeing the expenditures of taxpayer funds. Continuing to claim \nfraud and abuse is rampant and that no one is accountable is directly \nquestioning the competency and dedication of these professionals who \nare doing their best job possible in very difficult and many times \ndangerous circumstances.\n  There are areas in Iraq that are dangerous. And even the contractors' \nlives are in danger, as we well know. Their actions are making a \ndifference. The most recent report to Congress from the SIGIR states--\nthis is the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Listen \nto this:\n\n       The positive results achieved in the reconstruction program \n     are impressive . . .\n       The United States has made steady progress in its part of \n     Iraq's construction, despite the hazardous security \n     environment, the fluid political situation, and the harsh \n     realities of working in a war zone.\n\n  The media and the other side of the aisle spend too much time telling \nthe negative side of what is going on in Iraq, I believe. To far too \nmany Americans, the image of the conflict in Iraq is a burning humvee \nor the scene of a car bomb. I would like to show you a few before and \nafter photos of how the reconstruction funds have benefitted the people \nof Iraq.\n  This first slide portrays reconstruction of the Ministry of the \nEnvironment Building. Here is the way it looked after the war. And here \nwe see how it has been reconstructed. Somebody was paid for that. I \nhope it was an Iraqi contractor who had a family to feed. Commander \nPaquette says it was. This is a matter he has personal knowledge of, I \nbelieve. So somebody went out there and did a job similar to in the \nUnited States, did a great job of reconstructing this building that was \nutterly gutted.\n  Here is another one, the Az Zubayr Courthouse. Look at this \ncourthouse here. Now, we have to have the rule of law. General Petraeus \ntold me when he was in Mosul how he worked on that, had the Iraqis out \nhere doing the work. Are they going to be paid or not? They don't want \na check, I can tell you that. And here we have a new courthouse where \nwe hope justice can be done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Has the Senator put into the Record the name of the \nassistant he has worked with in developing this and explained about his \nbackground as having been there and participated? Because this is an \nextremely important segment of our debate that the Senator is filling \nin this morning. You are receiving a lot of this information from your \nvery able assistant who is an on-the-scene individual responsible for \nsome of this.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the chairman. I did not do enough. Commander \nPaquette was in Iraq shortly after Saddam Hussein's government fell, \nwhen the statue fell and he was given the charge of handling the \nnorthern third of the reconstruction effort for the military. He was a \nNaval lieutenant commander then and that was his responsibility in our \njoint effort. We have Navy people, Air Force people there, Army and \nMarines, of course, and he worked on the reconstruction effort. Much of \nwhat I am saying, many of these photos he has had personal involvement \nwith.\n  Here is a hospital operating facility. You can see what a pathetic, \nsad thing it was--one little chair. Now, after we have come in with \nreconstruction efforts, you have a fully functional hospital.\n  Here is a bridge replacement with a new structure. This bridge was \ntotally destroyed, broken here, and you can see the old bridge here, \nbut a new bridge has been constructed. Somebody had to be paid to do \nthat work. You can't rebuild a bridge for $500. If you pay people in \ncash, you have to have a bundle of cash to pay the expense of building \na bridge.\n  How about this one. This is one Commander Paquette mentioned to me. \nThis is a street in a town he personally has visited, with sewage \nrunning down the main street there, kids wading in it, he said. And \nhere, after our work to create a sewage system, we have a safe street \nfor this lady to walk on. And of course, you have heard about the \nsabotage of electric powers. This one was sabotaged and here you have \nIraqis climbing up there fixing it. Are you going to climb up to the \ntop of a tower like that and fix it and not be paid? Somebody has to \npay you. They are not going to take a check. We have to pay them in \ncash, and that is what is being done, in an effective way, I believe.\n  I could go on. There are hundreds of examples such as this from all \naround Iraq, thousands of them. Let's not politicize this conflict. It \nis important. We are a nation at war, and the mission in Iraq is vital \nto ensuring democracy, that democracy takes hold in a region of the \nworld that has known far too many tyrants and despots.\n  I am proud of the accomplishments of our military, our civilian and \ncontractor personnel in Iraq. Many of them were former military people \nwho retired, who brought their skills and who had the courage to go \ninto dangerous areas. They are dedicated to improving the quality of \nlife for millions of Iraqis and Afghanis and are doing so under very \ndifficult circumstances.\n  As we approach Veterans Day, the Senate should spend a little less \ntime advertising allegations of wrongdoing, allegations that we are \nalready taking vigorous actions to deal with, and spend more time \ntalking about what is going right. We owe it to the men and women we \nvoted to send into harm's way. We owe it to their families and to the \nfamilies of the fallen to tell them that their mission is important, \nthat their sacrifice is making a difference for nearly 50 million \npeople in a region that has known so much suffering and violence.\n  I thank the Chair. I also want to express my personal appreciation to \nCommander Paquette for his service. He will soon be leaving us, going \nback on active duty. He has been a tremendous asset to my office and \nhelped me craft the legislation I am most proud of to double the death \nbenefits for soldiers who lose their life in defense of our country. We \nappreciate it, and I thank him also for helping us bring a personal \ntouch directly from the frontline in our efforts in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S12641]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I want to say again how important is the \ndebate our distinguished colleague from Alabama has provided the Senate \nthis morning on these key subjects. It is reassuring. The Senator made, \nas did I, reference to this report, which I think is an accurate \ncompilation of what has been achieved and what remains to be achieved \nand the struggle they are having with regrettably this cultural thing \ncalled graft, which is all pervasive throughout much of the Middle \nEast, but nevertheless somehow we are overcoming that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the chairman. I note I did meet that special \ninspector general. He impressed me. I know Senator Collins has met with \nhim and is thoroughly impressed with him. He is very present throughout \nIraq to make sure our dollars are being spent wisely.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, it is my understanding that the time under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Virginia has now expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. And there remains what period of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senate has already defeated this \namendment twice--first on September 14, 2005, on the Commerce, State, \nJustice, Appropriations bill by a vote of 53-44 and then on October 19, \n2005 on the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development \nAppropriations bill by a vote of 54-44.\n  This amendment is unnecessary and duplicative of the current \ncontracting oversight mechanisms created to meet the challenges that \nthen Senator Truman identified. The Truman Committee was needed at the \noutbreak of World War II. There were no GAO or IG investigations, no \nDefense Contract Audit Agency or Defense Contract Management Agency. \nThere were no conflict of interest laws to reign in the dollar-a-day \nmen and no Truth in Negotiations Act, Whistle blower Protections, or \nCompetition in Contracting Act.\n  The Armed Services Committee is currently performing its oversight \ntasks and I see no need for a Special Senate Committee to look at \ncontracting practices in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The potential for fraud, waste and abuse is not limited to just Iraq \nand Afghanistan. The Air Force has just been through the worst \ncontracting scandal in the last 20 years and the Armed Services \nCommittee was at the forefront of uncovering this scandal by using \nnormal committee legislative oversight tools. We conducted hearings, \ntasked the GAO and the Inspector General to review specific issues, and \nrequested and reviewed thousands of documents.\n  The Armed Services Committee has conducted numerous hearings and \nbriefings on acquisition oversight and reform, including oversight of \ncontracting in Iraq, and initiated numerous investigations by the GAO \nand the Inspector General on DOD acquisition practices and programs.\n  Senator Ensign plans to conduct several more Iraq contracting \nhearings in the near future in the Readiness Subcommittee and Senator \nMcCain is conducting a series of hearings on the overall procurement \nprocess.\n  The Office of the Special Inspector General of Iraq Reconstruction \nwas established to look at Iraqi contracting. This new IG has routinely \nbriefed this Committee and others on its findings.\n  Section 823 of this bill establishes a contract fraud task force at \nDOD to identify potential areas where DOD is susceptible to fraud, \nwaste and abuse. This group will inform Congress on how to modify our \ncontracting laws wherever we need to get tougher on contract fraud.\n  This is how best to conduct our oversight--through the established \ncommittee process and established oversight mechanisms. I am sure that \nthe Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who shares \nresponsibility for the oversight and jurisdiction of contracts in Iraq, \nas well as the Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee who has \njurisdiction of Federal contracting would agree.\n  I appreciate the concerns of the sponsors of this legislation. \nHowever, I do not support the establishment of a new special committee \nwhich would duplicate the work of this committee and others and only \nlook at a narrow amount of Federal expenditure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, is the time between now and 11:30 \nallocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time remaining until the vote is \ncontrolled by the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer. I know that Senator Dorgan \nwanted some of this time. I would have a couple comments relative to \nthe Dorgan amendment, first of all. I happen to agree with what has \nbeen recently said about the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction. He, indeed, would be a useful witness for the Senate to \ncall, and I hope that either the Armed Services Committee or the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee would call that \nSpecial Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction so that he could come \nand testify before us. That has not been done.\n  The Department of Defense IG has withdrawn his people. These are the \npeople who look at the contracts with the contractors that are \nsupporting our troops. The DOD IG withdrew his people so that there are \nno longer those folks on the ground who can tell us about those \ncontractors. I do not believe that the Government Accountability Office \npeople have been called to testify before the Senate.\n  There are a lot of issues. There are a lot of issues about the \ninitial contract, why it was awarded on a sole-source basis, whether \nthe CPA, the provisional authority, was overcharged by Halliburton for \noil which was purchased. There are serious questions about meals which \nwere served or not served. There are questions about whether \nHalliburton had the estimating, subcontracting, and financial \nmanagement systems they needed to run two multibillion dollar \ncontracts. There are a lot of questions which need to be reviewed. They \nought to be reviewed. And we ought to have Senate committees that are \ncalling these people to testify in front of us. It seems to me that in \nthe absence of that, what Senator Dorgan is doing is saying: Let's have \na Truman-type committee, a special inspector general to look at the \ncontracting issues. Not only do I see nothing wrong with it, it has \ntremendously powerful precedent.\n  It is named the Truman committee because Harry Truman, in the middle \nof a war--I emphasize in the middle of a war, World War II--Harry \nTruman, a Democrat, with a Democratic President, was willing to \nundertake an investigation of contracting practices and procurement \npractices because he felt the war was being exploited for profit by \ncertain persons who were trying to profiteer off the bravery of others.\n  There is no disagreement among any Member of this body that I know of \nabout the bravery, the professionalism, the courage of our troops. They \ndeserve everything we can give them, and I believe we are giving them \neverything they need. There is no disagreement about that here. When \nMembers of this body get up and are critical about the way in which \nthis war has been won, it seems to me that is what we owe our troops. \nWe not only owe them the material and the training and we owe their \nfamilies everything, but we also owe them our best thinking. And our \nbest thinking is not unanimous. There is not a consensus. There are not \n100 people here who are cloned to think the same way. There are \ndifferent thoughts.\n  We owe our troops our best, honest, conscientious thinking, and when \npeople get up on this floor and provide that thinking, particularly \nwhere it is critical, it should not just be characterized as somehow or \nanother undermining our troops.\n  Our troops depend upon us for the equipment, the training, the \nmateriel, morale, for the support of their families. They depend on us \nfor that. They are entitled to that. People who stand up and give their \nbest thinking are supporting our troops in the best sense of\n\n[[Page S12642]]\n\nthe word; they are giving them their best, honest, conscientious \nthoughts as to how we can succeed in Iraq and make the best of a \nsituation that is not going well, not just stay the course, stay the \ncourse, which is a bumper sticker, not a strategy, but how can we \nmodify this course to increase our chances for success.\n  I want to yield the floor. I see Senator Dorgan is in the Chamber. I \nknow he wants to speak on his amendment. I yield to him such time as he \nneeds to speak relative to his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Michigan has said it \npretty well. This is not an unusual time. The money we have spent with \nrespect to the war in Iraq and the reconstruction of Iraq are not usual \nexpenditures. We have been asked, and the Congress has complied, with \nsupport for legislation that moves $50 billion, $60 billion, $20 \nbillion--huge chunks of money--to pursue, first of all, the war in Iraq \nto support our troops and also to pursue what is called the \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  Almost all of that--I think perhaps all of it--was done without any \nrequirement to pay for it. It was all designed as an emergency, just to \nadd it to the debt of this country.\n  My colleague, Senator Levin, said we have not in any way, nor would \nwe refuse any request that would be helpful to our troops. When we ask \nmen and women in uniform to risk their lives, we have a responsibility \nto them, and that is to give them everything they need to carry out the \nmission they have been asked to carry out. That is not what is at issue \nwith this amendment.\n  This amendment is designed to respond to what we already know, and \neveryone in this Chamber knows, is a massive amount of waste, fraud, \nand abuse of the taxpayers' money. I spoke yesterday about this, but \ncan anyone here justify having the American taxpayers purchase $85,000 \ntrucks to be used on the roads of Iraq by contractors, and when the \ntrucks get a flat tire, what do they do with them? They leave them \nbeside the road and let them be torched. An $85,000 truck with a \nplugged fuel pump, what do they do? Abandon it. It is a plus-cost, \nsole-source contract. The American taxpayer will pay for that; don't \nworry about it. The list is almost endless.\n  A company--Halliburton in this case--charged the taxpayers for 42,000 \nmeals served to American troops. It turns out they were only serving \n14,000 meals. They have overcharged us by 28,000 meals. The people who \nlast were responsible in the Pentagon, now retired, for managing all \nthe fuel contracts to move fuel to the battlefield, after they retired \nthey came back and testified and said: What has happened since is just \nunbelievable. The massive overcharges to move fuel to the battlefield \nby these contractors is almost unthinkable.\n  The stories go on and on. Renting a car for $7,500 a month, buying \ntowels for the troops, double the price so you can put the company logo \non it because the company tells their buyers that is what they are \nrequired to do: Double the cost of the towels so we can put our company \nlogo on it.\n  How many of these stories do we need? Do we need 100 more stories \nlike it? There is rampant waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Why is that the case? Because massive quantities of money are being \nshipped over there in pursuit of reconstruction. Massive quantities of \nmoney are going, in many cases, to no-bid, sole-source contracts under \nthe buddy system, and the taxpayers, I think in many of these cases, \nare being robbed blind. Will someone do something about it?\n  This amendment I have offered would establish what I call a Truman-\ntype committee. Harry Truman stood on this floor in the 1940s in the \nmiddle of a war with a President of his own political party in the \nWhite House, and said: I think there is substantial waste, fraud, and \nabuse in military contracting and in military spending. They formed a \nspecial Truman committee, and he went after and uncovered tens of \nbillions of dollars, in today's dollars, of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\n  Normally, we would do this through oversight hearings, but we have \nnot had many oversight hearings. In some cases, in other venues, none \nat all; in other venues, a few but really no aggressive oversight \nhearings designed to track this massive amount of money.\n  Yesterday, I showed a picture of a fellow who testified at a hearing \nI chaired that we have been doing in the Policy Committee. Why? Because \nthe regular committees don't want to have oversight hearings. Why don't \nthey want to do that? I guess they don't want to embarrass anybody. It \nwould be embarrassing to the White House, I guess, if we had hearings \nabout no-bid, sole-source contracts under the buddy system to big \ncompanies that then waste a lot of money. It would be embarrassing to \ndisplay that in public.\n  The fact is, we owe it to the taxpayers to get rid of the waste, \nfraud, and abuse. Yesterday, I showed a photograph of money that was in \nthe downstairs vault of a building that was occupied by the Coalition \nProvisional Authority in Iraq, which was us, by the way. CPA is us, not \nanything else. It is a fancy name for us. They were dealing in cash. I \nshowed a photograph of one hundred dollar bills wrapped in Saran Wrap \nin bundles. The guy who testified at my committee and who was pictured \nin that photograph said: We told all the contractors, show up with a \nbag because we pay in cash. He said this was like the Old West. Bring a \nbag, we pay in cash. He said: We actually threw around like a football \nthose bundles of one hundred dollar bills wrapped in Saran Wrap. You \nwould be able to play catch with them. It was the Old West.\n  After all, when we provide funding for these contracts, it doesn't \ncome out of the pockets of the 100 Members of the Senate. It is \ntaxpayers' money, and we have a responsibility to the taxpayers to make \nsure it is spent appropriately.\n  If all of the 100 Senators would sit and listen to the stories I have \nlistened to in many hearings now from contractor employees who were \nsickened and disgusted by the waste, fraud, and abuse they saw, if all \nof the Members of this Senate could hear that and then vote against an \namendment that asks for this kind of long-term investigation, I don't \nknow how they can sleep at night.\n  We have had this vote previously, and sufficient Members of the \nSenate have said it does not matter what the evidence is; I don't \nintend to support a special type committee to investigate this waste, \nfraud, and abuse. And they have prevailed. So we will have another vote \ntoday.\n  I say to those Senators who have voted against this amendment \npreviously, if they still believe this waste, fraud, and abuse doesn't \nmatter very much, then vote against it. If they still believe it is OK \nfor the regular committees of the Senate not to hold any significant \noversight hearings, not to do their due diligence, not to meet their \naccountability responsibility, and they don't care about that, then \nvote against this. Just vote against it, it doesn't matter. But then \nthey should not stand up at home and say to their constituents that \nthey care about how this money is spent when there is such dramatic \nevidence of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I used some newspaper headlines yesterday to describe the charges: \n$18.6 million worth of Government equipment missing at the moment that \na contracting company was given to manage. One-third of the equipment \nthat company was entrusted with at this point cannot be accounted for. \nDoes it matter? Is somebody looking into this? It doesn't look like it \nto me. It is really pretty unbelievable. I have spoken before. I am \nguessing nobody in this Chamber--at least only a few in this Chamber--\ncare.\n  My colleague from Michigan was at a hearing we held with Bunnatine \nGreenhouse who rose to become the top civilian contracting official in \nthe Corps of Engineers. She was the top civilian contracting official \nin the Corps of Engineers. She had outstanding recommendations every \nsingle year. She was an outstanding Federal employee, and she was in \ncharge as the highest civilian in the Corps of Engineers for making \nsure contracting was done properly.\n  As the war in Iraq ramped up and some companies began to get \nsubstantial no-bid contracts under the old buddy system, she said this \ndoesn't meet the test of the law; you are violating the procedures of \nthe Corps of Engineers. You are not doing things\n\n[[Page S12643]]\n\nthe right way; there is a right way and wrong way to do things. You do \nit this way. We are going to see substantial waste, abuse, and fraud. \nWhen she started raising those questions, something important happened \nto her. She was told one of two things will happen: You will either be \nfired or you will be demoted.\n  This public servant had the courage to speak up and speak out against \npractices she thought were horribly unfair and were going to hurt this \ncountry, and she paid for it with her career.\n\n  What a message to send to those who have the courage to blow the \nwhistle and speak up. Does anybody care about that? It doesn't appear \nso. It really doesn't appear that way. We have asked Secretary \nRumsfeld. We sent many letters to Secretary Rumsfeld. It is like \nsending those letters into a deep abyss someplace. You get a little \none-paragraph reply saying: Got your letter, get back to you later. And \nthere will never be a later. That is the way it works. Zip it up, cover \nit up, sew it up, it doesn't matter and, oh, by the way, ask Congress \nfor more money; they will certainly appropriate it. Don't worry where \nit is going. If it is waste, nobody cares very much and, by the way, if \nsomebody does care and raises the issue, we will have sufficient votes \non it to say we won't do anything about it. And those sufficient votes \nwill go home and talk about the fact, boy, they are tigers watching out \nfor the American taxpayers. Hardly. Hardly.\n  We will see, once again, in a few minutes whether people really do \ncare about this and whether they are willing to own up to the oversight \nresponsibility Congress has, to care about how the taxpayers' money is \nspent.\n  This case is made. This is not an open case, it is not an argument \nthat has to be made. This case is made. The evidence is all around us. \nThe question is whether enough Senators will care.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I speak on \nthe bill for just a minute or two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend and colleague, if \nthere is an award to be made for determination, he has it on this \nparticular issue. It is interesting that the Senator from North Dakota \ninvoked a good deal of history as to the Truman committee. I think \ncolleagues should know, however, that the Senate has already addressed \nthis amendment on two previous occasions: first on September 14, 2005, \non the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. The vote was 53 to \n44, defeated, and then again on October 19, 2005, on the DOD \nappropriations bill. Again, the Senate rejected it 54 to 44. Those \nmatters should be before Senators.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, since Senator \nDorgan does have another minute left, I believe, and I want to give him \nan opportunity to respond, I will use 30 seconds of that time simply to \nsay that Senator Dorgan has, indeed, been tenacious. There has been an \nabsence of oversight in this area which has been glaring. He has almost \nby himself filled in some of those gaps as he described it. He should \nnot need to do that. We should either have the committees doing that or \nelse we need this special Truman-type committee.\n  I commend him for his tenacity. I am glad he is bringing this to a \nvote, and maybe one of these days--hopefully today--he will prevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this point in time, a vote is imminent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12643-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      NOMINATION OF DONALD C.

That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wish to have a very brief colloquy with my dear friend \nfrom Virginia on this matter, which I think he would want to comment \nbriefly on, and that is I understand that once Secretary Winter is \nconfirmed, which he now is, the Department of Defense will adopt an \napproach under which Secretary England will continue to act as Deputy \nSecretary of Defense on an interim basis. This approach is lawful, but \nit is temporary only and it is not intended to establish a pattern for \nfuture appointments. Would the Senator agree with that statement?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, Mr. President. This is a subject I have discussed \nwith the administration and most specifically with the Secretary of \nDefense. I assure my colleague that it will not establish a pattern \nbecause to me the advice and consent process is a very precise \nobligation of the Senate. This type of action is taken in this case \nbecause it is my understanding that the President will make a recess \nappointment within 120 days, and I assure the Senator this matter will \nnot go beyond the 120 days.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing it up, and I thank him for his \ncooperation and the cooperation of other Senators on this matter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do welcome that assurance. It is important for this \ninstitution. Whether the President is a Democrat or a Republican makes \nno difference on this issue. This is a matter of this institution \nasserting its constitutional responsibility, and I thank my friend from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Virginia is quite right that we have \ntwice before voted on this amendment and I believe ignored the value of \nthe amendment.

There has been a \nmobility capability study which indicates that we have an acceptable \nnumber for this capability.\n  We are looking at cuts in defense spending, and there are a lot of \ntremendous cost overruns. We are looking at rapidly escalating \nprocurement costs. These additional aircraft are not needed. They are \nnot needed today. I believe we have to at some point have some kind of \ndiscipline and listen to what we need and have in capabilities, and \nthis is not one of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as many of you may know, almost every person \nin uniform who has looked at this believes that this program is of \ncritical importance to our national security structures in the 21st \ncentury. There is not any debate that exists there. We believe it is an \nimportant element. If we don't do this, there is a great fear that this \nline will be dropped and the C-17 will be lost.\n  We, obviously, have an interest in Connecticut. The engines are made \nin our State. But this aircraft is far more important than where the \nengines or the bodies are made. It is important to our national \nsecurity needs. That is why we have this bipartisan support.\n  We thank the chairman and ranking member for their support as well of \nthe amendment being offered by the Senator from Missouri and the \nSenator from Connecticut. I am proud to be a sponsor of it.\n  We urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nand the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham).

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are making progress on this bill. It is \nthe intention of the joint leadership, the majority leader, and the \nDemocrat leader, that this bill be finished. Senator Levin and I are \ndoing the best we can to accommodate all colleagues.\n\n[[Page S12645]]\n\nThe amendments we know of that remain--one by the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina. At this time I would like to set the hour of 2:30 \nto consider that. Is that agreeable?\n  We simply bring it up at 2:30 and we determine how it unfolds with \nregard to second degrees.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Massachusetts is ready to proceed with \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is no objection to that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Akaka needs 5 minutes--have you gone through this?\n  Mr. WARNER. What I am trying to get at the moment is the amendments, \nand then we will try to splice in periods of time for our colleagues to \nspeak to other matters on the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are hopeful we can complete the drafting of an Iraq \namendment in the next half hour which, if we succeed, we would want to \nshow it to the Senator from Virginia, but it may take some real time \nthis afternoon.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Let's deal with the known quantities.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts wishes to bring up an amendment which \nis within the 12 amendments of the Senator from Michigan. That is to be \ntaken up now. We will proceed with that. There may well be an amendment \nin the second degree; I cannot anticipate that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could ask the Senator to yield, the Senator from \nMinnesota has an amendment or needs morning business?\n  Mr. DAYTON. To speak on two amendments already included in the \nmanagers' package.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will try and package, for the moment, two items. The \nSenator from Massachusetts will now proceed on his amendment. We cannot \npredict how long it will take because we do not know of the potential \nfor second degrees. That will take place under the underlying unanimous \nconsent. At 2:30 we take up the amendment of the Senator from South \nCarolina and proceed on that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With a second-degree amendment expected on that.\n  Mr. WARNER. So let us get those two locked in for the moment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Excuse me. We made reference to two other Senators within \nthat period of time. Senator Akaka would get 5 minutes for morning \nbusiness, and I want to make sure the Senator from Minnesota, within \nthat same time period, will have 10 minutes that relates to the pending \namendments, as I understand the Senator.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Amendments to the bill that are in the managers' package.\n  Mr. WARNER. And Senator Burr needs 5 minutes.\n  Within that period of time we will accommodate the three colleagues \nfor the matters they wish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Further, I wish to inform Senators that the likelihood of \nany votes between, say, the hour of 12:45 and 2 o'clock is most \nunlikely. As a matter of fact, I ask unanimous consent there be no \nvotes during that period of time to accommodate a number of Senators on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator expect the possibility of a vote before \n12:45?\n  Mr. WARNER. No.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So it is unlikely between now and when?\n  Mr. WARNER. 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand the Senator from Hawaii wants to speak for 5 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Hawaii be recognized \nfor 5 minutes and I be recognized at the conclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12645-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12645-S12648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VETERANS DAY 2005\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nKerry, for the time.\n  Tomorrow is Veterans Day. I pause this morning and join my fellow \nAmericans in paying homage to those who served in this Nation's Armed \nForces.\n  Observance of this day is a wonderful tradition that allows all \nAmericans to reflect upon the sacrifices made by our veterans in \nprotecting our freedoms and liberties. This Veterans Day is especially \npoignant during this time of conflict.\n  Our current battles abroad are a constant reminder of the ordeals our \nsoldiers of this war and past wars endured on behalf of this great \nNation. I commend the many soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines on \nActive Duty, and the National Guard and the Reserves, and their \nfamilies for their service to our country. Our support of our service \nmembers must be steadfast and strong.\n  Veterans Day has a long and important history. In 1911--at the \neleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month--an armistice \nwas signed between the Allied nations and Germany, effectively ending \nWorld War I, then hoped to be ``the war to end all wars''. In November \nof 1919, President Wilson proclaimed November 11 the first \ncommemoration of Armistice Day.\n  This great day was initially celebrated in honor of those veterans \nwho fought in World War I.\n  It was not until 1954 that Congress, at the urging of veterans \nservice organizations, renamed Armistice Day as Veterans Day to extend \nthe commemoration to all those who have so honorably served this \nNation.\n  Although we pause today to commemorate the service of those who \nserved on behalf of this grateful Nation, we must make certain that \nthis day has meaning and is not merely set aside for fanfare and \nspeeches. Indeed, we must make certain that our veterans have our \ncommitment and support every day and not just Veterans Day.\n  Too often our veterans' priorities are not our own. As we saw earlier \nthis year, VA had a tremendous funding shortfall.\n  It took some too long to acknowledge what so many of us had known for \nsome time--that VA health care was not being funded at an adequate \nlevel--a level commensurate with the sacrifice that our veterans made \non the beaches of Normandy, the harbors of Hawaii, the jungles of \nVietnam, and the deserts of the Middle East.\n  I am pleased that VA has announced that it is suspending its planned \nreview of 72,000 post traumatic stress disorder claims. This is surely \ngreat news for all veterans because many times VA compensation is the \nsole source of income for a veteran and his family.\n  We must put into practice daily the sentiment that Abraham Lincoln \nexpressed when he said during his second inaugural address that we \nshould--and I quote the President--\n\n     care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his \n     widow and for his orphan.\n\n  Our 25 million living veterans are the backbone of this Nation.\n  Today, I want to personally express my gratitude to all veterans of \nour Armed Forces and thank them for their service.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2507\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2507.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require reports on clandestine facilities for the \n   detention of individuals captured in the global war on terrorism)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REPORTS ON CLANDESTINE DETENTION FACILITIES FOR \n                   INDIVIDUALS CAPTURED IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Secretary of Defense Report.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than sixty days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives a detailed report on \n     the knowledge of the Secretary, and of the personnel of the \n     Department of Defense, on whether or not there exists, or has \n     existed, any clandestine facility outside of United States \n     territory for the detention of individuals captured in the \n     global\n\n[[Page S12646]]\n\n     war on terrorism, whether operated by the United States \n     Government or at the request of the United States Government.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) Whether or not the Secretary or any personnel of the \n     Department of Defense have affirmative knowledge that a \n     facility described in paragraph (1) exists.\n       (B) If the Secretary or any such personnel have affirmative \n     knowledge that such a facility does exist--\n       (i) the existence of such facility;\n       (ii) any support provided by the Department of Defense to \n     any other department, agency, or element of the United States \n     Government, or any foreign government, for the establishment, \n     operation, or maintenance of such facility;\n       (iii) the amount of funds obligated or expended by the \n     Department in furtherance of the establishment, operation, or \n     maintenance of such facility;\n       (iv) whether the Department has transported individuals \n     captured in the global war on terrorism to or from such \n     facility, and if so--\n\n       (I) the number of such individuals;\n       (II) the date of transfer of each such individual to such \n     facility;\n       (III) the place from which each such individual was so \n     transferred; and\n       (IV) the identity of the agency or authority in whose \n     custody each such individual was held before such transfer.\n\n       (v) whether any detainee in such facility is expected to be \n     prosecuted by military commission or another system for \n     administering justice; and\n       (vi) the interrogation procedures used on each individual \n     detained in such facility.\n       (C) Whether or not the Department has ever held any \n     individual captured in the global war on terrorism at a \n     facility controlled by the Department at the request of, or \n     in cooperation with, another department, agency, or element \n     of the United States Government, and for any such individual \n     so held, a detailed description of the circumstances \n     surrounding the detention of such individual and the \n     disposition, if any of such individual.\n       (3) Form of report.--The report required by paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted in classified form.\n       (b) Director of National Intelligence Reports.--\n       (1) Reports required.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall provide to each member of the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives a detailed report setting forth the nature \n     and cost of, and otherwise providing a full accounting on, \n     any clandestine prison or detention facility currently or \n     formerly operated by the United States Government, regardless \n     of location, where detainees in the global war on terrorism \n     are or were being held.\n       (2) Elements.--The reports required by paragraph (1) shall \n     set forth, for each prison or facility covered by such \n     report, the following:\n       (A) The location and size of such prison or facility.\n       (B) If such prison or facility is no longer being operated \n     by the United States Government, the disposition of such \n     prison or facility.\n       (C) The number of detainees currently held or formerly \n     held, as the case may be, at such prison or facility.\n       (D) Any plans for the ultimate disposition of any detainees \n     currently held at such prison or facility.\n       (E) A description of the interrogation procedures used or \n     formerly used on detainees at such prison or facility.\n       (3) Form of reports.--The reports required by paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted in classified form.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harry \nReid of Nevada and Senator Biden be added as cosponsors of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in recent weeks the American people and \nMembers of the Senate have heard allegations about the existence of \nsecret prison facilities operated by the U.S. Government in various \ncountries around the world.\n  Now, I know many of my colleagues take this matter very seriously. \nThe Central Intelligence Agency has reportedly requested a Justice \nDepartment investigation of how classified intelligence information \nmade its way into print. Clearly, the revelation of the potential of \nthese programs is a serious national security matter. It is one we can \nall agree on, no matter where we sit.\n  No one in this Chamber underestimates the seriousness of the war on \nradical Islamic terrorists. It is a war we have to win, we must win. \nAnd no one underestimates the depravity and the viciousness of our \nenemies. We do not need to look any further than the bombings last \nnight in Jordan to once again be reminded of the kind of enemy we \nface--an enemy willing to always target the innocent. We know that \nsuccess in any war requires the informed consent of the American \npeople. And in an issue as sensitive as this, that informed consent can \nonly be derived from the Congress's full and appropriate understanding \nand involvement in these issues. That in and of itself requires \ninformation and cooperation from the administration so we in Congress \ncan provide effective and informed oversight. That begins by knowing \nwhat the money we authorize and appropriate is being used to do. The \nAmerican people demand no less than that. The fact is, we are not \naware; we are not as a Congress performing that proper oversight. The \nvast majority of us first heard about the possibility of clandestine \ndetention facilities in the Washington Post last Wednesday.\n  Since then, we have heard that this may have been discussed by Vice \nPresident Cheney in a meeting with the Republican caucus. That \nobviously comes from statements by people at the caucus made publicly. \nIf, as has been reported by Senator Lott, members of the Republican \ncaucus can hear about these facilities from the Vice President of the \nUnited States, then the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence ought to be able to receive a full \naccounting.\n  So the amendment I offer today seeks to simply assert, appropriately, \ncongressional oversight in this matter by requiring two classified \nreports--one by the Secretary of Defense and one by the Director of \nNational Intelligence--to the appropriate committees, detailing the \ninvolvement of the Department of Defense and the intelligence community \nin these activities if, indeed, there is any.\n  Not later than 60 days after enactment, the Secretary of Defense will \nprovide a classified report to the House and Senate Armed Services \nCommittees of any knowledge or participation in the operation of \nclandestine facilities by the Department of Defense, including support \nprovided by the Department of Defense to any other part of the U.S. \nGovernment or foreign government. The Secretary of Defense must also \nreport on whether the Department has transported any individuals to or \nfrom such a facility, and whether detainees in such facilities are to \nbe tried by military commission. Finally, this report will include \ndetails about detainees held at DOD facilities for other Government \nagencies.\n  The second classified report required by this amendment is from the \nDirector of National Intelligence to the Intelligence Committees of \nboth the House and the Senate. In it, the Director will provide a \ndetailed accounting of the nature, cost, and operation of any \nclandestine prison or detention facility operated by the U.S. \nGovernment, regardless of location, where detainees from the global war \non terror are being or have been held.\n  Now, let me be clear: We are not passing judgment on the merit or the \nvalue of these facilities. What we are saying is we need to know and \nunderstand what the policy of our country is, what is being done with \ntaxpayer money, and what are the appropriate accounting and oversight \nmechanisms with respect to this.\n  In its reporting, the Washington Post said:\n\n       The CIA and the White House, citing national security \n     concerns and the value of the program, have dissuaded \n     Congress from demanding that the agency answer questions in \n     open testimony [about the facilities].\n\n  My colleagues will note that both of these reports would be \nclassified, both of them would be limited to the committees of \njurisdiction. This is not about open testimony. It is about Congress \ndoing its appropriate job through the appropriate committees.\n  I do not have any doubt that in the American public's mind we are all \nunited and determined to win the war against radical Islamic \nterrorists. But I do know that any administration that tries to keep \nCongress in the dark ultimately winds up damaging the very effort we \nare engaged in. We have seen this all through history. This goes back \nfor years in the relationship of oversight by the Congress and efforts \nby administrations to undertake clandestine initiatives on their own.\n\n[[Page S12647]]\n\n  The executive branch cannot win this by itself. It needs Congress to \nbe invested. It needs Congress to be knowledgeable. It needs Congress \nto act on behalf of the American people. And in this case, the simple \njob of oversight is critical to our ability to maintain the consensus \nnecessary for our Nation. We have seen too often too many instances of \nefforts that go awry that cost us leverage as a nation, cost us \nleverage with other communities, and ultimately may even cost us lives \nof Americans because they do go awry without the proper consent.\n  We also do better as a country in these kinds of efforts when Members \nof both parties across the aisle have joined together in a foreign \npolicy that represents the broad consensus of the American people and \nwhere all of us are accepting responsibility for our actions.\n  I would hope my colleagues, the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember, would accept this amendment because I think it acts in the best \ninterests of this institution and of our Nation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts provided us \na copy of his amendment just a minute before he began his remarks to \nthe Senate. Senator Roberts, on this side, is now in consultation with \nthe ranking member, Senator Rockefeller, and I anticipate that one or \nboth will shortly come to the floor on this issue. At this time I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall not be charged to the time of either the proponent of the \namendment or those who will be giving a different perspective, perhaps, \nin opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burr pertaining to the introduction of S. 1990 \nand S. 1991 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak as \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise to thank the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee and the ranking member, who are \ntwo of the finest public servants I have ever had the privilege of \nknowing, for their leadership of that committee on which I serve and \nfor their leadership on this important legislation before the Senate, \nwhich I support. I also thank them for including two of my amendments \nin the bill, the first of which is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, \nwhich I am proud to coauthor with Senator Murray of Washington and \nSenator Collins of Maine, that says the Department of Defense must \nhonor its promise to pay reenlistment bonuses to members of the Army \nNational Guard. I was told yesterday that the Pentagon has reversed its \nposition and has now approved the National Guard's payment of those \npromised reenlistment bonuses.\n  My second amendment authorizes an additional $50 million for \nchildcare for Active-Duty military families and an additional $10 \nmillion for family assistance centers. The committee bill already \nprovided for increased funding for these two vital programs, and I \nthank the chairman and ranking member for agreeing to these further \nauthorizations which parallel the increased funding that I added to the \nSenate's 2006 Defense appropriations bill.\n  Our military families are facing increased pressures as husbands and \nwives are deployed in faraway war zones and thus separated from their \nfamilies for up to 18 months at a time. The Office of the Secretary of \nDefense has reported that some 38,000 children of Active-Duty families \nare being denied childcare in military facilities due to the lack of \nfunding for the centers and for the spaces needed. This imposes an \nunfair additional hardship on these wonderful American families. The \nextended absence of a parent is compounded by the lack of available, \nreliable childcare. For the same reasons of extended absences, \nemotional and financial stresses, and the understandable need for \nsupport, the military family assistance centers are more important now \nthan ever. They are especially valuable for the families of Reserve and \nGuard men and women whose wife or husband is called to active duty and \nthen deployed in adjusting to extended absences and then readjusting to \nthe spouses return or, in the worst case, to the spouse's not returning \nhome alive, or returning home seriously wounded or maimed for life. \nWhen we talk about supporting our troops, which all of us truly want to \ndo, two very important ways are through childcare and family assistance \nservices.\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to address briefly a related area, \none vital to our national security. Last week the Washington Post \nreported that the CIA is operating secret prisons in up to eight other \ncountries, including one in a former Soviet gulag in eastern Europe. \nThese are so-called ``black sites'' where reportedly the CIA's \n``enhanced interrogation techniques,'' some of which are prohibited by \nU.N. convention or U.S. military law--in other words, torture--are \nbeing used against unidentified subjects for indefinite periods of \ntime. They are reportedly being denied lawyers or any opportunity to \ndefend themselves against whatever charges of wrongdoing have brought \nthem there.\n  At the same time, the Vice President has reportedly given ``one of \nthe most impassioned pitches he has ever delivered'' to Republican \nSenators at last week's caucus lunch opposing the McCain amendment, \nwhich passed the Senate by a vote of 90 to 9, that would prohibit the \nuse of torture against detainees. The President has reportedly \nthreatened to veto the entire 2006 Defense appropriations bill if it \ncontains the McCain amendment. The Vice President was reportedly urging \nthat the prohibition against torture be stricken, or at least an \nexception be given to the CIA.\n  Now we know why the President and the Vice President are so adamantly \nopposed to the Senate's ban on the use of torture or want an exemption \nfor the CIA. It is because the CIA is operating secret prisons in other \ncountries where torture is allegedly being used. Why else would they be \nagainst prohibiting torture, if they weren't doing it or intending to \ndo it?\n  In response to the Post story, Republican congressional leaders sent \na letter to the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence \nCommittees requesting them to ``immediately initiate a joint \ninvestigation into the possible release of classified information to \nthe media alleging that the United States Government may be detaining \nand interrogating terrorists at undisclosed locations abroad. As you \nknow, if accurate, such an egregious disclosure could have long-term \nand far-reaching damaging and dangerous consequences, and would imperil \nour efforts to protect the American people and our homeland from \nterrorist attacks.''\n  Well, with all due respect, I say that the Republican leaders have \nthe right idea but the wrong focus. There ought to be a congressional \ninvestigation, but it ought to be on the existence of those secret \nprisons, on who is being held there, why, for how long, and how are \nthey being treated, whether torture is being used, and why these \n``black\n\n[[Page S12648]]\n\nsites'' are being hidden from Congress. I know my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, has just proposed \nan amendment to this legislation that would require disclosure of these \nsecret sites.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The oversight responsibilities of Congress have \ntragically been emasculated by this administration, and too many \nMembers of Congress have acquiesced. They have bowed to this \nadministration's wishes or demands that it be able to do whatever it \nwants, wherever it wants, and to whomever it wants. And then, if they \nare caught doing it, they say it is part of the war against terror, or \nthat it is essential to our national security.\n  You don't defeat terror with terror. You don't stop those inhuman \nbeings who would commit atrocities by committing atrocities against \nthem. And you don't make our citizens more secure by taking away other \npeople's brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers to secret gulags and \ntorturing them for months or years. Of those torture victims \nthemselves, if you release them, does anyone suppose that they will not \nbe filled with hatred and revenge towards the United States? After they \nhave been tortured, you keep them secretly locked up forever so they \ncan't torture Americans in return?\n  These are not only hideous, horrible, and inhuman practices, they are \nstupid policies, shortsighted, misguided, and immoral policies which, \nif not illegal, should be, and which, to use the CIA's term, will blow \nback or boomerang against our own citizens in the years ahead.\n  Yes, there should be a congressional investigation into how unelected \npeople with no accountability to the American people or to the \ncivilized world can usurp the powers and responsibilities which are \nthis Congress's by law, and why this Congress has let them get away \nwith it and continues to look the other way while they blacken \nAmerica's great name, debase our good values, and endanger our national \nsecurity with their depravity.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded and that I be allowed to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              veterans day\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, as Veterans Day approaches, we pay homage \nto the soldiers who once stormed the beaches of Normandy, reclaimed the \nmountains of Korea and crossed the sands of Kuwait. We pay homage to \nour veterans' sacrifice and courage, and also to the brave men and \nwomen who now follow their example in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In paying respect, we must also follow through on our Nation's \ncommitment's to ensure our veterans receive the benefits they earned \nand deserve.\n  Arkansas has a long and distinguished record of service, one that my \nState is proud of, and one that we will continue to build upon. In \naddition to honorable service by our active duty soldiers, marines, \nseamen and airmen, the Arkansas National Guard has mobilized more than \n8,000 of its guardsmen since Sept. 11, 2001. In fact, this Veterans Day \nis an especially poignant one for families in Rogers, AR where 180 \nguardsmen have just been deployed to serve in Iraq.\n  Arkansas is not alone in its commitment to military service. Since \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are 393,000 new veterans to \ncare for, including 103,000 who are currently seeking health care from \nVA hospitals.\n  We can never truly repay our veterans for their service to our \nNation, but we can care for them just as they cared for us. In honor of \nthese men and women, Senator Norm Coleman and I have introduced the \nVeterans Benefits Outreach Act to help ensure that all veterans collect \nthe benefits they have earned but for whatever reason are not \nreceiving.\n  Nearly 600,000 veterans nationwide are not receiving the benefits \nthey are entitled to, often due to a simple lack of knowledge that they \nare eligible.\n  Instead of veterans having to cut through bureaucracy to learn about \nand receive the various benefits they earn, our bill seeks to bring \nthis information to them. It requires the VA to prepare a plan to \nidentify veterans who are not enrolled in programs they are eligible \nfor and an action plan to enroll them.\n  This measure represents an opportunity to help our current veterans \nand meet the challenges we foresee instead of waiting until benefit \nproblems escalate for a new generation of veterans. I hope this \nVeterans Day will add the necessary momentum for the full Senate to \nconsider and pass this measure.\n  We owe this to veterans like Chaplain--Colonel--David McLemore--a \nsoldier's soldier who has dedicated a career to providing outreach to \nservice men and women in the field.\n  Chaplain McLemore is a native Arkansan and has served as a chaplain \nin the Arkansas Army National Guard for 21 years. During that time he \nhas served soldiers at the company, battery, battalion, and brigade \nlevel. He has personally answered the call to duty in two wars, \nOperation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom II.\n  In both of these conflicts, Chaplain McLemore served on the front \nlines with combat units, where he ministered to soldiers conducting the \nday-to-day fight with the enemy. Chaplain McLemore always chose to be \nup front providing a ``Ministry of Presence'' to those in the greatest \nplace of danger.\n  Those who served in combat with Chaplain McLemore knew that he would \nalways be there with a listening ear, an open heart, and a guiding \nhand. His mere presence gave courage and inspiration to those who knew \nthat they could lose their lives at any minute.\n  As any chaplain, Chaplain McLemore did not carry a weapon as he faced \nthe perils of combat, but the soldiers he served with knew that he \ncarried more firepower than any of them, the grace and word of God, and \nthey always wanted Chaplain McLemore and that firepower with them.\n  They knew that he risked his life every day for one mission, to serve \nthem. In the simple but strong bond of combat, it was clear that \nChaplain McLemore loved his fellow soldiers and they loved him.\n  Two months after his return from Operation Iraqi Freedom II, Chaplain \nMcLemore was involved in a motorcycle accident where he sustained \nsevere injuries. Today, he fights to recover from those injuries in the \nVeterans Administration Hospital in North Little Rock, AR.\n  As he does, he has the prayers, respect, and encouragement from us \nand all of his fellow soldiers. We honor him today for his commitment \nand selfless service to God, his country, and his fellow soldiers. \nThank you, Chaplain David McLemore. God Bless and Godspeed.\n  We owe all our veterans not only our gratitude, but also our freedoms \nand American way of life. Our military has kept us safe for a long \ntime. We cannot thank them enough, but we can begin to repay their \nsacrifices by providing them with the resources they need in the field \nand the support they have earned when they return home.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12648-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12648-S12651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n              APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I \nfurther ask that there now be 5 minutes of debate, and that following \nthe next vote on the Defense authorization bill the Senate proceed to a \nvote on adoption of the conference report with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n\n[[Page S12649]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I, of \ncourse, will not--in terms of sequence, it is possible there may be two \namendments relating to the first-degree amendments relating to the same \nsubject. If that were true, it may be wiser that this not intervene \nthose two amendments.\n  Have amendments been scheduled for votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No amendments are scheduled at this time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in other words, the Senator from \nMichigan is suggesting this simply be at the end of the next sequence \nand, therefore, not in the middle.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think that may be better.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I so modify my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand I have the floor, but I am \nperfectly willing to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3057), making appropriations for foreign operations, export \n     financing, and related programs for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2006, and for other purposes, having met, have \n     agreed that the House recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the Senate to the text, and agree to the same \n     with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same; that the \n     Senate recede from its amendment to the title of the bill, \n     signed by all of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of November 2, 2005.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment before the \nSenate completes consideration of the fiscal year 2006 foreign \noperations and related programs conference report to thank Chairman \nKolbe and Ranking Member Lowey in the House, and their staffs, and my \nfriend from Vermont and his staff for the hard work and compromise that \nwent into this legislation.\n  Although the bill we send to the President is more than $1.8 billion \nbelow the budget request--and more than $1.1 billion below the Senate \nmark--we did our best to fund our Nation's foreign assistance \npriorities, whether countering terrorism, combating HIV/AIDS, TB and \nmalaria or advancing democracy abroad. I am also pleased we were able \nto provide significant funding for Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel and \nSudan.\n  Given bipartisan support for several accounts, we were able to \nprovide modest increases over last year's enacted levels for the Child \nSurvival and Health Programs Fund, Development Assistance, \nInternational Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, Migration and \nRefugee Assistance, and Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and \nRelated Programs.\n  For HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, we provided a total of $2.8 billion \nfrom all accounts in the bill, an increase of $268 million above the \nbudget request. There is $450 million available for a U.S. contribution \nto the Global Fund. We also include a provision, for the first time in \nthe bill, designating $100 million to combat malaria.\n  Finally, the bill includes a new appropriations account entitled \n``Democracy Fund'' that will help ensure America's activities to \npromote democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law \nabroad are conducted in a more efficient and effective manner.\n  Let me close with a brief word of thanks to my staff--but especially \nto their families. It takes a long time to produce a foreign aid bill, \nand I appreciate the dedication of Tom Hawkins, Harry Christy, Bob \nLester, LaShawnda Smith and Paul Grove to this task. But to their \nfamilies, I offer a special thanks for their understanding and support \nas the midnight oil was burned and weekends were spent at the office.\n  I hope we can move quickly to a vote on the conference report.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support the Foreign Operations Conference \nReport for fiscal year 2006 and urge all Senators to vote its passage.\n  Like every appropriations bill, there are things in this conference \nreport that I disagree with. There are programs which I, as do many \nhere, believe need substantially more funding than we were able to \nprovide. A good example is our migration and refugee programs. This \nconference report provides less than the President requested and far \nless than the Senate bill. The suffering of refugees and displaced \npeople that we are able to relieve but will not because of the scant \nresources in this bill is shameful and inexcusable. We and other \nindustrialized nations could and should do far more to help them.\n  Another problem is HIV/AIDS, although we were able to provide $268 \nmillion more than the President requested. I am disappointed that the \namount of our contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and \nMalaria was $50 million less than in the Senate bill. There are few \nmore compelling needs for those funds than fighting these insidious \ndiseases.\n  I had hoped we would have enough to fully fund the Non-Proliferation, \nAnti-Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs account. It is a mistake \nto cut funding for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty International \nMonitoring System, for which the President did not request sufficient \nfunds. The amount in this conference report represents a cut of $4.498 \nmillion below the fiscal year 2005 level, and is at least $6 million \nless than the amount of the U.S. share for this vitally important \nmonitoring system.\n  The fact is, despite the help we got from Chairman Cochran and \nSenator Byrd with our allocation, for which we are very grateful, this \nconference report does not provide nearly enough resources to respond \nadequately to the multitude of threats we face across the globe. We had \nto make the kind of peevish choices that the world's wealthiest, most \npowerful country should not be making.\n  There are other funding problems in this conference report, but on \nthe whole it strikes the right balance for the bipartisan support it \nneeds, and for that I commend Chairman McConnell, Chairman Kolbe, and \nCongresswoman Lowey. We have worked very cooperatively as is our \npractice, and I think we did about the best we could with an allocation \nthat was almost $2 billion below the President's budget request.\n  I want to mention a few other issues.\n  First, Colombia. I was pleased that the conferees agreed to my \nrequest to provide an additional $6 million for economic and social \nprograms. Despite assurances by the administration that they would \nincrease funding for these programs as the security situation in \nColombia improves, they have done the opposite. Military programs have \nconsistency received a larger share of the budget.\n  I was pleased that the conferees included report language I \nrequested, directing that $500,000 of our military aid for Colombia be \nused to pay incidental costs relating to the treatment at U.S. \nhospitals of seriously injured Colombian soldiers. Due to the tireless \nwork of the nonprofit organization ``United for Colombia,'' these \nhospitals have generously offered to perform this surgery--which \nrequires sophisticated technology and expertise that is unavailable in \nColombia--free of charge. But there are additional expenses such as \ntransportation, lodging and medicines. The conferees also included my \nrecommendation that additional assistance from the Leahy War Victims \nFund be made available for civilians who have been injured by landmines \nand other causes relating to the conflict.\n  The conference report also includes language concerning the \ndemobilization of Foreign Terrorist Organizations in Colombia. We would \nlike to support this process, but it has been flawed from the beginning \nand the ``Peace and Justice'' law has been widely criticized by human \nrights experts in Colombia, the United States, Europe, the United \nNations, and the Organization of American States. There is considerable\n\n[[Page S12650]]\n\nskepticism that the paramilitary leaders will in fact give up narco-\ntrafficking, surrender their illegally acquired land and other assets, \nor be brought to justice. We want to be sure that the law is being \nimplemented in a manner that lives up to its promise of peace and \njustice, that these organizations are dismantled, and that their \nleaders receive the severe punishment they deserve.\n  We provide up to $20 million in fiscal year 2006 for the \ndemobilization. These are mostly funds that were already requested by \nthe Administration for other purposes. We require the Secretary of \nState to first certify that certain conditions have been met and to \nnotify the Congress. This reflects the serious concerns that Members of \nCongress have with the demobilization process. Among those conditions \nis that the Government of Colombia is ``providing full cooperation to \nthe Government of the United States to extradite the leaders and \nmembers of [Foreign Terrorist Organizations] who have been indicted in \nthe United States.''\n  This is very important, and it was included at the insistence of both \nRepublican and Democrat Members. When we say ``full cooperation'' we \nmean nothing less. We want to see these people in handcuffs and on an \nairplane to the United States as soon as possible. We do not want \nanything to happen that would interfere with the extradition of the \nleaders of these narcoterrorist organizations--organized \ncrime syndicates is what they are--for major crimes for which they have \nbeen indicted here.\n\n  These are not ordinary criminals. Some of them make Pablo Escobar \nlook like an amateur. They are responsible for creating and arming \ntheir own death squads, for killing thousands of civilians, for \nshipping billions of dollars worth of cocaine into the United States, \nand they have infiltrated many sectors of Colombian society including, \nwe learned recently, the police intelligence service. We also know they \nhave sway with some members of the Colombian Congress.\n  Impunity has been the norm throughout Colombia's history. Nothing \nwould be worse for the cause of justice, or for democracy in Colombia, \nthan for people who are among the most notorious criminals in this \nhemisphere to escape punishment that is proportional to their crimes. \nIf that happens, you can be sure that their criminal enterprises will \nnot be dismantled, the cocaine will keep flowing across our borders, \nthe Colombian people will continue to be plagued by narcotics related \nviolence and corruption, and peace and justice will remain out of \nreach.\n  Another item in this conference report deals with Indonesia.\n  President Yudhoyono, who was democratically elected, has been \nadvancing reformist policies that we support, including reducing the \narmy's role in the political process. He has also been a reliable ally \nin fighting terrorism in the world's largest Muslim country.\n  The conference report provides assistance to the Indonesian Navy in \nthe amount requested by the Administration, and it also provides IMET \nassistance for Indonesia without restriction. In addition, our largest \ncounterterrorism training program is with Indonesia, and the Defense \nDepartment regularly conducts joint exercises and other activities with \nthe Indonesian military.\n  But one area where there has been no discernable progress is \naccountability for crimes by the army. In 1992 the Indonesian army shot \nto death an estimated 200 unarmed protesters in a cemetery in Dili, \nEast Timor. A few low-ranking soldiers were punished, but in a \nperversity of justice several of the civilians were sent to jail for \nfar longer sentences. Then in 1999, the Indonesian military armed the \nmilitias who laid waste to East Timor after the independence \nreferendum. The U.N. identified the top officers involved and accused \nthem of crimes against humanity, but the army sabotaged the \ngovernment's halfhearted efforts to bring them to justice. Thousands of \ninnocent people died, and no one has been punished.\n  Some have suggested that because these are ``past'' crimes, we should \nlook forward, not backward. What crime isn't a past crime? Does that \nmake it any less important that justice be done? How do you prevent \nfuture atrocities if you let those who order and commit murder get away \nwith it? What is more fundamental to democracy than justice?\n  For many years, the Congress has put conditions on U.S. assistance to \nthe Indonesian army. The conditions in our law require nothing more \nthan that the army respect the law, yet both Secretary Rumsfeld and \nSecretary Rice asked Congress to eliminate the conditions. I understand \nthere are competing concerns and that we and Indonesia have common \nsecurity interests. I would have supported their request if there were \nany sign that the Indonesian army is prepared to be accountable to the \nlaw for any of these heinous crimes. So far, there is not.\n  The conference agreement also requires a report on the status of the \nFBI investigation of the August 2002 murders of two American civilians \nand one Indonesian civilian in Timika, West Papua. Soon after the \nkillings the Indonesian military tried to frame an innocent man. Then, \nwhen the police implicated the military in the attack, the \ninvestigation abruptly ended. Nothing happened for another year or so \nbecause the military actively impeded further efforts to investigate. \nSince then, the military has been more cooperative and one West Papuan \nindividual has been indicted in the U.S. But he has yet to be indicted \nin Indonesia and responsibility for this heinous crime does not stop \nthere. It is now more than three years since this tragedy and no one \nhas been brought to justice.\n  Finally, the conference report requires a report on the humanitarian \nand human rights situation in West Papua.\n  Another item I want to mention is Nepal. We have once again put \nconditions on our military aid because of the King's undemocratic and \nrepressive actions on February 1, and the army's continuing involvement \nin human rights violations. We detest the tactics of the Maoists, who \nforcibly recruit children, who engage in extortion, and brutalize \ncivilians. But the King's actions have only made a political solution \nto the conflict in Nepal more elusive, and at great cost to democracy \nand the rule of law. The conference agreement provides $2.5 million for \na U.S. contribution to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights \nOffice in Nepal, to monitor and report on human rights violations \nthroughout the country.\n  The conference agreement also provides another $10 million for \nUSAID's new Amazon Basin Conservation Strategy. This is a regional \ninitiative that I am personally committed to, and I greatly appreciate \nthe efforts that USAID has made to develop this strategy through an \nextensive process of consultations with governments and nongovernmental \norganizations.\n  The Amazon Basin encompasses nine countries and has global \nenvironmental, health and economic importance that dwarfs any other \nforest or river system in the world. We all have a responsibility to \nprotect it. Brazil and Colombia are examples of countries that already \nhave environmental laws and policies in place and protected areas and \nindigenous reserves. Coordinating with other donors, governments and \ncivil society organizations, we can help build the capacity to \nstrengthen, enforce, implement, and replicate these laws and policies \nthroughout the region.\n  On a related matter, the conference report requires USAID to \nestablish a new position of ``Advisor for Indigenous Peoples Issues.'' \nIndigenous peoples, from the Kalahari Desert in Botswana to the forests \nof Ecuador, are the most vulnerable people on Earth. Their land and \ntraditional ways of life are under siege, and often their own \ngovernments are part of the problem, as was the case in our own country \na century and a half ago. USAID, which works in these countries on \nissues that affect indigenous peoples, needs someone who is \nknowledgeable and has the responsibility to consult with indigenous \npeoples, advocate on their behalf in relation to USAID policies, \nprograms and activities and coordinate with other federal agencies. I \nlook forward to discussing this with USAID.\n  I want to mention a provision in this conference report that deals \nwith reform at the multilateral development banks. There are several \nparts to this provision, but one that deserves special mention concerns \nthe rights of whistleblowers. Too often at these institutions, people \nwho complain about\n\n[[Page S12651]]\n\nwaste, fraud or abuse are harassed, threatened, silenced, or demoted. \nThat is the opposite of what should happen, and it is long overdue for \nwhistleblowers to be given the protection and recourse they deserve. \nThis provision, among other things, calls for independent adjudicatory \nbodies, including ``external arbitration based on consensus selection \nand shared costs''. I believe that access to external arbitration is \nlong overdue, and I urge the World Bank and the other MDBs to act \nexpeditiously to implement this and the other reforms called for in \nthis provision.\n  The conference report provides $1.77 billion for the Millennium \nChallenge Corporation, MCC. While this represents a deep cut from the \nPresident's request, it reflects the tight budgetary constraints we \nfaced. The conference allocation required us to cut nearly $2 billion \nfrom the President's total request and therefore many programs, \nincluding the MCC, were not fully funded.\n  I support the goals of the MCC, and I look forward to working with \nthe new CEO Ambassador Danilovich. We know that foreign aid is most \neffective when governments are committed to fighting corruption and \naddressing the needs of their people, and when public officials, civil \nsociety and the private sector work together to reduce poverty.\n  I am pleased that the conference agreement includes language \nemphasizing the importance of strong participation from indigenous \ncivil society organizations to help ensure that the MCC is responsive \nto local people's concerns. It is through the meaningful participation \nof civil society that democracy is strengthened, good governance is \nvalued, and open discussions of how best to achieve national priorities \nare accomplished. The conference agreement requires the MCC to submit a \nreport that details how contributions of indigenous civil society have \nbeen incorporated in completed compact negotiations.\n  The conference report provides funds above the President's request \nfor both the Inter-American Foundation and the African Development \nFoundation. The Congress strongly supports the work of these \nfoundations which support local initiatives to increase income for \nLatin America's and Africa's poorest people.\n  I was very pleased that the conference report provides additional \nassistance for civilian victims of the military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We provide $5 million for the Marla Ruzicka Iraqi War \nVictims Fund for assistance for Iraqi families and communities, which \nis named for Marla Ruzicka, the founder of Campaign for Civilian \nVictims of Conflict. Ms. Ruzicka died, at the age of 28, along with her \ncolleague Faiz Ali Salim, in a car bombing in Baghdad on April 16, \n2005. We also provide $2 million for assistance for Afghan families and \ncommunities that have suffered losses as a result of the military \noperations. By providing this assistance the United States is seeking \nto alleviate the suffering, as well as the anger and resentment, \nresulting from tragic mistakes that occur in the military operations.\n  I was also pleased that the conference report includes $15 million to \nsupport an initiative I sponsored to combat certain neglected diseases. \nLymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, intestinal parasites, \nschistosomiasis, leprosy, and trachoma cause terrible suffering and \ndisfigurement among hundreds of millions of people in mostly tropical \ncountries. In addition to providing additional funds to prevent and \ntreat these diseases, this initiative seeks to develop a multilateral, \nintegrated approach to coordinate and maximize donor contributions to \ncontrol them. This is important because current efforts are poorly \ncoordinated and underfunded. As with the infectious diseases initiative \nI sponsored nearly a decade ago, I look forward to working with USAID, \nother Federal agencies, the World Health Organization, and the relevant \ninternational technical and nongovernmental organizations to develop \nsuch an approach that has broad support.\n  I was disappointed that the amount provided for the Global \nEnvironmental Facility, $80 million, fell $27 million short of the U.S. \npledge. I want to emphasize that this cut does not reflect any \ndissatisfaction on the part of the conferees with the GEF, which had \ntaken steps to adopt management and transparency reforms advocated by \nthe United States, but instead was due to budgetary constraints. As a \nstrong supporter of the GEF I am hopeful that we can make up this \nshortfall in the fiscal year 2007 budget.\n  The conference report supports the Extractive Industries Transparency \nInitiative, which aims to improve the capacity of developing countries \nto sustainably manage the extraction of natural resources and to \nmonitor revenues generated from such extraction so they are used for \npurposes which benefit their people. This is an anti-corruption, good \ngovernance initiative spearheaded by the British Government, which \nresponds to the longstanding practice in many developing countries of \nexploiting natural resources in a wasteful and environmentally \ndestructive manner that benefits only the elites. The conference \nagreement provides $1 million for USAID to support EITI implementation \nand to strengthen the role and capacity of civil society organizations \nin the EITI process. This is another issue I look forward to discussing \nwith USAID before funds are obligated.\n  Finally, I want to mention the funding in the conference report for \nUSAID Operating Expenses, which was cut by $50 million below the \nadministration's request. Again, this was the result of the budgetary \nconstraints we faced, but it also reflects some concerns with USAID's \nmanagement of appropriated funds. This cut will force USAID to make \ndifficult choices, which should be the subject of consultations with \nthe Appropriations Committees.\n  There are many other provisions in this conference report that I do \nnot have time here to recount. I want to again thank my friend from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell, who has been a pleasure to work with. I \nalso thank our counterparts in the House, Congressman Kolbe and \nCongresswoman Lowey, and their capable staffs. I commend the Senate \nmajority staff, Paul Grove, Tom Hawkins, Harry Christy, Bob Lester and \nLaShawnda Smith. They put in long hours and they held themselves to the \nhighest standards. And for the minority, I thank Tim Rieser, Kate \nEltrich and Jennifer Park.\n\n                               EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to mention one other item in the \nForeign Operations conference report. It does not earmark Foreign \nMilitary Financing funds for Timor-Leste, formerly East Timor, the \nworld's newest democracy and a friend of the United States. However, we \ndo not earmark funding for many of the countries for which FMF was \nrequested, but we provide $241.7 million in FMF assistance to cover \nthese needs, including for Timor-Leste. The administration's budget \nrequest included $1.5 million in FMF for East Timor. The fact that we \ndid not earmark these funds for Timor-Leste should not be \nmisinterpreted as an indication of any disagreement on the part of the \nconferees with the administration's request.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct. We did not earmark FMF for Timor-\nLeste but we intend the administration to provide an amount similar to \nthe request. We also provided $1.5 million in International Narcotics \nand Law Enforcement, INCLE assistance for Timor-Leste, for on the \nground police training, as well as $19 million in Economic Support Fund \nassistance. The cut in ESF from the fiscal year 2005 level of $22 \nmillion was due, in part, to the earmark in INCLE assistance which had \nnot been requested by the administration.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, do I have time under the consent \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, sometime later today when we dispose of a \nfew of the next amendments, Senator Levin, on behalf of leadership and \na group of Senators on our side of the aisle--and we hope others might \njoin in--will be submitting an amendment with respect to the issue of \nIraq. I am pleased to join in that with them. I look forward to \nparticipating in that debate at that time. I have come to the Senate at \nthis moment to introduce an amendment that lays out what, in my \njudgment, represents a comprehensive and new strategy that is essential \nfor the President to implement in order to successfully complete the \nmission in Iraq, as well as to bring our troops home in a reasonable \ntimeframe.\n\n  At a news conference a week ago I referred to this in a speech I gave \nrecently. I left Iraq departing on a C-130 from Mosul, together with \nSenator Warner and Senator Stevens. The three Senators and the staff, \nall of us, were gathered in this cavernous C-130. In the middle of the \ncargo hold was a simple aluminum coffin with a small American flag \ndraped over it. We were bringing another American soldier home to his \nfamily and to his resting place.\n  The starkness of the coffin in the center of that hold, and the \nsilence--except for the din of the engines; believe me, there was a \nkind of silence notwithstanding--was a real-time, cold reminder of the \nconsequences of decisions for which all of us as Senators bear \nresponsibility.\n  As we enter a make-or-break 6-month period in Iraq, that long journey \nof that soldier and 2,000-plus more of them remind us, all of us, about \nour responsibilities with respect to the troops in Iraq. It underscores \nthe need to help this administration take steps that will bring our \ntroops home within a reasonable timeframe from an Iraq that is not \npermanently torn by conflict.\n  Some say we should not ask tough questions because we are at war. I \nsay, no. A time of war, that is precisely when you have to ask the \nhardest questions of all. It is essential, if we want to correct our \ncourse and do what is right for our troops, that instead of repeating \nthe same mistakes over and over again, we ask those questions. No \nmatter what the President says, asking tough questions is not \npessimism. It is patriotism. We have a responsibility to our troops and \nour country and our conscience to be honest about where we should go \nfrom here.\n  There is a way forward that gives us the best chance to both salvage \na difficult situation in Iraq and to save American and Iraqi lives. \nWith so much at stake, we all have a responsibility to follow the best \nway forward.\n  No. 1, we cannot pull out precipitously, as many argue and call for, \nbut also we cannot merely promise to stay as long as it takes. The \npromise simply to stay as long as it takes, in fact, exacerbates the \nsituation. It is not a policy. To undermine the insurgency we must, \ninstead, simultaneously pursue a political settlement that gives Sunnis \na real stake in the future of Iraq, while at the same time reducing the \nsense of American occupation. That means a phased withdrawal of \nAmerican troops as we meet a series of military and political \nbenchmarks, starting, I have said, with a reduction of 20,000 troops \nover the holidays as we meet the first benchmark--the completion of the \nDecember elections.\n  Earlier today, my good friend, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, \nmade a speech in which he mischaracterized my plan to bring our troops \nhome within a reasonable timeframe and to succeed in Iraq. He \nmischaracterized how one arrived at 20,000 troops. The fact is, that is \na benchmark. It is a benchmark set by this administration itself. The \nfact is, most of last year, during which time the administration says \nwe have adequate troops to do the job, we had about 138,000 troops in \nIraq. The fact is, for the purposes of the constitutional referendum \nand for the purposes of the election, the administration upped the \nnumber of troops in order to guarantee security for the purpose of \nthose two events.\n  I have said specifically that when those two events are completed \nsuccessfully, and with the increased numbers of Iraqis trained, there \nis no excuse for not being in a position to go from the current 161,000 \ndown to the 138,000, where we were before, where our generals told us \nwe had enough troops to do the job. That figure is set not by any \narbitrary standard but by the accomplishment of the specific benchmark.\n  It is also critical that we send this signal to the Iraqi people that \nwe do not desire a permanent occupation and that Iraqis themselves must \nfight for Iraq. History shows again and again that guns alone do not \nend an insurgency, and guns alone, particularly, will not end this \ninsurgency. The real struggle in Iraq is not what the President has \ndescribed again and again as the war on terror as we know it against \nal-Qaida. The real struggle in Iraq is Sunni versus Shiite. It is a \nstruggle that has gone on for years with oppressor and oppressed, and \nit will only be settled by a political solution. No political solution \ncan be achieved when the antagonists can rely on indefinite large-scale \npresence of occupying American combat troops.\n  The reality is our military presence in vast and visible numbers has \nbecome part of the problem, not just the solution. Our own generals are \ntelling us this in open hearings of the Senate. Our generals understand \nthis well. GEN George Casey, our top military commander in Iraq, \nrecently told Congress that our large military presence ``feeds the \nnotion of occupation'' and ``extends the amount of time that it will \ntake for Iraqi security forces to become self-reliant,'' and Richard \nNixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, breaking a 30-year silence, \nwrites:\n\n       Our presence is what feeds the insurgency, and our gradual \n     withdrawal would feed the confidence and the ability of \n     average Iraqis to stand up to the insurgency.\n\n  It comes down to this: An open-ended declaration ``to stay as long as \nit takes,'' lets Iraqi factions maneuver for their own political \nadvantage by making us stay as long as they want. It becomes an excuse \nfor billions of American tax dollars to be sent to Iraq and siphoned \noff into the coffers of cronyism and corruption.\n  When I was last in Iraq, at a dinner put on by the Ambassador and \nothers with the Minister of Defense--the Minister of Interior, the \nPrime Minister, and others--we sat and listened while they told us \nthemselves of the corruption that has been taking place in the \ndisbursement of American taxpayer funds.\n  This administration needs to pay attention to that corruption. The \nadministration must also use all of the leverage in America's arsenal--\nour diplomacy, the presence of our troops, our reconstruction money, \nall of the diplomacy--in order to convince the Shiites and the Kurds to \naddress the legitimate Sunni concerns about regional autonomy and oil \nrevenues and to make Sunnis accept the reality that they will no longer \ndominate Iraq. We cannot and we should not do this alone.\n  The administration must immediately call a conference of Iraq's \nneighbors: Britain, Turkey, other key NATO allies, and Russia. The \nabsence of legitimate international effort with respect to this is, \nfrankly, absolutely extraordinary. I am not alone in calling for that. \nRepublicans, colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Senator Hagel, \nothers, have talked about the need for an international leverage in \norder to help resolve this issue. Together we have to implement a \ncollective strategy to bring the parties in Iraq to a sustainable \npolitical compromise that also includes mutual security guarantees \namong Iraqis. To maximize our diplomacy, the President should appoint a \nspecial envoy to bolster Ambassador Khalilzad's commendable efforts.\n  To enlist the support of Iraqi Sunni neighbors, we should commit to a \nnew\n\n[[Page S12653]]\n\nregional security structure. I have heard from countless numbers of \nmembers of government in the region that the old security arrangement \nthat existed prior to the invasion of Iraq has, in fact, been altered \nby that invasion. And today there are great uncertainties with respect \nto the Gulf States--Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and obviously uncertainties \nwith the saber rattling of Iran and the problems with Syria. We ought \nto be committing our efforts to create a new regional security \nstructure that will include improved security assistance programs, \njoint exercises, and provide a greater confidence to the region about \nlong-term strategy.\n  To show Iraqi Sunnis the benefits of participating in the political \nprocess, we should press these countries to set up a reconstruction \nfund specifically for the majority Sunni areas. The absence of specific \neconomic transformation remains the heart of one of the reasons for \npeople to move toward insurgency rather than the governance process. We \nneed to also jump-start our lagging reconstruction efforts by providing \nnecessary civilian personnel to do the job, standing up civil-military \nreconstruction teams throughout the country, streamlining the \ndisbursement of funds to the provinces, expanding job creation \nprograms, and strengthening the capacity of government ministries.\n  Prime Minister Blair, a few weeks ago, suggested that different \ncountries actually adopt a ministry. I know in the Ministry of Finance \nthere are precious few U.S. personnel helping that finance ministry to \nbe able to do the job of administering payrolls and managing the budget \nof the country. It is unbelievable that at a time when our troops are \nmaking such a valiant effort to provide for this transformation we are \nabsent the kind of diplomatic and civilian personnel necessary to make \nthose things happen.\n  On the military side, we must make it clear now that we do not want \npermanent military bases in Iraq. We still have not done that. In the \nabsence of doing that, we lend credence to the notion of occupation and \nof long-term designs on oil, on land, or other designs. Those lend \nthemselves to the recruitment process.\n  The administration must immediately give Congress and the American \npeople a detailed plan for the transfer of military and police \nresponsibilities on a sector-by-sector basis to Iraqis so the majority \nof our combat forces can be withdrawn--ideally as a target by the end \nof next year.\n  Simultaneously, the President needs to put the training of Iraqi \nsecurity forces on a 6-month wartime footing and ensure that the Iraqi \ngovernment has the budget to deploy them. The administration should \naccept the long-standing efforts and offers of Egypt, Jordan, France, \nand Germany to do more training. They should prod the new Iraqi \ngovernment to ask for a multinational force to help protect Iraq's \nborders until a capable national Army is formed. And that force, if \nsanctioned by the United Nations, could attract participation by Iraq's \nneighbors and countries like India, and it would be a critical step in \nstemming the tide of insurgents and money into Iraq, especially from \nSyria.\n\n  Finally, we must alter the deployment of American troops themselves. \nI believe deeply that special operations obviously need to continue. \nThey must continue in order to pursue specific intelligence needs and \nin order to ferret out those jihadist and other hard-core insurgents \nthat we have in Tehran. But the vast majority of our troops could \neasily move to a rear guard, garrison kind of status in order to \nprovide security backup. You do not need to send the young Americans on \nsearch-and-destroy mission that invite alienation and deepen the risks \nthey face.\n  If the President were to do this, then the Iraqis would far more \nrapidly, according to our own generals, begin to assume the \nresponsibilities which we are asking them to and which they need to and \nwhich, in the end, are the only way to be successful.\n  If the President refuses to move in this course, ultimately it is our \nresponsibility, the U.S. Congress, to debate and ultimately help to put \nthis policy in the right direction. If we take these steps, there is, \nfrankly, no reason that within 12 to 15 months we couldn't be able to \ntake on a new role--a role as an ally, not an occupier. And only then \nwill we have provided our troops with what they really deserve, which \nis leadership equal to our soldiers' sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in consultation with the ranking member, \nwe are anxious to move now to further debate on the Kerry amendment. \nFor that purpose, if we could get an estimate of the amount of time \nthat might be required and we could proceed to the second-degree \namendment.\n  Could the Senator advise the managers how quickly we could proceed \nwith the resolution of your amendment, first and second degree to be \noffered by Senators Roberts and Rockefeller, short debate on that, and \nsuch final debate as needed on the underlying amendment, and move to a \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to help the distinguished \nmanager move the process as rapidly as possible. Senator Rockefeller \nhas just pulled me aside. I will spend a few minutes with him now in \nthe cloakroom, and we will try to report back as fast as we can. I hope \nwe can dispose of it. If we were to proceed under a quorum call until \nthen, it would be helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, to help clarify the situation: Is it the \nproposal that there be two amendments voted on?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct, I say to my distinguished \ncolleague. The proposal, eventually is that you will have some sort of \na----\n  Mr. KERRY. My understanding is we are talking about a second-degree \namendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct, but then, as we have with others, if it \nis desired by the three principals here, to do it in a side-by-side \nfashion. There is a parliamentary means to do that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could have a chance to work with \nSenator Rockefeller, we may just have one vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That would be better.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. In that event, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nreserve the time on my amendment, but that we set the amendment aside \nand proceed immediately to the second-degree amendment of Senator \nRoberts and Senator Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2514 To Amendment No. 2507\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to offer a second-degree \namendment, along with the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence, Senator Rockefeller, in regard to reporting language \nfor certain intelligence activities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts], for himself and Mr. \n     Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 2514 to amendment \n     No. 2507.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require a report on alleged clandestine detention \n  facilities for individuals captured in the global war on terrorism)\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. REPORT ON ALLEGED CLANDESTINE DETENTION FACILITIES \n                   FOR INDIVIDUALS CAPTURED IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President shall ensure that the United \n     States Government continues to comply with the authorization, \n     reporting, and notification requirements of title V of the \n     National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 413 et seq.).\n       (b) Director of National Intelligence Report.--\n\n[[Page S12654]]\n\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall provide to the members of the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives a detailed report setting forth the nature \n     and cost of, and otherwise providing a full accounting on, \n     any clandestine prison or detention facility currently or \n     formerly operated by the United States Government, regardless \n     of location, where detainees in the global war on terrorism \n     are or were being held.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     set forth, for each prison or facility, if any, covered by \n     such report, the following:\n       (A) The location and size of such prison or facility.\n       (B) If such prison or facility is no longer being operated \n     by the United States Government, the disposition of such \n     prison or facility.\n       (C) The number of detainees currently held or formerly \n     held, as the case may be, at such prison or facility.\n       (D) Any plans for the ultimate disposition of any detainees \n     currently held at such prison or facility.\n       (E) A description of the interrogation procedures used or \n     formerly used on detainees at such prison or facility.\n       (3) Form of report.--The report required by paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted in classified form.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the Senate did create the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence as a unique means to provide oversight of our \nsensitive activities in regard to intelligence. I agree with Senator \nKerry that more information will improve our ability to conduct the \noversight we need to do on intelligence.\n  Senator Rockefeller and Senator Warner and myself, however, believe \nthis intelligence oversight function should remain focused in the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, as intended by S. Res. 400, the \nlegislation that actually created the Intelligence Committee back in \n1976.\n  I can assure my colleagues that the membership of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee is designed to include significant crossover \nmembership from the various national security committees. For example, \nI am one of the several Armed Services Committee members currently on \nthe Intelligence Committee, including Senator Warner and Senator Levin. \nThat construct was intentionally created by the Senate to address \nsituations just like this.\n  Transparency is important and open government is critical, but in \ncertain circumstances sensitive information must be handled in a proper \nway. That is exactly why we created the Committee on Intelligence. This \namendment strikes the appropriate balance between the Senate's needs \nfor transparency and the need to handle sensitive information \nappropriately.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Certainly.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have no debate or disagreement about what \nthe Senator said. I was wondering whether the chairman and the cochair, \nthe Democratic chair, would object to--maybe this is not the \nappropriate place to do it--a second-degree amendment, or an additional \namendment, whatever form it would take, that would require not the \nintelligence community but the State Department to report to the \nForeign Relations Committee on the status of their judgment as to \nwhether we are in compliance with international treaties--their view on \nthat matter.\n  I don't want to be the skunk at the family picnic. I am not trying to \ncause any difficulty. But it seems to me that such an approach would \nnot in any way fly in the face of the intelligence community reporting \nto the Intelligence Committee. The Senator is right--historically, the \nvarious committees, including the Foreign Relations Committee, have \nbeen represented on the Intelligence Committee. I have no argument with \nthat. I wonder whether any of my friends could respond to that concern \nI have raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Reclaiming my time, let me say to the Senator, he is \nwelcome to the picnic any time he wants to come. I believe we have \nresolved this matter in response to the original amendment regarding \nthis subject. Senator Kerry and Senator Rockefeller and Senator Warner \nand I have crafted a second-degree amendment that will be accepted by \nSenator Kerry. I recognize the unique concern in regard to the Senator \nfrom Delaware. I would hope we could dispense with this first and then \nenter into a discussion as to the merits of the Senator's concern.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: If we dispense with the second-\ndegree amendment, is there any ability to further amend this \nlegislation? This is a substitute or a second degree?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. This is a second-degree amendment, I inform my \ncolleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second degree is drafted as a substitute, \nif it is adopted.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If it is adopted, and I am not saying I will, but will the \nSenator from Delaware have an opportunity to amend the substitute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would simply say that my colleague would have ample \nopportunity to offer an amendment in its own standing, and this \ncarefully crafted compromise should receive priority attention.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we can solve this if we do the following: \nFirst, the amendment of the Senator from Delaware, which is a good \namendment, is outside of the jurisdiction of the Intelligence \nCommittee. It is not something that involves the Intelligence \nCommittee. It is really a separate judgment. My suggestion would be, \nsince we are trying to dispense with this fairly expeditiously, if we \nwere to modify now the amendment simply to say that it is not a \nsubstitute but, rather, only a second degree, immediately upon \ndisposition of that second degree, I could accept the second degree of \nthe Senator from Delaware, at which point we could have a vote on the \nfinal amendment, as amended. Would that be satisfactory?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we would need to examine the second-degree \namendment by the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. Could we have an agreement now that we would modify the \namendment as submitted so that it is a second degree, not a substitute, \nbut simply a second degree?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would defer to the distinguished \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. As I have indicated or as has been indicated by the \ndistinguished chairman, the subject matter before us now pertains to \nthe jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee. The amendment, as I \nunderstand it, of the Senator from Delaware does not. I would rather go \nahead with the agreed-upon method, and then we could take a look at the \namendment and handle that separately.\n  Mr. KERRY. We would simply modify the title ``substitute.'' We are \nnot changing any of the substance of what we have agreed on, nor will \nit change the procedure which we are going to follow. This amendment, \nwith respect to the Intelligence Committee, will be disposed of \nseparately, freestanding now. But if we don't change the title of the \nsubstitute, then the Senator from Delaware is closed out, and we don't \nhave the right to amend it. This is a technicality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe that we are dealing with an \nimportant unknown; that is, the content of what the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware wishes to put on. May I make this suggestion, \nwithout any prejudice to this colloquy and honest effort to resolve it, \nif we were just to lay aside the Kerry amendment, go to another \namendment, and then at such time as there is reconciliation of \nviewpoints, I think we could then perfect his amendment to whatever is \nneeded and proceed.\n  Mr. KERRY. Before we do that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S12655]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The group that is working on the Kerry amendment, with \nthe proposed Roberts-Rockefeller second degree, is working diligently, \nbut it is important that we continue on the bill. At this time, I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts \nbe laid aside and that the Senator from South Carolina be recognized \nfor the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is it my understanding that upon the disposition of the \nnext amendment, this will be the pending business?\n  Mr. WARNER. That can easily be arranged.\n  Mr. KERRY. Can we have that?\n  Mr. WARNER. I so ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will be the order pending further action \nof the body.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2515\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2515 which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Chambliss, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2515.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: Relating to the review of the status of detainees of the \n                       United States Government)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REVIEW OF STATUS OF DETAINEES.\n\n       (a) Submittal of Procedures for Status Review of Detainees \n     at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to the congressional defense committees, and to \n     the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives, a report setting forth the procedures of \n     the Combatant Status Review Tribunals and the noticed \n     Administrative Review Boards in operation at Guantanamo Bay, \n     Cuba, for determining the status of the detainees held at \n     Guantanamo Bay.\n       (b) Procedures.--The procedures submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to subsection (a) shall, with respect to proceedings \n     beginning after the date of the submittal of such procedures \n     under that subsection, ensure that--\n       (1) in making a determination of status of any detainee \n     under such procedures, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or \n     Administrative Review Board may not consider statements \n     derived from persons that, as determined by such Tribunal or \n     Board, by the preponderance of the evidence, were obtained \n     with undue coercion; and\n       (2) the Designated Civilian Official shall be an officer of \n     the United States Government whose appointment to office was \n     made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of \n     the Senate.\n       (c) Report on Modification of Procedures.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall submit to the committees of Congress referred \n     to in subsection (a) a report on any modification of the \n     procedures submitted under subsection (a) not later than 30 \n     days before the date on which such modifications go into \n     effect.\n       (d) Judicial Review of Detention of Enemy Combatants.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 2241 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction \n     to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas \n     corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien outside the United \n     States (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(38) of the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38)) who \n     is detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, \n     Cuba.''.\n       (2) Certain decisions.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), and \n     (D), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction to \n     determine the validity of any decision of a Designated \n     Civilian Official described in subsection (b)(2) that an \n     alien is properly detained as an enemy combatant.\n       (B) Limitation on claims.--The jurisdiction of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n     under this paragraph shall be limited to claims brought by or \n     on behalf of an alien--\n       (i) who is, at the time a request for review by such court \n     is filed, detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba; and\n       (ii) for whom a Combatant Status Review Tribunal has been \n     conducted, pursuant to applicable procedures specified by the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       (C) Scope of review.--The jurisdiction of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on any \n     claims with respect to an alien under this paragraph shall be \n     limited to the consideration of whether the status \n     determination of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal with \n     regard to such alien was consistent with the procedures and \n     standards specified by the Secretary of Defense for Combatant \n     Status Review Tribunals.\n       (D) Termination on release from custody.--The jurisdiction \n     of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit with respect to the claims of an alien under \n     this paragraph shall cease upon the release of such alien \n     from the custody of the Department of Defense.\n       (3) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall apply to any application or other action that is \n     pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. \n     Paragraph (2) shall apply with respect to any claim regarding \n     a decision covered by that paragraph that is pending on or \n     after such date.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will you notify me when I have used 15 \nminutes of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this whole debate we are having now with \nSenator Kerry, what we did with Senator McCain's amendment earlier, and \nwhat I am trying to do, is a healthy debate about where we are going as \na nation, how we prosecute the war on terror, and what kind of value \nset we are going to adopt.\n  One thing we need to understand as a nation and we need to understand \nin the Senate, in my opinion, is that the attack of 9/11 was an act of \nwar. It was not a criminal enterprise. That is an important statement \nto make. Every Senator needs to understand in their own mind: Was 9/11 \nand were those who planned it and those who blew up the people in \nJordan yesterday common criminals or are these people engaged in acts \nof terrorism and war? Let it be said clearly, in my opinion, that the \nUnited States is at war with al-Qaida and associate groups, and we have \nbeen since 9/11.\n  When a country such as the United States is at war, we have a rich \ntradition of following the law of armed conflict, of living up to the \nGeneva Conventions and all other international treaties that regulate \nthe conduct of war. We have a moral imperative as a nation not to lose \nour way in fighting this war. Using tactics of one's enemy is no excuse \nin defeating one's enemy.\n  It is clear to me from Abu Ghraib backward, forward, and other things \nwe know about that at times we have lost our way in fighting this war. \nWhat we are trying to do in a series of amendments is recapture the \nmoral high ground and provide guidance to our troops. That is why \nSenator McCain's amendment, which I cosponsored, is so important, and \nit passed by voice vote.\n  The McCain amendment requires standardization of interrogation \ntechniques when it comes to people in our charge, not as criminal \ndefendants but as enemy combatants, people detained on the battlefield, \nPOWs. It requires the Army Field Manual, not the United States Code, to \nbe changed in a way to give our troops the guidance they need as to \nwhat is in bounds and out of bounds when it comes to interrogating \nprisoners. It is important that we get good information. It is equally \nimportant that we not lose our value set in obtaining that information.\n  Senator McCain has two things in his amendment that we desperately \nneed. It standardizes interrogation techniques for the military, \ndealing with people who are part of this war, our enemies, and it also \nmakes a statement to every other agency in the Government that you are \ngoing to treat people humanely if they are captured under your charge \nas part of fighting this war.\n  Guantanamo Bay is a place we have designated to take people off the \nbattlefield and hold them, and the determinations that go on at \nGuantanamo Bay fall into two categories. Some can be prosecuted for \nviolations of the law of war, not criminal violations in\n\n[[Page S12656]]\n\nterms of domestic criminal law but violations in terms of the law of \nwar. Enemy combatants are being held at Guantanamo Bay like POWs were \nheld in the past. What we have done at Guantanamo Bay is we have set up \na procedure that will allow every suspected enemy combatant to be \nbrought to Guantanamo Bay and given due process in terms of whether \nthey should be classified as an enemy combatant.\n  The Geneva Conventions in article V state that if there is a doubt \nabout one's status, the host country, the person who is in charge of \nthe person, the suspected enemy person, that host country will have a \ncompetent tribunal to determine the status.\n  What is going on at Guantanamo Bay is called the Combat Status Review \nTribunal, which is the Geneva Conventions protections on steroids. It \nis a process of determining who an enemy combatant is that not only \napplies with the Geneva Conventions and then some, it also is being \nmodeled based on the O'Connor opinion in Hamdi, a Supreme Court case, \nwhere she suggested that Army regulation 190-8, sections 1 through 6, \nof 1997, would be the proper guide in detaining people as enemy \nprisoners, enemy combatants. That regulation is ``Enemy Prisoners of \nWar, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees, and other Detainees.'' We \nhave taken her guidance. We have the Army regulation 190-8, and we have \ncreated an enemy combat status review that goes well beyond the Geneva \nConventions requirements to detain someone as an enemy combatant.\n  The McCain amendment says if you are an enemy combatant, we will \ntreat you humanely, even though you may be part of the most inhuman \ngroup the world has ever known. Senator McCain is right. How we treat \ndetainees in our charge once they are captured is about us, but their \nlegal status is about them. Once they choose to become part of a \nterrorist organization in an irregular force that blows up people at a \nwedding, then their legal status is about them and their conduct.\n  I want to make sure we follow the law of armed conflict, that we \ncomply with the spirit of the Geneva Conventions, that we do it right \nbecause we are a country that believes in doing it right. I believe the \nCongress needs to get involved. We have been AWOL.\n  I have enjoyed working with Senator Levin and my Democratic \ncolleagues, Senator Warner, Senator McCain, and others to get the \nCongress involved. Here is what we have done. The Congress is now \nsetting interrogation standards that have long been overdue and \nneglected. The Congress is now setting a humane treatment standard that \nwill serve us well in the international community. The Congress, \nthrough my amendment, is now getting involved in the enemy combatant \ndetention process.\n  People worry about taking folks to Guantanamo Bay and never hearing \nfrom them again. I can assure you they can be heard from. They are \nbeing heard from. They are being inspected in terms of their treatment \nby the International Red Cross. I have been to Guantanamo Bay twice. If \nyou worry about what is going on at Guantanamo Bay, go down there \nyourself. The press has access to Guantanamo Bay. The International Red \nCross has access to Guantanamo Bay. My amendment gets Congress in the \nball game.\n  My amendment requires that Combat Status Review Tribunal regulations \nhave to come to the Senate and the House for our review. Congress now \nis looking over the shoulder of what is going on there.\n  My amendment requires that the person sitting at the top of the \npyramid who makes the decision to release or detain has to be confirmed \nby the Senate so they will be accountable to us.\n  My amendment prohibits the use of undue coerced statements to detain \nsomebody as an enemy combatant.\n  If you are a POW in a war, you are there until the war is over. An \nenemy combatant falls into that same category, and we are going to make \nsure they get due process accorded under international law and then \nsome, and the Congress is going to watch what happens. The Congress is \ngoing to be involved, and we are going to take a stand. We are going to \nhelp straighten out this legal mess we are in.\n  But there is another problem. For those who want to treat people in \nour charge humanely, sign me up. For those who want to get Congress \ninvolved in making sure we have standardized interrogation techniques \nso our own troops won't get into trouble, sign me up. For those who \nwant to give enemy combatants due process in accordance with the Geneva \nConventions, and then some, sign me up. For those who want to turn an \nenemy combatant into a criminal defendant in U.S. court and give that \nperson the same rights as a U.S. citizen to go into Federal court, \ncount me out. Never in the history of the law of armed conflict has an \nenemy combatant, irregular combatant, or POW been given access to \ncivilian court systems to question military authority and control, \nexcept here.\n  What has happened at Guantanamo Bay that we need to fix? I know what \nwe need to fix in terms of the way we have treated prisoners. We are \ndoing it. We are getting it right. We are making up for our past sins. \nMy request to this body is, let's not go too far and create problems \nthat will come back to haunt us. We are at war; we are not fighting the \nMafia. We are fighting an enemy desirous of taking us down as a nation.\n  The Supreme Court decided that the Guantanamo Bay activity was part \nof the United States, not in its territory so much as under its \ncontrol. The Supreme Court has been shouting to us in Congress: Get \ninvolved.\n  Habeas corpus rights have been given to Guantanamo Bay detainees \nbecause the location is under control of the United States, and \nCongress has been silent on how to treat these people. The Supreme \nCourt has looked at section 2241, the habeas statute, and they are \nsaying to us: Since you haven't spoken, we are going to confer habeas \nrights until you act.\n  Justice O'Connor said that we will under habeas give due process to \nenemy combatants, but if you were smart, you would have a process like \nArmy regulation 190-8, and that would be more than enough. Well, we are \nsmart.\n  Here is what has happened. If you want to give a Guantanamo Bay \ndetainee habeas corpus rights as a U.S. citizen, not only have you \nchanged the law of armed conflict like no one else in the history of \nthe world, I think you are undermining our national security because \nthe habeas petitions are flowing out of that place like crazy. There \nare 500-some people down there, and there are 160 habeas corpus \npetitions in Federal courts throughout the United States. Three hundred \nof them have lawyers in Federal court and more to follow. We cannot run \nthe place.\n  They are not entitled to this status. They are not criminal \ndefendants. And here is what they are doing in our courtrooms:\n  A Canadian detainee who threw a grenade that killed an army medic in \na firefight and who came from a family of longstanding al-Qaida ties \nmoved for preliminary injunction forbidding interrogation of him or \nengaging in cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of him. It was a \nmotion to a Federal judge to regulate his interrogation in military \nprison.\n  Another example. A Kuwaiti detainee sought a court order that would \nprovide dictionaries in contradiction of Gitmo's force protection \npolicy and that their counsel be given high-speed Internet access at \ntheir lodging on the base and be allowed to use classified DOD \ntelecommunications facilities, all on the theory that otherwise their \nright to counsel is unduly burdened.\n  This is one of my favorites. There was a motion by a high-level al-\nQaida detainee complaining about base security procedures, speed of \nmail delivery, and he is seeking an order that he be transferred to the \nleast onerous conditions at Gitmo and asking the court to order that \nGitmo allow him to keep any books and reading materials sent to him and \nto report to the court on his opportunities for exercise, \ncommunication, recreation, and worship.\n  Can you imagine Nazi prisoners suing us about their reading material?\n  Two medical malpractice claims have come out of this.\n  Here is another great one. There was an emergency motion seeking a \ncourt order requiring Gitmo to set aside its normal security policies \nand show detainees DVDs that are purported to be family videos.\n  Where does this stop? It is never going to stop.\n\n[[Page S12657]]\n\n  Let me tell you what it is doing. Here is a quote from one of the \nlawyers representing these detainees in Federal court:\n\n       We have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small \n     firms working to represent these detainees. Every time an \n     attorney goes down there, it makes it that much harder for \n     the U.S. military to do what they're doing. You can't run an \n     interrogation . . . with attorneys. What are they going to do \n     now that we're getting court orders to get more lawyers down \n     there?\n\n  Know what. The people at Gitmo are asking that same question: What \nare we going to do? It is impossible to interrogate people with this \nmuch court intervention. We are undermining the role Gitmo plays in \nhelping our own national security. No POW enemy combatant in the \nhistory of the world has been given Federal court unlimited access as \nan American citizen.\n  Here is what I propose we do: that we take the procedures that are in \nplace far beyond what the Geneva Conventions require, that we make the \nreforms my amendment suggests where Congress is now involved in \noversight, and we do one other thing, we allow a detainee to go to \nFederal court, not anywhere and everywhere, but to one place, the \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia where they can \nchallenge what the military has done to them in terms of their status.\n  That is a right beyond what any enemy combatant POW has ever had in \nhistory. That will make sure two things happen: My amendment will make \nsure Congress will supervise what goes on and will be notified about \nwhat happens at Gitmo. They will be able to hold people off the \nbattlefield as enemy combatants; they will have a process recognized by \nthe Geneva Conventions and then some; and they will also have a right \nto go to Federal court to challenge their status to make sure we did it \nright.\n  If we will do these things together, then we can be proud as a \nnation. They all need to be done together. We need to make sure \nstandardized interrogation techniques exist for the benefit of our own \ntroops in the Army Field Manual to create clarity out of chaos. We need \nto make a statement as a nation that no matter who you are or where you \nare, if you are in our charge, you are going to be treated humanely.\n  Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, is somewhere in our care. He \nis not a criminal defendant. He is a warrior, the planner of 9/11. It \nis not a decision we should have to make to try him or let him go. We \nkeep him off the battlefield as we have kept every other POW and enemy \ncombatant off the battlefield. We get good intelligence from him and we \ntreat him humanely. Let us not turn this war into a crime. It would be \na crime to do so.\n  I think I have presented what I believe to be as balanced an approach \nas I know how without giving up our right to defend ourselves. To the \nhuman rights activists out there, God bless you. You have helped us in \nmany ways. We are going to make the statements you want us to make \nabout treating people humanely. We are going to have standardized \ninterrogation techniques. Congress is going to provide oversight and we \nare going to let the courts provide oversight. But in the name of human \nrights, we are not going to let this jail run amok. We are not going to \ncreate a status in international military law that has never been \ngranted before. Of all the people in the world who should enjoy the \nrights of an American citizen in Federal court, the people at \nGuantanamo Bay are the last we should confer that status on. We did not \ndo it for the Nazis. We should not do it for these people.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan. I \nrise to speak in opposition to this amendment as currently drafted. \nAfter the Senate deals with this amendment, I will offer a second-\ndegree amendment to remove the problematic language that I believe is \nincluded. First, I commend Senator Graham for taking on the issue of \ntreatment of these prisoners in Guantanamo. He did work with Senator \nLevin, myself, and others, I am sure, to try to improve the procedures \nfor processing prisoners at Guantanamo. We agreed upon some language. \nWe included that language. He proposed it and it was included in the \nDefense appropriations bill. That was agreed to. Unfortunately, here he \nhas taken that language and he has modified it. He has added to it. His \nadditions are a terrible mistake.\n  His amendment now also contains a provision that strips aliens at \nGuantanamo of any right to seek habeas corpus in our Federal courts. \nThe right to file a petition challenging the legality of a prisoner's \ndetention was specifically recognized by our Supreme Court in the Rasul \ncase. Considering that many prisoners have been held there for over 3 \nyears, that the administration has argued they can be held there \nindefinitely, it would be a major mistake for us to remove the very \nlimited judicial review the Supreme Court has recognized that these \nprisoners still have.\n  The writ of habeas corpus, which is what his amendment would \neliminate, which is in essence a right to petition the court to review \nthe legality of one's detention by the Government, is at the core of \ncivil rights in this country. It came originally from the Magna Carta. \nOur Founding Fathers wrote this into our own Constitution. In the first \narticle of the Constitution, in Section 9, it says:\n\n       The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion and Invasion the \n     public Safety may require it.\n\n  Our Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that the Government could not \nsimply imprison people at will and that there was judicial review that \nwould be available as a check on that executive power.\n  When the executive branch detains or imprisons a person within the \njurisdiction of the United States--and that is all we are talking about \nhere, detaining someone within the jurisdiction of the United States--\nthe Government, upon the issuance of a writ by a court, must show cause \nwhy that person is being detained. This right is enshrined in our own \nConstitution. It would be a terrible mistake for us to suspend that \nright as an amendment on a Thursday afternoon to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  This is an extremely serious issue. There have been no hearings on \nthis issue in the Judiciary Committee. I see the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee on the Senate floor this afternoon. If we are going \nto seriously consider suspending the privilege of habeas corpus, of \nfiling a petition for habeas corpus, the Judiciary Committee should be \nthe committee that considers that type of a proposal and has hearings \non it.\n  There have been no hearings in the Armed Services Committee. It would \nbe a terrible mistake for us to do this sort of as a by-the-way kind of \namendment on a Thursday afternoon as we are preparing to leave for the \nweekend.\n  Through our history, Congress has suspended the ``great writ,'' as it \nhas been called in Anglo jurisprudence for centuries now, only on very \nfew occasions. Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ during the Civil War \nin order to imprison suspected southern supporters. During the Second \nWorld War, President Roosevelt unilaterally suspended the writ in order \nto imprison more than 70,000 Japanese Americans in prison camps. This \nCongress has since gone on record indicating its regret at that action \ntaken by this Government.\n  Today, the executive branch has once again asserted extraordinary \npowers. The President has argued that he has the authority to \nindefinitely imprison anyone, whether a citizen or noncitizen, that he \ndeems to be an enemy combatant, and the judicial review of such \ndecisions is not needed or appropriate.\n  It is in times such as these that our Founding Fathers envisioned \nthat habeas corpus would be preserved. According to the Wall Street \nJournal article earlier this year, an estimated 70 percent of \nindividuals held at Guantanamo were wrongfully imprisoned. BG Jay Hood \nwas quoted as saying in that article: Sometimes we just did not get the \nright folks.\n  This is not the time Congress should suspend the writ and grant the \nexecutive branch additional unchecked authority.\n  The administration has gone to great lengths to avoid the legal \nrestraints\n\n[[Page S12658]]\n\nthat normally would apply under our legal system. They have argued that \nthe laws of war are not applicable because we are fighting a new type \nof enemy. They have argued the criminal laws are not applicable because \nwe are fighting a war. The administration position is that there is a \nrights-free zone where the President has complete authority to detain \nand hold individuals indefinitely.\n  Within this framework, the administration argues that the prohibition \non torture is an unnecessary barrier. They argue that the Geneva \nConventions are outdated, that constitutional rights do not exist for \nthis group of individuals. In essence, they argue that the rights of \nthese prisoners, if any, are at the discretion of the President.\n  According to press reports, in deciding where they wanted to hold \nsuspected terrorists, the administration has gone to enormous lengths \nto avoid putting them some place where they would be under the \njurisdiction of our courts. They considered Soviet-era detention \ncenters in Eastern Europe, secret facilities in Thailand, Egypt, \nJordan, and Zambia. They finally settled on putting them at Guantanamo \nin Cuba because, as the Secretary of Defense said, it was the least \nworst place. It also had the advantage, they thought, of giving them a \nplausible argument that they were outside the reach of the U.S. courts \non the theory that since this was Cuban territory, if these prisoners \nhad objections or problems they could always seek redress from the \nCuban Government. That was the argument our own Department of Justice \nmade in our courts.\n  Of course, the Supreme Court disagreed in the Rasul case and held \nthat Guantanamo prisoners do have the right to challenge the basis of \ntheir detention in U.S. Federal court.\n  As I understand it, the number of prisoners facing trial today is \nabout 10. That is 10 out of the 500 prisoners who are being held there. \nThe rest are being held without charges. There is no prospect for them \nbeing charged in the near future that I am aware of.\n  The President and the administration in this country have a \ncredibility problem with regard to our detention policies. The \nadministration says one thing regarding its position on torture. We \nappear to do something different. We all watched as the President \ntoured Latin America last week and reassured our allies at every stop \nthat, in fact, it is not the policy of our Government to engage in \ntorture. We are on the defensive on an issue that should not be an \nissue in this country.\n  We can effectively combat terrorism without resorting to these types \nof techniques, and we can do so in a manner consistent with American \nvalues. Our Nation's longstanding commitment to the respect of law, to \nthe rule of law, and basic human rights is founded on a set of values \nthat distinguishes us from terrorists and it is important that we keep \nthose principles and those values intact as we pursue this war on \nterrorism.\n  This is not the time to back away from the basic principles this \ncountry was founded on. Considering the ambiguity that exists with \nregard to the legal status of so-called enemy combatants and the \nrevelations that have come out regarding secret prisoners, irregular \nrendition, torture and abuse, I believe it would be a tragic mistake to \nfurther limit the ability of our courts to provide the minimal judicial \nreview that has been afforded thus far. The world has come to doubt our \nGovernment's commitment to the rule of law as a result of many of the \nactions I have recounted. Let us not provide an additional basis for \nthose doubts by stripping our Federal courts of the right to consider \npetitions for habeas corpus.\n  I urge that this amendment be defeated. If appropriate, after \nconsideration of this amendment, I have an alternative amendment which \nwould enact the first three sections of Senator Graham's amendment as \nwe passed them on the appropriations bill but would delete the portion \nthat strips the Federal courts of jurisdiction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nyielding me 10 minutes.\n  The issues presented by the Graham amendment are very important, and \nI commend Senator Graham for taking the initiative in offering this \namendment. This is an issue which this Senator has been wrestling with \nfor some time.\n  Shortly after 9/11, on February 13, Senator Durbin and I introduced \nlegislation which would have dealt with the military commission \nprocedures. This is pursuant to the provisions of article I, section 8, \nclauses 10 and 11 of the Constitution, which confers upon the Congress \nthe power ``To define and punish . . . Offenses against the Law of \nNations; . . . make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.''\n  Early this year, after becoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nin collaboration with the distinguished ranking member, Senator Leahy, \nwe took up this issue.\n  We held a hearing on June 15 this year, which I had sought \ncontinually in 2002, 2003, and 2004. I believe this was the first \nhearing to deal with these issues. In line with that effort, I traveled \nto Guantanamo Bay in mid-August. I had the expectation of having a \nhearing and making progress to really come to grips with the complex \nissues which are involved here.\n  These issues are very difficult. When you talk about detainees and \ntheir status as an enemy combatant, you first wrestle with the problem \nof what evidence is there. It is very hard to quantify any of the \nevidence. You talk about competent evidence, which we are familiar with \nin a courtroom--here there is none. Hearsay is permitted, but it is \nimpossible to put your hands on what the hearsay is. There are some \nsuggestions that on the battlefield somebody who is known and trusted \nto our forces would just identify: You, you, and you are enemy \ncombatants; and it would stick. These detainees are then held for the \nduration.\n  There is no doubt that these detainees are the worst of the worst. \nThat is the way they have been characterized. We are facing very \ndifficult problems with these terrorists. Some of them have been \nreleased, and they have gone back to Afghanistan or gone back to Iraq, \nso we are fighting them all over again. It is a very difficult problem.\n  Finally, the Supreme Court of the United States came down with three \ndecisions in June of 2004, which were a patchwork, really a crazy \nquilt, of decisions. Now you have the Supreme Court of the United \nStates again undertaking jurisdiction in the Hamdan case, which \nchallenges the Presidential authority to set up the commissions. It \ndoes so on the ground that the Geneva Convention says that there must \nbe a tribunal who makes the determination of enemy combatant status.\n  The question raised in the circuit court--this opinion got a lot of \nnotoriety because Chief Justice Roberts, then Judge Roberts of the \ncircuit court, was on the panel--dealt with the issue as to whether \nthere had to be a tribunal. That is what the district court said. The \ncircuit court overruled the district court's ruling that the President \nwas not a tribunal. Although it is hard to fashion the President as a \ntribunal, I do realize that the President has to act to protect the \ncountry.\n  These are the kind of weighty problems which we have not sorted \nthrough, quite frankly. I have discussed this matter with the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. He is on the Judiciary Committee and participated \nin the hearing which we held. He took a good bit of what we had found \nand worked with it in the Armed Services Committee. That is the way it \nshould be. But when you undertake to remove habeas corpus, you better \nknow where you are, and you better have a comprehensive plan and a \ncomprehensive way of dealing with the issue which deals with evidence \nand which deals with the right of counsel.\n  Detainees do not have the right to counsel. I can understand why the \nDepartment of Defense does not want to give detainees the right of \ncounsel. But we have not come up with an answer as to how the detainees \nought to be handled. The detainees are reviewed only once a year. We \nhave submitted draft legislation to the Department of Defense, as we \nworked on this issue in\n\n[[Page S12659]]\n\nJune, July, August, and through the fall. A number of the suggestions \nwhich we made were incorporated by the Department of Defense. I think \nthey have been moving in the right direction. They have changed the \ncommission so that the presiding judge is no longer a fact finder or \njuror, but functions more like a judge. Changes in the Classified \nInformation Act have occurred.\n  But until we can sort through these issues and find a comprehensive \napproach which deals with them--and we should be doing that--the \nJudiciary Committee will still be wrestling with these problems. But it \nis well known that we have been busy since we took up this issue with a \nJune 15 hearing. In July we had the nomination of Roberts, and we had \nthe nomination of Miers, and now we have the nomination of Alito. We \nhave had so many matters: class actions, bankruptcy and asbestos and \njudicial nominations, that we have not been able to come to grips with \nall of the issues.\n  Candidly, it is very hard to deal with the Department of Defense on \nthese matters. When we were in Guantanamo on August 1, we took up an \nissue that the New York Times had publicized, on August 1, where three \nofficers had said that the trials were rigged by the military. We \nsought information from the Department of Defense on an inspector \ngeneral's report and on an internal investigation. There was delay \nafter delay after delay, as we tried to find out what was going on. It \nwas very difficult. This is sort of a pattern, where the Department of \nDefense wants to do it their way and is very resistant to congressional \ninquiries and to congressional oversight.\n  While it is a collateral matter, it bears on some of the work by the \nJudiciary Committee on Able Danger. There we have, notwithstanding \ncommitments by the Department of Defense, not been able to get \nimportant information.\n  I see the Presiding Officer edging forward. Is my time about to \nexpire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. But I am not prepared, at this stage, \nto support legislation which calls for removal of habeas corpus. The \nissues on detainees and military commissions have been pending since 9/\n11 of 2001. Until the Judiciary Committee held a hearing in June 15 of \n2005, nothing had been done by Congress. The Supreme Court finally took \nthe bull by the horns and came down with the three decisions in June of \n2004 because the Congress had not acted. It didn't know what to do. It \ndidn't know quite how to approach it. And perhaps it was too hot to \nhandle. But the Congress frequently is inactive in the face of \nassertions by the executive of the need to defer to Presidential power. \nBut I believe that the habeas corpus provisions which are now in effect \nneed to be maintained.\n\n  While the three decisions by the Supreme Court in June of 2004 did \nnot answer the problem, they did get us started. Their movement in the \nHamdan case is again significant. My own thinking, as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, is to try to find answers to these complex issues.\n  When the Senator from South Carolina decries the numerous habeas \ncorpus appeals, I know what that means. I was a district attorney of a \nbig city, 30,000 cases a year, with a lot of convictions and a lot of \nhabeas corpus matters. The Federal Government can handle the habeas \ncorpus provision. But I read in the revised statute that there are \ngoing to be appeals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield those 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When I read in the bill of the Senator from South \nCarolina about appeals to the court of appeals of the District of \nColumbia from detainee status, that opens up a brand new Pandora's box. \nYou have existing procedures under habeas corpus which we currently \nunderstand, but if you provide for a new jurisdiction for the circuit \ncourt of appeals for detainees' appeals than that could make it worse.\n  I think this probably requires a lot more analysis. We have an able \nSenator from South Carolina who sits on both Judiciary and Armed \nServices. We are going to continue to work on it, but I do not think \nthis amendment is the answer.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding me the time and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield 6 minutes to my colleague from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let's go back to the fundamentals of what \nactually happened and what the amendment of the Senator from South \nCarolina would actually do. The Congress did not create laws to deal \nwith terrorists, primary to the beginning of the war on terrorism. \nQuestions arose as to the executive branch's treatment of these \nterrorists in detention. Absent congressional direction, the U.S. \nSupreme Court had to interpret an existing statute, section 2241. It \nheld that, since Congress had not expressed any intention outside of \nsection 2241 in interpreting that section, the courts had jurisdiction \nto consider habeas corpus petitions regarding the status of these \ndetainees. That is all that the Court has held.\n  As Justice Scalia said in his dissent, ``the petitioners do not argue \nthat the Constitution independently requires jurisdiction here.'' So \nlet's be plain, that the Great Writ does not apply to terrorists. No \none argued in the Rasul case that the Constitution required habeas \ncorpus petitions. It was, rather, a matter of statutory interpretation. \nAs the Justice said:\n\n       Accordingly, the case turns on the words of section 2241.\n\n  How did the Court in the majority opinion treat that?\n\n       Considering that section 2241 draws no distinction between \n     Americans and aliens held in Federal custody, there is little \n     reason to think that Congress intended it not to apply . . .\n\n  The bottom line is that the Congress has, on numerous occasions, \nstatutorily limited the writ of habeas corpus to American citizens. In \n1996, when the courts were plugged up with habeas petitions, Congress \npassed a substantial revision of the habeas corpus laws, reducing this \nbacklog of habeas petitions in Federal court from U.S. citizens. We \nhave the statutory jurisdiction to write whatever kinds of laws we \nwant. We clearly have the statutory jurisdiction to say it does not \napply to foreign terrorists. And nothing in the Rasul case says \notherwise.\n  So let's be very clear about this Great Writ. It does not apply to \nterrorists, and it should not apply to terrorists, and nothing in this \namendment goes any further than to say it applies to U.S. citizens. It \ndoes not apply to terrorists.\n  Another argument is that we should not suspend the writ of habeas \ncorpus. We are not suspending the writ of habeas corpus. It does not \napply. The only reason the Court in Rasul said the Court had \njurisdiction to consider it is because the language in 2241 was not \nexplicit enough to exclude the aliens, the terrorists who were detained \nat Guantanamo Bay from asserting that jurisdiction.\n  Third, our chairman, Senator Specter, has said we need a \ncomprehensive way to deal with the prisoner claims. And he is \nabsolutely correct about that. And this amendment provides such a \nmechanism.\n  What Senator Specter says is: I'm not sure that we should be granting \na circuit court of appeals review right.\n  That's a pretty good right, I would say. That's what this amendment \ndoes. Either we are arguing we are not giving these detainees enough \nrights or we are giving them too many rights, but let's get one or the \nother here. I think what we are doing is granting a substantial right \nto appeal the issue of status when, first of all, it is determined by \nthe CSRT procedures in the military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay and \nthen there is an automatic right to appeal this, not just to a Federal \ncourt but to the U.S. court of appeals, on the record. That is a \nsubstantial right.\n  But what we have gotten rid of are these hundreds of habeas petitions \nthat will be clogging the Federal courts. We have already seen them \nmaking medical malpractice claims against the doctors, saying they want \none kind of food as opposed to another kind of food and so on. It is \ngoing to get like it did\n\n[[Page S12660]]\n\nwith prisoners. One of the real-life cases that came out of Arizona \nthat we tried to take care of in 1996 law is a prisoner said: I want \nchunky peanut butter, I don't want creamy peanut butter. And that was \nthe habeas petition. You have a right to question food in a habeas \npetition. Do we want our Federal courts clogged with terrorists making \nthese kind of petitions? No.\n  As a result, what Senator Graham has done here is very sensible, to \nsay there is going to be a military tribunal to determine status. By \nthe way, it is reviewed every single year. When that status is first \ndetermined, there is an automatic right to appeal to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. But the writ of habeas corpus, \nwhich has never been intended to apply to prisoners of war, much less \nterrorists, does not apply in this case.\n  We are not going to clog up the courts with habeas corpus petitions. \nYou can have an automatic right to the circuit court of appeals.\n  It gets us back to the point that Senator Graham made in the \nbeginning. Let us recognize that we are not dealing with criminal \ndefendants. We are dealing with people who have committed acts of war \nagainst the United States. They certainly should not be accorded \ngreater privileges than U.S. citizens or prisoners of war.\n  A final point: There has been a suggestion by some that this would \nsomehow undercut the McCain antitorture amendments. I think Senator \nGraham laid that to rest. But make it crystal clear. Under McCain, \nthere is not private right of action. They are enforced by the \nconstitutional requirement that the President take care that the laws \nbe executed. The Graham amendment does not take away the right of \naction to enforce McCain because there is no right of action to enforce \nMcCain in the McCain amendments.\n  This is a very good amendment. It gets us back to the basics of what \nkind of folks these terrorists are. It grants them substantial rights \nto contest their status but not the right to clog up Federal courts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am always concerned that when they speak \nof terrorism we are constantly adding new things to our laws to show \nhow we are opposed to terrorists. Maybe it would be easier to just to \npass a resolution 100 to 0 saying we are all opposed to terrorists. Of \ncourse, we are.\n  I also remember when it was written and attributed to Benjamin \nFranklin at a time when he and other Founders of this great Nation \nfaced the hangman's noose. Had they failed in their efforts to create a \ndemocracy instead of trade, their liberties for security deserve \nneither.\n  We should go very slowly when we want to make changes on the great \nrift.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee is absolutely \nright. We should oppose this amendment.\n  We made a major change in the habeas corpus laws a few years ago when \nwe were looking at that to see how that works.\n  This is not the time nor the place nor the bill to willy-nilly--that \nis really what it is--make this change in the habeas corpus law. There \nare just too many things going on--whether it is the reports in the \npress about us using secret prisons that had been abandoned by the old \nSoviet Union following criticism of every President, Republican or \nDemocrat, in my lifetime, that we are now using that, to questions that \nare raised and appropriately raised about Guantanamo.\n  I have heard it said here that the Red Cross has available to them \nall prisoners, that the press has available to them all prisoners--we \nhave found that isn't so--and prisoners are spirited out in the middle \nof the night to these secret prisons.\n  Let us stand as a country that believes in the rule of law.\n  I hope we stand with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania in opposing \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator from South Carolina would \ndefer to the managers, I would like to address the Senate in connection \nwith a unanimous consent request. My understanding is that it has been \ncleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it now be in order for Senator Graham to \noffer a perfecting second-degree amendment. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that at 4:30 the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \nGraham second-degree amendment; further, that following that vote \nSenator Bingaman be recognized and it be in order for him to offer a \nmotion to strike; further, that the Senate proceed immediately to a \nvote on the motion to strike.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that if the motion to strike is \nagreed to, it be in order for Senator Graham to offer a further \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question for \nclarification. I anticipated offering a second-degree amendment, for \nwhich I understood I would be entitled to 30 minutes equally divided. I \nwant to make sure I have a right to argue that amendment and have my 30 \nminutes of debate on my second-degree amendment before we wind up \nagreeing to a 4:30 vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would the Senator be willing to amend this \nby saying that the time remaining between now and 4:30 be equally \ndivided between himself and Senator Graham? Would that serve your \npurpose?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That will be an acceptable result.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have not \nseen the perfecting amendment of the Senator from South Carolina. I \nhave not seen the perfecting language. Reserving the right to object, \nwhat is the purpose of that, if I may inquire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. There are no objections that I know of, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There will be 20 minutes divided on each side. Who yields time? The \nSenator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I defer to my colleague from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak very briefly. I wanted to \nclarify a couple of points. The Senator from South Carolina has \nindicated that instead of people having a right to challenge the \nlegality of their detention through a writ of habeas corpus, we are \ngoing to give them the right to challenge the legality of their \ndetention in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That is \nnot what his amendment says. His amendment says the Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Colombia shall have a limited scope of review. The \njurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \non any claims with respect to an alien under this paragraph shall be \nlimited to consideration of whether the determination of the combatant \nstatus review tribunal regarding such alien was consistent with such \nprocedures and standards as specified by the Secretary of Defense.\n  The very limited scope of review that he would provide to the court \nof appeals would just say you can look to see whether they, in fact, \nfollowed their own procedures--the procedures set out by the Secretary \nof Defense--not whether the status, or whether the detention of that \nindividual is legal. That is the question that the writ of habeas \ncorpus gets to--a question of whether, in fact, a person is being \nlegally held by the government.\n  To say that we are going to give the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia authority to look at whether the Department of \nDefense followed their own procedures does not, in fact, solve that \nproblem.\n  I think that is clearly a clarification that needs to be understood \nby everyone.\n  The other point that I would make is it does not matter, frankly, \nwhat people put in these petitions. I heard my colleagues--both the \nSenator from South Carolina and then the Senator from Arizona--say we \nhave these outrageous requests being made that they didn't like the \npeanut butter, they don't like the television they are having to watch. \nIt doesn't make any difference what they put in these petitions. The \nwrit of habeas corpus which\n\n[[Page S12661]]\n\nthe Senator from South Carolina would have us eliminate as to these \nindividuals is a procedure which says the court can determine whether \nyou are legally being held, not whether you are given the right peanut \nbutter, not whether you are being allowed to see the right DVDs, and \nthere is no obligation of the court to grant any of these petitions. \nThere is no obligation of the court to hold hearings on any of these \npetitions.\n  All we are saying is if a court receives a petition from an \nindividual who is being held prisoner and determines that there is a \nproblem or a potential problem, that court does have authority to go \nahead and issue an order which is a writ saying bring that individual \nhere and justify the imprisonment of this individual.\n  This is the bedrock of our constitutional system. This is the bedrock \nof our legal system which goes back long before the Founders even wrote \nthe Constitution. It would be a very tragic mistake for us, on a \nThursday afternoon, in an amendment to the Defense authorization bill, \nto dispense with this for this or any group of individuals.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist the amendment, as I did before. If the \namendment is defeated, the second-degree amendment which I would offer \ncontains the first three sections of the amendment that the Senator \nfrom South Carolina has offered. That is the portion of the amendment \nwhich we agreed to for the Defense appropriations bill and that is the \npart which is appropriate for us to enact again as part of this bill, \nif the Senate desires to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator from South \nCarolina if he would object to a unanimous consent that we allow \nSenator Rockefeller and Senator Roberts to take 5 minutes to introduce \na modification, and then to stack the votes and have the vote on that \namendment prior to his on the unanimous consent order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is \nessential that the amount of time between now and 4:30 be used on the \ndebate on the Graham amendment. That would detract, I am afraid, from \nthat amount of time.\n  Mr. KERRY. It would be difficult. I think it would take 5 minutes to \nhandle what we have to do.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would ask unanimous consent--and I ask everyone to pay \nattention to this--that any time taken to comply with that request be \nadded on at 4:30 so that the vote would be at 4:35 or 4:40, depending \nupon whether this insert would take 5 or 10 minutes to that \nmodification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Presiding Officer's question, Is there objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To the unanimous consent for 5 minutes, or \nsuch time as may be consumed.\n  Mr. KERRY. The order would be that Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nRoberts would introduce the modification on his amendment, at which \npoint the debate would conclude with respect to the Kerry amendment. We \nwould vote on the Kerry amendment prior to the Graham amendment, and \nthen subsequently his unanimous consent request, as propounded, already \nwould stand.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have to at this time object.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum so we can hopefully resolve this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I appreciate the patience of all of our \ncolleagues, wherever they may be. We are continuing to make \nconsiderable progress. That progress will hopefully lead to final \npassage tonight.\n  Consistent with those objectives, I ask unanimous consent that the \nRoberts amendment now be modified with the changes that are at the \ndesk; provided further that the amendment be agreed to. I further ask \nconsent that no later than the hour of 4:45, the Senate proceed to \nvotes in relation to the following amendments: the Kerry amendment, as \namended; Lautenberg No. 2478, as modified with the changes at the desk; \nGraham amendment 2516; the Bingaman motion to strike is under the \nprevious order; conference report to accompany the foreign operations \nbill; further, that no second degrees be in order to the Kerry or \nLautenberg amendments prior to the vote; and that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided before the votes, with the Lautenberg amendment getting \n8 minutes equally divided before the vote. I further ask that after the \nfirst vote, all subsequent votes be 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object--I don't intend to object--I \nask a parliamentary inquiry as to whether there is anything in this \nunanimous consent agreement which would preclude the offering of \nadditional second-degree amendments to the Graham amendment should the \nGraham amendment 2516 be agreed to and should the Bingaman motion to \nstrike be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Depending on how the amendment is drafted, a \nfurther second-degree amendment could be in order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Or amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Or amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. WARNER. I hear no further comment or objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2514), as modified, was agreed to as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. REPORT ON ALLEGED CLANDESTINE DETENTION FACILITIES \n                   FOR INDIVIDUALS CAPTURED IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President shall ensure that the United \n     States Government continues to comply with the authorization, \n     reporting, and notification requirements of title V of the \n     National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 413 et seq.).\n       (b) Director of National Intelligence Report.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall provide to the members of the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives a detailed report setting forth the nature \n     and cost of, and otherwise providing a full accounting on, \n     any clandestine prison or detention facility currently or \n     formerly operated by the United States Government, regardless \n     of location, where detainees in the global war on terrorism \n     are or were being held.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     set forth, for each prison or facility, if any, covered by \n     such report, the following:\n       (A) The location and size of such prison or facility.\n       (B) If such prison or facility is no longer being operated \n     by the United States Government, the disposition of such \n     prison or facility.\n       (C) The number of detainees currently held or formerly \n     held, as the case may be, at such prison or facility.\n       (D) Any plans for the ultimate disposition of any detainees \n     currently held at such prison or facility.\n       (E) A description of the interrogation procedures used or \n     formerly used on detainees at such prison or facility, and a \n     determination, in coordination with other appropriate \n     officials, on whether such procedures are or were in \n     compliance with United States obligations under the Geneva \n     Conventions and the Convention Against Torture.\n       (3) Form of report.--The report required by paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted in classified form.\n\n  The amendment (No. 2478), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 286, strike lines 1 through 3, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1072. IMPROVEMENTS OF INTERNAL SECURITY ACT OF 1950.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Holding of Security Clearance After \n     Certain Violations on Handling of Classified Information.--\n       (1) Prohibition.--Section 4 of the Internal Security Act of \n     1950 (50 U.S.C. 783) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(B) No person, including individuals in the executive \n     branch and Members of Congress and their staffs, who \n     knowingly violates a law or regulation regarding the handling \n     of classified information in a manner that could have a \n     significant adverse impact on the national security of the \n     United States, including the knowing disclosure of the \n     identity of a covert agent of the Central Intelligence Agency \n     or the existence of classified programs or operations, the \n     disclosure\n\n[[Page S12662]]\n\n     of which could have such an impact, to a person not \n     authorized to receive such information, shall be permitted to \n     hold a security clearance for, or obtain access to, \n     classified information.''.\n       (2) Applicability.--Subsection (f) of section 4 of the \n     Internal Security Act of 1950, as added by paragraph (1), \n     shall apply to any individual holding a security clearance on \n     or after the date of the enactment of this Act with respect \n     to any knowing violation of law or regulation described in \n     such subsection, regardless of whether such violation occurs \n     before, on, or after that date.\n       (b) Clarification of Authority To Issue Security \n     Regulations and Orders.--\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I clarify, how long is this \ndiscussion going to take because I know this is set for 4:45.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see that the Senator from Kansas says 5 \nminutes, and the Senator from Massachusetts is indicating some time to \nhelp our colleague.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the concern is, we still need a few \nminutes to complete the debate on the Graham amendment and my second \ndegree. I would hate to see that time all used up while they are \ndiscussing this other amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consistent with the previous agreement, \nSenators Bingaman and Graham would each have 15 minutes, and they may \nyield that time to others.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my understanding, from the \ncolloquy we had around the desk of the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, in order to expedite the whole process, we would lead with \nthe Kerry amendment, and we would then proceed onward. I thought that \nwas the agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I can only say to my colleague, having \nbeen a part of this, we seemed to reach a consensus. Staffs on both \nsides compiled this UC request, which my understanding is it was \ncleared, subject to clarification by the Senator from Michigan, and it \nwas a concluded matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I do not think we need to get hung up on \nthis at all. I think the unanimous consent request was absolutely \ncorrect in the order it proceeded. We simply now have to agree that \nSenators Rockefeller and Roberts would have a total of 5 minutes \nbetween them, and subsequently Senator Graham and Senator Bingaman \nwould follow with their 15 minutes, approximately, and the votes would \nfollow immediately thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, do I understand now that the Presiding \nOfficer has ruled that the UC is in place that I so stated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2507\n\n  Mr. President, I support the objective of the underlying amendment \nproposed by Senator Kerry and others, those others being the minority \nleader and Senator Biden.\n  The information required by the Kerry amendment is essential if we \nare to ensure that the U.S. intelligence community is carrying out its \nintelligence collection mission against a dangerous and nefarious \nterrorist enemy.\n  In fact, earlier this year, I took to the Senate floor during the \nconsideration of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill and \noffered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment calling for such an \ninvestigation in the Intelligence Committee. The amendment was ruled \nout of order by the Chair.\n  The reason I raise this point is that the Intelligence Committee is \nthe only committee in the Senate with the expertise and the \njurisdictional responsibility for overseeing the Central Intelligence \nAgency and the other agencies comprising the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity. The Kerry amendment, as amended, correctly points out that \nall members of the Intelligence Committee must have answers to key \nquestions concerning alleged clandestine detention facilities. We need \nthe information so we can ensure that the intelligence activities of \nthis Nation are both effective and lawful. The Senate Intelligence \nCommittee was established 30 years ago to carry out precisely this type \nof matter.\n  I wish to commend, once again, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry, and the cosponsors for offering this amendment. I am pleased \nthat the second-degree amendment has been agreed to.\n  I thank my colleagues. I hope we can adopt this amendment on the \nfloor because I believe it is a good piece of legislation that John \nKerry has put forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will just take 1 minute.\n  I thank Senator Rockefeller and Senator Roberts for their cooperation \nin this effort and Senator Warner and Senator Levin for helping to \nproceed down the road here. We are happy to accept the modification, a \nmodification that I think appropriately keeps the jurisdiction within \nthe Intelligence Committee, but at the same time it also appropriately \nmakes certain that the Senate will have the information necessary to be \nable to provide accountability with respect to these activities.\n  So I thank my colleagues and look forward to the vote. I hope my \ncolleagues will overwhelmingly embrace this amendment.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman and Senator Graham for their courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I yield back any time we have.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2515\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico and the Senator \nfrom South Carolina each have 12\\1/2\\ minutes under their control.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I do not see the Senator from South Carolina on the floor, and I \nwanted to propound a question to him. So I will wait until he returns.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from South Carolina might make \nhimself available to answer an inquiry by the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to the Senator, I would be glad to, if I could just \nwrap up my thoughts. But do you want to do that now? What would you \nlike to do?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from New Mexico, \nthen, would like to proceed with his time and then yield to me in a few \nminutes? And then I could propound that question at a later moment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Shall I go first?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Go right ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve and a half minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Twelve and a half minutes.\n  Mr. President, one thing I have not done in this whole process is be \nwilly-nilly about this amendment or about this issue. I am deeply \nconcerned as a Senator that we have lost the moral high ground in the \nwar, that we have confused our own troops, that our interrogation \ntechniques have been out of bounds. That is why I support Senator \nMcCain and other Members of this body--90 to 9--to get it right, \nbecause we have to maintain the moral high ground.\n  We did not have hearings about that because we do not need hearings. \nWe know that our interrogation techniques have been confusing and \nsometimes unacceptable. We know it is time for America to say to the \nworld that no matter what agency is involved or where the person is, \nthey are going to be treated humanely. We know that.\n  I have been dealing with this for a year. I have worked with Senator \nSpecter. I have been trying to find some way to get a grip on the legal \naspects of this war, as well as the moral aspects of this war. And \nbefore I got here--I am still an active member of the Reserves. I have \nbeen a judge advocate in the Air Force most of my adult life.\n  Senator Leahy mentioned something: Let's be a nation of the rule of\n\n[[Page S12663]]\n\nlaw. I applaud that. The question is, What is the law here? What is the \nrule of law when you are at war? The rule of law when you are at war is \nthe law of armed conflict. When we were attacked on 9/11, we went to \nwar, ladies and gentlemen. We are not fighting a criminal enterprise. \nThe rule of law in the law of armed conflict says that POWs and enemy \ncombatants and irregular combatants will be detained within the \nguidelines of the Geneva Conventions. An enemy combatant is not \nentitled to Geneva Conventions protection because they do not wear a \nuniform, they do not fight for a nation. But an enemy combatant is \nentitled to certain things. We as Americans say you are entitled to be \ntreated humanely, interrogated humanely, and you are entitled to due \nprocess to be kept off the battlefield. But you are what you are. You \nare someone who took up arms against our country. Never in the history \nof the rule of law of armed conflict has an enemy combatant, POW, \nperson who is trying to kill U.S. troops, been given the right to sue \nthose same troops for their medical care, for their exercise programs, \nor for their reading materials.\n  Do you want to be the Senator who has changed 200 years of law? Do \nyou want to be the Senator who is changing the law of armed conflict to \nsay that an enemy combatant--someone caught on the battlefield, engaged \nin hostilities against this country--is not a person in a war but a \ncriminal and given the same rights as every other American citizen? Do \nyou want to be the Senator who changes 200 years of that? I do not want \nto be. This is not complicated. One thing is for sure, this is not \ncomplicated. No POW in the history of this country has ever been \nallowed to sue our own troops in Federal court. Does it matter? The \nhabeas corpus writ that is being exercised does not come from the \nConstitution. This is not a constitutional right that an enemy \ncombatant has under our law. This is an interpretation of a statute we \npassed, 2241.\n  The question is, 4 years after 9/11, do we want to change our law and \ngive a terrorist, an al-Qaida member, the ability to sue our own troops \nin Federal court, all over the country, for anything and everything? I \ndo not. I want to treat them humanely. I want to get good information. \nAnd I want to prosecute them within the rule of law. But I do not want \nto do something that is absurd and is going to hurt our national \nsecurity; that is, allowing a terrorist the ability to go to Federal \ncourt and sue our own troops, who are fighting for our freedom, as if \nthey were an American citizen.\n\n  Do you know why the Nazis did not get to do that when we had them in \nour charge? Because that is not the law. It has never been the law. We \ncaught six German saboteurs sneaking into this country, trying to blow \nup part of America. They were tried. Where? In a military commission, a \nmilitary tribunal, not in a civilian court. We had German POWs who \ntried to come into Federal court, and our court said: As a member of an \narmed force, organized against the United States, you are not entitled \nto a constitutional right of habeas corpus.\n  Do you want to give these terrorists habeas corpus rights just like \nan average, everyday American citizen or a common criminal to sue our \nown troops? Well, if you do, vote against my amendment. If you want to \nget back to where we have been for 200 years, then you need to support \nme.\n  This is not complicated. We need to do more than one thing at a time. \nWe need to have interrogation techniques we can be proud of. We need \nthe McCain amendment. We need to standardize interrogation techniques \nso we do not lose the moral high ground. We need to make a statement \nthat we are going to treat everybody humanely. Enemy combatant, POW--no \nmatter who you are--we are going to treat you humanely.\n  The Congress does not need to give the executive branch a blank check \non how to run this war. My amendment requires the executive branch to \nreport to us about what they are doing at Guantanamo Bay. It requires \nthe Senate to confirm the person in charge of releasing or retaining \nthese enemy combats. My amendment gives them every right the Geneva \nConventions afford an enemy combatant, and then some. It gives them an \nadversarial proceeding at Guantanamo Bay, where they can challenge \ntheir status. We go further. It gives them a right to go to the \nDistrict Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia--something never \ndone in the history of warfare--because we want to let the world know \nwe are going to go out of our way to get it right.\n  But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do not rein in prisoner abuse, we \nare going to lose the war. But if we do not rein in legal abuse by \nprisoners, we are going to undermine our ability to protect ourselves.\n  I am making one simple request of this body: Do not give the \nterrorists, the enemy combatants, the people who blow up folks at \nweddings, who fly airplanes into the Twin Towers, the ability to sue \nour own troops all over the country for any and everything. Give them \ndue process. Treat them humanely. Try them under the rule of law. But \nlet's not change 200 years of the law of armed conflict.\n  Your vote today matters. Your vote today matters. We are going to \nmake history one way or the other.\n  Does the Senate, honestly to God, want to give terror suspects the \nsame rights as American citizens based on a statute we pass? That is \nwhat is at stake here. Our troops are counting on us.\n  They are being taken all over the country, and here is what is going \non according to some of the people involved in these habeas petitions:\n\n       We have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small \n     firms working to represent these detainees. Every time an \n     attorney goes down there, it makes it that much harder for \n     the U.S. military to do what they're doing. You can't run an \n     interrogation . . . with attorneys. What are they going to do \n     now that we're getting court orders to get more lawyers down \n     there?\n\n  Civilian judges cannot run this war. This is about the rule of law. \nThe rule of law protects people in armed combat. This is about changing \nour law to give terror suspects rights of U.S. citizens.\n  Shame on us if we do that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 11\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. And how much on the side of the proponent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from New Mexico. I wonder if I could \ninquire of the Senator from South Carolina, I agree with much of what \nhe said, and I congratulate him for trying to get some rules and \nregulations into these proceedings. I believe that is important. But if \nthe habeas corpus proceedings were added to the Senator's amendment--\nthey were not part of the Senator's amendment to begin with, and I \nthink all of us shared the original amendment of the Senator from South \nCarolina, but then the court-stripping provisions were added relative \nto habeas corpus. That is where we are getting into very precipitous \ntrouble.\n  Given the language of the new amendment of the Senator from South \nCarolina, if one of these enemy combatants is sentenced to death, there \nwould be no appeal; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No, sir. That is not correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me read the language of the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The military commissions would be the sentencing body, \nnot the CSRTs. I know this is a bit complicated, but the CSRT provision \ndoesn't try people. It determines whether they are enemy combatants.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could read this, because I only have a few minutes, \non page 3 of the amendment, Judicial Review:\n  United States Code is amended by saying no court, justice, or judge \nshall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for writ of \nhabeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien outside the United \nStates who is detained at Guantanamo Bay.\n  Is it not accurate to say that no court of the United States could \nreview a conviction which even resulted in a death sentence for one of \nthese people down at Guantanamo and that that is inconsistent with the \ndecision of the Supreme Court in re Quirin?\n\n[[Page S12664]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No, sir. That is not accurate. This says that no illegal, \nno foreign alien who is being detained as an enemy combatant can file a \nwrit of habeas corpus. The reason for that being said is because that \nhas been the law for 200 years. We didn't let German prisoners file \nwrits. Under the Roosevelt administration, these six people were \ncaptured. They were tried. Four were executed. A writ of habeas corpus \nwas not available to them. It should not have been available to them. \nThe reason we have a military system and we have a civilian system is \nbecause we understand the military is a unique body. We don't try our \nown people in civilian court. We try them in military court. It has \nbeen the history of the law of armed conflict that when you have \nsomebody tried for a violation of law of armed conflict, you don't go \nto Federal court. You go to a military commission or a military court. \nThat is what happened in World War II. That is what will happen to \nthese people, if they are tried.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me read from the opinion in the Hamdan case to see if \nthe Senator would agree with it. Ex parte Quirin, in which captured \nGerman saboteurs challenged the lawfulness of the military commission \nbefore which they were to be tried, provides a compelling historical \nprecedent for the power of civilian courts to entertain challenges that \nseek to interrupt the processes of military commissions. The Supreme \nCourt ruled against the petitioners in Quirin but only after \nconsidering their arguments on the merits.\n  What the language of the Senator's amendment does--and I hope it is \ninadvertent--the Senator eliminates court review of the sentences of \nenemy combatants before these commissions. I understand that he \nprovides a mechanism to review the status of those enemy combatants. \nThat is fine. He sends them all to court. That creates the kind of \nproblem which the Senator from Pennsylvania talked about. But he goes \nway beyond that. The Senator's language goes way beyond saying that we \nare substituting court review for habeas corpus relative to status \ndeterminations. The Senator's amendment eliminates habeas corpus on all \nissues for enemy combatants at Guantanamo. That would be a clear repeal \nof the decision in Quirin and would also do one other thing.\n  In the Rasul case, which has been already decided by the Supreme \nCourt, the Supreme Court concluded that Federal courts have \njurisdiction to determine the legality of the executive's potentially \nindefinite detention of individuals who claim to be wholly innocent of \nwrongdoing. This decision of the Supreme Court would be reversed if we \nadopted this language.\n  Finally, in the moment I have remaining, there is pending a decision \nat the Supreme Court which would be retroactively prohibited. The \nSupreme Court has agreed to hear a case recently, about a week ago, in \nthe case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld to decide whether military commissions \nestablished by the President--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield whatever time the Senator needs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In the Hamdan case, the Supreme Court, a few days ago, \nagreed to determine the legality of the military commissions \nestablished by the President to try enemy combatants and about whether \ndetainees at Guantanamo are entitled to protections under the Geneva \nConventions. That case would be wiped out under the language which is \nretroactive in the Senator's amendment. The Supreme Court, although \nthey have agreed to hear the case, would be stymied in hearing a case \nthey have agreed to hear. This goes way beyond the question of whether \nwe are substituting. I have no great problem in substituting the court \nreview for habeas corpus relative to those determinations of status. I \nthink that is a fair substitute because at least then there is a court \nreview. But this goes way beyond that, because this amendment \neliminates habeas corpus for all issues which might be raised by \ndetainees, including a conviction which leads to a death sentence that \nviolates Quirin.\n\n  It is inconsistent with what the Supreme Court did in the case which \nI already referred to. It would eliminate the jurisdiction already \naccepted by the Supreme Court in Hamdan.\n  I urge that we not adopt this amendment. It is far too broad. Senator \nSpecter's argument that the Judiciary Committee should have an \nopportunity to look at this is an argument to which we ought to listen.\n  Although I disagree with the Senator's modified amendment, I do want \nto commend Senator Graham because he has at least undertaken to tackle \na very difficult issue which this body should tackle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To my good friend Senator Levin, we fundamentally \ndisagree. There is a principle at stake here that is as old as war \nitself. Writs of habeas corpus have never been given to enemy \ncombatants or POWs. They have never been allowed access to the Federal \ncourt to challenge their enemy combatant status tribunal which is new \nand different, beyond the Geneva Conventions. The German prisoners were \ntried by a military commission. Four of them were executed. They were \nnot allowed to go into Federal court under writ of habeas corpus \nbecause the Constitution does not confer the right of a writ to a \nforeign alien involved in combat activities against the United States. \nThe only reason we are talking about this is, the Court is inviting us: \nAs the Senate, do you want al-Qaida members, under 2241, to have the \nwrit of habeas corpus. The military commissions are set up to try these \npeople. My amendment talks about the procedure of keeping them off the \nbattlefield, allows them due process rights beyond Geneva Conventions \narticle 5, allows them now to go to a district court and the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia beyond what the Geneva Conventions \never envisioned. The military commissions are totally different. No one \nhas been tried yet.\n  Here is the one thing I can tell you for sure as a military lawyer. A \nPOW or an enemy combatant facing law of armed conflict charges has not \nbeen given the right of habeas corpus for 200 years because our own \npeople in our own military facing court-martials, who could be \nsentenced to death, do not have the right of habeas corpus. It is about \nmilitary law. I am not changing anything. I am getting us back to what \nwe have done for 200 years.\n  If you want to give terrorists habeas corpus rights as if they were \nAmerican citizens, that they are not part of an outfit trying to wage \nwar on us, fine, vote against me. If you think they are common \ncriminals like American citizens, vote against me. I will be the first \nto say that if these were criminals, we wouldn't treat them this way. \nThese are not criminals. These are people caught on the battlefield as \nthe Nazis were caught on the battlefield. They need to be held \naccountable. They need to be treated humanely. Does this body want to \nbe the first Senate in the history of the United States to confer \nrights on a POW and an enemy combatant to sue the troops who are trying \nto protect us? There are 160 cases down there. There are going to be \n300 cases. They are going to ruin the ability to get intelligence \nbecause we in the Senate haven't acted, and we need to act.\n  How are we going to act? Are we going to act in the best tradition of \nthe United States in accordance with the rule of law, or are we going \nto give terrorist suspects, al-Qaida members, the right to sue our own \ntroops in Federal court? If you want that, vote against me. If you \nthink that is absurd, vote with me.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from South Carolina want to give those \nsame terrorists due process, for heaven's sake? Of course, he does. He \ngets up on the floor and says he wants to provide due process. I say--\n  Mr. GRAHAM. May I respond?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want an opportunity here. He is on the right track in \ndoing it. The question is whether there will be an appeal. If there is \na conviction of those alleged terrorists for committing a war crime, is \nthere any appeal under this language in the amendment? I am afraid \nthere is not. I don't think it is the intention of the amendment, \nbecause the Senator says, of course, there is going to be appeal. The \ntrouble is, the language of the amendment, by its own specific terms, \nsays: No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or \nconsider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by somebody \nat Guantanamo. That is the problem here. There would be no appeal.\n\n[[Page S12665]]\n\n  Although the Senator makes a plea for due process for these same \nterrorists, he would eliminate the appeal of a conviction that led to a \ncapital offense, the death penalty, for these same terrorists. I hope \nthat is not his intent, but it would be the first time that that would \never happen, that we would purport, as the Senate, to strip the court \nof habeas corpus opportunity to review that kind of a conviction. Since \nex parte Quirin, we have never done that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. May I answer that? I say to the Senator, with all due \nrespect, that is dead wrong. Military commissions that will be trying \nthe people designated by the President, subject to be tried at \nGuantanamo Bay for violation of the law of armed conflict, do get \nappeals. They get more appeal rights than the people who were tried as \nGerman saboteurs under military commissions. They get a lawyer. They \nget the right to confront witnesses against them. They get the right to \ncall witnesses. The military commissions are different than the CSRTs. \nThere is a process in the military commissions for people to have every \nright under the Geneva Conventions and then some, to have more rights \nthan the German saboteurs. The German saboteurs did not have habeas \ncorpus rights. They had an appeal right within the military commission \nsystem, as the al-Qaida members do. To say that you can be tried at \nGuantanamo Bay for a war crime and not have an appeal is not true. It \nis like we did with the saboteurs. To say that people at Guantanamo Bay \nshould have habeas corpus rights is doing something no one has ever had \nin the law of armed conflict, Nazi or otherwise.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My final question, to what court would the conviction of a \ndetainee at Guantanamo for a capital offense subject to death, to what \ncourt would that appeal lie, if this language of the Senator is \nadopted? It is a very specific question, to what court?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Under the military commission model, there is an appeal \nto a three-judge panel of civilians appointed to hear appeals. In the \nmilitary commission model, under World War II, they didn't get that. \nThere is an appeal process for civilian review of the trial of enemy \ncombatants detained at Guantanamo Bay. My amendment doesn't affect \nthat. It doesn't change that at all. My amendment prevents the use of \nhabeas rights for POWs and enemy combatants, something we have never \ngiven in the history of the law of armed conflict to people in the \nmilitary system because we don't want civilian judges coming in here \nand running the war. I am trying to get us back where we have always \nbeen. This is not complicated, but it is very important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from South Carolina \nhas expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we are getting back to where we have always been, we \ndon't need this amendment. The Senator just answered my question by not \nanswering it. I asked him what court would an appeal of a death \nsentence be appealed to? His answer was, a three-judge panel. That \nthree-judge panel is appointed by the Secretary of Defense. I asked \nspecifically to what court would a death sentence be appealed, if this \nlanguage is adopted. I read the language as to how broad it is. It \neliminates explicitly any appeal: No court, justice, or judge shall \nhave jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for writ of habeas \ncorpus, and that is the way an appeal goes to a court from one of these \npeople. It is eliminated. We strip courts of the right to hear a habeas \ncorpus petition on a death sentence.\n  I agree with what the Senator started out to do with his amendment. \nHe was on the right track. But this language goes way beyond it. That \nis why the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, and \nthe ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, oppose \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to end with this thought. Never in \nthe history of military commissions where we have tried enemy \ncombatants and spies have they appealed those convictions to Federal \ncourt. Never.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me use the final minute of this \ndebate to clarify for my colleagues what we are doing here. There are \nfour parts to the amendment that the Senator from South Carolina has \noffered. There are parts A, B, C, and D. Parts A, B, and C are \nperfectly acceptable and provisions that I support and Senator Levin \nsupports. They were worked out. They were added to the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  The first deals with procedures for status review of detainees. The \nsecond sets out what those procedures would generally provide. The \nthird is a report on modification of procedures that would be made to \nthe Congress.\n  It is the last part, this section D, judicial review, that is such a \nterrible mistake, in my opinion. It has us, on a Thursday afternoon as \npart of a debate on a Defense authorization bill, making a very major \nchange that is within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The \nJudiciary Committee should be considering any effort by the Congress to \nlimit or prohibit or suspend the writ of habeas corpus. We should not \nbe trying to do that sort of ``oh, by the way, let's do this.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I urge the defeat of the Graham amendment. Assuming it \nis defeated, I will not have to offer a second-degree amendment. If it \nis adopted, I will offer a second-degree amendment to retain the first \nthree portions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Cornyn as a \ncosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2507, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nthe Kerry amendment, as amended.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 8 minutes equally divided on the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2478, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this modified version of my amendment \ncontains several good suggestions from the managers of this bill, \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin. My underlying amendment stands for a \nvery simple proposition: Those who knowingly compromise significant \nclassified information should not continue to hold a security clearance \nand they should be denied further access to classified information. The \nmodification to the amendment makes clear that it applies to Members of \nthe Congress and to their staffs as well.\n  My amendment is similar to one offered by our Democratic leader, \nSenator Reid, in July. Some of our colleagues reacted to Senator Reid's \namendment by expressing their concern that it was an open-ended \nstandard. In deference to these concerns, I have added the ``knowing'' \nstandard; in other words, if someone reveals information knowingly. I \nam pleased to see my colleagues find this version acceptable.\n  Senator Warner and I served in World War II. We had an expression \nthen. It said: ``Loose lips sink ships.'' Everybody was participating \nin protecting ourselves from revealing information to the enemy. \nExposing our secrets was a grave offense then and it is a grave offense \nnow.\n  No one is above this law and no one has a right to keep their \nsecurity clearance if they knowingly reveal our secrets. Anybody in \nGovernment, whether the White House or the Congress or a Government \nemployee, should have to live by the same standards as other hard-\nworking Federal employees. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that \nan intelligence analyst lost his clearance because he faxed his resume \nusing a commercial machine. A Defense Department employee had her \nclearance suspended because a jilted boyfriend called her office and \nsaid she was unreliable. An Army officer had his clearance revoked over \n$67 in personal calls charged to a military cell phone. There should \nnot be a double standard for anybody.\n  I want to be clear with my colleagues. This amendment has nothing to \ndo with criminal behavior. That is taken care of in other statutes. It \nmerely governs under what circumstances someone should lose their \nsecurity clearance for improper behavior. Given recent developments of \nwhich we are all aware, this is a necessary amendment. We need to make \nsure those who are careless with national security information are \ndenied continued access to top-secret information. Anyone who leaks \nclassified information should not continue to have a security \nclearance. I am sure across the country people would agree with that. \nIf you are giving out information you should not reveal in the first \nplace, why should you have access to that same type information on a \ncontinuing basis?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I worked on the amendment with the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey. I have done so in consultation \nwith my leadership and the leadership of the Intelligence Committee.\n  I would like to make this offer to my good friend. We have a rapidly \nmoving bill. We have a number of amendments yet to vote on tonight. The \nleadership may well be addressing the Senate, the majority leader and \nDemocratic leader, about this bill.\n  Is it at all possible that we can voice vote this amendment? I urge \nmy colleague to do so.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I want to be cooperative, but I do want to make sure \nit is clearly understood that we are all supporting--or those who are \nsupporting this amendment. I would like it clearly on the record. \nPerhaps a 10-minute vote?\n  Mr. WARNER. Suppose we had a voice vote and you determined from the \nresounding ayes if it meets your specifications?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I were sitting in that chair, I would probably say \nyes, but I am not sitting in that chair.\n  I ask that we have a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be glad to have you occupy the Chair right now, \nas President pro tempore.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If we continue to talk about it, we will have lost \nthe opportunity to move the bill along. This was the understanding that \nwe had, for a rollcall vote. Forgive me, my colleagues, but like \neverybody else I want to have a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator take a division vote? A standing vote? \nA division of the Senate, a standing vote? All those in favor stand?\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, we have worked \nwith you in a most cooperative way.\n  I would like to have the attention of my good friend. We have worked \nwith you in a most cooperative way. What I am trying to do is \nconvenience a number of Members who have commitments tonight. I once \nmore ask if you will not accept this on a voice vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I don't want to be obstinate. If we could now declare \nthe time that this session will end, perhaps we can then look at a \nstanding vote. Other than that, if I agree to move my amendment along \nand find out that we still continue to drag on--will all the other \namendments be subjected to voice votes?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will ask all.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Where there is no objection, yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. If there is no objection.\n  So once again I ask my colleague if we could voice vote this \namendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How about a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have the yeas and nays on this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the parliamentary situation? Will the Senator \nyield? Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand the rules, if you get a standing \ndivision and the Chair calls it and you are the author of the amendment \nand you are not satisfied, you can still ask for the yeas and nays, am \nI not correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the Senator is correct in his interpretation of \nthe rules.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So you can say you want a voice vote and if you are not \nsatisfied, you can ask for the yeas and nays. Can you get a standing \ndivision if you are not satisfied? You can still get the yeas and nays, \nam I not correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. Can we have a standing division?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If that is the situation, I am going to cooperate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Presiding Officer arrange for a division vote?\n  May we have order in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A division is requested.\n  All those in favor of the amendment, stand and remain standing until \ncounted. The ayes will be seated and the nays will rise.\n  On a division, the amendment (No. 2478), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2516\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment to be considered is the \nGraham amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Chambliss proposes an amendment numbered \n     2516.\n\n[[Page S12667]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: Relating to the review of the status of detainees of the \n                       United States Government)\n\n       Strike all after the word SEC.\n\n     __. REVIEW OF STATUS OF DETAINEES.\n\n       (a) Submittal of Procedures for Status Review of Detainees \n     at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to the congressional defense committees, and to \n     the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives, a report setting forth the procedures of \n     the Combatant Status Review Tribunals and the noticed \n     Administrative Review Boards in operation at Guantanamo Bay, \n     Cuba, for determining the status of the detainees held at \n     Guantanamo Bay.\n       (b) Procedures.--The procedures submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to subsection (a) shall, with respect to proceedings \n     beginning after the date of the submittal of such procedures \n     under that subsection, ensure that--\n       (1) in making a determination of status of any detainee \n     under such procedures, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or \n     Administrative Review Board may not consider statements \n     derived from persons that, as determined by such Tribunal or \n     Board, by the preponderance of the evidence, were obtained \n     with undue coercion; and\n       (2) the Designated Civilian Official shall be an officer of \n     the United States Government whose appointment to office was \n     made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of \n     the Senate.\n       (c) Report on Modification of Procedures.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall submit to the committees of Congress referred \n     to in subsection (a) a report on any modification of the \n     procedures submitted under subsection (a) not later than 30 \n     days before the date on which such modifications go into \n     effect.\n       (d) Judicial Review of Detention of Enemy Combatants.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 2241 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction \n     to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas \n     corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien outside the United \n     States (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(38) of the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38)) who \n     is detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, \n     Cuba.''.\n       (2) Certain decisions.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), and \n     (D), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction to \n     determine the validity of any decision of a Designated \n     Civilian Official described in subsection (b)(2) that an \n     alien is properly detained as an enemy combatant.\n       (B) Limitation on claims.--The jurisdiction of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n     under this paragraph shall be limited to claims brought by or \n     on behalf of an alien--\n       (i) who is, at the time a request for review by such court \n     is filed, detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba; and\n       (ii) for whom a Combatant Status Review Tribunal has been \n     conducted, pursuant to applicable procedures specified by the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       (C) Scope of review.--The jurisdiction of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on any \n     claims with respect to an alien under this paragraph shall be \n     limited to the consideration of whether the status \n     determination of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal with \n     regard to such alien was consistent with the procedures and \n     standards specified by the Secretary of Defense for Combatant \n     Status Review Tribunals.\n       (D) Termination on release from custody.--The jurisdiction \n     of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit with respect to the claims of an alien under \n     this paragraph shall cease upon the release of such alien \n     from the custody of the Department of Defense.\n       (3) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall apply to any application or other action that is \n     pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. \n     Paragraph (2) shall apply with respect to any claim regarding \n     a decision covered by that paragraph that is pending on or \n     after such date.\n       This section shall become effective 1 day after enactment.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Debate is equally divided on the amendment. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak briefly in opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  This amendment contains a provision that I think is a very major \nmistake. It essentially denies all courts anywhere the right to \nconsider any petition from any prisoner being held at Guantanamo Bay. \nIn my view, it is contrary to the way the court decisions have come \ndown already. It is an extraordinary step for this Congress to be \ntaking as an amendment to the Defense bill. This is an issue that \nshould be dealt with in the Judiciary Committee. Senator Specter has \nspoken against the amendment. Senator Levin has spoken against the \namendment. Senator Leahy has spoken against the amendment. It is \nsomething that requires hearings. It is a very important issue, and we \nshould not be dealing with it here on a late evening on Thursday as \npart of this authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we need to standardize our interrogation \ntechniques because we have lost our way. We need to make a statement we \nare not going to treat people poorly during our charge. For 200 years \nin the law of armed conflict, no nation has given an enemy combatant, a \nterrorist, al-Qaida member the ability to go into every Federal court \nin the United States and sue the people who are fighting the war for \nus. There are 160 habeas corpus petitions being filed against \nGuantanamo Bay detention.\n  Let me read what one of them is saying, a motion by a high-level al-\nQaida detainee complaining about basic security procedures: Speed of \nmail delivery, medical treatment, seek an order to be transferred to \nthe least onerous condition at Gitmo, and asking the court to order \nGitmo to allow him to keep any books and reading material sent to him, \nand report to the court on his opportunities for exercise, \ncommunication, recreation, and worship.\n  The Nazis couldn't go to a Federal court when we had them in our \ncharge as prisoners of war. Never in the history of armed conflict has \nthis been allowed.\n  Let us stand up for our troops in a reasonable way, protect them from \nabuses, and protect them from the court suits filed by the people they \nare fighting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from New Mexico \n(Mr. Domenici), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from \nNebraska (Mr. Hagel), the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Lugar), the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum), and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. \nThomas).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Parliamentary inquiry: The Senator is not withdrawing \nhis amendment permanently. Are you withdrawing your amendment \npermanently?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as I understand the unanimous consent \nagreement we have entered into, it is still possible to file second-\ndegree amendments and to propose second-degree amendments to the Graham \namendment even after we take the series of votes that are scheduled \ntonight. And it is not my intent to go to a vote on my amendment at \nthis time so we can proceed to the remainder of the votes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Regular order.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only \nremaining first-degree amendments to the Defense bill, other than any \nfurther managers' amendments that are cleared, be an amendment offered \nby the majority leader or his designee on Iraq, and an amendment \noffered by the Democratic leader or his designee on Iraq, and that they \nbe laid down this evening with no second degrees in order. I further \nask unanimous consent that there be 3 second degrees in order to the \nGraham amendment, two offered by Senator Levin or his designee, and one \noffered by Senator Graham. I further ask consent that all amendments be \noffered and debated on Monday, under the previous limitations, and that \non Tuesday, at a time determined by the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to a vote \nin relation to the majority amendment on Iraq, to be followed by a vote \nin relation to the Democratic amendment, to be followed by votes in \nrelation to the second degree amendments in order offered, to be \nfollowed by a vote on the underlying Graham amendment, as amended; and \nthat following these votes the bill be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or \ndebate; finally, that there be 30 minutes equally divided between the \ntwo managers prior to the start of the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I surely will not, is \nit my understanding that we had agreed that there would be some brief \ntime period on Tuesday, prior to the votes on the Iraq amendments, I \nbelieve it was like 20 minutes?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just for the information of our colleagues, \nthere will be 30 minutes equally divided between the two managers prior \nto the start of the votes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With that clarification, I am very content.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader and all others who made possible that we will now \nhave a Defense authorization bill, a strong bill, a good bill. The UC \njust propounded by the distinguished majority leader requires that the \nIraq amendments be laid down tonight.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2518\n\n  On behalf of the distinguished majority leader and myself, I now send \nto the desk the Iraq amendment as required by the UC. My understanding \nis the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Michigan on Iraq is \nat the desk; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was going to send that up immediately after the Senator \nsends up his amendment.\n\n[[Page S12669]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, by way of preliminary debate on the Iraq \namendment, I would simply advise my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan and other Senators that we were given, in a timely manner, the \namendment that has just been sent to the desk by the Senator from \nMichigan, known as the leadership Iraq amendment. Senator Frist, I, and \nothers have simply taken that amendment and amended it in several ways, \nand that then becomes the Warner-Frist amendment.\n  So I just inform colleagues, basically, we are dealing with the basic \namendment as provided by the Senator from Michigan, the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, and others. We have modified our leadership \namendment in a manner which we think is consistent with the strong \nneeds of our country to achieve the objectives that we have in Iraq.\n  Having said that, I think we have pretty well concluded business for \nthe day on this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, I agree with the \ndescription which my dear friend from Virginia has provided, that I did \nprovide him with our amendment. Even though our amendment has a later \nnumber, it was the amendment which was first provided. The Senator from \nVirginia, after consultation with his leader and others, has made some \nmodifications in our amendment and that amendment, under the unanimous \nconsent agreement which will be voted on first, is the amendment \nbasically that we drafted over here with the modifications made by the \nSenator from Virginia and others. So that is the chronology, that is \nthe history, and that is the order we will be voting on and will be \ndebating these on Monday under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  There are some differences. I would not describe them as major \ndifferences but, nonetheless, there are some differences that now exist \nbetween the two versions, and we can debate which is the preferable \nversion. But in any event, under either version, it strikes me that \nthere is clearly a call here for some changes in course in policy in \nIraq. But that again is something we can debate further on Monday.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I do believe it is \nvery wise for the Senate to have this debate. We are prepared for that \ndebate.\n  I would simply advise colleagues--and the leadership later will in \nwrap-up give more specifics--my understanding is there will be a vote \nat 5:30, preceded by 1 hour of debate on that vote, which is on one of \nthe appropriations bills. That is my understanding. Can the Presiding \nOfficer advise me as to what the vote is that is scheduled on Monday at \n5:30?\n  I am advised it is the Energy and Water Conference Report. Am I \nreasonably correct in preliminarily informing the Senate that vote will \ntake place at about 5:30, and the 1 hour prior to it will be reserved \nfor debate on that? I interpret that to mean that from the time the \nSenate comes in on Monday up until 4:30, that would be available for \nthe important debate on the respective Iraqi amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, also I believe the debate on \nthe second-degree amendments to the Graham amendment would occur on \nMonday since the only time on Tuesday prior to votes on the amendments \nwould be 30 minutes equally divided and that would be needed, perhaps, \nfor both second degrees to Graham and the Iraqi amendments, all wrapped \ninto that 30 minutes.\n  There may be and I think there probably would be debate on Monday on \nthe second-degree amendments, referred to in this unanimous consent \nagreement, to the Graham amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if the distinguished Senator from Michigan and I \ncan visit here for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Michigan and I desire to accommodate \ncolleagues. Again, the hour from 4:30 to 5:30 is on the appropriations \nbill. The time from whenever the Senate convenes on Monday up until \n4:30 is subject to debate on the Iraqi amendments; indeed, if Senators \nwant to comment on the bill and such amendments as may be filed in \nconnection with the Graham issues.\n  I think we would urge our colleagues to try to contact our respective \noffices as to their needs for time to vote on these matters so the \nSenator from Michigan and I can try to accommodate them. But I also \nwish to remind colleagues that presumably the vote on the \nappropriations bill starts at 5:30, and by all measures should be \ncompleted sometime after 6. Then, subject to leadership, I would think \nthere would be time that evening, Monday evening, to continue votes for \nthose Senators whose travel plans otherwise do not enable them to get \nhere before 4:30. So the same framework for debate that can take place \nprior to 4:30 can take place after 6:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I agree with his \ncomments and I reinforce the importance of our colleagues notifying our \noffices and our cloakrooms if they desire to have time to speak on \nMonday afternoon so we can schedule that time. It would be very helpful \nfor us to be so informed as early as possible on Monday. I want to \nreiterate there are two groups of amendments we are talking about here \nthat will need to be debated Monday. One is the Iraqi amendment. The \nother one is the second-degree amendments to the Graham amendment. We \nare going to have to fit all that in on Monday afternoon, and possibly, \nas the Senator from Virginia mentions, after the vote on Monday. So it \nis important that our colleagues let us, our offices and our \ncloakrooms, know on Monday morning if they want time on either or both \nof those subjects. We will try to work the best we can and protect \neverybody's opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I pause momentarily.\n  Mr. President, I think our respective staffs can incorporate in the \nwrap-up document such that the Senator from Michigan and I will share \nequally the time before 4:30, after leadership, and in that way be able \nto work more effectively with our colleagues.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again thank all Senators. I thank our \nstaff. I thank the professional staff of the Senate, who in many ways \nhave made possible the completion of this bill. We are owing a debt of \ngratitude to many to get where we are.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are almost there. We are going to be there on Monday. \nWe thought we would be there tonight, but we will on Monday.\n  Mr. WARNER. In a way we are. We have charted the course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Fixed stars.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2485, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, we have some \ncleared amendments we can do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the previously agreed-to \namendment 2485 be modified with a technical correction. I send that \nmodification to the desk. I understand it has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2485), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 286, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1073.

Mr. President, I ask the previously agreed-to amendment \n1550 be modified and I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1550) as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PILOT PROJECT FOR CIVILIAN LINGUIST RESERVE CORPS.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Defense (referred to \n     in this section as the ``Secretary''), through the National \n     Security Education Program, shall conduct a 3-year pilot \n     project to establish the Civilian Linguist Reserve Corps, \n     which shall be composed of United States citizens with \n     advanced levels of proficiency in foreign languages who would \n     be available, upon request from the President, to perform any \n     services or duties with respect to such foreign languages in \n     the Federal Government as the President may require.\n       (b) Implementation.--In establishing the Civilian Linguist \n     Reserve Corps, the Secretary, after reviewing the findings \n     and recommendations contained in the report required under \n     section 325 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2003 (Public Law 107-306; 116 Stat. 2393), shall--\n       (1) identify several foreign languages that are critical \n     for the national security of the United States and the \n     relative priority of each such language;\n       (2) identify United States citizens with advanced levels of \n     proficiency in those foreign languages who would be available \n     to perform the services and duties referred to in subsection \n     (a);\n       (3) cooperate with other Federal agencies with national \n     security responsibilities to implement a procedure for \n     calling for the performance of the services and duties \n     referred to in subsection (a); and\n       (4) implement a call for the performance of such services \n     and duties.\n       (c) Contract Authority.--In establishing the Civilian \n     Linguist Reserve Corps, the Secretary may enter into \n     contracts with appropriate agencies or entities.\n       (d) Feasibility Study.--During the course of the pilot \n     project, the Secretary shall conduct a study of the best \n     practices in implementing the Civilian Linguist Reserve \n     Corps, including--\n       (1) administrative structure;\n       (2) languages to be offered;\n       (3) number of language specialists needed for each \n     language;\n       (4) Federal agencies who may need language services;\n       (5) compensation and other operating costs;\n       (6) certification standards and procedures;\n       (7) security clearances;\n       (8) skill maintenance and training; and\n       (9) the use of private contractors to supply language \n     specialists.\n       (e) Reports.--\n       (1) Evaluation reports.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter until the \n     expiration of the 3-year period beginning on such date of \n     enactment, the Secretary shall submit to Congress an \n     evaluation report on the pilot project conducted under this \n     section.\n       (B) Contents.--Each report required under subparagraph (A) \n     shall contain information on the operation of the pilot \n     project, the success of the pilot project in carrying out the \n     objectives of the establishment of a Civilian Linguist \n     Reserve Corps, and recommendations for the continuation or \n     expansion of the pilot project.\n       (2) Final report.--Not later than 6 months after the \n     completion of the pilot project, the Secretary shall submit \n     to Congress a final report summarizing the lessons learned, \n     best practices, and recommendations for full implementation \n     of the Civilian Linguist Reserve Corps.\n       (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated $3,100,000 for fiscal year 2006 to carry \n     out the pilot project under this section.\n       (g) Offset--The amounts authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 301(4) are hereby reduced by $3,100,000 from \n     operation and maintenance, Air Force.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand this also is technical?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. It was cleared on both sides. Has the \nvote been taken?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consent has been granted.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, noting that tomorrow is Veterans Day, I \nrise to discuss an amendment which will make it clear that returning \ncombat veterans of the National Guard and Reserve will receive the same \nconsideration as other combat veterans when applying for a Federal job.\n  I am offering this bipartisan amendment along with Senators Vitter, \nChambliss, Wyden, Landrieu, Schumer, Clinton and Dayton.\n  Since the time of the Civil War, veterans of the Armed Services have \nbeen given some degree of preference in the consideration process for \nemployment with the Federal Government. This usually takes the form of \nan additional 5 points added to the score received by a veteran on the \ntest they must take to qualify for the job. If the veteran is disabled, \nhe or she receives an additional 5 points for a total of 10 added \npoints. This program is known as ``Veterans Preference.''\n  The way the law reads now, veterans applying for a Federal job can \nreceive preferential consideration if they served on active duty during \na war in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been \nauthorized and have been separated from the Armed Forces under \nhonorable conditions.\n  Unfortunately, the term ``separated'' is not defined in the Veterans \nPreference law and this lack of clarity has had the practical effect of \ncausing some veterans, who saw combat as mobilized members of the Guard \nor Reserve, to be denied the veterans preference they had earned.\n  That is exactly what happened to an Army reservist from my own State \nof Illinois.\n  Earlier this year, I was contacted by a young woman serving in the \nArmy Reserve as a military police officer. Her name is Kylene Conlon. \nSince 9/11, Kylene has been mobilized twice. The first time she spent \nnearly a year in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The second time she spent a full \nyear in Iraq.\n  Upon her return she learned that the United States Marshals Service \nwas hiring. When she requested an application, she was informed that \nthe hiring program was open only to those eligible for Veterans \nPreference. She provided copies of her two different Department of \nDefense forms verifying her overseas service over two major \nmobilizations, yet she was told that that was not good enough for \nveterans preference. She was told that she had to have a discharge. But \nKylene did not have a discharge certificate, which she would receive \nafter ending military service because she had not quit the Army \nReserve. She had come home from Iraq and gone back to attending weekend \ndrills and annual training periods. She had two Department of Defense \nforms 214 which stated that her type of separation was a ``release from \nactive duty.'' To be given a discharge certificate, Kylene would have \nto quit the Army Reserve.\n  She was stunned. She could not believe that the Federal Government \nwould require her to quit the Army Reserve before being able to receive \nthe veterans preference she had earned. So, she came to my office for \nhelp.\n  I sent a letter to the Marshals Service in the Department of Justice \nto ask why Kylene Conlon was being denied veterans preference.\n  They wrote back. Here is what their letter said:\n\n       The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) administers the \n     veterans preference program for the Federal Government in \n     accordance with statute and regulation. Unfortunately, \n     service as a member of the Army Reserve does not qualify for \n     veterans preference. The OPM VetGuide states ``to receive \n     preference, a veteran must have been separated from active \n     duty in the Armed Forces with an honorable discharge.'' Ms. \n     Conlon has not been discharged from the Army.\n\n  Every word of that letter was 100 percent true. OPM administers the \nprogram according to the law. OPM's guide requires a discharge. \nReservists completing a mobilization and returning to part-time status \ndon't receive discharges. Therefore, reservists were being deemed \nineligible for Veterans Preference.\n  I knew right then that the law had to be changed.\n\n[[Page S12673]]\n\n  My staff checked into this and found that it was that vague word \n``separated'' in the current Veterans Preference law that was the \nproblem. Somebody could read that word and assume it means only \n``discharged'' and so they had.\n  That was not Congress's intent. Elsewhere in Federal law, rather than \nthe term ``separated,'' one finds the phrase ``discharged or \nreleased.'' That's a better phrase. It covers both those who end full-\ntime, active duty service completely with an honorable discharge as \nwell as reservists who are released after a tour of active duty and go \nback to reserve duty. Troops leaving the military altogether are given \na discharge. Reservists who are simply ending a period of active duty \nand reverting to their previous part-time reservist status are given a \nrelease from active duty.\n  The measure which I introduce today clarifies title 5 by replacing \nthe vague term ``separated'' with the clearer and more precise phrase \n``discharged or released.'' While this may seem a small change in \nwording, it will have an important effect. It will make it absolutely \nclear that a member of the National Guard or Reserve who serves \nhonorably in a war, campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal \nhas been authorized can receive full access to veterans preference in \nFederal hiring. We want these honorable veterans to receive this \npreference without any pressure or incentive whatsoever to terminate \ntheir valuable service in the reserve components of our Armed Forces.\n  This change in the law is merely a clarification to avoid future \nerrors of interpretation as have occurred in the past. It will have no \neffect on previous grants of veterans preference and it will in no way \nlimit or reduce future considerations for veterans preference \neligibility.\n  The measure is endorsed by the Reserve Officers Association. I am \nvery grateful to the managers of the Defense authorization bill for \nagreeing to accept this measure as an amendment. It is important and \ntimely legislation as we approach Veterans Day and honor all those who \nserve our Nation in uniform.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I support the extension of the Defense Department's \nprogram ensuring that its Federal contracting process in no way \nsupports or subsidizes the discrimination that has long been a problem \nin the contracting business. The extension of the program through \nSeptember 2009 is needed to help achieve that goal.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has learned a great deal about \nthe effects of discrimination in denying contracting opportunities for \nminority-owned businesses. The ugly reality is that contracting has \nlong been dominated by ``old-boy'' networks that make it very difficult \nfor African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans to \nparticipate fairly in these opportunities, or even obtain information \nabout them.\n  Years of congressional hearings have shown that minorities \nhistorically have been excluded from both public and private \nconstruction contracts in general, and from Federal defense contracts \nin particular. Since its adoption, the Defense Department program, \ncalled the 1207 Program, has helped level the playing field for \nminority contractors. But there is still more to do, as the additional \ninformation we have received since the program was last reauthorized \nmakes clear.\n  Ever since the program was first adopted in 1986, racial and ethnic \ndiscrimination--both overt and subtle--have continued to erect \nsignificant barriers to minority participation in Federal contracting. \nIn some cases, overt discrimination has prevented minority-owned \nbusinesses from obtaining needed loans and bonds. Prime contractors, \nunions, and suppliers of goods and materials have preferred to do \nbusiness with White contractors rather than with minority firms.\n  We have seen repeated reports of bid-shopping and of minority \nbusinesses being denied contracts despite submitting the lowest bid.\n  The Department's decision to award a growing number of defense \ncontracts noncompetitively has had the unfortunate effect of excluding \nminority-owned businesses from a significant number of contracting \nopportunities. No-bid contracts also hurt White-owned businesses, but \nthey disadvantage minority-owned firms in particular.\n  These problems affect a wide variety of areas in which the Department \noffers contracts, and the problems are detailed in many recent \ndisparity studies, including:\n\n       City of Dallas Availability and Disparity Study, Mason \n     Tillman Associates, Ltd. (2002); City of Cincinnati Disparity \n     Study, Griffin & Strong, P.C. (2002); Ohio Multi-\n     Jurisdictional Disparity Studies, Mason Tillman Associates, \n     Ltd. (2003); Procurement Disparity Study of the Commonwealth \n     of Virginia, MGT of America, Inc. (2004); Alameda County \n     Availability Study, Mason Tillman Associates (2004); City of \n     New York Disparity Study, Mason Tillman Associates, Ltd. \n     (2005).\n\n  We are also mindful that the data contained in the Department of \nCommerce benchmark study supports the need for efforts to improve \ncontracting opportunities for minority-owned businesses.\n  The 1207 Program helps to correct these problems of discrimination \nwithout imposing an undue burden on White-owned businesses. Small \nbusinesses owned by White contractors are eligible to receive the \nbenefits of the program if they are socially or economically \ndisadvantaged.\n  All of us benefit when recipients of Federal opportunities reflect \nAmerica's diversity, and I am proud to support the reauthorization of \nthe 1207 Program.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague Chairman \nCraig, for offering this amendment to correct current law, which \npermits capital offenders to be buried in a national cemetery with full \nmilitary funeral honors. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nthis amendment, which would deny capital offenders a hero's funeral.\n  I believe that the congressional intent was crystal clear on this \nissue when Congress passed two laws denying capital offenders \neligibility for burial in a national cemetery and certain funeral \nbenefits in 1997 and 2002. However, a loophole remains and is \nvulnerable to misapplication. It is unfortunate that it took the \nmistaken internment of double murderer Russell Wayne Wagner in \nArlington National Cemetery earlier this summer to shed light on this \negregious loophole.\n  I commend Chairman Craig's immediate response to this oversight by \nquickly convening a hearing to study how big this loophole really is. \nAccording to a study of the law conducted by the Congressional Research \nService, CRS, because Wagner's double life sentences carried the \npossibility of parole, he was technically eligible for burial in a \nnational cemetery. Upon further study, it was determined that this same \nparole loophole also would apply to Dennis Rader, the serial killer who \nterrorized Kansans for over three decades.\n  In Kansas, we take honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice \nvery seriously. Entire towns make their way in the funeral procession \nof the hometown hero to pay their respects and say a quiet prayer as he \nor she is laid to rest. This respect was recently demonstrated in South \nHaven, KS, as the community gathered en mass to honor Sgt. Evan Parker, \nwho died of wounds from a bomb attack during Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nNeighbors and fellow members of the community poured out their front \ndoors to silently watch the funeral procession and 150 members of the \nAmerican Legion convened to erect a barrier to block protesters from \ninterrupting the mourners. This is what small town America does to \nhonor those who gave all.\n  It is unconscionable that Dennis Rader, BTK for short, as he referred \nto himself, who brutally bound, tortured, and killed 10 innocent \nvictims would be granted a hero's funeral. A criminal who is facing 10 \nlife sentences and no less than 175 years of prison could be honored \namong our Nation's heros under the law as it stands today because his \nsentence included the phrase ``with parole.'' The idea that the brave \nmen and women of our Nation's military forces like SGT Evan Parker \ncould be memorialized and laid to rest in the same sacred ground as the \nBTK Killer is outrageous and simply wrong.\n  If current law cannot prevent this brutal murderer from internment in \na national cemetery or with military funeral honors, then the law needs \nto be fixed. This amendment closes the parole loophole by tying \neligibility for\n\n[[Page S12674]]\n\nburial in a national cemetery and military funeral honors to the \nunderlying action of the capital offender rather than to the sentence, \nwhich can vary from State to State.\n  I understand that Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin are \nincluding this amendment as a part of a broader manager's amendment. I \nappreciate the inclusion of this important legislation that ultimately \nprotects the honor and memory of our Nation's heros and the hallowed \nground in which they rest.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my concern over \napparent discrepancies between the administration's rhetoric with \nrespect to our treatment of detainees, and the clear reality of the \nsituation.\n  We all agree, I hope, that individuals in the custody of the United \nStates must be treated humanely. We certainly agree that under no \ncircumstances must American military and government personnel engage in \ntorture. That is why we ratified the United Nations Convention Against \nTorture in 1994.\n  And that is why Senator McCain's provision prohibiting the use of \n``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment'', and adopting the Army Field \nManual as the standard for interrogation procedures passed the Senate \nas part of the Defense appropriations bill by a 90 to 9 vote on October \n5. It was also unanimously adopted to be included in this Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Senator McCain's amendment simply makes it clear that the Convention \nAgainst Torture applies without geographical limitation.\n  It states that conduct that is unacceptable on U.S. soil is also \nunacceptable in Guantanamo Bay, in Abu Ghraib, or anywhere else the \nUnited States government may be holding detainees.\n  President Bush has repeatedly stated that captives are to be treated \nhumanely, and just this week he reiterated his policy that:\n\n       In this effort, any activity we conduct, is within the law. \n     We don't torture.\n\n  And yet, the administration, led by Vice President Cheney, has been \nmaking a great effort to lobby Members of Congress to alter the McCain \nprovision by exempting the CIA and members of the intelligence \ncommunity from its prohibition on torture.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, the language he circulated on \nOctober 20th proposes that:\n  ``Subsection (a)''--that is, the prohibition against cruel, inhuman \nor degrading treatment or punishment --``shall not apply with respect \nto clandestine counterterrorism operations conducted abroad, with \nrespect to terrorists who are not citizens of the United States, that \nare carried out by and element of the United States Government other \nthan the Department of Defense and are consistent with the Constitution \nand laws of the United States and treaties to which the United States \nis a party, if the President determines that such operations are vital \nto the protection of the United States or its citizens from terrorist \nattack.''\n  Why? The President has stated that it is not his policy to torture. \nWe all know the catastrophic effects that even the appearance of \nimpropriety in this area has on the image of the United States abroad. \nWe know the irreparable harm that reports of abuse and secret detention \ncenters do to our war effort. And, we know that torture does not \nproduce good and effective intelligence. So why fuel that fire by \nenacting a specific exemption to our long-standing policy of humane \ntreatment?\n  Earlier this month, the Washington Post reported that the CIA has \nbeen ``hiding and interrogating'' its most valuable prisoners at so-\ncalled ``black sites'' at several locations in Eastern Europe and Asia.\n  If this is true, it would allow the intelligence community to engage \nin ``unconventional'' interrogation procedures at secret locations \noutside of Congressional oversight or military directives on the \ntreatment of prisoners.\n  Earlier this week, I wrote a letter to the chairman and vice chairman \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee requesting that the committee \nconduct hearings into these allegations that the CIA is holding \nprisoners in ``black sites'' around the world.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee has jurisdiction over the entire \nintelligence community. And therefore, it is critical that it have \naccess to all information and material related to these disturbing \nallegations.\n  Moreover, I believe that the committee must do a better job with its \noversight responsibilities, particularly as they relate to detention, \ninterrogation, and rendition activities by our intelligence agencies.\n  The fact is that our policy to date with respect to detainees has \nbeen confused, and that that confusion has led to disturbing \nallegations of abuse and even torture.\n  The Senate has already acted to clarify the rules by passing the \nMcCain amendment. I have heard it argued that this will somehow ``tie \nthe hands'' of the President in his prosecution of the war, but I \nstrongly disagree.\n  In the first place, the President himself insists that detainees \nshould be treated humanely. We are simply acting to codify his policy.\n  Secondly, the Constitution is perfectly clear with regard to the \nauthority for regulating the United States military: that authority \nlies with the Congress.\n  Some claim that the Founding Fathers intended the executive branch to \nhave a free hand in prosecuting this Nation's wars.\n  But their consideration and deliberation on this issue resulted in \nArticle VII, Section 8 of the Constitution, which states that Congress \nshall have the power to ``make Rules concerning Captures on Land and \nWater,'' and also ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of \nthe land and naval Forces.''\n  It is clear that this administration has been inconsistent and \nmistake-prone in regulating the Armed Forces with respect to the \ntreatment of detainees.\n  There is the case of Captain Ian Fishback of the 82nd Airborne \nDivision, who attempted for 17 months to determine what regulations \nwere in force.\n  He determined that, years after President Bush had declared that all \nprisoners, regardless of their Geneva status, were to be treated \n``humanely,'' the definition of what constituted humane treatment was \nstill being left to individual commanders.\n  He reports:\n\n       We've got people with different views of what ``humane'' \n     means and there's no Army statement that says ``this is the \n     standard for humane treatment for prisoners to Army \n     officers.'' Army officers are left to come up with their own \n     definition of humane treatment.\n\n  The results of this lapse are well documented. Even the Pentagon's \nown reports are highly critical:\n  The Taguba Report found ``numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant, \nand wanton criminal abuses,'' which the report described as \n``systemic.''\n  Along the same lines, the Mikolashek Report examined 94 cases of \nconfirmed abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, and found that ``ambiguous \nguidance from command on the treatment of detainees'' was a \ncontributing factor.\n  Further, the Fay-Jones Report implicated 35 soldiers, including the \ntop two military intelligence officers at Abu Ghraib prison, in 44 \ncases of abuse.\n  So the problem goes far beyond a ``few, isolated bad apples.'' \nDecent, hardworking American soldiers simply do not know how they may \nor may not treat their captives.\n  I note that on Tuesday, the Department of Defense released a new \ndirective banning the use of unmuzzled dogs in interrogations, or to \nharass or intimidate prisoners. I welcome this directive, but it is too \nlittle, too late. The ban comes after dozens of confirmed reports of \nsoldiers using dogs to intimidate inmates of Abu Ghraib, and it is \nlimited in scope and details.\n  The McCain amendment would give a clear baseline standard of human \nrights, which all Americans will always recognize--the rights which our \nFounders believed were inalienable rights; the rights they chose to \nenshrine in our Constitution.\n  It is not for the Vice President, or anyone else for that matter, to \ncircumvent those rights in the name of fighting terrorism.\n  This week the White House Press Secretary, Scott McClellan, tried to \njustify the exemption, saying, ``You're talking about people like \nKhalid Shaykh Muhammad; people like Abu Zubaydah.''\n  I agree that these are terrible men, but we must also consider men \nlike Mr.\n\n[[Page S12675]]\n\nDilawar, an innocent taxi driver who was beaten to death in \nAfghanistan.\n  We are talking about thousands of innocent Iraqis rounded up in \nsweeping neighborhood raids and systematically abused.\n  And we are talking about their friends and families, and an entire \ngeneration of young people around the world who are watching and \njudging the actions of the United States.\n  If we fail, in their eyes, to live up to our ideals, if the promise \nof America is reduced to self-serving hypocrisy, then I fear we will \nbreed more terrorists than we can ever stop.\n  In fact, the scale of the problem is such that the narrowly-focused \nPentagon reports do not provide us an adequate picture.\n  In conclusion, let me state this--it is essential that we answer \nthese three fundamental questions:\n  Is our current policy legal?\n  Is it moral?\n  And does it work?\n  From my work on this issue in the Judiciary Committee and \nIntelligence Committee, I fear the answer to all three is ``No.''\n  I believe that Congress did not intend to permit torture abroad when \nit ratified the Convention Against Torture. The overwhelming support \nenjoyed by Mr. McCain's amendment is evidence of that.\n  Furthermore, I do not believe that violating fundamental human rights \nis ever justified.\n  There are some absolutes in this world, and some activities that the \nUnited States simply cannot condone.\n  I am convinced that our detainee policy has been a costly failure. \nFar from making us safer, the aggressive interrogation of terror \nsuspects has served to breed more terrorists, and to make us more \nvulnerable to attack.\n  Should Congress refuse to statutorily codify the legal and humane \ntreatment of prisoners, we risk endangering those Americans who become \nprisoners themselves.\n  We must set an honorable example for the entire international \ncommunity; to do otherwise would be a betrayal of the values we hold \ndear.\n  American values, such as the humane treatment of detainees, are truly \nat the very core of this debate.\n  We must not fail--America's future will rest on it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2519\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment introduced by \nSenator Levin and several colleagues that formulates our military \nstrategy and foreign policy in Iraq.\n  We need clear, defined benchmarks that lay out how and when we can \nbegin a structured downsizing of the 160,000 Americans currently \nserving in Iraq.\n  Increasingly, Americans are demanding answers about how we intend to \ntransition sovereign control of Iraq to the newly elected government.\n  If we do not heed the call of the American people, popular support \nfor this war will continue to wane.\n  We must have a well-reasoned approach that will allow our Armed \nForces to remove themselves from the constant crossfire between Sunnis \nand Shia.\n  As we look forward, I believe the parliamentary election on Dec. 15 \nrepresents one such opportunity.\n  For the first time in history, the Iraqi people will have \ndemocratically elected their permanent leaders to serve full 4-year \nterms. Their constitution, problematic as it may be, has been adopted, \nand it is time for Iraqis to take greater control.\n  A growing perception is that U.S. military forces buttress the \nShiites. As a result, we pay a high cost, in lives lost and casualties.\n  We need to change course to remove ourselves from being the literal \nand figurative target of Sunni enmity.\n  Frankly, this battle cannot be won militarily by American forces.\n  A structured downsizing of our presence in Iraq will not only take \nour service men and women out of harm's way, but it will also force \nIraq's religious and political leaders to confront the insurgency and \nfind a balance of power acceptable to Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds.\n  The first and primary impetus for transitioning our forces will be a \nbetter trained Iraqi Security Force.\n  Ultimately, the Iraqis will have to defend themselves and confront \nthe insurgency, both militarily and politically. The question is when.\n  Training of the Iraqi Security Forces has been too slow, and the \nadministration has been less than forthright about the capabilities of \nthe Iraqi troops on the ground.\n  In the interim period ahead, U.S. forces may continue to have a \nsignificant role to play, especially in the areas of training and \nrebuilding infrastructure. But this requires a change of focus for \nAmerican troops from leading combat missions to buttressing and backing \nIraqis as they seek to quell the insurgency and growing violence.\n  For starters, we need to increase the number of U.S. military \npersonnel providing initial training to the Iraqi forces from the \ncurrent 1,200. This number is frankly inadequate, and raises questions \nabout our military's priorities in Iraq.\n  This does not necessarily mean that all Iraqi forces will be trained \nto the level of U.S. forces--that is unlikely--but the real benchmark \nis for Iraqi units to have a basic level of training and equipment to \nsafeguard their towns, cities and communities.\n  The Pentagon recently estimated that an additional 125,000 Iraqi \nsecurity personnel will be needed to bring total endstrength to \n325,000.\n  If it is going to take a force of 325,000 Iraqis, then it is \nincumbent upon the U.S. military to prioritize this training and put \nenhanced efforts into recruiting qualified individuals to serve.\n  It is only fair to our service men and women, and to their families, \nif we put every effort into properly training Iraqis so that American \ntroops can come home as soon as possible.\n  America needs to change course, reassess its mission in light of this \nescalating insurgency, place more responsibility on Iraq for a \nnegotiated settlement, and begin a structured drawdown of American \nforces.\n  This structured drawdown must come in the form of a consistent, \nplanned strategy. This amendment uses the word ``redeployment,'' which \nI frankly believe is confusing.\n  Our military leaders must establish a framework for a careful, \ncautious removal of our troops from Iraq, in conjunction with the \nrising number of trained Iraqis.\n  This might mean the removal of 10,000 American troops for every \n20,000 trained Iraqis, or a similar but concrete formula.\n  Certainly, we should prioritize what troops are most needed in the \ntraining process and begin to drawdown our endstrength in other areas.\n  This amendment rightly requires the President to report regularly on \nAmerican policy in regards to Iraq and our military operations there.\n  The administration needs to define and lay out an endgame.\n  The Levin provision ensures that Congress will be receiving regular \nupdates on the administration's strategy in Iraq, and as it must be \nunclassified, will provide the American people the opportunity to see \nwhether there truly is a plan for success.\n  Again, I believe it is time to reevaluate our policy and strategies \nin Iraq.\n  We have lost over 2,000 American troops, and tens of thousands of \nIraqis have died.\n  Americans are tired of hearing daily about the chaos and violence \nthat has beset Iraq. With American soldiers and scores of Iraqi \ncivilians dying every day, there has to be a better course.\n  In my view, it is clear that now is the time to consider a \ncomprehensive plan for the structured downsizing of our mission, while \nwe greatly increase the emphasis on training Iraqis to protect \nthemselves.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I want to commend my \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee for taking a step forward to \nhelp our soldiers who are wounded, and removed from the combat zone for \nmedical treatment.\n  Under current law, when soldiers are removed from a combat zone, even \nif it is for a severe wound, they lose all of their special duty pay, \nwhich for some enlisted soldiers can reduce their pay by half. It does \nnot seem right to cut a soldier's pay at the time of an injury when \nthat soldier and his family will face personal and financial hardships. \nFor example, if a young soldier is sent to Walter Reed Hospital to \nrecover, it is often important to have family nearby to assist in \nrecovery. But that often means a young wife or husband must leave their \nhome and job to help the\n\n[[Page S12676]]\n\nwounded soldier. They may face new temporary housing costs or added \nexpenses just to live nearby and support in the soldier's recovery.\n  Thanks to action in our Armed Services Committee, there is a \nprovision to continue some of the specialty pays for imminent danger \nfor our wounded soldiers as long as they are in the hospital. The House \nDefense authorization includes a similar provision that creates a new \npay provision specifically for rehabilitation from combat-related \ninjuries.\n  I support such provisions, and in fact, I introduced S. 461, the \nCrosby-Puller Combat Wounds Compensation Act, to maintain full pay for \nsoldiers during recovery. I was proud to have Senators Kennedy, \nClinton, and Salazar as cosponsors.\n  My commitment to this legislation was based on hearing the plight of \nwounded soldiers. My West Virginia caseworkers have heard from many \nsoldiers and families who are struggling. While everyone is tragically \naware of the more than 2,000 soldiers, including 15 West Virginians, \nwho have lost their lives, we do not hear as much about our wounded \nsoldiers.\n  Current estimates are that 16,220 soldiers have been wounded in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, and 104 are West Virginians. Thanks to better medical \ncare and better equipment, when it is available, our soldiers are \nsurviving devastating attacks, but too often at high costs including \nthe loss of limbs. Such soldiers face long recoveries, and they need \ntheir families nearby to support them. But there are extra costs for \nfamilies at this time, and we should not be substantially reducing the \npay of our wounded heroes.\n  As the conference committee is appointed and we begin the hard work \nof resolving the differences between these two bills, I hope that we \nwill keep in mind the struggles and financial hardships of our wounded \nsoldiers and their families. We need to provide them with adequate pay \nin honor of their distinguished service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12676-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MR. HENRY OSCAR WHITLOW\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I today honor the life of a prominent \nKentuckian, Mr. Henry Oscar Whitlow, and to pay tribute to the numerous \ncontributions he made to his community and to the Commonwealth of \nKentucky.\n  A native of Ballard County, KY, Mr. Whitlow spent his professional \nlife practicing law in Paducah. In addition to being a respected \nattorney, he was also an active member of the Broadway United Methodist \nChurch, and served as President of the Paducah Area Chamber of \nCommerce, the Paducah Jaycees, and the Paducah Rotary Club.\n  People like Henry Whitlow are what make Kentucky such a special \nplace. I extend my condolences to his wife of 55 years, Elizabeth Ann \nClement Whitlow, his son Mark Whitlow, his daughter Rebecca Gutherie, \nand all those that mourn the passing of this great man.\n  Earlier this week the Paducah Sun marked the passing of this \ncommunity icon in a piece titled, ``Whitlow remembered for community \ncontributions.'' I ask that the full article be printed in the Record \nand that the entire Senate join me in paying our respect to this \nbeloved Kentuckian.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Paducah Sun, Nov. 8, 2005]\n\n             Whitlow Remembered for Community Contributions\n\n                          (By Bill Bartleman)\n\n       Henry Oscar Whitlow was remembered Monday as soft-spoken \n     and unassuming, but strong and powerful in his contribution \n     to the community and the legal profession.\n       Whitlow, 91, died at 5:42 a.m. Monday at Lourdes hospital. \n     His son, Mark Whitlow, said he had suffered from Alzheimer's \n     and had been in a nursing home since last year.\n       Visitation will be held at the Milner and Orr Funeral Home \n     of Paducah from 4 to 7 p.m. Thursday. Services will be at \n     Broadway United Methodist Church in Paducah at 1:30 p.m. \n     Friday followed by burial in Mount Kenton Cemetery.\n       Whitlow, a native of Monkey's Eyebrow in Ballard County, \n     began practicing law in Paducah in 1937 with the Waller and \n     Threlkeld law firm. He eventually became a partner and the \n     firm is now known as Whitlow Roberts Houston and Straub. It \n     is one of Paducah's largest and most prestigious firms.\n       He was a member of Broadway United Methodist Church for \n     almost 70 years and held every leadership position in the \n     church. He also was a lay speaker and a Sunday School \n     teacher.\n       He also was active in civic affairs and served as president \n     of what is now the Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce, the \n     Paducah Rotary Club, the Paducah Jaycees and many other \n     organizations.\n       Senior U.S. District Judge Edward H. Johnstone described \n     Whitlow as a leader with humility, a litigator with \n     compassion and a scholar with the common touch.\n       ``He was a great man,'' Johnstone said. ``The thing that \n     distinguished him from present-day lawyers is that he built \n     his reputation by what he did, not how much he advertised or \n     blew his own horn. His work is what sold him to the public. \n     He never sought glory or credit. He was unselfish and always \n     a perfect gentleman.''\n       U.S. District Judge Thomas Russell said Whitlow had a \n     profound effect on those around him. Russell was associated \n     with Whitlow's firm for almost 25 years.\n       Without Whitlow as a mentor, Russell said he would have \n     never risen to the federal judgeship. ``You can learn the \n     practice of law from a lot of people, but he taught me what \n     it takes to represent people--to feel their sorrow, their \n     joys and their concerns.''\n       Whitlow served as the attorney for the Paducah Board of \n     Education for more than 40 years. Bill Black Jr., a long-time \n     board member, said Whitlow viewed his work with the board as \n     public service. ``The fees he charged were not what he could \n     get investing his time in other legal work,'' Black said.\n       He said Whitlow never tried to influence board decisions \n     and only got involved when he thought the board was straying \n     in the wrong legal direction.\n       ``He listened very carefully and said very little,'' Black \n     said. ``But when he did speak, we always knew it was our time \n     to listen to his wisdom and take his advice.''\n       Black noted that Whitlow was the board attorney in 1956 \n     when the city schools were integrated. He said Whitlow's \n     legal advice undoubtedly played an important role in the \n     successful and peaceful integration that had been mandated by \n     the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       ``Many schools in the South started integrating in the 1st \n     grade and did it over 12 years,'' Black said. ``Paducah \n     allowed any African American who wanted to attended a \n     previously all-white school to do it in the first year.''\n       Away from the legal profession, Russell said Whitlow set an \n     example of how a person should be a good citizen. In addition \n     to being a church leader, Russell said Whitlow was active in \n     the Boy Scouts, charitable work ``and was past president of \n     the Rotary Club and every other civic organization that he \n     belonged to. ``In all that he ever did, he didn't seek any \n     kind of recognition.''\n       Mark Whitlow, also an attorney, said his father was an \n     inspiration.\n       ``We all love our fathers,'' Whitlow said. ``But he also \n     was an outstanding mentor in terms of being a scholar of the \n     law and in his love for the community and public service. He \n     set a good example for all of us.''\n       Fred Paxton, chairman of the board of Paxton Media which \n     owns the Paducah Sun, said Whitlow's slight frame and soft \n     voice were deceiving.\n       ``He was a very rugged individual and very, very strong,'' \n     Paxton said. ``If you exchange a hand shake with him, you \n     knew that. He also had a delightful sense of humor. It was \n     very low key and subtle, but rich.''\n       In 1993 Whitlow was honored as the Kentucky Bar \n     Association's ``Lawyer of the Year.''\n       He was humbled by the honor. ``It was like a bolt out of \n     the blue,'' he told the Paducah Sun. ``I still don't know how \n     the lightning happened to strike me. I am just an old country \n     boy who came up in the Depression.''\n       In addition to his son, Whitlow is survived by his wife of \n     55 years, Elizabeth Ann Clement Whitlow; a daughter, Rebecca \n     Gutherie of Maryland; a sister, Mildred Hughes of Tucson, \n     Ariz., and two grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12676-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12676-S12677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MR. EVERETT RAINS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I pay tribute to a great leader in \npublic service, Mr. Everett Rains. Everett served as county clerk in \nWhitley County, KY, for 24 years. I first met him when I started my \npolitical career in Kentucky, more than two decades ago. Everett was \nknown for his numerous acts of kindness and generosity. He inspired \nothers to serve, including his own nephew Tom Rains, who succeeded him \nas Whitley County clerk.\n  Last month, Everett passed away at the age of 88. He spent his career \nserving the people of Whitley County, and will be missed by all who \nknew and loved him.\n  On October 26, 2005, The Williamsburg News Journal published an \narticle highlighting Everett's contributions, caring nature, and strong \ncharacter. I ask that the full article be printed in the Record and \nthat the entire Senate join me in paying our respect to this beloved \nKentuckian.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12677]]\n\n\n\n          [From the Williamsburg News Journal, Oct. 26, 2005]\n\n    Family, Friends Have Fond Memories of Rains, Former County Clerk\n\n                            (By Mark White)\n\n       Everett Rains will undoubtedly go down in history as one of \n     the most successful politicians in Whitley County history, \n     but his nephew, current Whitley County Clerk Tom Rains, says \n     he will remember Everett more as a generous man that always \n     tried to help people.\n       ``Many times at the Corbin hospital we would go visit the \n     sick men, who were his friends. If the men didn't have a pair \n     of socks on, that really bothered him the most,'' Rains said \n     Monday afternoon, unsuccessfully trying to choke back tears. \n     ``He would pull his socks off and give them to them. He would \n     leave and go home without any socks on. I've never seen \n     anybody do that before in my life; that was how generous he \n     was.''\n       Everett Rains, who served as Whitley County Clerk for 24 \n     years, passed away Saturday afternoon at the Oak Tree \n     Hospital in Corbin at the age of 88.\n       ``He was a tremendous gentleman. They called him the best \n     politician in Whitley County, but it all came from his heart. \n     Everything came out of Everett's heart. He did things for \n     people out of his heart, not because he was county clerk. He \n     was just that type of person,'' said Tom Rains, who worked \n     for Everett for eight years before succeeding him as county \n     clerk. ``He treasured this office. He was a good county \n     clerk.''\n       Everett Rains began his career in politics serving one term \n     as Whitley County sheriff from 1954 through 1957. At the \n     time, sheriffs couldn't succeed themselves, and Rains made a \n     failed bid for county clerk in 1957 against incumbent Ernie \n     Hickey. He ran again for county clerk in 1961, and was \n     elected to the first of his six terms in office. Rains was \n     unopposed in his bid for re-election during three of his six \n     terms, and left office in 1985. Kay Schwartz, who has worked \n     in the county clerk's office for nearly 31 years and who \n     worked for Everett Rains for 11 years until he left office, \n     described her former boss as an easygoing person, who never \n     raised his voice to any workers.\n       ``He would always tell us in a kind way how things needed \n     to be done, or what he needed done. He never did anything to \n     humiliate you. He always wanted to help you,'' she noted.\n       ``He was a very good man. He was always kind to people. It \n     didn't matter if they came in mad, they never left mad. He \n     always calmed them down, and took care of their needs. It \n     didn't matter what they needed, he always tried to help \n     them,'' Schwartz said. ``Even if he knew somebody was against \n     him, he was kind to them when they came in. He shook their \n     hand, and he helped them. It didn't matter to him. He was a \n     man that would turn the other cheek. He was always good to \n     people.''\n       Tom Rains said some of his fondest memories as a child were \n     of he and his twin brother riding around with Everett as he \n     traveled the county buying and selling cattle.\n       ``We used to come down and sit on the sheriff's counter. \n     While he was working we used to get to stay a few hours at \n     the courthouse. It was the biggest treat ever. He was a \n     special person, who made you feel so good,'' Tom Rains said.\n       Everett Rains and his wife of 46 years, Delois, never had \n     any children. The couple didn't marry until they were 42 \n     years old, Tom Rains noted. Still, the couple had a large \n     family, including seven nephews and five nieces.\n       Everett and Delois attended 73 birthday parties for their \n     great-nephews and nieces in Tom Rains' family, only missing \n     one birthday party due to illness.\n       Tom Rains noted that Everett had a great love for children, \n     period. ``There is probably not anyone in this county that \n     Everett Rains didn't buy a bottle of soda pop for when he was \n     young. Young boys would run to the county store when they saw \n     Everett coming down the road because they knew Everett would \n     buy them a pop. Every child everywhere he went, he would give \n     them a quarter and in later years he would give a dollar to \n     every child he saw. He was really so generous,'' Tom Rains \n     said.\n       In addition to being a politician, Rains was also an active \n     farmer, who raised crops and cattle on his farm near Dal Road \n     until last year.\n       ``He had a real closeness to all the farmers in Whitley \n     County,'' Tom Rains noted Monday. ``Back in the '40s, '50s \n     and '60s, everyone had a milk cow; in Whitley County that was \n     the most valuable thing on your place. Everett would loan \n     people milk cows. So many people came to me today, and said, \n     'I remember when your uncle brought us a milk cow.' He didn't \n     ask nothing.''\n       Rains said about a year ago, Everett suffered a bump on his \n     head that required surgery in Lexington for internal bleeding \n     in his brain. After the stint in the hospital, he developed \n     lung problems, and had suffered from pneumonia for the past \n     month until he passed away Saturday.\n       Funeral services were scheduled for 2 p.m. today at the \n     Ellison Funeral Home Chapel with the Rev. Bill Mitchell \n     officiating. He will be buried at the Highland Park Cemetery \n     in the Davis Addition.\n       The Whitley County Courthouse closed at noon Wednesday for \n     the funeral, and remained closed for the remainder of the \n     day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12677-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VALARIE YOUNG--2005 MILKEN FAMILY FOUNDATION NATIONAL EDUCATOR AWARD \n                                 WINNER\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nsubmitted by Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Feingold, and myself on the \n10th anniversary of Ken Saro-Wiwa's death. On November 10, 1995, a \nterrible injustice occurred when Mr. Saro-Wiwa and eight of his \ncountrymen were hanged by Sani Abacha's regime in Nigeria. While we \ncannot undo that tragedy, we must never forget it.\n  Mr. Saro-Wiwa led the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, \ndedicated to defending the rights of his fellow Ogoni in the Niger \nDelta through nonviolent means. Over the course of his life, he had \ndozens of opportunities to take a different path, to stop speaking out, \nto let someone else intervene. Instead, he risked everything, over and \nover again, to call the world's attention to suffering and injustice, \nto demand action. In May 1994, Abacha responded by imprisoning Mr. \nSaro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni men, the Ogoni Nine, and unjustly \naccusing them of murder.\n  Ten years ago on this day, Mr. Saro-Wiwa is said to have told his \nexecutioners: ``Lord, take my soul, but the struggle continues.''\n  Sadly, the struggle has indeed continued for the Ogoni people, whose \nstandard of living is among the lowest in the world, and whose oil rich \nland remains severely polluted. The names of the Ogoni Nine have yet to \nbe cleared, and they remain convicted of the crime for which they were \nunfairly tried and hanged.\n  This resolution acknowledges not only the tremendous legacy left by \nKen Saro-Wiwa, but also the battles that remain to be fought in the \nNiger Delta and beyond. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort \nto honor his memory, his vision, and his struggle which continues \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12679-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LABOR-HHS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                 Enhanced Study and Exchange Activities\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I want to bring the attention of my \ncolleague from Kentucky to a provision Senator Bingaman and I offered \nto the Labor-HHS appropriations bill regarding a strategic plan for \nenhancing access of legitimate foreign students, scholars, scientists, \nand exchange visitors in the United States for study and exchange \nactivates. Since September 11, restrictive visa policies and negative \nperceptions of the United States have led to a drastic decline in the \nnumber of foreign students studying in the United States, a development \nwhich has a negative consequences for both American foreign policy and \neconomic competitiveness. A strategy is needed to pro-actively counter \nnegative perceptions about America as unwelcoming to foreign students, \nand to enable us to successfully compete with places like the EU, the \nUK, and Australia, which have developed strategies to recruit the \nworld's best and brightest. In my amendment to the Labor-HHS bill, I \ninitially requested the Secretary of Education, in consultation with \nthe Secretaries of State, Commerce, Homeland Security and Energy and \nothers, to prepare this plan.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am aware of this provision and have been alerted by \nthe State Department that they would prefer that the Secretary of State \ntake the lead in coordinating this strategic plan, given Secretary \nRice's jurisdiction over this matter. Had this provision been offered \nto the fiscal year 2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, I can \nassure my friend that it would have been included as a requirement for \nthe State Department to fulfill.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I, too, have been informed of the State Department's \njurisdictional concern. Given that this issue is more appropriate to \nthe Foreign Operations bill, I wonder if my friend from Kentucky will \nwork with me and the State Department to ensure that this provision is \nfulfilled, specifically that within 180 days of enactment of the \nforeign aid bill the Department provide the relevant congressional \ncommittees with a report detailing this strategic plan, in consultation \nwith the Departments of Education, Commerce, Homeland Security, and \nEnergy, as well as institutions and organizations involved in \ninternational education. The strategy should seek to use innovative \nmedia like the Internet to develop a marketing strategy. It should also \ninclude policy recommendations for streamlining the procedures related \nto international student access.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My staff has already discussed this matter with the \nState Department and they have committed to providing such a plan \nwithin that timeframe.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I thank the chairman of the State, Foreign Operations, \nand Related Programs Subcommittee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12679-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I proudly join as a cosponsor of Senator \nObama's Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of \n2005. This important legislation will protect voters from the deceptive \npractices that aimed to keep them from the polls on election day.\n  Free and fair elections are the foundation of our democracy--a \ndemocracy built on the unassailable principle that every single \nAmerican should have an equal say in their government. No American \nshould ever approach their polling place in fear. No American should \never worry that they will somehow be penalized for exercising their \nfundamental right to vote. No American should ever be tricked into \nthinking they do not have the right to vote.\n  The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevent Act takes \ngreat strides towards ensuring that no American will ever be denied the \nright to vote. It both criminalizes deceptive practices and provides \naffected individuals with a private right of action. It prevents the \nnegative effects of deceptive practices by ensuring voters get accurate \nelection information. It also requires the Attorney General to report \nallegations of deceptive practices, the actions taken to correct them, \nand any prosecutions resulting from those allegations.\n  We have worked hard to bring fair and free elections to people around \nthe word-including the people of Iraq and Afghanistan. We must do \neverything in our power to ensure that our own elections are at least \nas fair and as free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12679-4", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12679-S12680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN HARRIS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory \nof Paula Yeager, a distinguished Hoosier and executive director of the \nIndiana Wildlife Federation, who passed away yesterday following a 7-\nyear battle with cancer. Over the years, I have valued Paula counsel \nand advocacy on behalf of conservation in Indiana.\n  After studying business at the University of Nebraska, Paula began a \ncareer as a travel agent. Eventually, this career brought her into \nclose contact with John Denver, a singer who shared Paula's respect for \nthe importance of nature and dedication to wildlife conservation. The \ntwo became close friends and their friendship inspired Paula to use her \nremarkable talents to make a difference in conservation.\n  This dedication led Paula to pursue an opportunity as executive \ndirector of the Indiana Wildlife Federation. In that role, she \nreinvigorated the organization as she worked with like-minded groups to \nadvance initiatives and become effectively engaged in the political \nprocess at both the State and Federal level.\n  Paula's efforts have been recognized across Indiana. She has twice \nbeen recognized with the President Award from the Indiana Wildlife \nFederation and was named Conservationist of the Year in 2001 by the \nIndiana Department of Natural Resources.\n  While I know that this is a difficult time for Paula's family and \nmany friends, my thoughts are with her husband John and their two \nchildren Stephanie and Corey as they remember her life of \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12680-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12680-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12680-4", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 9:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nto Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 2490.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 57 Rolfe Square in Cranston, Rhode Island, shall be \nknown and designated as the ``Holly A. Charette Post Office''; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Rhode \nIsland's brave soldiers, Lance Corporal Holly A. Charette, who was \nkilled in Iraq on June 23, 2005. In honor of her sacrifice, I am \nintroducing a bill, along with Senator Chafee, to name the post office \nat 57 Rolfe Square in Cranston, RI, the ``Holly A. Charette Post \nOffice.''\n  Twenty-one year old Holly Charette died when a suicide bomber in \nFallujah attacked the military convoy in which she was riding. This was \nthe deadliest attack on women in the U.S. military since the start of \noperations in Iraq, and yet another example of the violence that \ncontinues to plague our soldiers serving in this conflict.\n  Those who were close to Holly describe her as a happy and positive \nyoung woman loved by all those who knew her. She was a cheerleader at \nCranston East High School, where she worked hard in college-prep \ncourses. Her teachers remember her as a ``bright, shining star.''\n  Holly had dreams of becoming a postal worker. Instead, in 2002, she \nmade the choice to serve her Nation by joining the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  She was deployed to Iraq in March of this year with her unit from \nCamp Lejeune, NC, and assigned to Headquarters Battalion, 2nd Marine \nDivision, II Marine Expeditionary Force. It was here that Holly was \nable to combine her dreams of postal service with that of serving her \nNation.\n  During her service in Iraq, Holly utilized her strong organizational \nskills to take on and complete various administrative tasks, including \nthat of mail delivery to the troops. She became known as the ``Marine \nwho brought the good news.'' Holly never forgot a name, and would often \nstop Marines in the mess hall to let them know that they had mail.\n  The day that Holly was killed, she was working with Iraqi security \nforces to prevent insurgents from gaining a foothold in that country.\n  Her tragic passing has touched the lives of Rhode Islanders. Holly's \npresence will be deeply missed by all those who knew and loved her.\n  This legislation will pay proper tribute to this remarkable young \nwoman, and commemorate her valor for future generations. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in honoring Lance Corporal Holly A. Charette by \nsupporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation to name the \npost office in Cranston after Lance Corporal Charette be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1989\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. HOLLY A.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \noutreach activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURR:\n  S. 1991. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \nfinancial assistance program to facilitate the provision of supportive \nservices for very low-income veteran families in permanent housing, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor our Nation's veterans \nfor their service and their sacrifice. We will celebrate Veterans Day \ntomorrow, and I am proud of the improvements we have made in providing \nbenefits and care to our country's heroes.\n  In the past 10 years, since I first came to Congress, the veterans \nbudget has increased by 77 percent, an annual average increase of over \n7 percent. The VA's health care budget has increased over 85 percent \nduring this time. We have also enacted a fix to the concurrent receipt \nproblem and made groundbreaking progress with computerized health \nrecords at the Veterans Department. I am proud of these efforts, but I \ncertainly understand the need to do more to stay ahead of the curve.\n  I also want to detail the recent growth in the veterans population in \nNorth Carolina. Our State's veteran population has increased by over \n100,000, to 780,000 veterans since 1980.\n  This growth rate comes at a time when the number of veterans in the \nUnited States is decreasing. Veterans are moving to the State because \nmany of them were stationed there while on active duty, and they have \nmoved back because of the quality of life in North Carolina.\n  I have two bills I have introduced today that I believe will improve \nthe services we currently provide to our veterans. The first is the \nServices to Prevent Veterans Homelessness Act which makes grants to \nnonprofit and faith-based organizations to provide services to \nextremely low-income veterans who are in permanent housing. The goal is \nto keep them from becoming homeless. The services provided for in this \nbill--from vocational counseling and personal finance planning to \nhealth and rehabilitation--were designed to address the root causes of \nhomelessness.\n  The VA estimates on any given night as many as 200,000 veterans are \nhomeless and as many as 400,000 are homeless at some point during the \nyear. We also know that 45 percent of the homeless veterans have a \nmental illness, and 50 percent have some sort of addiction.\n  The cost of this bill is $25 million annually, a small sum to help \nthe poorest of our veterans. In North Carolina alone, over 43,000 \nveterans live below the poverty line. This bill would allow the VA to \npartner with nonprofits in order to help poor veterans escape the root \ncauses of homelessness. I urge the Senate to consider whether we are \ndoing enough on this issue. More importantly, I invite my colleagues to \nstudy this bill and to become a cosponsor.\n  Next, I introduced the Veterans Outreach Improvement Act which \nauthorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to partner with State and \nlocal governments for outreach to veterans. This bill provides grants \nto State veterans agencies and county veterans service offices to help \nthem with outreach and claims development and to provide education and \ntraining of officers. The bill would also authorize $25 million \nannually for this outreach program.\n  County veterans service officers are charged with assisting veterans \nand their dependents in seeking benefits as a supplement to the work \nbeing performed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They are \noverseen by the Division of Veterans Affairs in North Carolina and \nreceive accreditation from organizations approved by the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs. Many veterans need assistance in filing claims in \norder to make sure that the claim is accurate and complete. County \nveterans service officers and officials from State veterans agencies \nare often the officials who can actually sit down face to face with a \nveteran to develop a claim and to send it to the VA. This bill makes \nthe VA a partner in that outreach process.\n  On the eve of Veterans Day this year, I join my colleagues in \nhonoring veterans across this country for their heroic service to our \nNation.\n\n[[Page S12685]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 1994. A bill to require that an increasing percentage of new \nautomobiles be dual fueled automobiles, to revise the method for \ncalculating corporate average fuel economy for such vehicles, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, when we talk about moving toward energy \nindependence in this country, we are really speaking to the issue of \nreducing America's dangerous dependence on imported oil. Our addiction \nto oil is most acute in the U.S. transportation sector where a stunning \nninety-seven percent of our fuel comes from petroleum--97 percent. In \nthe electricity sector we have largely turned away from oil but not so \nin transportation.\n  Fortunately a growing percentage of transportation energy is now \ncoming from clean, domestically-produced renewable fuels like ethanol \nand biodiesel. With the nearly 8-billion-gallon Renewable Fuels \nStandard now the law of the land, renewable fuels will supply 5 percent \nof the energy for our passenger vehicles by 2012, perhaps more. These \nhome-grown, environmentally friendly alternatives made from corn, \nsoybeans and other sources of biomass are helping to improve air \nquality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the rural economy \nwhile substantially reducing dependence on foreign oil.\n  The best part of this trend is that the health, community, and \ndomestic security benefits of renewable fuels come with the bonus of \nprice savings at the pump. Ethanol prices in this country can be as \nmuch as 70 cents a gallon less than regular gasoline. Drivers in my \nState of Iowa are saving as much as 10 cents a gallon on E10--a blend \nof just 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline. This is a savings \nof about $100 a year for a typical family.\n  A report earlier this year by the Consumer Federation of America \nfound that consumers throughout our country would experience similar \nsavings if all refiners offered E10. That is a significant savings in \nall regions of the country. Now, consider the savings if ethanol and \nother renewable fuels were blended not at 10 percent, but at 85 percent \nor more. That $100 a year savings turns into hundreds of dollars each \nyear for a typical family.\n  Unfortunately, right now only about two percent of vehicles on the \nroad in the United States can use ethanol blends of 85 percent--what we \ncall E85. It turns out standard gasoline engines aren't designed for \nthe different fuel to oxygen ratio.\n  The good news is, manufacturing a new vehicle to run on E85 or other \nclean alternative fuel blends is simple--the manufacturer adds a fuel \nsensor and modifies the engine calibration and fuel line to allow the \nvehicle to run on gasoline or a combination of gas and alternative \nfuels.\n  Right now, these ``flex-fuel'' vehicles cost at most an additional \n$100 or so to produce. Some cost estimates are as low as $50. Many auto \nmanufacturers offer them to customers at no additional cost. But few \nAmericans are even aware of the option.\n  At a time of record-high gas prices and continued instability in the \nMiddle East and other oil-producing countries of the world, I believe \nthat all Americans deserve the option to choose the fuel they put in \ntheir car.\n  In Brazil, all new vehicles on the road are expected to be flex-fuel-\nready by 2008--meaning every new vehicle owner will have the choice to \nfill up with gasoline, ethanol, or a combination of the two. If the \nBrazilians can do it, why can't we?\n  That's why today Mr. Lugar, Mr. Obama and I are introducing the Fuel \nSecurity and Consumer Choice Act to require that automobile \nmanufacturers equip a growing percentage of new vehicles sold in the \nU.S. for flexible fuel operation. Mr. Lugar is a leader in promoting \nresearch and development into the conversion of cellulosic biomass into \nuseable fuels. Mr. Obama is a leader in promoting renewable fuels and \nin particular E85.\n  Starting eighteen months after the bill's enactment, manufacturers \nwill be required to equip 10 percent of their cars and light trucks \nwith flex-fuel vehicle, FFV, capability. This is a modest proposal. \nSeveral manufacturers are close to meeting or beating this requirement \nalready.\n  Each model year thereafter, the requirement increases 10 percentage \npoints, so in the second year the manufacturers would have to make at \nleast 20 percent of their vehicles FFVs, and so on, until in about ten \nyears' time 100 percent of new vehicles sold in the United States are \nflex fuel. I recognize that we could be more aggressive in our \ntimetable, but I believe we've struck the right balance here in pushing \nand prodding.\n  In addition, the bill allows auto manufacturers to bank and trade FFV \ncredits toward meeting the requirements. In other words, if one company \nproduced more than its required percentage of FFV vehicles in a given \nyear, it could trade or sell extra credits earned to another company \nthat would then use them to meet the bill's requirements. Credits would \nhave a three-year window if banked or traded. This banking and trading \nprovision is similar to others in law, in the RFS for example, making \nit that much easier for companies to meet statutory obligations at the \nlowest possible cost.\n  Finally, the bill would leave intact the corporate average fuel \neconomy (CAFE) credits for FFV production. However, the bill would \nchange the way the credits are calculated for vehicles produced above \nthe required percentages. Rather than keeping the assumption that the \nvehicle runs 50 percent of the time on fuel like E85, which isn't an \nappropriate figure since most don't run yet on E85, we phase-down the \nassumed use from 50 percent in the first model year the requirement \napplies to 30 percent in the second year, 10 percent the third year, \nand 0 percent thereafter. This should still spur interest among \nautomakers in the early years of the requirement to go beyond the \nminimum FFV production levels outlined in the bill to get the extra \ncredits. And in the meantime the FFV requirement is kicking in and the \nramp up of FFVs won't dilute or weaken CAFE.\n  This bill will give American consumers true choice in fuel selection \nfor the first time. Drivers will have the option to choose low-price, \nhigh-performance E85, or another fuel. My firm belief is that consumers \nwill choose to buy home-grown renewable fuels that directly reduce oil \ndependence rather than buy traditional fossil fuels often derived from \nunstable regimes around the globe.\n  Now, I don't doubt some automobile manufacturers will complain that \nthis requirement is unduly onerous, that it will hurt the industry \nsomehow. Well, I heard the same thing back in 1989 when I proposed \nanother revolutionary idea: closed captioning for TV sets. Industry was \nin an uproar when I suggested that the hearing impaired should have \naccess to television programming on the public airwaves. The industry \nsaid closed captioning would bankrupt it and drive the price of \ntelevisions through the roof.\n  But then, an amazing thing happened. Electronics manufacturers \nrealized that they could reach a broad range of new audiences, \nincluding not just the hearing impaired, but also the learning \ndisabled, and immigrants for whom English is a second language. Sales \nfor several companies reached an all-time high, and with implementation \nacross the electronics industry, the cost of the closed captioning chip \ndropped dramatically to less than a dollar a set.\n  I have no doubt that vehicle manufacturers will discover similar \nunexpected efficiencies and benefits with flex fuel vehicles. As more \nAmericans discover the savings from flexible fuels, the more they will \nseek them out. What better way to boost car sales than to market the \nfuel cost savings that flexible fuel vehicles offer? Any very small \nadditional cost of the flex-fuel vehicle will be more than offset by \nthe price benefits drivers will achieve from a flexible fuel supply \nover time, not to mention the tremendous energy security benefits for \nour Nation.\n  The country will benefit from cleaner air, reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions, reduced dependence on foreign oil, and an enhanced rural \neconomy. Simply, put, this is a low-cost measure with a tremendous \npayoff.\n  It is already well-established that federal auto standards for the \nbenefit of our Nation are an appropriate policy option. It's also \nimportant to note that auto manufacturers already comply\n\n[[Page S12686]]\n\nwith literally dozens of other requirements having to do with the make-\nup, design, and performance of their vehicles. Making an FFV is a lot \ncheaper than putting in air bags, or many other components.\n  Agriculture and renewable fuels producers are ready to provide the \nfuel. Automobile manufacturers have the technology to do it. Given the \ncountry's great energy and security challenges, all sectors must do \ntheir part to chart a path toward energy independence: government, \nindividual citizens, energy companies, and yes, auto manufacturers.\n  I'm grateful that this legislation has been endorsed by a wide array \nof renewable fuel, agriculture, clean energy and security \norganizations, including the Renewable Fuels Association, American \nCoalition for Ethanol, Alliance to Save Energy, Set America Free, and \nNational Corn Growers Association.\n  In closing I want to recognize Mr. Lugar and Mr. Obama for co-\nsponsoring this legislation with me today. Mr. Lugar and I have teamed \nup many times over the years, most recently to enact the national \nRenewable Fuels Standard, which we did as part of the comprehensive \nenergy bill. This bill builds upon the RFS, to guarantee that renewable \nfuels which are being produced in ever greater abundance can find a \nhome in just about any vehicle on the market a few short years from \nnow. I am thankful for his leadership on this and so many other \nimportant energy security issues. I am also grateful to Mr. Obama for \nhis leadership.\n  I hope we can rapidly enact this legislation.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, oil companies recently announced record \nprofits. Those of us who drive cars and trucks could feel our wallets \nshrink at the news. Throughout most of this year, American drivers have \npaid the highest gas prices of all time--more so in the wake of \nrefinery disruptions caused by Hurricane Katrina. While petroleum \ncompany shareholders enjoy healthy stock dividends, the rest of us \nhemorrhage the cash. Industry analysts explain it away as ``business is \nbusiness.''\n  Sound familiar? In the 1970s, political conflicts compelled Middle \nEast oil sheiks to tighten their reins on oil production, sending \nshockwaves throughout our economy and creating long lines at the gas \npump. Congress responded with laws promoting energy conservation and \nfuel efficiency that we thought would reduce our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Unfortunately, 30 years later, here we are again. The Middle East \nremains in turmoil, and the engines of America remain firmly fueled on \nforeign oil. Exacerbating the problem is that the economies of China \nand India--two nations totaling over 2 billion citizens--are quickly \nexpanding, and they are competing with the U.S. for the same pool of \noil. Quite simply, worldwide production capacity cannot keep pace. And \nthat means U.S. gas prices likely will remain high for the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  More so than at any other time in a generation, our economy is \nexposed. In the year 2035, will the American market be shackled still \nto foreign oil? Will we question whether bolder past policies could \nhave prevented future crisis?\n  The response to these questions can be ``no'' if we begin now.\n  For about $100 worth of hoses and sensors, we can make our cars run \non ethanol made from homegrown corn. Automakers made 1 million of these \ncars this year. We have the technology, and it is proven. With 200 \nmillion cars on the road, and 17 million more each year, why can't more \ncars run on ethanol?\n  The answer is they can, and that is why I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues from Iowa and Indiana, Senators Harkin and Lugar, in \nintroducing legislation to require all cars made in the United States \nto be ethanol-capable vehicles within 10 years.\n  Making ethanol cars is not expensive. It is less than the cost of \nairbags. It is less than the cost of a sunroof. It is less than the \ncost of foglights. It is less than the cost of a fancy CD player. It is \nless than the cost of heated seats.\n  Making ethanol cars is not restrictive. These cars are known as \nflexible fuel vehicles. Where ethanol is not yet available, you simply \nfill up with regular gas.\n  And making ethanol cars is good for American automakers, because \nAmerican automakers have a head start. Already, 5 percent to 7 percent \nof their fleet can run on ethanol. We are only asking for an increase \nover a decade.\n  I remind my colleagues that the renewable fuels standard enacted in \nthe Energy bill of 2005 will incorporate enough ethanol into our fuel \nsupply to reduce the use of foreign oil. The Harkin-Lugar-Obama bill, \nif enacted, would accelerate that reduction. And we can do it without \nhardship, without requiring drivers to purchase matchbox cars, without \nproposing futuristic technologies that only our great-great-\ngrandchildren's children will see.\n  The Harkin-Lugar-Obama bill transforms existing, inexpensive, and \nsimple technology into a genuine movement towards energy independence \nfor the United States within a time period that we all can witness. I \nurge my colleagues' swift approval of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        Obama):\n  S. 1995. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nenhance the security of wastewater treatment works; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Wastewater \nTreatment Works Security Act of 2005. This legislation is designed to \nimprove the safety and security of our Nation's wastewater treatment \nsystems.\n  There are 16,000 wastewater treatment facilities across the United \nStates serving almost 190 million people. Approximately 1,600 \nfacilities are located near large metropolitan areas. These industrial \nfacilities use large quantities of toxic chemicals in their treatment \nand disinfection processes, and their collection systems run beneath \nevery city and town in America.\n  A recent Department of Homeland Security planning scenario estimates \nthat a chlorine tank explosion could result in 17,500 deaths, 10,000 \nsevere injuries, and 100,000 hospitalizations. In February 2005, the \nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on wastewater \nsecurity which ranks the release of chlorine as the number two security \nrisk after damage to sewer collection systems.\n  In the past few years alone, fatal accidents involving large \nquantities of chlorine have reminded us of the highly volatile nature \nof this popular wastewater disinfection agent. In January 2005, 9 \npeople were killed in South Carolina when a train carrying chlorine gas \nwas involved in a crash. In June 2004, 3 people died when two freight \ntrains collided in Texas and caused a chlorine tank to rupture.\n  At the very least, wastewater facilities that use chlorine should \nevaluate how the chemical is stored on site and how to react in the \nevent of a harmful intentional act. The GAO report on wastewater \nsecurity recommends mandatory vulnerability assessments and emergency \nresponse plans as an immediate step towards addressing the security \nconcerns.\n  The Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act takes the essential first \nstep in closing the security gaps that make our wastewater treatment \nsystems vulnerable to terrorist attack. The provisions contained in \nthis bill are the product of four years worth of lessons learned since \n9/11, mirroring similar legislative efforts to secure critical \ninfrastructure and minimize potential terrorist targets.\n  This legislation requires all wastewater facilities to conduct \nvulnerability assessments and to develop or modify site security and \nemergency response plans to incorporate the results of the \nvulnerability assessments. Treatment works must certify that \nalternative approaches, such as using smaller quantities or replacing \nsubstances of concern, were considered in their site security plans. It \nrequires that these documents be submitted to EPA for review, and it \nincludes significant security measures to protect this information from \nunauthorized disclosure.\n  Additionally, the legislation authorizes $250 million for assistance \nin completing vulnerability assessments, for immediate security \nimprovements, and for assistance to small treatment works. Finally, it \nauthorizes $15 million for research to identify threats,\n\n[[Page S12687]]\n\ndetection methods and response actions. This bill makes tangible \nprogress towards more secure and better prepared wastewater treatment \nworks.\n  By contrast, drinking water facilities have conducted vulnerability \nassessments under the Safe Drinking Water Act since 2002, when Congress \npassed H.R. 3448, the Public Health and Bioterrorism Preparedness \nResponse Act, P.L. 107-188. These plants are often co-located. It makes \nno sense to adopt strong standards for one infrastructure sector and \nnot the other. In anticipation of congressional action on wastewater \nsecurity, EPA has already issued guidance on conducting vulnerability \nassessments of wastewater treatment works, and many plants have already \ncompleted them.\n  The Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act will codify what are now \nvoluntary prevention and security measures and require all wastewater \nfacilities to complete vulnerability assessments and emergency response \nplans, just as drinking water facilities have done since 2002.\n  Our homeland security strategy begins with protecting critical \ninfrastructure, and wastewater treatment facilities can no longer \nremain the exception. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 1996. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to temporarily \nprohibit the exportation of a finished petroleum product or liquefied \npetroleum gas from the United States if the Secretary determines that \nthe supply of the product or gas in any Petroleum Allocation Defense \nDistrict has fallen or will fall below expected demand; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to address an issue that I know \nmy constituents in Wisconsin are worried about; indeed, something that \nall Americans should be concerned about. On Tuesday, the Energy \nInformation Administration (EIA) announced the most recent outlook for \nhome heating costs. For the average family, the cost of heating oil \nwill increase approximately $325. And for families relying on propane, \nthey can expect to pay an increase of about $230. I would like to \nstress that this is the average; in some areas, the prices could be \nmuch higher. And while these increased costs will place an undue burden \non all sectors of the economy, the heaviest toll will clearly be on \nmiddle and low-income families.\n  Yesterday, executives from several major oil companies were called to \nCapitol Hill, to defend the nearly $33 billion they earned last \nquarter. The answers they gave, for why Americans could expect to pay \nsignificantly more to heat their homes this winter, often were directed \nat the economics of supply and demand. The Chairman and CEO of \nConocoPhillips argued that prices are ``a function of longer-term \nsupply-and-demand trends, and lost energy production during the recent \nhurricanes.'' John Hofmeister, the President of Shell Oil Company, told \nSenators that the industry is doing everything in its power to ``supply \nshortfalls.''\n  Given the testimony of Mr. Hofmeister, I find it surprising to note \nthat currently, American companies are actually exporting products that \ncould be used for home heating. According to the EIA, between January \nand August 2005 more than 48 million barrels of refined product was \nexported out of the U.S. This amount is 24 times the size of what is \nstored in the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve. While some of this went to \nboth Canada and Mexico, large quantities were also sent to Argentina, \nChile, France and Peru.\n  I believe my constituents would be shocked to hear that while the oil \ncompanies are blaming high prices on low supplies, they are also \nreaping the benefits of exporting home heating oil abroad. That is why, \non November 4th, I, along with 11 of my colleagues, wrote to several of \nthe major oil companies and refiners, asking them to voluntarily halt \nall unnecessary exports of products that could be used for home \nheating. Such action would not be without precedent: in 2000, some \nrefiners, including Shell Oil, voluntarily suspended heating oil \nexports after consulting with then Energy Secretary Richardson. We have \nnot yet heard a response from any of the companies.\n  I remain hopeful that these companies will help American consumers by \ntemporarily suspending their unnecessary exports. Yesterday's hearing, \nhowever, did not inspire confidence in the companies to act on behalf \nof consumers rather than profits. That is why I am introducing the Stop \nHeating Oil Exports bill today.\n  My legislation would grant emergency powers to the Energy Secretary \nto halt all unnecessary exports in the face of a serious price spike or \nsupply shortfall. It is that simple. If the Secretary finds that demand \nwill heavily outpace supply, then he or she should be able to stop \nexports--thereby temporarily improving supply, and preventing a major \nprice spike, such as the one we can expect this winter.\n  Yesterday, the oil companies cautioned those of us in Congress \nagainst policy changes that would amount to long-term involvement in \nenergy markets. I would assure these executives that my legislation is \na simple, short-term answer that is designed to protect American \nconsumers. The companies have a chance to do the right thing, to \nincrease supply and avoid the significantly increased home heating \nprices that have been forecasted.\n  I believe that in the future, if they fail to use such an \nopportunity, the Energy Secretary should have the power to intervene on \nbehalf of consumers. I would remind my colleagues that in 2000, as many \nas 4 refiners voluntarily suspended exports, citing ``market \nconditions'' and the desire to ensure adequate supplies of home heating \noil for the winter. And I would remind the President of Shell that his \ncompany was one of them.\n  Americans across the country could face potentially life-threatening \nconditions this winter, when temperatures drop and home heating prices \nsoar. I believe that the oil companies have it in their power to \nprevent such a crisis--if they fail to use it, I believe it is the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to protect American families. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of our legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1996\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Heating Oil Exports Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) according to the Energy Information Administration, \n     households heated primarily with heating oil can expect to \n     pay an average increase of $378, or 32 percent more than last \n     year, to heat their homes;\n       (2) households relying on propane can expect to pay, on \n     average, $325 more this winter;\n       (3) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     projects a 3.2-percent colder winter than last year, and if \n     colder weather prevails, home heating expenditures will be \n     significantly higher;\n       (4) high home heating prices will disproportionately impact \n     moderate- and low-income families;\n       (5) in October 2000, the Secretary of Energy, Bill \n     Richardson, successfully worked with major refiners to \n     temporarily halt heating oil exports, to ensure adequate \n     supplies of home heating oil for the winter;\n       (6) between January and August 2005, refiners in the United \n     States have exported more than 48,000,000 barrels, or \n     2,000,000,000 gallons, of product that could be used for home \n     heating; and\n       (7) at a time when consumers in the United States can \n     expect nearly double their home heating costs in 2004, \n     refiners in the United States should not be diminishing the \n     supply by exporting home heating products.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORITY TO TEMPORARILY PROHIBIT EXPORT OF CERTAIN \n                   PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.\n\n       If the Secretary of Energy determines that the supply of a \n     finished petroleum product or liquefied petroleum gas in any \n     of the 5 Petroleum Allocation Defense Districts has fallen or \n     will fall below expected demand for the product or gas, the \n     Secretary may temporarily prohibit the exportation of the \n     product or gas from the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Bingaman, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1997. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to establish a \nprogram of energy assistance grants to local educational agencies; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S12688]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the School Energy \nCrisis Relief Act. This bill would authorize the Secretary of Energy to \naward School Energy Grants to the poorest school districts in each \nState. I am pleased that Senators Schumer, Clinton, and Bingaman have \njoined me in sponsoring this bill.\n  With cold weather setting in, people all across the country are \nworried about the sky-high cost of energy. Americans are feeling pain \nat the pump, and they are feeling even more pain at home, with home-\nheating costs expected to rise as much as 70 percent above last year's \nlevels.\n  At the same time, many public school districts across the country are \nstruggling to cope with a dramatic, unexpected surge in their energy \ncosts. Schools are facing a double hit: they operate large fleets of \nbuses, and they must heat large, sprawling buildings. This problem is \nespecially acute in the West and Midwest, where many school districts \ncover large geographic areas, and in urban areas, which are burdened \nwith some of the nation's oldest and often least energy-efficient \nbuildings.\n  For affluent suburban districts, these unanticipated energy costs are \na challenge. But for poor school districts, they are a full-blown \ncrisis. Many school boards face a choice between paying their higher \nenergy bills or cutting instructional staff and programs.\n  My bill would allow the Secretary of Energy to award grants to \nschools districts with the highest percentage and highest number of \nstudents eligible for Title I assistance. The grant amounts would be \nawarded based on the population of school-age children in the district, \nas well as the regional costs of transportation and heating fuel.\n  This is a nationwide crisis, and it calls for an urgent Federal \nresponse. School districts across the country are already implementing \ndrastic measures in response to higher energy costs. In Kentucky, for \ninstance, several school districts have cut back to four days of \nclasses per week. In September, most of Georgia's schools cancelled \nclasses for two days in an effort to conserve energy and cut costs.\n  In my State, the Iowa Association of School Boards estimates that, \nthis winter, there will be $40 million shortfall in funding to cover \nschool heating costs. Higher fuel costs for school buses could worsen \nthe shortfall by another $8 million. And because that will come out of \nthe fixed general fund for public education, every additional dollar \nspent on energy costs will come at the expense of classroom and \ninstructional quality. For example, Charles City, IA, expects to spend \n$140,000 more on fuel this winter. That's enough to pay the salaries of \nfour teachers.\n  According to the Iowa Association of School Boards, school districts \nare responding to the energy crisis by reducing staff, increasing class \nsizes, reducing course offerings, postponing technology purchases, or \ncutting Headstart transportation programs. Many school districts are \nlowering their thermostats to unhealthful levels. In fact, just \nyesterday, I heard that the school district in Ottumwa, IA, has asked \nparents to start sending kids to school with coats to keep them warm \nindoors. This is just not acceptable.\n  In addition, I remind my colleagues that school districts--especially \nhigh-poverty school districts--are struggling heroically to try to meet \nthe requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. It is penny wise and \npound foolish to force these districts to cut instructional staff and \nclassroom resources in order to pay their higher energy bills. And none \nof us can be comfortable with the prospect of children sitting at their \nschool desks in coats and scarves to fight off the chill. As I said, \nthis is just not acceptable.\n  The poorest school districts all across America are in desperate need \nof assistance with their energy costs. Low-income children deserve the \nopportunity to learn and achieve in classrooms that are properly \nheated. And we certainly don't want schools to be eliminating school \ndays and laying off teachers because of higher energy costs. So we need \nto act. I urge my colleagues to support the School Energy Crisis Relief \nAct so we can respond to this emergency as expeditiously as possible. \nAccording to the Iowa Association of School Boards, this has led to \nsome schools deciding to scale back after-school activities because of \nheating costs and to cut non-varsity sports because they lack funding \nnecessary to take them to games. It is very troubling to me that \nschools have been forced to make cuts that have directly affected the \neducational experience of the children in their schools, in the name of \nrising fuel costs. For instance, some schools have had to cut back on \nfield trips, put off buying new text books and school supplies, while \nreducing course offerings in fine arts and academics.\n  In addition, the Iowa Association of School Boards has reported that \nschools have cut back on staff and increased class sizes while also \nturning down the thermostat in the classroom. I ask, Mr. President, are \nwe supposed to expect students to learn at a high-level when rising \nenergy costs have put them in overcrowded, cold classrooms?\n  But this problem is not specific to my home State of Iowa. As the \nsponsor of companion legislation in the House of Representatives, \nCongressman Joe Baca, pointed out that some schools in Kentucky have \ncut back to four-day school weeks to keep their energy costs down. \nRecently, Georgia schools cancelled two days of classes in an attempt \nto keep their costs down. In Colton Joint Unified District in \nCongressman Baca's congressional district, the price of a gallon of \ndiesel fuel has risen from under a dollar at one point to $2.72 a \ngallon increasing annual fuel costs by over $300,000.\n  So I have come to the floor today to introduce the School Energy \nCrisis Relief Act. This legislation meets the needs of struggling \nschool districts by authorizing the Secretary of Energy to award grants \nto poor school districts struggling to balance skyrocketing energy \ncosts with providing a quality education. Grants would be awarded to \nthe poorest urban and rural school districts in each state. In Iowa \nalone, this means both poor rural and urban districts would be eligible \nto receive grants.\n  I ask for my colleagues support for the School Energy Crisis Relief \nAct and urge the Senate to work quickly to pass this crucial \nlegislation and provide relief to those school districts in need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Nelson \n        of Nebraska, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Thune, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Isakson, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mrs. Dole):\n  S. 1998. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to enhance \nprotections relating to the reputation and meaning of the Medal of \nHonor and other military decorations and awards, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to introduce the \nStolen Valor Act of 2005. This legislation will honor the brave \nveterans of our Nation who have been awarded valorous medals for their \nservice to our Nation. It is only appropriate that this bill be \nintroduced today, the day before our country remembers all servicemen \nand women--past and present--who have served America in uniform.\n  Recipients of the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Awards, \nSilver Star, or Purple Heart have made incredible sacrifices for our \ncountry. They deserve our thanks and respect.\n  Unfortunately, however, there are some individuals who diminish the \naccomplishments of award recipients by using medals they have not \nearned. These imposters use fake medals--or claim to have medals that \nthey have not earned--to gain credibility in their communities. These \nfraudulent acts can often lead to the perpetration of very serious \ncrimes.\n  Currently, Federal law enforcement officials are only able to \nprosecute those who wear counterfeit medals. The statute does not apply \nto individuals who claim to be award recipients either verbally or in \nwriting, or to those who display fake medals in their offices or homes.\n  My legislation will allow law enforcement officials to prosecute \nthose who falsely claim, either verbally or in writing, to be medal \nrecipients. It calls for a six-month jail sentence and a fine for \nimproper use of most medals, and includes a maximum sentence of one \nyear for perpetrators who claim to have earned the Medal of Honor, \nDistinguished Service Awards, Silver Star, or Purple Heart.\n  The Military Order of the Purple Heart, the VFW, and the FBI Agents\n\n[[Page S12689]]\n\nAssociation have endorsed this legislation because of the capabilities \nit will provide law enforcement officials to prosecute these fraudulent \nacts.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will serve to honor the \ncourageous heroes who have rightfully earned these awards. We must \nnever allow their service and sacrifice to be cheapened by those who \nwish to exploit these honors for personal gain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1999. A bill to amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to \ntransfer the YouthBuild program from the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development to the Department of Labor, to enhance the program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould transfer the YouthBuild program from its current home in the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to the Department of Labor. \nTransferring departmental jurisdiction over this program will help \nensure that Youthbuild continues to receive the funds it needs to help \nunemployed and undereducated young people ages 16-24 work toward their \nGED or high school diploma while learning job skills by building \naffordable housing for homeless and low-income people. It is supported \nby the YouthBuild Coalition.\n  Poverty, neglect, abuse, and deprivation of all kinds can prevent \npeople from reaching their true potential. Many of those who have \nfallen off track, suffered losses, and made mistakes can recover. If \ngiven the opportunity, they can learn to cope with obstacles and care \neffectively about themselves, their families and their communities. \nYouthBuild helps young people who have lost their way to turn their \nlives around.\n  YouthBuild is a uniquely comprehensive program that offers at-risk \nyouth an immediate productive role rebuilding their communities. While \nattending basic education classes for 50 percent of program time, \nstudents also receive job skills training in the construction field, \npersonal counseling from respected mentors, a supportive peer group \nwith positive values, and experience in civic engagement. They build \nhouses for homeless and low-income people while earning their own GED \nor high school diploma.\n  YouthBuild is built on success. The first YouthBuild program was \ncreated in 1978. At that time, YouthBuild's future founder, Dorothy \nStoneman, formed the Youth Action Program to rebuild homes in New York \nCity. The successful renovation of an East Harlem tenement led to a \ncity-wide coalition and in 1990, led to YouthBuild USA, an organization \ncreated to replicate this program around the Nation.\n  In 1992, I introduced legislation which was enacted into law as part \nof the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, authorizing \nfederal funding for YouthBuild through the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development.\n  In its first 10 years of Federal funding, YouthBuild has demonstrated \nthe ability to bring the most disadvantaged youth into productive \nemployment, higher education, and civic engagement. Since 1994, more \nthan 40,000 YouthBuild students have helped rebuild their communities, \ncreating more than 12,000 units of affordable housing, while \ntransforming their lives at the same time.\n  YouthBuild has earned majority bipartisan support for Federal funding \nin the Senate due to its great success in local communities. Today \nthere are 226 YouthBuild programs in 44 States engaging 7,000 young \nadults.\n  The number of programs could easily be expanded. Last year alone, 260 \ncommunities were denied YouthBuild funding. The programs that exist \ncould easily grow. In 2004, local programs turned away 10,000 \napplicants solely for lack of funds.\n  The expansion of YouthBuild would help address critical national \nproblems: the construction industry is short 80,000 workers; over \n500,000 youth are dropping out of high school every year with no \nprospects of becoming gainfully employed; states are spending huge \namounts on prisons, housing 365,000 16 to 24 year olds, 65 percent of \nwhom have dropped out of high school.\n  Consider this story of success: Manny Negron grew up in New Britain, \nCT. He left school during his Sophomore year after having some personal \nproblems. He started selling drugs and getting into trouble. Then he \njoined YouthBuild, obtained a GED and learned more about the \nconstruction industry. ``Before YouthBuild, I didn't know what I wanted \nto do with my life.'' Manny said. ``I had no goals, no plans--I had \nnothing. If it was a weekend when I was partying and in the street, I \nhad no plans. Now it's completely different and YouthBuild did that for \nme. Now that I'm away from all that, I actually see a future for myself \nand see what I'm capable of and what I can do with my life.''\n  Research on 900 YouthBuild graduates several years after program \ncompletion showed that 75 percent were employed at an average wage of \n$10/hour or in college. They were voting and paying taxes. Of those who \nhad committed felonies, the recidivism rate was a strikingly low, 15 \npercent.\n  The legislation I am introducing today responds to the Bush \nadministration's attempt to move YouthBuild from HUD to DoL in its FY \n2006 budget request. I did not agree with the Administration attempt to \ntransfer YouthBuild in the budget; it was simply the wrong approach. \nHowever, my staff has met with Administration officials, with \nYouthBuild and with YouthBuild's strong supporters. And I believe that \nwe can find a way to do this, and I appreciate that the Administration \nhas shown a willingness to work with us so far. If done properly, I \ntransferring YouthBuild from HUD to DoL could increase YouthBuild's \nscope, helping it to reach the communities and young people that are \ncurrently denied access due to a lack of funds. This legislation not \nonly authorizes the transfer of YouthBuild from HUD to DoL, but also \nallows unlimited future federal funding, continues centralized \nmanagement at DoL and continues the historic role of YouthBuild USA as \nthe partner and contractor for quality assurance.\n  This legislation is an attempt to help move the process of \ntransferring the YouthBuild program forward. I look forward to working \nwith Senators Enzi and Kennedy, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nSenate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to develop \ncompromise legislation that will ensure that YouthBuild continues to \nassist young people around the nation. I ask that all my colleagues \nsupport this legislation and continue to support the YouthBuild.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12689-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12689-S12692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 302--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n IMPACT OF MEDICAID RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-\n                           BEING OF CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nDodd, and Mr. Salazar) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 302\n\n       Whereas the Medicaid program provides health insurance for \n     more than \\1/4\\ of children in the United States and pays for \n     more than \\1/3\\ of the births and health care costs for \n     newborns in the United States each year;\n       Whereas the Medicaid program provides critical access to \n     health care for children with disabilities, covering more \n     than 70 percent of poor children with disabilities and \n     children with special needs in low-income working families, \n     including 1 in 9 military children with special health care \n     needs;\n       Whereas low-income children who depend on the Medicaid \n     program experience a rate of health conditions and health \n     risks much greater than those found among children who are \n     not low-income;\n       Whereas the Medicaid program is the largest source of \n     payment for health care provided to children with special \n     health care needs in the Nation and is also a critical source \n     of funding for health care provided to children in foster \n     care and for health care services provided in schools to \n     children eligible for coverage under the Medicaid program;\n       Whereas the Medicaid program is the single largest source \n     of revenue for the Nation's safety net hospitals, including \n     children's hospitals and community health centers, and is \n     critical to the ability of these providers to adequately \n     serve all children;\n       Whereas the Medicaid program, in combination with the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program, has helped to \n     dramatically\n\n[[Page S12690]]\n\n     reduce the number of uninsured children, cutting the rate by \n     more than \\1/3\\ between 1997 and 2003;\n       Whereas without the Medicaid program, the number of \n     children without health insurance--8,300,000 in 2004--would \n     be substantially higher;\n       Whereas the Medicaid program's guarantee of affordable \n     coverage and access to necessary health care is essential to \n     the ability of the Medicaid program to adequately serve \n     children whose families have low-incomes and whose health \n     care expenses often exceed the norm;\n       Whereas for nearly 40 years, the Medicaid program has \n     ensured particularly comprehensive benefits for infants, \n     young children, school-age children, and adolescents, in \n     recognition of the unique growth and development needs of \n     children and the importance of strong and healthy young \n     adults to the safety and welfare of the Nation;\n       Whereas the Medicaid program's special benefits, added in \n     1967, were a direct response to findings of the Department of \n     Defense regarding pervasive physical, dental, and \n     developmental conditions among low-income military recruits, \n     and the implications of these findings for national \n     preparedness;\n       Whereas the Medicaid program's benefits for children are \n     comprehensive, in order to ensure that all low-income \n     infants, even those born too soon and too small, have the \n     chance to survive and thrive into a healthy childhood;\n       Whereas the Medicaid program's benefits for children help \n     ensure that young children grow and develop properly, arrive \n     at school ready to learn, and have the opportunity to achieve \n     their full educational potential;\n       Whereas the Medicaid program ensures that children have the \n     benefits, health services, and health care support they need \n     to be fully immunized, and that children can secure \n     eyeglasses, dental care, and hearing aids when necessary, and \n     have access to comprehensive, regularly scheduled, and as-\n     needed health examinations, as well as preventive \n     interventions, to correct physical and mental conditions that \n     threaten to delay proper growth and development;\n       Whereas the Medicaid program ensures that the sickest and \n     highest risk infants, toddlers, and children have access to \n     the specialized diagnostic and treatment care that become \n     essential when serious illness strikes;\n       Whereas title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n     House of Representatives, as reported out by the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce, would eliminate Medicaid Early and \n     Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit \n     rules outright for approximately 6,000,000 low-income \n     children, whose family incomes are only slightly above the \n     Federal poverty level and who are therefore without the \n     resources to secure basic health care or essential medical \n     care;\n       Whereas title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n     House of Representatives permits States to eliminate the \n     following benefits for children: comprehensive developmental \n     assessments, assessment and treatment for elevated blood lead \n     levels, eyeglasses, dental care, hearing aids, wheelchairs \n     and crutches, respiratory treatment, comprehensive mental \n     health services, prescription drugs, and speech and physical \n     therapy services;\n       Whereas title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n     House of Representatives would allow States to impose \n     premiums, deductibles, and copayments on children whose \n     families have incomes only slightly above the Federal poverty \n     level and who therefore cannot afford the cost of medically \n     necessary care and millions of children, especially infants, \n     young children, and school-age children with serious \n     disabilities and high health care needs, would potentially be \n     affected;\n       Whereas although title III of the budget reconciliation \n     bill of the House of Representatives purports to exempt poor \n     children, it permits States to redefine the meaning of \n     poverty virtually without limitation, in order to eliminate \n     cost sharing safeguards for poor children currently available \n     under the law;\n       Whereas title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n     House of Representatives would permit States to require that \n     even the poorest children pay copayments for prescription \n     drugs, without providing exemptions to this requirement, not \n     even in the case of children in foster care or special needs \n     adoptions;\n       Whereas title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n     House of Representatives would permit States to allow \n     hospital emergency departments to impose cost sharing \n     requirements on the poor and on near-poor infants, toddlers, \n     and young children, without providing exemptions to this \n     requirement, not even in the case of children in foster care \n     or special needs adoptions;\n       Whereas title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n     House of Representatives would permit providers to turn \n     children away because their families are unable to pay \n     deductibles and copayments;\n       Whereas title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n     House of Representatives would potentially eliminate medical \n     case management coverage for Medicaid-enrolled children in \n     foster care, even though Federal foster care programs \n     expressly assume that medical case management services for \n     such children will be furnished through the Medicaid program;\n       Whereas title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n     House of Representatives would permit States to entirely \n     replace the Medicaid program for children with ``health \n     opportunity accounts'' that eliminate all Medicaid coverage \n     in favor of cash accounts of $1,000 and catastrophic-only, \n     high deductible health insurance coverage for children with \n     family incomes only slightly above the Federal poverty level; \n     and\n       Whereas title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n     House of Representatives would only exempt the poorest \n     children from participation in health opportunity accounts \n     during the first 5 years of the demonstration projects under \n     which the accounts are available and would permit States to \n     redefine the meaning of poverty to any level, no matter how \n     low: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     conferees for any budget reconciliation bill of the 109th \n     Congress shall not report a reconciliation bill that would--\n       (1) allow States to--\n       (A) reduce coverage for medically necessary health care for \n     poor or low-income children; or\n       (B) impose premiums, deductibles, copayments, or \n     coinsurance on poor or low-income children;\n       (2) reduce coverage of, or payment for, medical case \n     management services under title XIX of the Social Security \n     Act for children in foster care, including targeted case \n     management services; or\n       (3) allow the Secretary to undertake any Health Opportunity \n     Account demonstrations involving poor or low-income children.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am submitting a Senate resolution \ntoday with Senators Rockefeller, Reed, Clinton, Murray, Baucus, Akaka, \nMikulski, Corzine, Lautenberg, and Dodd that does three things: 1. \nExplains the importance of Medicaid to children; 2. Explains the \nconsequences of the various provisions in the House budget \nreconciliation bill that will negatively impact the health and well-\nbeing of children's health; and 3. Expresses the Sense of the Senate \nthat the conferees for the budget reconciliation bill shall not report \nback language that has negative consequences for the health and well-\nbeing of children.\n  This resolution highlights the many ways in which the House of \nRepresentatives budget reconciliation bill affects the health of low-\nincome children across this Nation. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office (CBO), the House budget reconciliation package increases \ncost-sharing placed on low-income Medicaid beneficiaries, even while \nreducing health services by $6.5 billion over 5 years and an astounding \n$30.1 billion over 10 years.\n  In sharp contrast, the Senate budget reconciliation bill includes \nonly one provision--the targeted case management reduction of $750 \nmillion over 5 years--that could negatively affect young Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\n  For children, the impact would be devastating. Medicaid covers more \nthan 27 million children--or almost one in four--American children. \nMedicaid also covers more than one-third of all the births and health \ncare costs of newborns in the United States each year.\n  In spite of the importance of Medicaid, the House budget package \nincreases cost-sharing for all children who rely on it for prescription \ndrugs and emergency room services. The bill also allows States to \nimpose premiums for the first time under Medicaid for children's \ncoverage and deny children coverage even if their family cannot afford \nto pay the premium or other cost-sharing.\n  The House budget bill also allows States to eliminate the Early and \nPeriodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit rules that \nare so critical to the health of children with special health care \nneeds or disabilities. Benefits that could be lost include: \ncomprehensive developmental assessments, assessment and treatment for \nelevated blood lead levels, eyeglasses, dental care, hearing aids, \nwheelchairs and crutches, respiratory treatment, comprehensive mental \nhealth services, prescription drugs, and speech and therapy services.\n  In short, the vast majority or three-fourths of the savings in the \nHouse bill come at the expense of low-income Medicaid beneficiaries. By \nCBO's estimate, half of the beneficiaries affected by the increased \ncost sharing provisions in the House package are imposed on children, \nand half of those who will lose Medicaid benefits would be children.\n  Without the Medicaid program, the number of children without health \ninsurance--8.3 million in 2004--would be substantially higher. In fact, \nthe number of uninsured children has dropped\n\n[[Page S12691]]\n\nby over one-third of a million children over the past 4 years due in \nlarge part to Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, or SCHIP.\n  As Representative Frank Pallone noted, ``Once again, Medicaid has \nproven to be part of the solution, not the problem. Burdensome cost-\nsharing requirements and reduced benefits included in the \nreconciliation package will undoubtedly weaken Medicaid's ability to \nensure all of America's children have access to the health care they \nneed.''\n  Representative Lois Capps of California adds, ``. . . this \nreconciliation package would allow states to deny critical medical \nscreening, treatment, and follow up care for these children. And it \nwould allow excessive out of pocket costs and premiums which--\nexperience shows--causes families to lose coverage or fail to get even \nneeded services for children.''\n  I urge Senators to closely monitor what the House of Representatives \nis doing with respect to the health and well-being of children in their \nbudget reconciliation bill. Low-income children should not be asked to \nbear the burden of billions of dollars in budget cuts--cuts that are \nnot even being used to reduce the deficit, but rather to help pay for \ntax cuts.\n  There are a variety of reasons that I did not support the Senate's \nbudget reconciliation bill, but even with its imperfections, it is far \nsuperior to the House's budget package. If nothing else, it does not \ncontain the types of cuts to children's health that are included in the \nHouse bill.\n  Senators need to know that the House budget package is terrible for \nthe health and well-being of the children in our country.\n  With that in mind, I offer today's Senate resolution on children's \nhealth.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a copy of the CBO analysis of the \nimpact that the Medicaid provisions in the budget reconciliation bill \npassed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the analyses was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Congressional Budget Office--Additional Information on CBO's Estimate \nfor the Medicaid Provisions in H.R. 4241, the Deficit Reduction Act of \n                                  2005\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the \n     provisions of subtitle A of Title III of H.R. 4241 would \n     reduce federal Medicaid spending by $12 billion over the \n     2006-2010 period and $48 billion over the 2006-2015 period \n     (see CBO's cost estimate of the reconciliation \n     recommendations of the House Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce, issued on October 31, 2005). About 75 percent of \n     those savings are due to provisions that would increase \n     penalties on individuals who transfer assets for less than \n     fair market value in order to qualify for nursing home care, \n     restrict eligibility for people with substantial home equity, \n     allow states to impose higher cost-sharing requirements and/\n     or premiums on certain enrollees, and permit states to \n     restrict benefits for certain enrollees. This memorandum \n     provides additional information about the estimates and the \n     number and types of Medicaid enrollees who would be affected \n     by those provisions.\n\n\n                    Asset Transfers and Home Equity\n\n       CBO estimates that the provisions changing the treatment of \n     asset transfers and home equity would reduce net Medicaid \n     outlays by $2.5 billion over the next five years and by $6.8 \n     billion over the next 10 years. Of those amounts, more than \n     three-quarters is due to the proposed change to the start \n     date of the penalty for prohibited transfers and the \n     prohibition of nursing home benefits for individuals with \n     home equity exceeding $500,000.\n       Under current law, very few of the applicants for Medicaid \n     incur penalties for prohibited asset transfers. CBO estimates \n     that changing the start date of the penalty would result in a \n     delay of Medicaid eligibility for approximately 120,000 \n     people in 2010, growing to approximately 130,000 in 2015. \n     Such delays would occur because individuals would either \n     incur a penalty for prohibited transfers or refrain from \n     making such transfers and instead pay for some nursing home \n     care themselves. Those figures represent about 15 percent of \n     the new recipients of Medicaid nursing home benefits each \n     year.\n       The majority of penalties or delays would apply to \n     individuals who otherwise would have employed a strategy to \n     preserve half of their assets--the so-called ``half-a-loaf' \n     strategy. Under the bill, some of those individuals would \n     simply not transfer assets and thus not incur a penalty, but \n     instead accept a delay in Medicaid eligibility. The bill's \n     provisions that allow greater exemptions for hardship \n     situations reduce the number of affected individuals, while \n     the changes to the look-back window increase that number.\n       The period of delayed eligibility for affected recipients \n     would range from one day to more than one year, averaging \n     about three months in 2006 and decreasing to an average of \n     about two months in 2015. The length of the delay would \n     decrease because payment rates for nursing home services are \n     expected to grow faster than assets.\n       CBO estimates that about 1 percent of the unmarried \n     applicants for Medicaid nursing home benefits have homes \n     valued at over $500,000. (The policy would have a negligible \n     effect on the treatment of the homes of married individuals.) \n     That figure translates to about 5,000 affected individuals \n     annually by 2010.\n\n\n                              Cost Sharing\n\n       CBO estimates that the provisions allowing states to impose \n     higher cost-sharing requirements and premiums on certain \n     recipients would reduce Medicaid spending by $10 billion over \n     the 2006-2015 period. Of that total, about two-thirds of the \n     estimated savings are due to increased cost sharing and one-\n     third to higher premiums. We anticipate that states would \n     phase in changes in cost sharing and that those changes would \n     not be fully effective until 2012.\n       We assume that states would impose cost-sharing \n     requirements primarily for services such as prescription \n     drugs, physician services, and non-emergency visits to \n     emergency rooms. We also anticipate that states would require \n     greater cost-sharing payments by individuals and families \n     with higher income than by those with income just above the \n     poverty level. Although states would be likely to raise \n     nominal copay amounts and increase them over time, we expect \n     that aggregate enrollee cost sharing would remain, on \n     average, below limits established under H.R. 4241.\n       Under the bill, CBO estimates that states with about one-\n     half of all Medicaid enrollees would impose cost-sharing \n     requirements (for at least one service) on enrollees who \n     currently are not subject to cost sharing. We estimate that \n     the number of affected enrollees would increase from 7 \n     million in 2010 to 11 million by 2015, and that about half of \n     those enrollees would be children. States also would \n     increase cost-sharing requirements for many of those who \n     are subject to cost sharing under current law and thus \n     increase copays for another 6 million enrollees by 2015. \n     In sum, we expect that about 17 million people--27 percent \n     of Medicaid enrollees--would ultimately be affected by the \n     cost-sharing provisions of the bill.\n       We estimate that about 80 percent of the savings from \n     higher cost sharing would be due to decreased use of \n     services; the remaining 20 percent would reflect lower \n     payments to providers. CBO anticipates that about three-\n     quarters of states imposing cost sharing would allow \n     providers to deny services for lack of payment and that there \n     would be greater decreases in utilization in those states. \n     The estimate accounts for the fact that savings from the \n     reduced use of certain services (such as prescription drugs \n     or physician services) could be partly offset by higher \n     spending in other areas (such as emergency room visits).\n\n\n                                Premiums\n\n       CBO estimates that about 75 percent of the savings from \n     higher premiums under H.R. 4241 would be due to higher \n     premium receipts and the remaining 25 percent would stem from \n     individuals leaving the Medicaid program.\n       States would charge premiums to about 1 million enrollees \n     by fiscal year 2010 and to about 2 million enrollees by \n     fiscal year 2015. CBO expects that most of those enrollees \n     would be nondisabled adults and children and that, on \n     average, premiums would range from 1 percent to 3 percent of \n     family income. Those amounts would be less than the maximum \n     allowed by the legislation. In response, some beneficiaries \n     would leave Medicaid or would be disenrolled for nonpayment. \n     CBO estimates that about 70,000 enrollees would lose coverage \n     in fiscal year 2010 and that 110,000 would lose coverage in \n     fiscal year 2015 because of the imposition of premiums.\n\n\n                      Alternative Benefit Packages\n\n       CBO's estimate assumes that states with about 20 percent of \n     Medicaid enrollees would provide reduced benefit packages to \n     at least some of their enrollees. Those benefit reductions \n     would affect an estimated 2.5 million Medicaid enrollees in \n     2010 and about 5 million enrollees by 2015--about 8 percent \n     of the Medicaid population--and that about one-half of those \n     receiving alternate benefit packages would be children. We \n     anticipate that states would phase in benefit reductions and \n     that those changes would not be fully effective until 2015. \n     CBO expects that only a limited number of states would \n     exercise that option because the bill would prohibit states \n     that provide limited benefit packages from expanding such \n     coverage to groups not covered under the state plan when the \n     bill is enacted.\n       While many states trimming benefits likely would offer a \n     benefit package for Medicaid children similar to that \n     provided in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, we \n     expect that others would look to their state employee \n     programs or private-sector plans as models for benefits to \n     offer parents, families, and some disabled adults. CBO \n     anticipates that only a few states would offer benefit plans \n     that offer leaner benefits than those types of plans, though \n     the bill would permit them to do so.\n       On average, CBO expects that alternative benefit packages \n     provided by the states would reduce per capita spending by 15 \n     percent to 35 percent for the affected populations, depending \n     on the eligibility group\n\n[[Page S12692]]\n\n     targeted and the generosity of the state's program under \n     current law. Most of the reductions would be for services \n     such as dental, vision, mental health, and certain therapies, \n     but also could include restrictions on the amount, duration, \n     and scope of coverage for other services.\n\n\n                        Uncertainty of Estimates\n\n       CBO's estimates are particularly uncertain in two areas. We \n     have limited information about people's asset holdings prior \n     to their admission to nursing homes and about the number of \n     people engaging in asset transfers that would be prohibited \n     by the bill. How states would react to this legislation is \n     also very uncertain. We anticipate wide variation in the \n     extent to which different states would reshape their Medicaid \n     programs by increasing cost sharing or premiums or by \n     restricting benefits. Some states might make limited changes, \n     such as increasing cost sharing for a few specific services \n     or certain enrollees, while others would make more far-\n     reaching changes. Our estimates, therefore, account for a \n     range of possible responses by states to the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12692-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12692-S12693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 303--CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA TO CONDUCT \n    A THOROUGH JUDICIAL REVIEW OF KEN SARO-WIWA CASE, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Obama, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nDodd, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 303\n\n       Whereas on November 10, 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Nigerian \n     writer, environmental activist, and nominee for the Nobel \n     Peace Prize, along with 8 colleagues, together known as the \n     ``Ogoni 9'', were hanged by the military government of \n     Nigeria, based on charges widely regarded as false;\n       Whereas the Ogoni 9 had been nonviolently campaigning for \n     improved living standards and a clean environment for the \n     Ogoni People, whose Niger Delta land, air, and water was, and \n     remains, severely polluted from oil extraction, and whose \n     standard of living, despite the great mineral wealth their \n     land has yielded since the early 1960s, is among the lowest \n     in the world;\n       Whereas the international condemnation that followed the \n     executions included the suspension of Nigeria from the \n     British Commonwealth of Nations;\n       Whereas in 1996 a United Nations mission to Nigeria found \n     the military tribunal in contravention of international and \n     domestic law, and recommended financial relief for the \n     survivors of the Ogoni 9 and improvements in the \n     socioeconomic conditions of the Ogoni and other minorities in \n     the Delta;\n       Whereas 10 years later, none of the United Nations \n     recommendations have been implemented, and the environmental \n     and social situations have deteriorated for the Ogoni and \n     other Delta communities;\n       Whereas the Ogoni 9 remain convicted of a crime of which \n     they were unfairly tried;\n       Whereas Ogoniland remains severely polluted and gas flaring \n     continues unabated;\n       Whereas the security and stability in the Niger Delta are \n     threatened by a proliferation of small arms, armed gangs, and \n     black market oil bunkering;\n       Whereas despite these pressures, Ogoniland remains an \n     island of nonviolence, and the Ogoni voted in high numbers in \n     the 1999 elections;\n       Whereas stability in the Niger Delta is necessary to \n     prevent an increase in global oil costs; and\n       Whereas in the interest of the protection of human rights, \n     justice, and stability in the Delta, redress should be given \n     to the Ogonis and their use of nonviolent means should be \n     recognized: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the Government of Nigeria to conduct a thorough \n     judicial review of the trial of the Ogoni 9 and to provide \n     just compensation to the survivors of the Ogoni 9 if a \n     miscarriage of justice is found;\n       (2) urges the Government of Nigeria, international donors, \n     and international oil companies operating in the Delta to \n     increase assistance significantly to improve the lives of the \n     Ogoni and other affected communities and for pollution \n     abatement and cleanup in the Niger Delta region, in close \n     consultation with local communities;\n       (3) urges the Government of Nigeria to ensure that all \n     members of the security forces receive training in \n     international standards on the use of force and firearms, \n     particularly the 1979 United Nations Code of Conduct for Law \n     Enforcement Officials and the 1990 United Nations Basic \n     Principles on the Use of Force and Fire Arms by Law \n     Enforcement Officials;\n       (4) calls upon the Department of State to seek urgently to \n     ensure that American oil companies operating in the Niger \n     Delta comply, at a minimum, with the Voluntary Principles for \n     Security and Human Rights; and\n       (5) urges the Secretary General of the United Nations to \n     institute a 10-year followup mission to Ogoniland.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, ten years ago today, in what was by all \naccounts a barbaric miscarriage of justice, Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of \nhis Ogoni colleagues from the delta region of Nigeria were hanged after \nbeing convicted by a biased military tribunal.\n  Those of us who knew Mr. Saro-Wiwa remember him as a thoughtful, \npassionate, nonviolent advocate for the rights of the Ogoni people. His \narrest, conviction and hanging by the corrupt and brutal Abacha \ngovernment outraged the world and resulted in Nigeria's suspension from \nthe British Commonwealth, and a United Nations investigation which \nconcluded that Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues had been denied due process \nin violation of international and Nigerian law. The UN recommended \nfinancial relief for their families and improvements in the living \nconditions of the Ogoni people and the other minorities in the delta \nregion.\n  Unfortunately, none of the UN's recommendations have been carried \nout, the environmental, economic and social conditions there have \ngotten worse, and ten year's later the Ogoni Nine remain convicted of a \ncrime for which they were unfairly tried.\n  Today, I am honored to submit, on behalf of myself and Senators \nKennedy, Obama, Feingold, Durbin, and Dodd a resolution calling on the \nGovernment of Nigeria to conduct a thorough judicial review of this \ntravesty.\n  By this resolution we remember Ken Saro-Wiwa and the others who were \nexecuted, and we honor their courage and their nonviolent commitment to \nsocial justice. In addition to calling for a judicial review and just \ncompensation to the survivors if a miscarriage of justice is found, we \nurge the Nigerian government, international donors, and international \noil companies operating in the Niger delta to increase assistance \nsignificantly to improve the lives of the people who live there. It is \nunconscionable that after all the billions of dollars in oil that have \nbeen extracted from that area, these people continue to suffer daily \nfrom the polluted water and soil and the gas flaring and are living in \nsqualor.\n  And we call on the Nigerian Government to ensure that its security \nforces receive the necessary training and discipline to prevent the \nviolations of human rights that the Ogoni have suffered for so many \nyears.\n  The volatile situation in the Niger delta has been ignored for far \ntoo long. It cannot be resolved by force. It cannot be resolved by lip \nservice. There are serious environmental issues and urgent economic and \nsocial needs. Ken Saro-Wiwa's example of nonviolence stands today as it \ndid a decade ago as a model for the Nigerian government, the people of \nthe Niger delta, and the international community to join together to \nfinally address them.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I'm honored to join Senator Leahy, \nSenator Obama, Senator Feingold, Senator Dodd and Senator Durbin in \nsubmitting this tribute to one of the world's most courageous human \nrights and environmental activists, Ken Saro-Wiwa, on the tenth \nanniversary of his death.\n  Mr. Saro-Wiwa was a champion of nonviolence for social and economic \njustice and the environment in the oil-rich communities of the Niger \nDelta. He was a voice for hundreds of thousands of persons suffering \nfrom government repression and corporate greed, and he raised global \nawareness of the need for more responsible environmental and social \npractices by the oil industry.\n  On this day ten years ago, Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of his Ogoni \ncompatriots were unjustly put to death based on apparently trumped-up \ncharges by an apparently biased Nigerian military tribunal. Their only \ncrime was their courage in daring to speak out against the exploitation \nof the Ogoni environment and its people. Despite widespread \ninternational condemnation of the killings, Mr. Saro-Wiwa has not been \ncleared of the false charges, and environmental and social degradation \npersists in the Ogoni and other communities in the Niger Delta.\n  The resolution that we are introducing today calls on the Nigerian \nGovernment to conduct a thorough judicial review of the military \ntribunal, and to pay compensation to the heirs of Mr. Saro-Wiwa and his \ncolleagues if a miscarriage of justice is found. A United Nations \nmission to Nigeria in 1996 found such a violation and called for such \nrelief. The resolution also calls for increased assistance to the\n\n[[Page S12693]]\n\nOgoni people and for environmental support for the Niger Delta region. \nIn addition, it calls for American oil companies operating in the Delta \nto follow more responsible social practices, and for the Government of \nNigeria to ensure that its security forces are properly trained, so \nthat nonviolent protest is never again met with violent repression.\n  At a time when the Niger Delta is increasingly threatened by violence \nand instability from past failures to address these long-standing \ngrievances, it is urgent that we honor the legacy of Ken Saro-Wiwa and \nthe Ogoni people by seeking creative, nonviolent solutions to the \nenvironmental and social problems that plague the region. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution as an important step in that \ndirection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12693-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 304--TO DESIGNATE THE PERIOD BEGINNING ON NOVEMBER 1, \n   2005 AND ENDING ON OCTOBER 31, 2006 AS THE YEAR OF POLIO EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Corzine) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 304\n\n       Whereas 2005 is the 50th anniversary of the injectable \n     polio vaccine;\n       Whereas the polio vaccines eliminated naturally occurring \n     polio cases in the United States but have not yet eliminated \n     polio in other parts of the world;\n       Whereas as few as 57 percent of American children receive \n     all doses of necessary vaccines during childhood, including \n     the polio vaccine;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     recommends that every child in the United States receive all \n     doses of the inactivated polio vaccine;\n       Whereas the success of the polio vaccines has caused people \n     to forget the 1,630,000 Americans born before the development \n     of the vaccines who had polio during the epidemics in the \n     middle of the 20th century;\n       Whereas at least 70 percent of paralytic polio survivors \n     and 40 percent of nonparalytic polio survivors are developing \n     post-polio sequelae, which are unexpected and often disabling \n     symptoms that occur about 35 years after the poliovirus \n     attack, including overwhelming fatigue, muscle weakness, \n     muscle and joint pain, sleep disorders, heightened \n     sensitivity to anesthesia, cold pain, and difficulty \n     swallowing and breathing;\n       Whereas 2005 is the 131st anniversary of the diagnosis of \n     the first case of post-polio sequelae and is the 21st \n     anniversary of the creation of the International Post-Polio \n     Task Force;\n       Whereas research and clinical work by members of the \n     International Post-Polio Task Force have discovered that \n     post-polio sequelae can be treated, and even prevented, if \n     polio survivors are taught to conserve energy and use \n     assistive devices to stop damaging and killing the reduced \n     number of overworked, poliovirus-damaged neurons in the \n     spinal cord and brain that survived the polio attack;\n       Whereas many medical professionals, and polio survivors, do \n     not know of the existence of post-polio sequelae, or of the \n     available treatments; and\n       Whereas the mission of the International Post-Polio Task \n     Force includes educating medical professionals and the \n     world's 20,000,000 polio survivors about post-polio sequelae \n     through the international Post-Polio Letter Campaign, The \n     Post-Polio Institute at New Jersey's Englewood Hospital and \n     Medical Center, the publication of The Polio Paradox, and the \n     television public service announcement provided by the \n     National Broadcasting Company: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the need for every child, in America and \n     throughout the world, to be vaccinated against polio;\n       (2) recognizes the 1,630,000 Americans who survived polio, \n     their new battle with post-polio sequelae, and the need for \n     education and appropriate medical care;\n       (3) requests that every State designate the period \n     beginning on November 1, 2005 and ending on October 31, 2006 \n     as the ``Year of Polio Education'' to promote vaccination and \n     post-polio sequelae education and treatment; and\n       (4) requests that all appropriate Federal departments and \n     agencies take immediate action to educate--\n       (A) the people of the United States about the need for \n     polio vaccination; and\n       (B) polio survivors and medical professionals in the United \n     States about the cause and treatment of post-polio sequelae.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to submit \na resolution to designate November 1, 2005 to October 31, 2006 as the \nYear of Polio Education.\n  During the 1940s and the early 1950s, between 30,000 and 50,000 cases \nof polio were recorded annually in the United States, causing \nwidespread fear and panic. I recall as a youngster attending a public \nswimming pool in Wichita, KS, and wondering if going to the swimming \npool would cause polio.\n  Polio is a viral illness that leads to paralysis. The polio virus \ndamages nerves that control muscles, which results in muscle weakness. \nIn severe cases of polio, a person may lose the ability to move their \narms and legs, the ability to breathe without help, or die.\n  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the most famous symbol of how \nphysically debilitating polio can be. Yet despite the paralysis of his \nlegs, he was a magnificent President and a great leader of the United \nStates during the Depression and World War II.\n  This year, 2005, marks the 50th anniversary of the successful \nnationwide trial to administer the injectable polio vaccine to \nchildren. While the invention of injectable polio vaccines eliminated \nnaturally occurring polio cases in the United States, some American \nchildren did not receive the polio vaccine necessary to protect them. \nOn September 29, 2005, the first of four children from a rural \nMinnesota Amish community was diagnosed with polio. While none of the \nfour have suffered paralytic symptoms, the occurrence underscores the \nneed for vaccinations.\n  The need for continued diligence to protect this country's youth from \npolio and other illnesses is critical. As chairman of the Labor, Health \nand Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies--LHHS--\nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have worked to provide $101.25 million \nin the fiscal year 2006 Senate LHHS Appropriations bill for global \npolio eradication, an increase of $500,000 since 2005. These funds \nprovide polio vaccinations internationally in locations where naturally \noccurring polio has not been eradicated. Further, I have supported \n$461.5 million for the vaccine for children program as part of the \nfiscal year 2006 Senate LHHS Appropriations bill, an increase of $41 \nmillion since 2005. This program helps families of children who may not \notherwise have access to vaccines by providing free vaccines to doctors \nwho serve them.\n  This year is also the 131st anniversary of the first diagnosed case \nof post-polio sequelae. Post-polio sequelae is a condition that may \ndevelop several decades after a person has had polio, which affects the \nmuscles and nerves, causing weakness, fatigue, pain, and other \nsymptoms. Approximately 70 percent of paralytic polio survivors and 40 \npercent non-paralytic polio survivors, develop this illness.\n  The need for continued polio and polio vaccinations education are \nimportant to the health of all Americans, especially children. I \nencourage my colleagues to work with Senator Corzine and me to move \nthis legislation forward promptly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12693-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12693-S12694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 305--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                           VETERANS DAY 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nAlexander, Mr.  Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, \nMr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nBunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nChafee, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nColeman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Craig, \nMr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. DeMint, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, \nMr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Martinez, Mr. McCain, Ms. Mikulski, \nMs. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, \nMr. Salazar, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Sununu, Mr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \nVoinovich,\n\n[[Page S12694]]\n\nMr. Warner, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 307\n\n       Whereas in 1898, the Philippines Archipelago was acquired \n     by the United States of America, became an organized United \n     States territory in 1902, and, in preparation for her \n     independence, a self-governing commonwealth in 1935;\n       Whereas the people of the Philippines and of the United \n     States developed strong ties throughout the decades-long \n     democratic transition of the island, compelling the United \n     States to assume the responsibilities of defending the \n     archipelago and protecting the people of the Philippines;\n       Whereas on July 26, 1941, anticipating the aggression of \n     Japanese invasion forces in the Asia Pacific region, as well \n     as the imminent conflict between the United States and Japan, \n     President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a military order, \n     calling the organized military forces of the Government of \n     Commonwealth of the Philippines into armed service under the \n     command of United States Army officers led by General Douglas \n     MacArthur;\n       Whereas on December 7, 1941, the Japanese Government began \n     a devastating 4-year war with the United States with their \n     stealth bombing attacks of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Clark \n     Air Field, Philippines, and led to the loss of tens of \n     thousands of American and Filipino soldiers and countless \n     civilian casualties;\n       Whereas on February 20, 1946, President Harry Truman \n     stated, ``Philippine Army veterans are nationals of the \n     United States and will continue in that status until July 4, \n     1946. They fought, as American nationals, under the American \n     flag, and under the direction of our military leaders.

I consider it a moral obligation of the United \n     States to look after the welfare of the Philippine Army \n     veterans.'';\n       Whereas on October 17, 1996, President William J.

Mr. President, this Friday, November 11, is celebrated in \nthis country as Veterans Day. It is always held on the 11th of November \nin memory of the end of World War I. In that ``War to End All Wars'' \nwhat wishful, optimistic thinking. All guns were laid down on the \neleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, at 11 o'clock \na.m. on November 11, 1918. On that fateful hour, I am sure that many \nprayers of thanksgiving flew heavenward as Doughboys and their families \nrejoiced at their survival in spite of the most bitter and horrible \nfighting the world had yet experienced.\n  World War I saw the introduction of new and more deadly forms of \nwarfare, as technology and chemistry were brought to bear on the \nbattlefield. Horses were replaced by the first crude tanks and self-\npropelled guns. Monoplanes and biplanes brought warfare to the skies \noverhead for the first time.\n  Chemical weapons, terrible and deadly, clouded the trenches. Diseases \nstalked the fields as well, from trenchfoot to the deadly Spanish flu \nthat killed combatants and civilians alike. It was a dreadful time, one \nthat would surely erase the desire to battle, if only that desire could \nbe wiped from the human genome.\n  In 2005, in wake of World War II, the Korean war, the Vietnam \nconflict, the cold war and repeated conflicts in the Balkans, in Iraq, \nand in Afghanistan, World War I seems almost quaint. There was no \nthreat of nuclear war bringing vast destruction to our homeland. There \nwas no threat of terrorist attacks against innocent civilians. There \nwas some respect for noncombatants, and there were no kidnappings or \nconcentration camps.\n  Today's battlefield is amorphous. It touches humanitarian volunteers \nand journalists. It strikes at soldiers in their weary bivoacs, and it \nthreatens to reach again into our everyday lives and travels. Our \nbattle-stained soldiers get no rest.\n  This Veterans Day, we are at war on three fronts. First, let us never \nforget that we have troops in Afghanistan, still struggling to defeat \nthe remnants of those who attacked us on September 11, 2001. They do \nnot receive as much press coverage as the conflict in Iraq, but their \nfight is taking place in the heartland of the Taliban, the refuge of \nlast resort for the mastermind of the 9/11 attack, Osama bin Laden. Our \nprayers go out to those brave men and women who labor in the deserts \nand the high, cold mountains of that embattled land. Your efforts and \nyour sacrifices are not forgotten.\n  Second, we also have troops in Iraq, in a battle of our choosing. It \nis a battle that is consuming a high and bloody price on each difficult \nday. Our anxious prayers are with those men and women too, who must \nface each day not knowing what is around each comer or along each \ndangerous roadway. They may be sure, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that \nwhatever we do\n\n[[Page S12704]]\n\nhere to question or investigate the circumstances that led to their \ndeployment to Iraq, they have our unwavering respect and support in \naddition to our prayers. Those of their comrades who have paid a dear \nprice and who lie wounded in hospitals have our thanks and sincere \nwishes for a speedy recovery. To the families who have lost a loved one \nin battle in service to our Nation, we owe a great debt.\n  They have no Veterans Day prayer of thanksgiving, only the honored \nmemory of their loved one.\n  Our third war is taking place at home, as the Nation struggles to put \nin place protections to deter, prevent, or respond to a terror attack \nwithin our borders. The military, the Department of Homeland Security, \nand State and local first responders all must define and organize \nthemselves to meet these new threats. We are all familiar with the \nearly responses, from machine-gun wielding National Guardsmen \npatrolling our airports to fighter jets circling overhead on combat air \npatrol. We now dutifully take our shoes off for inspection before \nboarding a plane, and we park farther from public buildings. We are \nreviewing what role the military should play in responding to terror \nattacks or natural disasters. We are debating what legal protections \nand due process are due to those who are accused of involvement in \nsuspected terror plots. We are weighing what loss of privacy with \nregard to our electronic transactions, even our library book \nwithdrawals and Web searches, is commensurate with the threat to our \nsafety. These new threats have made significant changes in our way of \nlife, to be sure. Thankfully, we have not been tested again so far.\n  The changes in our daily routines are minute, however, in comparison \nto the challenges facing our men and women in uniform. Their foes wear \nno uniforms, no recognizable insignia. They travel in crowds, in taxis \nand buses, in private cars and cement trucks loaded with explosives. \nThey target diplomats, journalists, and those laboring to improve local \nliving conditions as well as those in uniform. They target their own \ncountrymen serving to keep the peace on their neighborhood streets. \nThey come from other nations, driven by a fanaticism most of us cannot \nfathom, let alone comprehend. Our men and women in uniform are fighting \nthe hardest kind of war against a chameleon foe hidden in plain sight \namong the passing crowd. They have made repeated trips to the \nbattlefield as our overstretched forces must deply and redeploy. My \nheart goes out to them and my prayers are with them.\n  American men and women in the military services customarily state \nthat they are proud to serve, proud to answer the Nation's call. Know \nthat this Senator, too is proud--proud and thankful for the bravery and \nskill of our Nation's soldiers, sailors, and airmen. And I am proud of \nthe families who support our troops with their love, their care \npackages, their prayers, and their loving welcomes home.\n  On Veterans Day, the Nation pays its respects to the men and women \nwho have served and are now serving our Nation in uniform, and who have \nfaced or are facing our foes in battle. Give them your thanks, and give \nthem their due. They are true patriots. They have faced great dangers \nfor each and every one of us.\n  Mr. President, I close with a poem by Edgar Guest:\n\n     The things that make a soldier great and send him out to die,\n     To face the flaming cannon's mouth nor ever question why,\n     Are lilacs by a little porch, the row of tulips red,\n     The peonies and pansies, too, the old petunia bed,\n     The grass plot where his children play, the roses on the \n           wall:\n     'Tis these that make a soldier great.\n     He's fighting for them all.\n\n     'Tis not the pomp and pride of kings that make a soldier \n           brave;\n     'Tis not allegiance to the flag that over him may wave;\n     For soldiers never fight so well on land or on the foam;\n     As when behind the cause they see the little place called \n           home.\n     Endanger but that humble street whereon his children run, You \n           make a soldier of the man who never bore a gun.\n\n     What is it through the battle smoke the valiant soldier sees?\n     The little garden far away, the budding apple trees,\n     The little patch of ground back there, the children at their \n           play,\n     Perhaps a tiny mound behind the simple church of gray.\n     The golden thread of courage isn't linked to castle dome;\n     But to the spot, where'er it be--the humblest spot called \n           home.\n\n     And now the lilacs bud again and all is lovely there,\n     And homesick soldiers far away know spring is in the air;\n     The tulips come to bloom again, the grass once more is green,\n     And every man can see the spot where all his joys have been.\n     He sees his children smile at him, he hears the bugle call,\n     And only death can stop him now--he's fighting for them all.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we observe Veterans Day on an \nanniversary of a day when war ended and our Nation was again at peace. \nNovember 11, 1918, Armistice Day, has been a day we use to remember our \ndebt to all who have worn the uniform of the United States.\n  Our veterans have borne the costs of America's wars and have \nsacrificed so that not only our Nation but also our world can be free \nfrom terror. Today, every veteran can be certain, the Nation you serve \nand the people you defend are grateful.\n  Today more than 25 million Americans are either veterans or retired \nmilitary. This number includes men and women from World War I, World \nWar II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Every \nVeteran has their own story of how they entered military service. Many \nenlisted on December 8, 1941, or at the beginning of other conflicts. \nSome began their military careers at a service academy or with a letter \nfrom the U.S. government. Yet when their service is complete, veterans \nof every era, every background, every branch, have certain shared \ncommitments and experiences that form bonds that will last a lifetime.\n  America's war veterans have fought for the security of this Nation \nand for the safety and peace of the world. They have humbled tyrants \nand defended the innocent and oppressed. The men and women of our Armed \nForces have engaged the enemy on many fronts and confronted grave \ndangers to defend the safety of the American people. They serve and \nfight today, and their great achievements are added to American \nhistory. Americans are forever grateful for their honor, their courage, \nand their sacrifice.\n  Today and every day, the prayers of the American people are with \nthose who wear our country's uniform. They follow a great tradition \nhanded down to them by America's veterans. Our veterans from every era \nare the finest of citizens. We owe them the life we know today. They \ncommand the respect of the people, and they have our lasting gratitude.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, tomorrow the Nation will pause to honor \nthose brave Americans who have so selflessly served our country in the \nArmed Forces. For more than 200 years, men and women have proudly worn \nthe uniform of the United States. In peacetime and in wartime, these \nselfless individuals have served and sacrificed on our behalf, many of \nthem far away from their homes and from their families. Too may of them \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice, and too many others bear the \npermanent scars of war, both seen and unseen. We owe them--and their \nfamilies--our deepest, heartfelt gratitude.\n  As we prepare to mark Veterans Day in the United States with \nappropriate ceremonies and recognitions such as those that will take \nplace in big cities and small towns across my home State of Wisconsin, \nmen and women from my State and across our country will be continuing \nto serve with honor and distinction on our behalf in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand elsewhere. Their dedication to this great country--and that of \nthose who served before them--should inspire us all.\n  These quiet heroes can be found in all of our communities--in our \nfamilies, within our circles of friends and acquaintances, in our \nschools, at our places of worship, at the local barber shop or salon, \nand at various neighborhood gathering places. Many of our veterans, \nwhile intensely patriotic and proud of their service--to our country, \ndecline to talk in detail about their own acts of courage. Such \nhumility is a testament to the selfless nature of these individuals. It \nis also a reminder\n\n[[Page S12705]]\n\nof the sometimes painful burden that too many of our veterans carry as \na result of their service--a burden that may include memories of \nwartime experiences that are too personal to share even with the \nclosest of family members and friends.\n  These men and women show their pride in and dedication to their \ncountry in ways large and small, but do not call attention to their own \nheroism. Many of them continue to serve their fellow Americans and \ntheir fellow veterans though active membership in veterans service \norganization and other community groups. Others talk to school and \nyouth groups about the importance of service, and many work tirelessly \nto keep alive the memories of those who did not return home.\n  Thousands of veterans around the country will gather proudly tomorrow \nfor events marking Veterans Day. November 11 is a date with special \nsignificance in our history. On that day in 1918--at the eleventh hour \nof the eleventh day of the eleventh month--World War I ended. In 1926, \na joint resolution of Congress called on the President to issue a \nproclamation to encourage all Americans to mark this day by displaying \nthe United States flag and by observing it with appropriate ceremonies.\n  In 1938, Armistice Day was designated as a legal holiday ``to be \ndedicated to the cause of world peace'' by an act of Congress. This \nannual recognition of the contributions and sacrifices of our Nation's \nWorld War I veterans was renamed Veterans Day in 1954 so that we might \nalso recognize the service and sacrifice of those who had fought in \nWorld War II and the veterans of all of America's other wars.\n  We owe these brave men and women our gratitude, and we also owe them \nour best efforts to ensure they know about and receive the Federal \nbenefits and services that they have earned through their service to \nour country. I have long been concerned that too many veterans and \nmilitary personnel are unaware of benefits and programs that are \navailable to them through the Departments of Veterans Affairs and \nDefense and a number of other Federal agencies. I will continue my work \nto ensure that all veterans know about the benefits for which they may \nbe eligible. I will also continue to support efforts to fully fund VA \nhealth care programs so that all veterans who wish to take advantage of \ntheir health care benefits are able to do so. No veteran should have to \nwait months to see a doctor or should be told that he or she is barred \nfrom enrolling in the VA health care system because of a lack of \nfunding.\n  In addition, I am committed to ensuring that our current military \npersonnel receive adequate health care and transition services, \nincluding mental health services, as they return from deployments \nabroad and when they return to civilian life. I am pleased that earlier \nthis week the Senate passed an amendment that I offered to the fiscal \nyear 2006 Defense authorization bill which is based on legislation I \nintroduced in June, the Veterans Enhanced Transition Services Act, VETS \nAct. This amendment represents another step toward enhancing and \nstrengthening transition services that are provided to our military \npersonnel by making a number of improvements to the existing transition \nand post-deployment/pre-discharge health assessment programs.\n  My amendment will ensure that members of the National Guard and \nReserve who have been on active duty continuously for at least 180 days \nare able to participate in transition programs and requires that \nadditional information be included in these transition programs, such \nas details about employment and reemployment rights and a description \nof the health care and other benefits to which personnel may be \nentitled through the VA. The amendment also requires that demobilizing \nmilitary personnel have access to follow-up care for physical or \npsychological conditions incurred as a result of their service. In \naddition, the amendment requires that assistance be provided to \neligible military personnel to enroll in the VA health care system.\n  Mr. President, as we reflect upon the solemn meaning of this day, let \nus keep all of our veterans and their families in our thoughts. These \nmen and women are examples of the best that our country has to offer, \nand they deserve our support--both during times of conflict and after \nthe battles have ended and these valiant men and women have come home \nto their families and their communities. As we reflect upon the service \nof these courageous individuals on this Veterans Day, we should also \nredouble our commitment to continue to honor and support America's \nbrave veterans, military personnel, and their families on this day and \nthroughout the year.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nveterans of our armed services. As combat operations continue in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, Veterans Day provides an important opportunity to \nhonor those men and women who have made such great sacrifices for our \nNation, both young and old.\n  Veterans Day is a time to reflect upon and celebrate the \nextraordinary contributions of all those who have served our country in \nuniform.\n  Veterans Day originated on November 11, 1918, as Armistice Day, \ncommemorating the end of World War I. Although Veterans Day originally \nmarked the end of a conflict, it now is an important reminder that our \nresponsibility to veterans extends far beyond the close of hostilities.\n  First, I believe it is important that we pause and pay tribute to the \napproximately 160,000 troops still fighting in the regions of Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Sadly, more than 2,000 soldiers have paid the ultimate sacrifice. \nNumerous others have experienced serious injury and harm.\n  With thousands and thousands of veterans coming home from this war, \nwe must prepare for their return and ensure that they receive the care \nand benefits they deserve.\n  Today, there are 24.5 million living veterans in the United States. \nAnd I am proud that California is home to the most veterans in the \ncountry--over 2.3 million.\n  As California's senior Senator, I am honored to serve as the ranking \nmember of the Military Construction and Veteran Affairs Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n  In July of this year, the Senate approved a spending package that \nprovides over $70.7 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nover $1 billion more than the administration's request.\n  The appropriated funds contain $23.3 billion for medical services, \nincluding nearly $2 billion in emergency funding to address the fiscal \nyear 2006 shortfall.\n  The Senate and House are currently in conference to reconcile \ndifferences between the two Chambers' respective bills. It is my hope \nthat we will finish conference on a final version of the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill and send it to \nthe President for his signature over the next several days.\n  In addition to medical services and research, the Senate bill also \nallocates $104 million for extended care facilities for our veterans. \nWith 9.5 million Veterans over the age of 65, the need for properly \nfunded long-term care is more important than ever.\n  To date, a quarter of a million veterans of Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have been discharged from Active \nDuty.\n  Of these, 49,000 have sought care from the Veterans Administration. \nAs a nation we must fully meet our responsibilities to the veterans of \nthis country.\n  Advances in medicine have thankfully spared many veterans of Iraq and \nAfghanistan from death, but roadside explosives and other weapons have \nleft many of our troops maimed and disabled. To better serve wounded \nveterans, the Senate recently allocated $412 million for medical and \nprosthetics research.\n  There should not be any doubt that these brave men and women have \ngiven their all to protect freedom and our way of life.\n  It is estimated that 500,000 veterans spent all or part of this past \nyear homeless. But tragically, the VA only has the capabilities to \nassist one-fifth of all homeless veterans.\n  We must continue to push for the development of an effective and \nexpansive therapeutic housing program to help these thousands of \nveterans.\n  The new funding will bring us closer to guaranteeing the health, \nsafety, and comfort of all veterans. The San Diego VA Medical Center \nalone will be able\n\n[[Page S12706]]\n\nto provide care for 2,000 additional patients.\n  It is also our responsibility to ensure that prescription drugs are \naffordable. We must also ensure that health care is accessible and that \nveterans' hospitals are provided with the proper tools and support they \nneed.\n  This is why I have consistently voted for increased funding for VA \nhealth care. Just this year I supported an amendment to the Defense \nAppropriations Act, which extends military health care benefits beyond \nretirement.\n  Noble sacrifices of past generations deserve to be remembered and \ncherished. Congress has consistently supported the construction of new \ncemeteries where the memories of our esteemed veterans can be honored \nand their legacies celebrated.\n  As a nation I believe we should also resist attempts to sell out land \nand facilities earmarked for veterans to commercial interests.\n  In west Los Angeles, pressure is increasing on the VA to develop some \nof the last open space left in the Los Angeles Basin. Land donated to \nhonor the service of veterans should be kept in the hands of veterans. \nWe cannot allow our responsibility to former servicemembers to be \nsubordinated to economic interests.\n  To truly honor veterans, our country needs to preserve the memory of \ntheir courage. I worked with my colleagues from Iowa and California to \nmake the battleship USS Iowa a permanent floating museum. The legendary \nship's service in World War II and the Korean war will serve as a \nproper tribute to the veterans who served aboard this great fighting \nship.\n  I look forward to continuing to work in service of our Nation's \nveterans. I hope you all will think of these courageous patriots beyond \nthis special day and honor our veterans and the sacrifices they made in \norder for us to remain a free, self-governing people. To our veterans, \nI extend a heartfelt thank you for your service to our country. May God \nbless each of you and your families.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor our Nation's \nveterans. Nowhere is dedication to duty and love of country more \nevident than among those who have voluntarily chosen to serve our \ncountry. Today, America honors the sons and daughters who have helped \npreserve our freedom and left a lasting legacy of selfless service.\n  Since 1954, we have designated November 11 as Veterans Day to \nremember the brave men and women who have served in our Armed Forces \nand defended our Nation. We also give our heartfelt gratitude to \ntoday's active service members and members of the National Guard and \nReserve who are serving our country as we help to maintain peace and \nsupport democracy throughout the world.\n  I am especially proud to recognize Oregon's soldiers serving in our \nArmed Forces, as they represent our State with honor and distinction \nacross the country and throughout the world. Whether protecting Iraqi \ncitizens in their historic effort to form a free and democratic state \nor helping evacuate victims of Hurricane Katrina in the gulf coast \nregion, their continued commitment to our Nation inspires us all.\n  Throughout our proud history, the United States has courageously met \nthe challenges posed by enemies of freedom. In the last 100 years, we \nhave lost some 700,000 men and women in defense of our country. As we \nrecall their noble sacrifices, it is also important to honor the \nrelatives and loved ones who help shoulder the burden of service.\n  America now faces new challenges from enemies that did not exist when \nour Nation's veterans fought in previous wars. Those who fought tyranny \nand paid the ultimate price did so for an honorable and enduring cause. \nGenerations of free and democratic people around the world join us in \nthanking the brave Americans who helped them achieve and protect their \nliberty.\n  Today, we honor the legacy of the fallen and the courage of our \nveterans and salute the values that have made the United States the \ngreatest Nation in the world. I have the highest respect for those who \nserve, and I appreciate and honor all of the men and women who continue \nto defend freedom at home and abroad. These American heroes and their \nfamilies are at the forefront of our thoughts and prayers on this \nspecial day.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, this weekend we will all return home to \nour States and march in parades and participate in memorial events. \nPersonally, I am always humbled to meet with men and women who heard \nduty calling and answered without hesitation. When duty called for \nbrave Americans to stand against the spread of tyranny and oppression--\nwhatever its many forms--they answered. They were willing to go \nanywhere--from the shores of Normandy to the islands of the Pacific to \nthe jungles of Southeast Asia, to Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf--\nthey put their lives on the line for our safety and freedom. And in \nexchange for that, our Nation owes them sincere gratitude and a promise \nof support when they return.\n  During World War II, my father was a soldier and my mother worked in \nthe War Department. During that time, my uncle Leandro was killed in \nEurope. My parents knew firsthand about the ultimate sacrifice to \nprotect America. They taught me the fundamental values I hold dear--\nlove of family, community, country and God.\n  My dad taught me something else. Four years ago, my father died at \nthe age of 85. Even though his mind was wracked with Alzheimer's, my \nfather's last wish was to be buried in his World War II uniform. My dad \nknew that there is no greater honor, in life or in death, than to love \nour country.\n  When I got to the Senate, I asked to serve on the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs. I wanted to fight for heroes like my father, uncle, \nbrothers, and nephews. In fact, my brother John, himself a veteran and \nCongressman from Colorado's third district, will speak at Veterans Day \nevents across his district tomorrow. Like millions of other veterans, \nwhose actions matched their ideals, it is time the Nation acted to keep \nthe promises it made to veterans.\n  Veterans Day is an opportunity for all of us to come together to hold \nparades and give speeches. Veterans all will hear from a number of \npoliticians tomorrow.\n  It reminds me of something a young Ben Franklin wrote to his mother \nand father in 1738:\n\n       the scripture assures me that at the last day we shall not \n     be examined by what we thought, but by what we did . . . that \n     we did good to our fellow creatures.\n\n  John Kennedy put it another way:\n\n       As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the \n     highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by \n     them.\n\n  Veterans Day is an important day, and veterans deserve every single \nword of praise that politicians utter. But our veterans deserve more \nthan good speeches. They need the Government to keep the promises it \nmade to them. We need to keep our promises to our soldiers at all \nstages of their lives, from when they first serve, to when they return \nhome, to when they pass away.\n  Our military faces very different and daunting challenges as we begin \nthe 21st century. We are fighting an enemy with a singular obsession--\nnothing less than the destruction of our way of life. We must provide \nour military with the resources to fight the war on terror and keep us \nsafe. And just as we must protect our soldiers in battle, we must serve \nthem when they return home.\n  Many of our veterans have seen and experienced things that will \ntorment them for all of their days. Many return to us damaged \nphysically and emotionally. Many will rise from the worst of it and \nwork to help others to do the same.\n  Colorado has 433,000 veterans who have fought for our freedom, and \nour state has more than 13,000 soldiers deployed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We need to show these heroes that we will support them \nwhen they come home.\n  Earlier this year, I was alarmed when I learned the VA had a $1.3 \nbillion budget shortfall and was delaying construction and rearranging \nfunds to hide the gap. I was proud to work with my colleagues on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee to pass $3.5 billion in additional funds to \ncover the shortfall this year and next.\n  This is an important first step, but we need to make sure that \nveterans never have to worry about losing their health care again. \nFirst, we need to make sure that the VA's budget process works. I have \nworked with my colleagues to successfully launch a Government \nAccountability Office investigation into what went wrong at the\n\n[[Page S12707]]\n\nVA. I also authored legislation that passed the Senate to make sure \nthat we are not surprised by this kind of news in the future.\n  Second, we need to ensure that the VA's budget is not dependent on \nthe political whims inside Washington. I believe we need to make VA \nfunding mandatory so that VA never has to ration care and veterans \nnever have to worry about losing their coverage.\n  Colorado's veterans deserve a new state-of-the-art veterans hospital \nat Fitzsimons. When negotiations between the VA, the Fitzsimons \nRedevelopment Authority, and the University of Colorado broke down, I \nwas proud to step in and help restart negotiations. This remains one of \nmy top priorities in the Senate, and I am optimistic about the \nhospital's prospects. Colorado's veterans will get a new VA medical \ncenter at Fitzsimons.\n  But veterans in the metro area are not the only ones who need better \ncare. In many rural parts of Colorado, veterans are being forced to \ndrive hundreds of miles to get basic health care at overutilized \nfacilities. This distance can lead to delayed care. And in the case of \nour aging veterans, the trip can be damaging to their health. That is \njust unacceptable.\n  Across Colorado, many brave and dedicated State officials and \nveterans groups are providing transportation services to rural \nveterans. Such volunteer programs currently exist in Alamosa, Denver, \nLa Plata, Moffat, Prowers, and Weld counties. These are successful, but \nfinancial uncertainties put them in jeopardy.\n  I am proud to have introduced the VetsRide Act to help programs like \nthese survive. The bill provides small grants to groups that provide \ntransportation or otherwise assist veterans in rural areas. This bill \nhas earned the support of 17 Senate cosponsors including 8 Republicans. \nI hope to get this legislation approved so that we can continue these \ntransportation programs that are a lifeline to our rural veterans.\n  In August, I hosted a field hearing on rural veterans issues in Grand \nJunction. Based on that hearing, I introduced legislation to require \nthe VA to reevaluate outdated policies that disadvantage rural areas in \nthe placement of new VA clinics. In September the Senate passed that \nlegislation, which hopefully will help clear the way for the veterans \nof northwestern Colorado to get a clinic that they deserve.\n  In addition, I have introduced critical legislation to improve care \nfor veterans living in rural areas, blinded veterans, and our elderly \nveterans. These are three areas where the VA is not doing enough, and a \nrelatively small investment can make a major difference in our heroes' \nquality of life.\n  As we celebrate this Veterans Day, I am reminded of a sad fact. By \n2015, the veteran population in Colorado is expected to fall by 49,500. \nMost of those will be World War II and Korean War veterans who will \ntake their rightful places of honor next to the heroes buried in the \nfour veterans cemeteries spread across Colorado.\n  I believe we need to honor the men and women who sacrificed so much \nfor our freedom by giving them a burial option close to their homes. \nYet one of the Nation's largest veterans communities, Colorado Springs, \ndoes not have a veterans cemetery. There are more than 105,000 veterans \nin the Pikes Peak Region. Despite this, the nearest veterans cemetery \nis at Fort Logan, a 70-mile trip from Springs through heavy Denver \ntraffic. I have cosponsored legislation that would fix this inequity \nand hope it will be passed by the Congress.\n  I have also cosponsored legislation this week to close a terrible \nloophole in the law that allows capital offenders to be buried at \nnational cemeteries. Our veterans deserve the dignity of not being \nburied next to murderers and monsters.\n  Since the American Revolution, nearly 1.2 million American soldiers \nhave died defending this country. Their valor is an example to us. It \nrequires us, the living, to ensure that the country they fought for \ncontinues to be worthy of their sacrifice.\n  Colorado and the Nation will not forget what our veterans have done \nand continue to do for us. We owe veterans our gratitude and our \nlifelong support.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 305) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Eisenhower \n     signed into law the Act proclaiming November 11 as Veterans \n     Day (Public Law 83-380);\n       Whereas on October 8, 1954, in anticipation of the first \n     nationwide observance of Veterans Day, President Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower issued a Presidential proclamation regarding \n     Veterans Day, which states, ``[o]n that day let us solemnly \n     remember the sacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly, \n     on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to preserve \n     our heritage of freedom, and let us reconsecrate ourselves to \n     the task of promoting an enduring peace so that their efforts \n     shall not have been in vain'';\n       Whereas veterans play important roles in communities \n     throughout the United States;\n       Whereas it is important to preserve the memory of the \n     veterans of the Nation and to teach every generation about \n     the sacrifices that all veterans have made in securing and \n     preserving the freedom that all Americans enjoy today;\n       Whereas the United States is in a time of conflict that \n     highlights the incommensurable sacrifices the brave men and \n     women of our Armed Forces have made and continue to make for \n     our Nation and its principles of freedom, justice, and \n     democracy;\n       Whereas as of October 2005, there were 433,398 new veterans \n     from the present conflict who bravely defended America;\n       Whereas November 11 is a day of solemn reflection on, and \n     commemoration of, the contributions of those who have served \n     and defended the Nation, especially those who gave the \n     ultimate sacrifice to secure the freedoms enjoyed by all \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas it is proper that the Senate observe the day with \n     appropriate tributes, commemorations, and reflection even \n     when it conducts the Nation's business: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that those that have died in war serving the Nation, \n     and the veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States, \n     living and dead, are to be honored for their contributions \n     and sacrifices to preserve the Nation and the principles of \n     freedom, justice, and democracy that all Americans hold dear;\n       (2) that Veterans Day 2005 should be commemorated with \n     appropriate tributes to all veterans of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States for their contributions and sacrifices, and \n     most especially to those who made the ultimate sacrifice; and\n       (3) that all Americans are encouraged to join the Senate in \n     honoring and paying tribute to veterans of the Armed Forces \n     of the United States on Veterans Day and throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12707-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12707-S12708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THAT VETERANS DAY IS A DAY TO HONOR ALL VETERANS OF THE \n                                  ARMY\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Roosevelt issued a military order, \n     calling the organized military forces of the Government of \n     Commonwealth of the Philippines into armed service under the \n     command of United States Army officers led by General Douglas \n     MacArthur;\n       Whereas on December 7, 1941, the Japanese Government began \n     a devastating 4-year war with the United States with their \n     stealth bombing attacks of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Clark \n     Air Field, Philippines, and led to the loss of tens of \n     thousands of American and Filipino soldiers and countless \n     civilian casualties;\n       Whereas on February 20, 1946, President Harry Truman \n     stated, ``Philippine Army veterans are nationals of the \n     United States and will continue in that status until July 4, \n     1946. They fought, as American nationals, under the American \n     flag, and under the direction of our military leaders. They \n     fought with gallantry and courage under most difficult \n     conditions. I consider it a moral obligation of the United \n     States to look after the welfare of the Philippine Army \n     veterans.'';\n       Whereas on October 17, 1996, President William J. Clinton \n     issued a proclamation on the anniversary of the 1944 return \n     of United States forces under General MacArthur to liberate \n     the Philippines and said, ``I urge all Americans to recall \n     the courage, sacrifice, and loyalty of Filipino Veterans of \n     World War II and honor them for their contribution to our \n     freedom.'';\n       Whereas on July 26, 2001, President George W. Bush, in his \n     greetings to the Filipino WWII veterans said, ``More than \n     120,000 Filipinos fought with unwavering loyalty and great \n     gallantry under the command of General Douglas MacArthur. The \n     combined United States-Philippine forces distinguished \n     themselves by their valor and heroism in defense of freedom \n     and democracy. Thousands of Filipino soldiers gave their \n     lives in the battles of Bataan and Corregidor. These soldiers \n     won for the United States the precious time needed to disrupt \n     the enemy's plan for conquest in the Pacific. During the \n     three long years following these battles, the Filipino people \n     valiantly resisted a brutal Japanese occupation with an \n     indomitable spirit and steadfast loyalty to America.''; and\n       Whereas the contributions of the Filipino people, and the \n     sacrifices of their soldiers in World War II, have not been \n     fully recognized: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate reaffirms, recognizes, and honors \n     the Filipino World War II veterans for their defense of \n     American democracy and their important contribution to the \n     victorious outcome of World War II.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12708-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12708-S12709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DESIGNATING 2006 AS THE ``YEAR OF STUDY ABROAD''\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 308, submitted early \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please report the resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 308) designating 2006 as the ``Year \n     of Study Abroad.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport a Senate resolution designating 2006 as the ``Year of Study \nAbroad.'' This resolution encourages initiatives to promote and expand \nstudy-abroad opportunities. Now more than ever, America needs citizens \nwho can understand and communicate with people all over the world. \nHowever, fewer than 1 percent of all U.S. undergraduates participate in \nstudy-abroad programs while nearly 600,000 international students from \nmore than 200 countries study in the United States each year. The \nfuture of our Nation depends on our ability to prepare the next \ngeneration of leaders for an increasingly complex global society.\n  This resolution seeks to promote study-abroad experiences as valuable \nopportunities for exposure to global knowledge and cultural \nunderstanding. An education that includes study abroad not only opens \ndoors to careers, it opens minds and worlds of possibility. Studying \nabroad can help students develop foreign language proficiency, improve \ndecisionmaking skills, and increase maturity and self-confidence. Such \nexperience can also help heighten a student's cultural sensitivity. Put \nsimply, an international education prepares U.S. citizens to live, \nwork, and compete in the global economy. Studying abroad is also an \neffective way to promote the development of a peaceful global \ncommunity, increase international trade, and create goodwill towards \nthe United States.\n  Congress recognized the importance of studying abroad in 2004 when it \nestablished the Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad \nFellowship Program. The Commission was tasked with formulating a \nnational program that would dramatically increase the number of \nAmerican students studying abroad each year. The Commission is \nscheduled to issue its recommendations on December 1 of this year. This \nresolution underscores the importance of the Commission's work and \nbuilds on the message of International Education Week, November 14 to \n18, 2005.\n  The future challenges that face all nations will require an \nunprecedented degree of understanding and cooperation among countries \nand their leaders. The experiences and lifelong friendships that result \nfrom studying abroad can help foster mutual understanding between the \nfuture leaders of the world. Such relationships and cooperation are \nvital for a secure and prosperous future, not only for the United \nStates, but for the entire world.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n\n[[Page S12709]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 308) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 308\n\n       Whereas ensuring that the citizens of the United States are \n     globally literate is the responsibility of the educational \n     system of the United States;\n       Whereas educating students internationally is an important \n     way to share the values of the United States, to create \n     goodwill for the United States around the world, to work \n     toward a peaceful global society, and to increase \n     international trade;\n       Whereas, according to a 2002 American Council on Education \n     poll, 79 percent of people in the United States agree that \n     students should have a study abroad experience sometime \n     during college, but only 1 percent of students from the \n     United States currently study abroad each year;\n       Whereas study abroad programs help people from the United \n     States to be more informed about the world and to develop the \n     cultural awareness necessary to avoid offending individuals \n     from other countries;\n       Whereas a National Geographic global literacy survey found \n     that 87 percent of students in the United States between the \n     ages of 18 and 24 cannot locate Iraq on a world map, 83 \n     percent cannot find Afghanistan, 58 percent cannot find \n     Japan, and 11 percent cannot even find the United States;\n       Whereas studying abroad exposes students from the United \n     States to valuable global knowledge and cultural \n     understanding and forms an integral part of their education;\n       Whereas Congress recognized through the Higher Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) that the security, \n     stability, and economic vitality of the United States in an \n     increasingly complex global age depend largely upon having a \n     globally competent citizenry and the availability of experts \n     specializing in world regions, foreign languages, and \n     international affairs;\n       Whereas the Coalition for International Education, an ad \n     hoc group of higher education organizations with interests in \n     the international education programs of the Department of \n     Education, and Government Accountability Office reports have \n     found that Federal agencies, educational institutions, and \n     corporations in the United States are suffering from a \n     shortage of professionals with international knowledge and \n     foreign language skills;\n       Whereas, according to the Coalition for International \n     Education, institutions of higher education in the United \n     States are struggling to graduate enough students with the \n     language skills and cultural competence necessary to meet the \n     current demands of business, government, and educational \n     institutions;\n       Whereas a survey done by the Institute for the \n     International Education of Students shows that studying \n     abroad influences subsequent educational experiences, \n     decisions to expand or change academic majors, and decisions \n     to attend graduate school;\n       Whereas substantive research literature demonstrates that \n     some of the core values and skills of higher education are \n     enhanced by participation in study abroad programs;\n       Whereas study abroad programs not only open doors to \n     foreign language learning, but also empower students to \n     better understand themselves and others through a comparison \n     of cultural values and ways of life;\n       Whereas study abroad programs for students from the United \n     States can provide specialized training and practical \n     experiences not available at institutions in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas a blue ribbon task force of NAFSA: Association of \n     International Educators, a global association of individuals \n     dedicated to advancing international education and exchange, \n     found that a national effort to promote study abroad programs \n     is needed to address a serious deficit in global competence \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the bipartisan, federally-appointed Commission on \n     the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program, \n     established pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous \n     Appropriations and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of the \n     Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (Public Law 108-199;

Mr. President, I rise to express my deepest sympathies \nto the people of Jordan, and to all of those affected by the terrorist \nattacks that occurred yesterday in Amman.\n  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his al-Qaida organization in Iraq have taken \nresponsibility for this attack, and if this is true, they have added \nstill more blood to their hands. These attacks on civilians--guests, \nworkers, a wedding party at three hotels in Jordan's capital brutally \nillustrate the hateful agenda of the terrorists. The hotels themselves \nmay have been associated with the West, but reports indicate that the \nvictims of this terrorist attack were Americans, Palestinians, Chinese, \nIndonesians, Syrians, Saudi Arabians, and, of course, Jordanians. Just \nas global terrorist networks threaten all people of all faiths, so too \ndid this attack cause terrible pain and loss for families and \ncommunities around the world.\n  Every time I read headlines like those we all read this morning, I am \nreminded of the tragedy of September 11, 2001. The American people know \nsomething about how the people of Jordan feel today. We feel grief, but \nwe also feel outrage, and these feelings merge into unshakable resolve. \nWe will work in partnership with countries and communities around the \nworld to resist and to defeat those who would have us live in fear.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 260) recognizing the \n     40th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council's promulgation \n     of Nostra Aetate, the declaration on the relation of the \n     Roman Catholic Church to non-Christian religions, and the \n     historic role of Nostra Aetate in fostering mutual \n     interreligious respect and dialogue.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to strongly encourage my \ncolleagues in the Senate to support this resolution recognizing the \n40th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on the \nRelation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions, Nostra Aetate, and \nthe continuing need for mutual interreligious respect and dialogue.\n  October 28, 2005 marked the 40th anniversary of Nostra Aetate, which \nmeans ``in our time.'' On October 28, 1965, Nostra Aetate affirmed the \nrespect of the Roman Catholic Church for Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and \nJudaism, and called upon all Catholics to engage in dialogue and \ncooperation with the followers of other religions. Nostra Aetate states \nthat the Roman Catholic Church, moved by the Gospel's spiritual love, \ndecries hatred, persecution, and displays of anti-Semitism directed at \nJews at any time and by anyone. As stated in the resolution, Nostra \nAetate marked a new relationship between Catholics and Jews worldwide \nand opened a chapter in Jewish-Christian relations that is \nunprecedented in its closeness and warmth.\n  With Nostra Aetate, Pope John Paul VI called on all Catholics not \nonly to decry the persecution of people of non-Christian religions, but \nalso to love and respect them.\n  As it is stated in a passage from Nostra Aetate: ``In our time, when \nday by day mankind is being drawn closer together, and the ties between \ndifferent peoples are becoming stronger, the Church examines more \nclosely its relationship to non-Christian religions. In her task of \npromoting unity and love among men, indeed among nations, she considers \nabove all in this declaration what men have in common and what draws \nthem to fellowship. . . . Men expect from the various religions answers \nto the unsolved riddles of the human condition, which today, even as in \nformer times, deeply stir the hearts of men: What is man? What is the \nmeaning, the aim of our life? What is moral good, what sin? Whence \nsuffering and what purpose does it serve? Which is the road to true \nhappiness? What are death, judgment and retribution after death? What, \nfinally, is that ultimate inexpressible mystery which encompasses our \nexistence: whence do we come, and where are we going?''\n  Nostra Aetate acknowledges that all people of all religions are \nunited by the fact that we are all searching for the answers to the \nmost basic questions about life and God, and that we must love and \nrespect one another, despite our differences.\n  The message of Nostra Aetate is of particular importance today, \namidst the conflict in the Middle East and terrorism in the name of \nIslam.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1558) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of \n     1978 to protect family members of filers from disclosing \n     sensitive information in a public filing and extend the \n     public filing requirement for 5 years.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Specter and I have introduced a \ncomprehensive court security measure, S. 1968, the Court Security \nImprovement Act of 2005, CSIA. Our bill responds to requests by the \njudiciary for a greater voice in working with the United States \nMarshals Service to determine their security needs. It enacts new \ncriminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal information to \nharm or threaten to seriously harm judges, their families or other \nindividuals performing official duties. It also enacts criminal \npenalties for threatening judges and Federal law enforcement officials \nby the malicious filing of false liens, provides increased protections \nfor witnesses, and makes available new resources for State courts to \nimprove security for State and local court systems. Finally, it extends \nlife insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and territorial \njudges, and health insurance to surviving spouses and families of \nFederal judges.\n  One of the provisions of CSIA extends the ``sunset'' of a provision \nfirst enacted in the ``Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of \n1998'' that grants the Judicial Conference of the United States the \nauthority to redact information from a judge's mandatory financial \ndisclosure in circumstances in which it is determined that the release \nof the information could endanger the filer or the filer's family. The \nSpecter-Leahy bill also extends the protections of this provision to \nthe family members of filers.\n  The misuse of this redaction authority has been a matter of some \nconcern to me. I appreciate that the Judicial Conference is seeking to \nimprove its practices. I offer this amendment to S. 1558, which is \ndrawn from CSIA, because none of us wants to see judges or their \nfamilies endangered. The redaction authority need not expire if there \nis agreement that it should be continued by reauthorization for another \n4-year period before another sunset. Instead, if the Senate adopts our \namendment and the House accepts the Senate\n\n[[Page S12712]]\n\nbill, the authority will be extended without interruption. I hope that \nthe House will join us without delay both in extending the redaction \nauthority and in expanding the scope of its protections to include \nfamily members.\n  I also hope that we will move quickly to pass the other important \nprovisions of CSIA so that we can better protect the dedicated women \nand men throughout the judiciary in this country who do a tremendous \njob under challenging circumstances.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nthat is at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed, the title amendment be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statement relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \njoining me in the fight against global counterfeiting--a plague on our \neconomy, on the safety of our citizens, and on our national security.\n  S. 1095, the Protecting American Goods and Services Act, or PAGS, is \nimportant legislation designed to combat the trafficking of \nillegitimate goods throughout the world--and I look forward to working \nwith our colleagues in the House of Representatives to send it to the \nPresident.\n  I am particularly pleased to work with Senator Leahy in our continued \nbipartisan effort to protect intellectual property rights as well as to \nwork on other important issues. Recently, we have worked together on a \nmatter near\n\n[[Page S12713]]\n\nand dear to my heart--good government legislation related to the \nFreedom of Information Act, and it indeed has been a pleasure to work \nwith the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and his staff again.\n  Mr. President, the rampant distribution of illegitimate goods--be it \ncounterfeited products, illegal copies of copyrighted works or any \nother form of piracy--undermines property rights, threatens American \njobs, decreases consumer safety and, often times, supports organized \ncrime and terrorist activity.\n  Amazingly, it is estimated that between and 5 percent and 7 percent \nof worldwide trade is conducted with counterfeit goods and services. \nAccording to FBI estimates, counterfeiting costs U.S. businesses as \nmuch as $200-$250 billion annually--and that costs Americans their \njobs--more than 750,000 jobs according to U.S. Customs.\n  In recent years, this plague on global trade has grown significantly. \nAccording to the World Customs Organization and Interpol, the global \ntrade in illegitimate goods has increased from $5.5 billion in 1992 to \nmore than $600 billion per year today; that is, $600 billion per year \nillegally extracted from the global economy.\n  But perhaps most troubling, the counterfeit trade threatens our \nsafety and our security. Counterfeit goods undermine our confidence in \nthe reliability of our goods and service. For example, the Federal \nAviation Administration estimates that 2 percent of the 26 million \nairline parts installed each year are counterfeit. And the Federal Drug \nAdministration estimates that as much as 10 percent of pharmaceuticals \nare counterfeit. Worse yet--evidence indicates that the counterfeit \ntrade supports terrorist activities. Indeed, alQaeda training manuals \nrecommended the sale of fake goods to raise revenue.\n  And the reach of counterfeiting runs deep in my own home State of \nTexas. Data is difficult to collect, but a 1997 piece detailing \nMicrosoft's efforts to combat counterfeiting and piracy--while dated--\npointed out that this type of activity costs Texas over 10,000 jobs and \nalmost $1 billion. Today, we know those numbers are much higher.\n  Mr. President, we must act to stop this illegal activity.\n  The legislation that we are sending over to the House today, the \nProtecting American Goods and Services Act, is not complicated, it is \nnot long--but its global impact will be significant. The legislation is \ndesigned to provide law enforcement with additional tools to curb the \nflow of these illegitimate goods and it is perhaps even more critical \nfor businesses, large and small, throughout America and for ensuring \nthe safety of consumers around the globe.\n  Those who traffic in counterfeit goods put Americans in danger, \nsupport terrorism and undermine the health of our Nation's economy. The \nPAGS Act fills certain important gaps in current counterfeiting law by \nclarifying the term ``trafficking'' to ensure that it is illegal to: \nPossess counterfeit goods with the intention of selling them; give away \ncounterfeit goods in exchange for some future benefit--in effect, the \n``bartering'' of counterfeit goods in such a way that avoids \ncriminality and import or export counterfeit goods or unauthorized \ncopies of copyrighted works.\n  This bill will protect property rights, protect consumer safety, \npreserve American jobs and bolster the American economy by cracking \ndown on the trade of illegal counterfeit goods and services.\n  Each of these items was highlighted by the Department of Justice in \nits October, 2004 report on its Task Force on Intellectual Property. In \nit, the Department describes the significant limitation law enforcement \noften times faces in pursuing counterfeiters and offers, among others, \nthe principles embraced in the Protecting American Goods and Services \nAct, as possible solutions to these obstacles.\n  This legislation, and other reforms, will help turn the tide of the \ngrowing counterfeit trade. The legislation is critically important to \nlaw enforcement--but it is even more critical for businesses, large and \nsmall, throughout America--including in my home state of Texas--as well \nas for ensuringthe safety of consumers around the globe. Those who \ntraffic in counterfeit goods put Americans in danger, support terrorism \nand undermine the health of our Nation's economy. It is time to put an \nend to this scourge on society.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation \nforward, and in so doing, protect property rights, protect consumer \nsafety, preserve American jobs and bolster the American economy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today, I am pleased that the Senate is passing S. 1095, \nthe Protecting American Goods and Services Act of 2005, which is the \nlatest of the bipartisan efforts that Senator Cornyn and I have made to \nimprove the lives of Americans through effective and efficient \ngovernment. The Protecting American Goods and Services Act of 2005 will \nstrengthen our ability to combat the escalating problem of \ncounterfeiting worldwide. In order to effectively fight intellectual \nproperty theft, we need stiff penalties for counterfeiters and those \nwho are caught with counterfeit goods with the intent to traffic their \nfalse wares. Ours is a short bill--indeed, it is only two pages long--\nbut it will have powerful global implications in the fight against \npiracy.\n  Counterfeiting is a growing problem that costs our economy hundreds \nof billions of dollars every year and has been linked to organized \ncrime, including terrorist organizations. According to the \nInternational Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, counterfeit parts have \nbeen discovered in helicopters sold to NATO, in jet engines, bridge \njoints, brake pads, and fasteners in equipment designed to prevent \nnuclear reactor meltdowns. The World Health Organization estimates that \nthe market for counterfeit drugs is about $32 billion each year.\n  Several years ago, Senator Hatch joined me in sponsoring the Anti-\ncounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of 1996, which addressed \ncounterfeiting by amending several sections of our criminal and tariff \ncodes. That law made important changes, particularly by expanding RICO, \nthe Federal antiracketeering law, to cover crimes involving \ncounterfeiting and copyright and trademark infringement. Then, as now, \ntrafficking in counterfeit goods hurts purchasers, State and Federal \nGovernments, and economies at every level.\n  Perhaps most disturbingly, the U.S. Customs Service reports that \nterrorists have used transnational counterfeiting operations to fund \ntheir activities: The sale of counterfeit and pirated music, movies, \nsoftware, T-shirts, clothing, and fake drugs ``accounts for much of the \nmoney the international terrorist network depends on to feed its \noperations.''\n  Last year, as in years past, I worked with Senator Allen on an \namendment to the Foreign Operations bill that provides the State \nDepartment with vital resources to combat piracy of U.S. goods abroad. \nThe bill we ultimately passed included $3 million for this important \npurpose. Yet more work both at home and abroad remains. When you \nconsider that the economic impact of tangible piracy in counterfeit \ngoods is estimated to be roughly $350 billion a year and to constitute \nbetween 5 percent and 7 percent of worldwide trade, a few million \ndollars is a worthwhile investment.\n  We have certainly seen how this form of theft touches the lives of \nhard-working Vermonters. Burton Snowboards is a small company, whose \ninnovation has made it an industry leader in snowboarding equipment and \napparel. Unfortunately, knockoff products carrying Burton's name have \nbeen found across the globe. Vanessa Price, a representative of Burton, \ntestified about counterfeiting at the Judiciary Committee's March 23, \n2004, hearing on this topic. In addition to learning about the economic \ncosts of counterfeiting, I asked her after the hearing about the risks \nposed to consumers by these goods. Her answer was chilling: ``In the \nweeks since my Senate testimony, I discovered a shipment of counterfeit \nBurton boots for sale through a discount sports outfit . . . After \nexamining the poor quality of the counterfeit boots, we determined that \nanyone using the boots for snowboarding risks injury due to a lack of \nreinforcement and support in the product's construction.''\n\n  Customers and businesses lose out to counterfeiters in other ways, \ntoo. SB Electronics in Barre, VT has seen its\n\n[[Page S12714]]\n\ncapacitors reverse engineered and its customers lost to inferior \ncopycat models. Vermont Tubbs, a furniture manufacturer in Rutland, has \nseen its designs copied, produced offshore with inferior craftsmanship \nand materials, and then reimported, so that the company is competing \nagainst cheaper versions of its own products. And Hubbardton Forge in \nCastleton, VT has seen its beautiful and original lamps counterfeited \nand then sold within the United States at prices--and quality--far \nbelow their own. This is wrong. It is unfair to consumers who deserve \nthe high quality goods they think they are paying for, and it is unfair \nto innovators who play by the rules and deserve to profit from their \nlabor.\n  The Protecting American Goods and Services Act of 2005 will help to \ncombat this growing scourge. It amends the definition of trafficking in \nthe counterfeit law to criminalize the possession of counterfeit goods \nwith the intent to sell or traffic in those goods, as well as to \ninclude any distribution of counterfeits with the expectation of \ngaining something of value--criminals should not be able to skirt the \nlaw simply because they barter illegal goods and services in exchange \nfor their illicit wares. Finally, the bill's new definition will \ncriminalize the importation and exportation of counterfeit goods, as \nwell as of bootleg copies of copyrighted works into and out of the \nUnited States.\n  By tying off these loopholes and improving U.S. laws on \ncounterfeiting, we will be sending a powerful message to the criminals \nwho belong in jail, and to our innovators.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Sung, 87 \n     F.3d 194 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, counterfeiting threatens the American \neconomy, our workers, and our consumers. I am pleased that the Senate \nhas today taken an important step towards beating back that threat, by \npassing S. 1699, the ``Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act.'' \nSenator Specter is the principal cosponsor, and I know that he shares \nwith me the conviction that this bill that will give law enforcement \nimproved tools to fight counterfeit trademarks, and that it could work \na significant change in the efforts to combat this type of theft. So \nare all our cosponsors, and I thank them: Senators Alexander, Bayh, \nBrownback, Coburn, Cornyn, DeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Hatch, \nKyl, Levin, Reed, Stabenow, and Voinovich.\n  It is all too easy to think of counterfeiting as a victimless crime, \na means of buying sunglasses or a purse that would otherwise strain a \nmonthly budget. The reality, however, is far different. According to \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, counterfeiting costs the U.S. \nbetween $200 billion and $250 billion annually. In Vermont, companies \nlike Burton Snowboards, Vermont Tubbs, SB Electronics, and Hubbardton \nForge--all of which have cultivated their good names through pure hard \nwork and creativity--have felt keenly the damage of intellectual \nproperty theft on their businesses. This is wrong. It is simply not \nfair to the businesses who innovate and to the people whose economic \nlivelihoods depend on these companies.\n  The threat posed by counterfeiting is more than a matter of \neconomics. Inferior products can threaten the safety of those who use \nthem. When a driver taps a car's brake pedals there should be no \nuncertainty about whether the brake linings are made of compressed \ngrass, sawdust, or cardboard. Sick patients should not have to that \nthey will ingest counterfeit prescription drugs and, at best, have no \neffect. The World Health Organization estimates that the market for \ncounterfeit drugs is about $32 billion each year. Knock-off parts have \neven been found in NATO helicopters. What's more, according to \nInterpol, there is an identifiable link between counterfeit goods and \nthe financing of terrorist operations.\n  S. 1699 makes several improvements to the U.S. Code. The bill \nstrengthens 18 U.S.C. 2318, the part of the criminal code that deals \nwith counterfeit goods and services, to make it a crime to traffic in \ncounterfeit labels or packaging, even when counterfeit labels or \npackaging are shipped separately from the goods to which they will \nultimately be attached. Savvy counterfeiters have exploited this \nloophole to escape liability. This bill closes that loophole.\n  The bill will also make counterfeit labels and goods, and any \nequipment used in facilitating a crime under this part of the code, \nsubject to forfeiture upon conviction. Any forfeited goods or machinery \nwould then be destroyed, and the convicted infringer would have to pay \nrestitution to the lawful owner of the trademark. Finally, although the \nbill is tough, it is also fair. It states that nothing ``shall entitle \nthe United States to bring a cause of action under this section for the \nrepackaging of genuine goods or services not intended to deceive or \nconfuse.'' It is truly just the bad actors we want to punish.\n  Those who profit from another's innovation have proved their \ncreativity only at escaping responsibility for their actions. As \nlegislators it is important that we provide law enforcement with the \ntools needed to capture these thieves. I am committed to this effort, \nand will continue to sponsor legislation that will support law \nenforcement in the protection of the intellectual property rights that \nare so important to the American economy and its creative culture.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to speak about S. \n1699, the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005, a bill \nI have sponsored with Senator Leahy and fifteen other cosponsors--\nSenators Alexander, Bayh, Brownback, Coburn, Cornyn, DeWine, Durbin, \nFeingold, Feinstein, Hatch, Kyl, Levin, Reed, Stabenow, and Voinovich.\n  The Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act addresses a problem \nthat has reached epidemic proportions as a result of a loophole in our \ncriminal code: the trafficking in counterfeit labels. Criminal law \ncurrently prohibits the trafficking in counterfeit trademarks ``on or \nin connection with goods or services.'' However, it does not prohibit \nthe trafficking in the counterfeit marks themselves. As such, there is \nnothing in current law to prohibit an individual from selling \ncounterfeit labels bearing otherwise protected trademarks within the \nUnited States.\n  This loophole was exposed by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in \nUnited States v. Giles, 213 F.3d 1247--10th Cir. 2000. In this case, \nthe United States prosecuted the defendant for manufacturing and \nselling counterfeit Dooney & Bourke labels that third parties could \nlater affix to generic purses. Examining Title 18, section 2320, of the \nUnited States Code, the Tenth Circuit held that persons who sell \ncounterfeit trademarks that are not actually attached to any ``goods or \nservices'' do not violate the federal criminal trademark infringement \nstatute. Since the defendant did not attach counterfeit marks to \n``goods or services,'' the court found that the defendant did not run \nafoul of the criminal statute as a matter of law. Thus, someone caught \nred-handed with counterfeit trademarks walked free.\n  S. 1699 closes this loophole by amending Title 18, section 2320 of \nthe United States Code to criminally prohibit the trafficking, or \nattempt to traffic, in ``labels, patches, stickers'' and generally any \nitem to which a counterfeit mark has been applied. In so doing, S. 1699 \nprovides U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors with the means not only \nto prosecute individuals trafficking in counterfeit goods or services, \nbut also individuals trafficking in labels, patches, and the like that \nare later applied to goods.\n  Congress must act expeditiously to protect U.S. held trademarks to \nthe fullest extent of the law. The recent ten count indictment of four \nMassachusetts residents of conspiracy to traffic in approximately $1.4 \nmillion of counterfeit luxury goods in the case of U.S. v. Luong et \nal., 2005 D. Mass. underscores the need for this legislation. According \nto the indictment, law enforcement officers raided self-storage units \nearlier this year and found the units to hold approximately 12,231 \ncounterfeit handbags; 7,651 counterfeit wallets; more than 17,000 \ngeneric handbags and wallets; and enough counterfeit labels and \nmedallions to turn more than 50,000 generic handbags and wallets into \ncounterfeits. Although the U.S. Attorneys Office was able to pursue \ncharges of trafficking and attempting to traffic in counterfeit \nhandbags and wallets, they could not bring charges for trafficking and \nattempting to traffic in the more than 50,000 counterfeit labels and \nmedallions. As such, these defendants will escape prosecution that \nwould have otherwise been illegal if they had only been attached to an \notherwise generic bag. This simply does not make sense and had the Stop \nCounterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005 been in effect at the \ntime of indictment, U.S. prosecutors would have been able to bring \ncharges against the defendants for trafficking and attempting to \ntraffic in not only counterfeit goods, but also counterfeit labels.\n  As Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher said, ``Those who \nmanufacture and sell counterfeit goods steal business from honest \nmerchants, confuse or\n\n[[Page S12716]]\n\ndefraud honest consumers, and illegally profit on the backs of honest \nAmerican workers and entrepreneurs.'' This point is underscored by the \nBureau of Customs and Border Protection estimate that trafficking in \ncounterfeit goods costs the United States approximately $200 to $250 \nmillion annually. With each passing year, the United States loses \nmillions of dollars in tax revenues to the sale of counterfeit goods. \nFurther, each counterfeit item that is manufactured overseas and \ndistributed in the United States costs American workers tens of \nthousands of jobs. With counterfeit goods making up a growing 5-7 \npercent of wor1d trade, this is a problem that we can no longer ignore.\n  To be sure, counterfeiting is not limited to the popular designer \ngoods that we have all seen sold on comers of just about every major \nmetropolitan city in the United States. Counterfeiting has a \ndevastating impact on a broad range of industries. In fact, for almost \nevery legitimate product manufactured and sold within the United \nStates, there is a parallel counterfeit product being sold for no more \nthan half the price. These counterfeit products range from children's \ntoys to clothing to Christmas tree lights. More frightening are the \nthousands of counterfeit automobile parts, batteries, and electrical \nequipment that are being manufactured and placed into the stream of \ncommerce with each passing day. I am told that the level of \nsophistication in counterfeiting has reached the point that you can no \nlonger distinguish between the real and the counterfeit good or label \nwith the naked eye. However, just because these products look the same \ndoes not mean that they have the same quality characteristics. The \ncounterfeit products are not subject to the same quality controls of \nlegitimate products, resulting in items that are lower in quality and \nlikely to fall apart. In fact, counterfeit products could potentially \nkill unsuspecting American consumers.\n  In addition to closing the ``counterfeit label loophole,'' the Stop \nCounterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act strengthens the criminal code \nand provides heightened penalties for those trafficking in counterfeit \nmarks. Current law does not provide for the seizure and forfeiture of \ncounterfeit trademarks, whether they are attached to goods or not. \nTherefore, many times such counterfeit goods are seized one day, only \nto be returned and sold to an unsuspecting public. To ensure that \nindividuals engaging in the practice of trafficking in counterfeit \nmarks cannot reopen their doors, S. 1699 establishes procedures for the \nmandatory seizure, forfeiture, and destruction of counterfeit marks \nprior to a conviction. Further, it provides for procedures for the \nmandatory forfeiture and destruction of property derived from or used \nto engage in the trafficking of counterfeit marks.\n  In crafting the language in Section 2(b)(I)(B) of this bill \npertaining to the forfeiture authority of the U.S. Department of \nJustice, Senator Leahy and I discussed the scope of the facilitation \nlanguage, which parallels the drug and money laundering forfeiture \nlanguage in 21 U.S.C. 853 and 18 U.S.C. 982, respectively, and how it \nmight relate to Internet marketplace companies, search engines, and \nISPs. Specifically, we were aware of concerns regarding the potential \nmisapplication of the facilitation language in Section 2(b)(1)(B) to \npursue forfeiture and seizure proceedings against responsible Internet \nmarketplace companies that serve as third party intermediaries to \nonline transactions. To this end, I would like to make it clear for the \nrecord that this bill is not intended to apply to ``good actor'' \nInternet service providers that serve as third party intermediaries to \nonline transactions and take demonstrable steps to prevent the exchange \nor trafficking of counterfeit goods on their networks.\n  Does Senator Leahy agree?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with the Senator.\n  Section 2(b)(1)(B) authorizes U.S. Attorneys to pursue civil in rem \nforfeiture proceedings against ``any property used, in any manner or \npart, to commit or to facilitate the commission of a violation of \nsubsection (a).'' The intent of this language is to provide attorneys \nand prosecutors with the authority to bring a civil forfeiture action \nagainst the property of bad actors who are facilitating trafficking or \nattempts to traffic in counterfeit marks. The forfeiture authority in \nSection 2(b)(1)(B) cannot be used to pursue forfeiture and seizure \nproceedings against the computer equipment, website or network of \nresponsible Internet marketplace companies, who serve solely as a \nthird-party to transactions and do not tailor their services or their \nfacilities to the furtherance of trafficking or attempts to traffic in \ncounterfeit marks. However, these Internet marketplace companies must \nmake demonstrable good faith efforts to combat the use of their systems \nand services to traffic in counterfeit marks. Companies must establish \nand implement procedures to take down postings that contain or offer to \nsell goods, services, labels, and the like in violation of this act \nupon being made aware of the illegal nature of these items or services.\n  It is the irresponsible culprits that must be held accountable. Those \nwho profit from another's innovation have proved their creativity only \nat escaping responsibility for their actions. As legislators it is \nimportant that we provide law enforcement with the tools needed to \ncapture these thieves.\n  It is also my understanding that the U.S. Sentencing Commission \nrecently promulgated new Federal sentencing guidelines to count for the \nchanges in how intellectual property crimes are committed. Could the \nSenator from Pennsylvania clarify for the Record why we have authorized \nthe U.S. Sentencing Commission to further amend the Federal sentencing \nguidelines and policy statements for crimes committed in violation of \nTitle 18, section 2318 or 2320, of the United States Code?\n  Mr. SPECTER. As the Senator is aware, the Sentencing Commission has \nsought to update the Federal sentencing guidelines upon the periodic \ndirective of Congress to reflect and account for changes in the manner \nin which intellectual property offenses are committed. The recent \namendments to which you refer were promulgated by the Sentencing \nCommission pursuant to the authorization in the Family Entertainment \nand Copyright Act of 2005, also known as FECA. These amendments to the \nFederal sentencing guidelines, which took effect on October 24, 2005, \naddress changes in penalties and definitions for intellectual property \nrights crimes, particularly those involving copyrighted pre-release \nworks and issues surrounding ``uploading.'' For example, these \nguidelines provide for a 25-percent increase in sentences for offenses \ninvolving pre-release works. In addition, the Commission revised its \ndefinition of ``uploading'' to ensure that the guidelines are keeping \nup with technological advances in this area.\n  I would like to make it clear for the record that the directive to \nthe Sentencing Commission in Section 3 of S. 1699 is not meant as \ndisapproval of the Commission's recent actions in response to FECA. \nRather, Section 3 covers other intellectual property rights crimes that \nCongress believes it is time for the Commission to revisit. \nSpecifically, Section 3 directs the Commission to review the \nguidelines, and particularly the definition of ``infringement amount,'' \nto ensure that offenses involving low-cost items like labels, patches, \nmedallions, or packaging that are used to make counterfeit goods that \nare much more expensive, are properly punished. It also directs the \nCommission to ensure that the penalty provisions for offenses involving \nall counterfeit goods or services, or devices used to facilitate \ncounterfeiting are properly addressed by the guidelines. As it did in \nresponse to the No Electronic Theft Act of 1997 and FECA, I am \nconfident that the Commission will ensure that the Federal sentencing \nguidelines provide adequate punishment and deterrence for these very \nserious offenses and I look forward to the Commission's response to \nthis directive.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank Senator Specter for that clarification. As he is \naware, we have received over a dozen letters in support of S. 1699, the \nStop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have several of these letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12717]]\n\n\n\n\n                                   Lexmark International Inc.,\n\n                                  Lexington, KY, November 4, 2005.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to the members of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee to express Lexmark's strong \n     support for Senate Bill 1699 (the ``Stop Counterfeiting in \n     Manufactured Goods Act''), and to urge your support for its \n     passage. S. 1699 creates a much-needed deterrent targeting \n     traffickers in counterfeit labels and goods--illegal acts \n     which plague not only our business, but many others. S. 1699 \n     amends 18 U.S.C. 2320 to strengthen the application of this \n     statute to include those who traffic in counterfeit labels \n     and goods, thus greatly helping our fight against \n     counterfeiters.\n       Unfortunately, counterfeiting continues to grow out of \n     control because it is seen as a lucrative, yet low risk, \n     crime that some even try to paint as a victimless crime. \n     Nothing could be farther from the truth--not only are the \n     illicit profits being funneled into other criminal \n     activities, but law abiding citizens around the world are \n     made victims when they unwittingly buy illegitimate products. \n     Intellectual property owners, their counsels, private \n     investigators and law enforcement fight counterfeiting every \n     day. We must be able to send a message to counterfeiters that \n     the theft of intellectual property is intolerable and that \n     the battle against counterfeiting will be fought with \n     stronger weapons. S. 1699 accomplishes that precise goal, by \n     strengthening forfeiture and destruction remedies.\n       Counterfeiting costs the United States billions of dollars \n     each year in lost intellectual property, revenues, profits \n     and ultimately, jobs. These criminals must be stopped, and \n     this bill seeks to take away some of the tools they use to \n     manufacture counterfeit goods. If S. 1699 is enacted into \n     law, it will also help the United States seek reciprocal \n     legislation abroad.\n       I urge your personal support for S. 1699 both in Judiciary \n     Committee deliberations and in promotion of its passage in \n     the full Senate. Thank you for your consideration in \n     addressing this very serious problem.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                Patrick T.

Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter and Senator Leahy: On behalf of the \n     more than 2,100 people employed in the U.S. by The Timberland \n     Company. I am writing to express my support for S. 1699, the \n     ``Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act'' which \n     creates necessary disincentives in the criminal code for \n     traffickers in counterfeit labels and goods. This bill is an \n     essential step toward protecting our trademark, our brand, \n     and our company's identity. I urge you to endorse this bill \n     and promote its passage in the full Senate.\n       As you know, the elicit counterfeiting of legitimate \n     products is a serious problem, both internationally and in \n     the United States. This bill, which is similar to H.R. 32, \n     which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in May, \n     will strengthen efforts to combat counterfeiting in the U.S. \n     in two very important ways. Specifically, S. 1699 would:\n       Amend Title 18 of the United States Code to close the \n     loophole in the criminal trademark infringement statute, \n     which currently does not criminally prohibit the trafficking \n     of labels, patches, and stickers, and other counterfeit \n     marks; and\n       Ensure that counterfeit goods and marks seized in violation \n     of this statute are properly disposed of and do not make \n     their way back on the street.\n       Counterfeiting costs the U.S. hundreds of billions of \n     dollars each year, and will continue to do so if our laws do \n     not act as a deterrent. Not only would S. 1699 take the very \n     equipment out of the hands of counterfeiters who would \n     perpetuate the manufacture of illicit goods, it would allow \n     the U.S. to seek similarly strong legislation abroad as it \n     enters into trade negotiations with other countries.\n       I appreciate this opportunity to address this critically \n     important issue, and I hope you will continue the fight \n     against elicit counterfeiting of U.S. products by supporting \n     S. 1699 and promoting its passage in the full Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Danette Wineberg,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                    General Counsel and Secretary.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been very heartening to see such \noverwhelming support for this important bill. Counterfeiting is a \nthreat to America. It wreaks real harm on our economy, our workers, and \nour consumers. This bill is a tough bill that will give law enforcement \nimproved tools to fight this form of theft. The bill is short and \nstraight-forward, but its impact should be profound and far-reaching.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senators \nAlexander, Bayh, Brownback, Coburn, Cornyn, DeWine, Durbin, Feingold, \nFeinstein, Hatch, Kyl, Levin, Reed, Stabenow and Voinovich for their \nco-sponsorship.\n  I would also like to thank Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, chairman \nof the House Judiciary Committee, and Representative Joe Knollenberg \nfor their leadership in the House with regard to H.R. 32, \ncounterfeiting legislation directly related to S. 1699. In January of \nthis year, Representative Knollenberg introduced H.R. 32, the initial \ndraft of the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005, in \nthe House. When the bill was in Committee, he fostered negotiations \nbetween the Department of Justice, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and \nthe International Trademark Association to craft language nearly \nparalleling S. 1699. I commend to my colleagues the Housing Judiciary \nCommittee Report on H.R. 32, as amended.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Some of our most important legislation is produced not \nonly when we reach across the aisle in the name of bipartisanship, but, \nwhen we work across chambers and reach true consensus. I would also \nlike to thank Senators Alexander, Bayh, Brownback, Coburn, Cornyn, \nDeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Hatch, Kyl, Levin, Reed, Stabenow \nand Voinovich for their cosponsorship. Counterfeiting is a serious \nproblem that does not lend itself to a quick and easy solution. This \nlegislation is an important step towards fighting counterfeiting. I \nhope we can build on the success of this law.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and that any statements relating to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1699), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/10/senate-section/article/S12718-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       AUTHORITY TO SIGN DULY ENROLLED BILLS OR JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
