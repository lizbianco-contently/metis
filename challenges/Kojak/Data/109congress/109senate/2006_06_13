Mr. President, later this morning, as I mentioned, the \nSenate will be voting on an amendment to commend the men and women of \nour Armed Forces for their bravery and skill which led to the death of \nZarqawi, who was anointed by Osama bin Laden as the Prince of al-Qaida \nin Iraq.\n  Al-Zarqawi was a brutal terrorist and, as we all know, the \noperational commander of al-Qaida in Iraq. His vicious campaigns of \nsuicide attacks, car bombings, beheadings, assassinations, and \nabductions was directly responsible for the deaths of many American and \ncoalition troops and thousands of Iraqi security forces and innocent \ncitizens.\n  He was violently opposed to the new Iraqi democracy and sought to \nturn Iraq into a safe haven for al-Qaida terrorists.\n  To achieve this goal, he murdered thousands of innocent Iraqi \ncivilians. He sought to divide the Iraqi people by fomenting sectarian \nviolence and inciting a civil war. His goal was destruction, and he \nbrought only violence and despair. But, finally, after 3 years of \neluding capture, justice was brought to Zarqawi.\n  At approximately 6:15 Baghdad time last Wednesday evening, American \nforces, acting on intelligence tips from the Iraqi people, attacked \nZarqawi's safe house near the city of Baqouba, northeast of Baghdad.\n  Zarqawi's spiritual adviser and several of their associates were also \ninside. Less than an hour later, the leading terrorist and No. 1 enemy \nof freedom in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was dead.\n  This is a severe blow for al-Qaida and the terrorist enemy in Iraq. \nAnd it marks yet another victory in the global war on terror.\n  The amendment I offered yesterday, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, commends the courageous men and women of the U.S. military \nfor their\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\nextraordinary efforts to eliminate this brutal terrorist, and for their \ncommitment to helping secure a free, prosperous, and secure future for \nthe Iraqi people.\n  It also applauds the efforts of our coalition partners and the Iraqi \nSecurity Forces who contributed to this achievement.\n  Iraqi security recruits had long been one of Zarqawi's primary \ntargets. Despite repeated attacks against hopeful, young recruits, \nthese brave Iraqis kept coming back. They have shown time and time \nagain they are eager to assume their responsibilities and do what it \ntakes to defend their democracy.\n  The Iraqi public is also deserving of recognition. They defied \nZarqawi's threats and streamed to the polls in three national \nelections. Against the threat of violence, they formed a permanent \ndemocratic government.\n  In recent months, coalition forces have also received a tremendous \nincrease in intelligence tips on the activities and whereabouts of \nterrorists directly from the Iraqi people. The number of actionable \nintelligence tips from the Iraqi population numbered only 483 in March \nof 2005. Since November of that year, the number of tips has \nskyrocketed to over 4,000 a month.\n  The Iraqi people want peace. They want to defeat the terrorist enemy \nthat uses them as human shields. They want to defend their country from \nchaos and terror.\n  And so, Zarqawi has met his fate. But the fight to secure a free and \ndemocratic Iraq continues. The terrorists in Iraq will continue to \nwreak havoc and destruction. But they will not succeed. They cannot \nsucceed. American forces, alongside our coalition partners and the \nIraqi security forces, will remain on the offensive until the terrorist \nenemy is defeated.\n  My Senate colleagues and I are filled with pride at the bravery, \nskill, and valor of our soldiers on the front line. We are grateful for \ntheir service, and we congratulate them for last week's successful \nmission to rid Iraq of its No. 1 terrorist.\n  Our resolution also commends our Nation's civilian and military \nleadership, which includes President Bush and Defense Secretary \nRumsfeld, for their continuing efforts to eliminate the leadership of \nal-Qaida in Iraq.\n  Prime Minister Maliki and the new democratically elected Government \ndeserve our gratitude and commendation.\n  Here in the Senate, we will continue to support our men and women in \nuniform, the democratically elected Government of Iraq, and the Iraqi \npeople as they strive for a free, prosperous, and democratic future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5732-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ROBERT DOLE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this Sunday marked the 10th anniversary of \nSenator Robert Dole's retirement from the U.S. Senate. From humble \nbeginnings on the plains of western Kansas, Bob Dole has risen to \nbecome one of our most accomplished and respected public figures of the \n20th century.\n  Bob Dole arrived in Congress in 1960 as a representative of the Sixth \nDistrict of Kansas. He was immediately chosen by his fellow freshman \ncolleagues to lead the freshman class. His ability to lead and inspire, \nhis dry wit and savvy, would characterize his ascent to the peaks of \npolitical life.\n  Bob Dole was reelected for three more terms before being elected to \nthe Senate in 1968.\n  In 1971, Senator Dole was chosen to lead the Republican National \nCommittee, a position he held for 2 years.\n  It was a tumultuous time for America. His steady hand earned him the \nVice Presidential nomination alongside Gerald Ford in the 1976 \nelection. Jimmy Carter won. But that didn't hinder Senator Dole's \nsteady climb.\n  Over the next decade, Senator Dole moved up through the leadership \nranks, and in 1984, he was elected to succeed Senator Howard Baker as \nmajority leader. While Democrats regained control of the Senate in \n1986, Senator Dole continued to lead his party as minority leader. In \n1994, Republicans swept Congress, and Senator Dole was once again \nelected majority leader. His 12 years as the leader of his party in the \nSenate set a record, and made him the longest serving Senate leader of \nthe Republican Party since its founding in 1854.\n  I learned a lot from Leader Dole during my first few years here. We \nsaw eye to eye on most issues, but when we didn't, he always encouraged \nme to vote my conscience.\n  He respected my commitment to family, and with three young sons, he \nwas always careful to ensure that the schedule wouldn't run over my \ntime with my wife and children.\n  And he took the time to listen to all colleagues. While many remember \nhis famous admonition, in meeting after meeting, to ``work it out,'' \nwhat fewer recall is that he would pursue votes, and ideas, and \nsolutions over and over and over to lead to the point where, indeed, we \ncould ``work it out.''\n  Our Senate party was in good hands under his stewardship. He was a \ngood partner for President Reagan, and President Bush. And the respect \nPresident Clinton paid him was impressive, even across party lines.\n  I was proud to begin to know him during my early years here. His \nportrait hangs on the wall in my conference room, making him part of \nour leadership meetings every week I have often thought about what he \nmight do when challenging situations arise around here.\n  And as much, I have often wondered what quip he might have offered to \nbreak the tension at a tough moment.\n  With my leadership team, we have made some tough calls under his \nwatchful gaze. In 1996, Senator Dole was chosen by the party to run as \nits Presidential nominee. It was the capstone to a remarkable career.\n  World War II hero, dedicated public servant, master of the Senate, \nand champion of the conservative cause, Senator Dole has stamped his \nplace in American political history. Although he has left office, the \nelder statesman has in no way retired. He has authored two best-selling \nbooks on political humor, and a personal memoir of his life as a \nsoldier. He is invited to speak all over the world to offer his wit and \nkeen insights into the issues of our time. President Reagan once said \nof Senator Dole, ``His title of Leader is not just a job title, it's a \ndescription of the man.'' This plain-spoken, honest and humble man from \nRussell, KS, is the genuine article.\n  One of the brightest stars of the Greatest Generation, Senator Dole \nserved his country with bravery and dedication. He has earned the \naffection and respect of his fellow citizens. And he will always be \nremembered for his humor, his leadership, graciousness and humility--\nand for the honor he has brought to political life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5732-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday, we honored our colleague, \nSenator Robert Byrd, for achieving an important milestone in our \nSenate's history. Today, we come to the floor to pay tribute to another \nman who stands out as a giant among those who have served in this \nChamber. Senator Bob Dole, last Sunday, marked the 10-year anniversary \nof his retirement from the Senate.\n  Bob Dole and I came to the Senate at the same time. We have worked \ntogether a great deal. When I was Republican whip and he was our \nparty's Vice Presidential nominee, I was asked to help him prepare for \nhis debate when he debated Walter Mondale--the first Vice Presidential \ndebate in history.\n  Bob helped us pass the Alaskan Native Land Claims Settlement Act, \nwhich paved the way for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. And he supported the \nAlaska Lands Act and the Alaska Railroad Transfer. In short, Bob Dole \nis a\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\ngreat personal friend, a friend to me and to Alaska.\n  Bob was--and still is--a leader in the truest sense of the word. \nWhenever I think of Bob Dole, I think of the great many men I have \nknown who were tested in World War II. Like my good friend Senator \nInouye, Bob Dole is a true war hero. He was tested in war and injured \nand struggled back through a long recovery. Like all great leaders, Bob \ntakes great challenges of life and uses them to improve the world \naround him.\n  Having been injured in World War II, he dedicated much of his time in \npublic service to improving the opportunities for disabled Americans.\n  Those of us in the Senate who were fortunate enough to call Bob a \ncolleague for 27 years, chose him to serve as our leader six times, \nwhen we were in the majority and the minority. He reached out to those \nwho disagreed with him. He listened to advice. You never had to ask him \ntwice to know where he stood; his word was--and is--his bond. As \nPresident Reagan said:\n\n       His title of leader is not just a job title, it's a \n     description of the man.\n\n  I think Bob's decision to resign his seat rather than stay in the \nSenate and campaign for the Presidency demonstrates what a devoted \npublic servant he is. I have now been in the Senate over 30 years, and \nI have seen Members of this body run for President and miss vote after \nvote because they were on the road campaigning.\n  Bob Dole loved the people of Kansas too much to leave them without a \nvoice in the Senate, so he resigned. I believe that took great courage. \nIf there is one thing about Bob Dole that there is no shortage of, it \nis courage. Bob himself said, when he resigned from the Senate:\n\n       One of the qualities of American politics that \n     distinguishes us from other nations is that we judge our \n     politicians as much by the manner by which they leave office \n     as by the vigor with which they pursue it. You do not lay \n     claim to the office you hold, it lays claim to you. Your \n     obligation is to bring to it the gifts you can of labor and \n     honesty and then to depart with grace.\n\n  By his own standards, Bob Dole stands out as one of the most noble \nand dignified men who ever graced these Halls.\n  Senator Dole did not win the 1996 Presidential election, but his \ncommitment to public service has not wavered. He still contributes to \nthe public debate through his writing and speaking, and he has remained \nactive on the campaign trail. We have been fortunate that since his \nretirement another Dole has joined this Chamber--his wife, Senator \nElizabeth Dole, who serves the people of North Carolina and our Nation, \nalso, with great distinction.\n  When Senator Dole resigned from the Senate 10 years ago to run for \nPresident, he and I were the only remaining Members of the class of \n1968. We have a bond that was forged on the morning of January 3, 1969, \nwhen we each took the oath to serve our country in the Senate. That \nbond never fades, and I salute his service today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator departs, \nI say to the Senator, you made mention of his heroic service, together \nwith that of yourself and Senator Inouye in World War II. But I think \nthe Record should reflect how you and I and others in the Chamber--\nSenator Inouye--supported him in the World War II Memorial. This was \nsomething that was very dear to his heart, and he became the national \npublic president figure to really raise those funds--almost all of the \ndollars from the public sector: dollars from veterans, dollars from all \nacross America, and, indeed, some from beyond our shores.\n  To his credit, every time I pass it--and I am sure you view that \nmagnificent memorial--I always remember his contribution in erecting \nit.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Virginia is correct, Mr. President. \nSenator Inouye and I were pleased and proud to join him and you in that \neffort. And we are delighted that the sponsors of that memorial \nremembered Alaska and Hawaii. They are in the memorial although they \nwere not States during World War II.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I \nplayed a very minor role in World War II in the last year, the closing \nyear, when my class of 17, 18-year-olds joined.\n  And I say to the Senator, you, sir, were a great hero in that war, as \nwas Bob Dole.\n  Mr. President, I also thank our colleague, Senator Smith, for \ninitiating this recognition on the 10th anniversary of Bob Dole's \nretirement from the Senate.\n  When I came to the Senate--it is hard to believe--28 years ago, he \nvery soon became a figure to whom I would turn from time to time to \nseek advice and counsel. He had a magnificent ability to reach across \nthe aisle. And he very firmly believed in the concept of trying to do \nas much business as we could in a bipartisan way.\n  Much has been said about trips we take in the Senate. I value the \ntrips I took with Senator Dole. I remember one very vividly when he \nquickly put together a delegation to visit Boris Yeltsin when he rose \nto the top position in then the Soviet Union, watching Bob Dole with \nthat new world leader, the two of them together trying to reach common \nground and common understanding in the midst of the Cold War between \nthe United States and the then Soviet Union. He was a man who wisely \nthought about how this is one world in which we live today. Be it the \nmeans of our national security or otherwise, we have to have the vision \nto look abroad.\n  I also remember another day very clearly. That was in connection with \none of the anniversaries of the landing of D-Day. He asked me to \naccompany him. He spoke in Italy that day. Then we doubled back and \nwent up to Normandy. We also incorporated in that trip a visit to a \nsmall village on the top of a mountain. All the way up the side of the \nmountain, the old bus we were in was zigzagging up a narrow road. There \nwere little signs: Welcome home, Bob Dole. After a luncheon, he took me \nand one other Member of the Senate and we walked a short distance from \nthe hotel up on a hillside where there was a small stone wall. We stood \nthere and joined him in a silent moment of prayer. Prayer was very \nimportant, as it is now, to Bob Dole. That is where he fell wounded and \nsurvived under extraordinary circumstances, largely owing to one of the \ncivilian partisans who helped him get back to receive medical care. I \nwill remember that moment always.\n  I also draw to the attention of my colleagues--I am not here to sell \nbooks--a great book he wrote called ``Great Political Wit: Laughing \n(Almost) All the Way to the White House.'' In it he talks about \nhimself. I particularly like this. This was in the last page of the \nbook called ``Great Political Wit'':\n\n       Don't feel too bad for me. The appearance of this book \n     coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of Harry Truman's \n     stunning upset of Tom Dewey in 1948, which not only changed \n     the course of American history but produced a patron saint \n     for every political underdog since. Like Truman, I have a \n     Midwestern preference for plain speaking, and a sometimes \n     impolitic habit of laughing at pomposity. Although there have \n     been times when I have been forced to eat my words--or \n     swallow my pride--I still find it hard to take too seriously \n     people who take themselves that way.\n       What people often forget is that the last laugh doesn't \n     belong to the victorious candidate--it belongs to the late-\n     night [show] comics.\n\n  In that book, he also told a story. I think this is applicable to \nclose out my brief remarks this morning.\n\n       As presiding officer of the United States Senate, Vice \n     President Calvin Coolidge declared his intention to master \n     the rules governing the world's greatest deliberative body. \n     This didn't take long, said Coolidge, who quickly discovered \n     that the Senate has but one rule, which is that the Senate \n     will do whatever it wants whenever it wants to.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, special thanks to my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Gordon Smith, who represents the State of Oregon and \nour Nation with grace and civility, intelligence and accomplishment, \nfor this special order paying tribute to our Kansas Senator Bob Dole.\n  It doesn't seem possible that it has been 10 years since Bob's tenure \nas our majority leader ended, a tenure that represents the longest \nserving Senate leader of our Republican Party since the founding of the \nGrand Old Party in\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\n1854. During those 12 years of leadership, there were difficult and \nchallenging times. But Bob Dole's legacy was and is legislative \naccomplishment, always in Bob Dole style, a unique mixture of principle \nand compromise when necessary, comity, his great gift of wit and humor \nand good old Kansas common sense.\n  In 1968, when Bob first ran for the Senate, his theme song was ``Let \na Leader Lead the Way.'' He certainly did. It would be impossible to \nlist all of Bob's legislative achievements, but the Dole Institute at \nthe University of Kansas does provide some highlights.

These accomplishments were of direct benefit to the \ndaily lives and pocketbooks of Americans and represent many programs \nand reforms that we now take for granted. Bob is probably most proud of \nthe fact he led the way for disabled Americans, for our Nation's School \nLunch Program, not to mention the World Food Program where food and \neducation combine as the most effective long-term answer in our current \nfight against terrorism.\n  I have special memories and a personal perspective of the Bob Dole \ndays in the Senate when I was in the House. Having the privilege of \nrepresenting Bob's former congressional district, the big first \ndistrict of Kansas, knowing Bob Dole since his friendship with my \nfather and later during my service as the administrative assistant both \nfor Bob's predecessor in the Senate, Senator Frank Carlson, and his \nsuccessor in the House, Congressman Keith Sebelius, many assumed that \nwhatever I was for, Bob was for. I would always emphasize that Bob Dole \nwas riding shotgun with me, whether he was or not. That was like having \nWyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Doc Holiday, and Matt Dillon all by your \nside during any kind of legislative shootout. Of course, if we won, I \nhad to come over to the Senate and let him know. If we lost, I came \nover to ask for help. Either way, when the chips were down, it was a \nwin-win with Bob on your side.\n  In Kansas, our State society named Dwight David Eisenhower the Kansan \nof the 20th century, and we are still proud of and still like Ike. \nHistorians have ensconced our native son as one of our greatest \nPresidents. The fact is that the Eisenhower legacy lives on with Bob \nDole. Ike was his hero, and by following his example, Bob has been \naccurately described as a towering figure and the most enduring \nRepublican leader of the 20th century with a distinguished record of \npublic service that has made a tremendous positive impact on our \nNation.\n  Following his elected public service, Bob has continued to \ncontribute, to lead, and to achieve. I daresay without Bob Dole, the \nWorld War II Memorial would not be the centerpiece of the Mall in our \nNation's Capital. Most deserving of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, \nhe has been and is an international emissary for peace and freedom and \nis involved in countless projects and causes. When I go back home to \nKansas, Kansans always ask me: What do you hear from Bob? How is he \ndoing? I tell them he is still on the go and doing what he has always \ndone, that we still tow buckets together, and we don't spill very much.\n  Simply put, Bob Dole continues to be a leader who leads the way. We \nin Kansas are proud of Bob Dole.\n  My thanks again to Senator Smith for reserving this time honoring our \nnative son.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

While that is my intention, \nto speak about them--specifically, Senator Bob Dole--I would like to \njoin all Senators, Democrats who yesterday spoke of Senator Byrd, I \nknow many Republicans did as well. I, not being in town, wanted to take \nan occasion to salute Senator Byrd for a remarkable career in the \nSenate.

I know how much Senator Byrd values the Senate, \nbut I think that comment of his, that reflection, was evidence that he \nvalues his marriage and family even more.\n  As a Republican Senator, I salute Senator Byrd for his remarkably \nlong and distinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5734-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5734-S5736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ROBERT DOLE\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I was not in the Chamber 10 years ago when \nSenator Dole resigned his seat. I was, in fact, on the campaign trail \nin the midst of an election campaign that he had helped to recruit me \nto run. I remember watching those proceedings and seeing the bipartisan \naffection in which Senator Dole was held. I later met him many times on \nthe campaign trail as he pursued the Presidency and was impressed by \nhis courage in the face of very discouraging poll numbers and the high \nprobability that he would not win and how hard he fought for us and \nothers who were running to fill seats in the U.S. Senate. Elizabeth was \nat his side, and together they made a tremendous campaign and did honor \nto our country and to the Republican Party by the way in which they \nprosecuted a very difficult campaign cycle. It reflected honor upon our \ncountry.\n  It is important that as we celebrate his resignation and his career \nthat ended 10 years ago, we take occasion to reflect on his remarkable \naccomplishments. He served 27 years in this body, 11 of those as Senate \nRepublican leader. Bob Dole's remarkable record of accomplishment as a \nSenator is well known. It is not an exaggeration to say that his \nfingerprints could be found on nearly every major piece of legislation \nthat passed Congress during the 1980s and the first half of 1990s.\n  It was Bob Dole who reached across party lines to work with Senator \nGeorge McGovern to create the Food Stamp Program. It was Bob Dole who \nworked with Senators Harkin and Kennedy to bring about the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. It was Bob Dole who worked with the late Senator \nPat Moynihan to save the Social Security Program.\n  I rise today not just to pay tribute to Bob Dole's legislative \naccomplishments; rather, I rise on this occasion to\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\ncelebrate what he has done in the decade since he left this body. There \ncan be no question that over those 10 years, Bob Dole has continued his \nlifelong commitment to serving his country, a commitment that began as \na young soldier in the hills of Italy during the Second World War. \nIndeed, for many Americans, Bob Dole is the living symbol of what Tom \nBrokaw has termed ``America's greatest generation,'' the generation of \nAmericans who saved freedom during World War II. My generation is the \nbeneficiary of Bob Dole's generation, the world we inherited, a world \nin which America assumed world leadership. My generation has been \ngreatly blessed by patriots such as Bob Dole.\n  Perhaps Bob Dole's greatest contribution to the past decade was his \nchairmanship of the National World War II Memorial. Quite simply, that \nbeautiful memorial would not grace our National Mall now had it not \nbeen for the persistence and leadership of Bob Dole.\n  Bob Dole also volunteered for service after the attacks on September \n11, when he joined with former President Bill Clinton to serve as \ncochair of the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund, which assists the \neducational needs of families of those who lost their lives in the \nWorld Trade Center, the Pentagon, and United flight 93.\n  During this time in this Chamber, no Senator spoke more loudly and \nmore eloquently about atrocities occurring around the world--\nspecifically in Bosnia--than did Bob Dole, who raised his voice loudly. \nHe has continued his vigilance by serving as Chairman of the \nInternational Commission on Missing Persons, traveling to the Balkans \nto provide closure to families of those who were victims of the \ngenocide that occurred under Slobodon Milosevic.\n  In January of 2003, President Bush appointed Bob Dole as honorary \nCochair of the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. \nHe has worked to connect countless Americans with service opportunities \nin communities, schools, and workplaces.\n  Bob Dole has also continued his commitment to ending the scourge of \nhunger, working with his former colleague, George McGovern, to advocate \nthe expansion of school breakfast programs in the United States. They \nhave also teamed to promote the expansion of the School Lunch Programs \nacross the world through their Global School Feeding Initiative.\n  Bob Dole has also devoted a great deal of his time and energy to the \nRobert J. Dole Institute of Politics, which is located at the \nUniversity of Kansas in Lawrence, KS. The institute is one of America's \npremier university-based political science and international affairs \nresearch institutes, dedicated to reestablishing politics as an \nhonorable profession and to promoting greater student and civic \ninvolvement in the democratic process.\n  Along with all of these activities, Bob Dole is one of America's most \npopular public speakers, inspiring audiences with his courage, his \nhumor, his love of America, and always with that trademark wit. He has \nalso authored three books since leaving the Senate--two on political \nhumor, and the most recent, ``One Soldier's Story,'' which tells the \nremarkable story of his recovery from the wounds he suffered during the \nSecond World War.\n  Mr. President, Bob Dole has often said that he takes inspiration in \nthe State motto of his beloved Kansas, which is: ``To the stars through \ndifficulties.'' There can be no doubt that Bob Dole reached those stars \nin serving his country as a soldier and as a public servant. He has \nproved time and again over the past decade that he continues to reach \nfor the stars as a private citizen.\n  I know all Senators join me in saluting Bob Dole and thanking him for \nthe positive difference he has made over these past 10 years. Part of \nthat difference was supporting his wife Elizabeth and her campaign to \nwin a seat in the Senate. Together, they are a remarkable American \ncouple and have made a remarkable difference for the betterment of our \ncountry and even the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank those who have come to the floor \ntoday to help honor our former colleague in the Senate, Bob Dole. I \ndon't know of anyone who has had more of an influence on my career in \nthe Senate than Bob Dole, although Howard Baker, who was the Republican \nleader when I first arrived in the Senate in 1978, also had a great \ndeal to do with my career here.\n  I don't know who coined the phrase ``compassionate conservative,'' \nbut Bob Dole was the epitome of a compassionate conservative. His \nlegislative record is replete with examples of his leadership to help \nensure the formulation and implementation of policies by our Federal \nGovernment that recognized the needs of those who were unable to care \nfor themselves, or were unable to make progress economically, without \nthe assistance of the Government.\n  He authored the Americans with Disabilities Act and helped lead the \nway for many Americans by his example of how one can overcome \ndisabilities. My friend Gordon Smith mentioned his authorship of the \nbook ``One Soldier's Story.'' That should be required reading for every \nAmerican. It was a heart-warming yet heartbreaking account of his \nexperiences in World War II in combat and his long road to recovering \nfrom the painful and life-threatening injuries he sustained in battle.\n  You can also look to examples of when he was a leader in the \nAgriculture Committee on which I had the good fortune to serve as a new \nmember, at a time when he was one of the true leaders in formulating \nagricultural policy for our Nation. He worked easily across the aisle \nwith Herman Talmadge, the chairman of the committee at that time, and \nwith George McGovern, another leader on the committee from South \nDakota. They worked together to help craft improvements in the School \nLunch Programs and other feeding programs that assist Americans who are \nunable to provide for their own nutritional needs. Think about that. \nThis was at a time when the Federal Government was pretty well leaving \nthese responsibilities to State and local governments, charitable \norganizations, and the Nation's schools to formulate their own response \nto these challenges.\n  But we became a Nation whose record of support for dealing with these \nproblems has become a model for the world. As a matter of fact, he and \nGeorge McGovern created a worldwide nutrition assistance program that \ntoday makes food and nutrition benefits available to the poorest of the \npoor in Africa and many other countries throughout the world.\n  He was a leader in establishing a modern veterans benefit program and \nensuring that a cabinet-level position was available to help administer \nthis program to be sure that all veterans, those who had disabilities \nor those who deserved pensions and other benefits because of their age \nor experiences in war, would have those benefits and could be a part of \nour national citizenship in every sense of the word.\n  I recall very vividly when we elected Bob Dole as our leader in the \nSenate on the Republican side. He was a master at getting things done, \nat working out problems, at bringing people together who had disparate \nviews on subjects that we needed to take action on and deal with. He \nworked hard. He knew everybody's personal interests and disposition. I \nwas amazed at how he could stand before the Senate and stay there until \nthe late hours of the evening, working out the intricacies of a tax \nreform bill, which he helped craft as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, in charge of tax policies for our country.\n  He was a Senator's Senator in every respect, a warm-hearted, \nhumorous, delightful companion, who enriched the lives of all who \nserved with him in the Senate. I suppose the highlight for me in my \nrelationship with Senator Dole was the nominating convention, when he \nwas selected to be the Republican Party candidate for President of the \nUnited States. I was very excited about that. It was a wonderful \ndecision. I could not think of anybody who would be better as President \nof the United States than Bob Dole. I remember the night that the \nconvention nominated him and he walked out on the stage to accept the \nnomination. It was really quite an event. Also, that night, I recall \nwhile they were counting the ballots on the floor, he invited Chuck \nGrassley from Iowa, our colleague in the Senate, and me to be with his \nfamily up in the suite in the hotel in San\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\nDiego to watch the last votes being counted, and then to proceed into \nthe convention hall to accept the nomination.\n  Mr. President, we miss Bob Dole's leadership in the Senate. We are \ndelighted, though, the Senate is taking time to recognize the great \nservice that he rendered during his career here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5736-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5736-S5737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am in the Dole seat for Kansas. When \nSenator Dole left, I ran for his seat and was fortunate enough to be \nelected to that seat. I worked with Senator Dole for many years, when I \nwas secretary of agriculture for Kansas. I first met him when I was \nKansas State president of the Junior Farmers of America. I have had a \nwonderful relationship with Senator Dole. He is an outstanding \nAmerican, and he is an outstanding Kansan. He deserves tribute.\n  We in the Senate are certainly blessed and honored each time we have \nthe opportunity to rise on our feet on this floor and address this \naugust body. At this moment, I feel particularly blessed and honored to \nbe able to recognize my predecessor, Senator Robert Joseph Dole.\n  Today, we rise to mark the decade anniversary of Senator Dole \nannouncing his retirement to this body. On June 11, 1996, Senator Dole, \nas the Republican nominee for the Presidency, announced that he would \nresign his seat in the U.S. Senate. And some asked, Why would he retire \nwith 2 full years left in his term and only 6 months left in the \ncampaign? ``I thought that was what was best for Kansas.'' For while he \nwas many things--a legislator, a statesman, a decorated war hero, a \nleader--Senator Dole believed in his State and he believed in service \nto his State and he thought this was the best for his State, and that \nhe would run just as a man, an ordinary citizen. It was a tremendous \ntribute to his service and his believing in the service of this body, \nthat if you couldn't be here full time to do this work, he thought it \nwould be better that he would leave it and bring somebody else in so \nthat he could pursue the Presidency full time.\n  The motto of our State is ``Ad Astera, per Aspera.'' That is a Latin \nphrase meaning ``to the stars, through difficulty.'' Perhaps, \nconsidering our State's motto, one could consider it also the motto for \nBob Dole.\n  He was born in 1923 in Russell, KS. Bob Dole was a teenager during \nthe worst environmental disaster of my State's history--that was the \nDust Bowl. He was 11 years old on April 14, 1935, which was referred to \nas ``Black Sunday.'' On that day, a wall of dust covered the prairie of \nwestern Kansas, turning day into night. Some thought it was the end of \nthe world. During those years, childhood friends of Bob Dole recalled \npostponing basketball games in the middle of them, four or five times \nduring the game, just to sweep the piling dust off the floor.\n  Some fled the dust. Others were withered by it. Bob Dole was formed \nby it. Years later, he would recount that ``growing up on the edge of \nthe Depression-era Dust Bowl, I was taught to put my trust in God and \nnot government, and never to confuse the two.'' Per Aspera.\n  As a young man, Bob Dole rose to meet the greatest challenge his \ngreat generation would face--World War II. Bob was a second lieutenant \nin the Army's 10th Mountain Division. He served in the mountains of \nItaly, where he and his unit faced some of the fiercest and challenging \nfighting of the war. Bob fought bravely. He was wounded. He fought \nagain. He crawled from the security of his foxhole during intense \nfighting to assist a critically wounded radio operator, and in the \nprocess was shot in the back by a Nazi machine gunner. This time few \nthought he would survive. Bob Dole was hospitalized for a total of 39 \nmonths. He gave up the use of his right arm.\n  Ad Astra--to the Stars.\n  For his wounds, Bob was awarded two Purple Hearts. For his valor, Bob \nDole was awarded the Bronze Star with an Oak Cluster.\n  Ad Astra--to the Stars.\n  Returning to his native Kansas, Bob turned to his family, to his \nneighbors, and to his friends for support. Later, he remarked: ``I was \nsustained by neighbors, who were anything but stingy with their love \nand encouragement. I learned then, if I hadn't already known it, that \nthere is no such thing as a wholly self-made man or woman.''\n  He picked up where he left off and earned his undergraduate and law \ndegrees from Washburn University in Topeka, KS. From there, Bob Dole \nbegan his political rise to the stars.\n  Ad Astra.\n  Bob served in the Kansas State House as the Russell County attorney, \nand on January 3, 1961, Bina Dole's little boy was sworn into the 87th \nCongress of the United States. Within a decade, Dole had distinguished \nhimself as a legislator and was sent by his fellow Kansans to serve \nhere in this body.\n  And here in this Chamber, Bob Dole continued to serve the people of \nKansas and this great Nation. He served them as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. He served them as the minority leader of the Senate. He \nserved them as majority leader. He served them for nearly three \ndecades, until exactly one decade ago today, when he retired.\n  Today, Bob Dole's service is neither over nor forgotten. Having been \nrecognized with the Presidential Medal of Freedom--a civilian honor, to \nmatch his military honors--he has continued to serve. He served as \nchairman of the International Commission on Missing Persons in the \nformer Yugoslavia and the National World War II Memorial. He even gets \na great deal of constituent casework of people contacting to ask if he \ncould help out with this or that--and of course he does. He spearheaded \nthe World War II Memorial effort, and what a beautiful memorial to the \ngreatest generation it is.\n  Also, I believe Bob served as the spokesman for a number of different \ncommercial causes which have continued. And his humor continues \nunabated as well.\n  I remember when serving as secretary of agriculture in the State of \nKansas that Senator Dole would address a number of farm audiences--\nsometimes from the back of a pickup truck. He would see a number of \nmembers of that audience who would often loosen up their belts and \ntheir overalls because they knew they were going to be in for an \nentertaining speech, a lot of times about 30 minutes or 25 minutes of \njokes and one-liners and 5 minutes of politics. They loved it. He loved \nit. They loved him. He loved them. It was a beautiful symbiotic \nrelationship that Bob Dole had with his State, with my State of Kansas.\n  He also continues to serve as a trusted adviser and friend to guys \nlike me. I have been honored to be able to serve in his seat. It is \ndifficult to follow somebody of his legendary status and his ability as \na legislator, his ability as a leader, and the contribution that he has \nmade to this society, to this Nation, and to this world. Yet we try--\nand try with his advice.\n  He is an important American of distinction. He is someone who truly \ndeserves to be recognized. He is one who has touched many lives \nindividually and millions of lives collectively. He is the epitome of \nthe greatest generation, the generation that served the rest of \nmankind, to be beat off Fascism, Hitler, Communism, and gave us the \nfreest world that we have known.\n  There are still wars to be fought, still battles to be fought, and we \npick up the flag and carry it each and every day, but we owe so much in \ntribute to legendary leaders such as Bob Dole.\n  Senator Dole, on behalf of our country and our State, certainly from \nme personally, I say, thank you and God bless you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in \npaying tribute to one of our Senate's finest leaders, Senator Bob Dole.\n  Ten years ago, after representing his home State of Kansas in the \nHouse of Representatives for 8 years and in the Senate for over 27 \nyears, Majority Leader Dole resigned from the Senate. He did so in \norder to engage fully all of his attentions to his Presidential \ncampaign. The Senate lost one of our greatest leaders that day, but Bob \nDole continues to be a national leader to this day.\n  I traveled with him a great deal during his campaign, and it was a \nthrill for me. I was given the honor of introducing him at the 1996 \nRepublican Convention--quite a humbling privilege for someone who \nconsiders himself far less distinguished than the man I was introducing \nformally to the Nation as\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\nthe Republican candidate for the President. He may not have won that \nelection, but he ran an honorable campaign and worked as hard as anyone \nI have ever seen on the campaign trail. Bob helped teach me the meaning \nof dedicating one's live to a cause greater than one's self-interest, \nand for this I will always be thankful.\n  Everyone knows that Bob is a decorated veteran through his sacrifice \nin World War II and that he faced a very hard road to recovery upon his \nreturn--a road that many selfless men and women today are similarly \nfacing upon their return from the war in Iran and Afghanistan. Like \nBob, they, too, are American heroes and they need and deserve to be \nreminded of that fact as often as possible.\n  Bob Dole's distinction among his peers could have rested with his \nmilitary service. But instead, he chose to continue serving his country \nand was as effective as he was, in my view, largely because of his \nexperience as a war veteran. For example, his Senate leadership was \nessential to the efforts of Presidents Reagan and Bush to win the Cold \nWar. He built majority coalitions to help restore the readiness and \nmodernization of our Armed Forces, which had been so badly neglected in \nthe previous decade. Thanks to his vision, America is better prepared \nto defend herself and others from those who want to cause us harm.\n  While Bob may no longer be daily in the public eye as he enjoys life \nin the private sector, he still continues to focus his energy on issues \nof importance to our country. He cochaired the Families of Freedom \nScholarship Fund with former President Clinton, helping to raise money \nfor the families of the victims of 9/11 to pursue secondary educations. \nBob also continues with his efforts on behalf of the disabled. And, of \ncourse, since leaving the Senate 10 years ago, he is also now enjoying \nthe obligations of a Senator's spouse.\n  Bob Dole is an American hero, and I am privileged to call him my \nfriend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to oppose the confirmation of \nRichard Sticker as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety. I also \nask the Senate to send a message of confidence and hope to the miners \nacross America that we in the Senate are no longer willing to put coal \nindustry executives that care more about profits than lives in charge \nof their safety.\n  How many of us recall the recent news stories coming out of Kentucky \nand West Virginia--heartbreaking stories--where lives were lost and \nfamilies waited expectantly aboveground praying that those miners would \nbe found and be brought back safely, and how many times that was not \nthe case.\n  What brings about safety in these coal mines, so deep in the Earth? \nThe vigilance of the agencies, Federal and State, that keep an eye on \nthe companies that are operating out of the view of most of the world. \nThose are the things that are important. Today, we will have a chance \nto vote on a man who wants to head the Federal agency when it comes to \nmine safety. Unfortunately, Mr. Stickler is yet another in a long line \nof coal industry executives nominated by this administration.\n  The last industry appointee to the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration withdrew or delayed final action on 18 mine safety \nrules. The result was disastrous--disastrous to the tune of 33 coal \nmine deaths in America in 2006.\n  Two of the rules that could have been enacted and were not by the \npredecessor to the man being appointed to this position had the \npotential to speed the rescue and increase the chance of survival for \nthe 14 miners killed in the recent West Virginian Sago and Alma mine \ndisasters. One would have sped up the formation of rescue teams. The \nother would have provided more oxygen for the miners. Both of these \nrules could have saved miners' lives this year. But the Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration didn't enact the rules. Why? Because doing so \nwould have cost the coal companies money. It is just that simple. And \nnow 33 miners have paid with their lives, and Congress was forced to \nact.\n\n  We passed a new law this year--a law that was pushed by the Senators \nfrom West Virginia, Senators Byrd and Rockefeller--which I was happy to \nsupport because of the coal mining in my own home State of Illinois. It \nis called the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. \nIt mandates the formation of two mine safety teams available within an \nhour of an accident. Such quick response mine rescue teams might have \nsaved lives at these coal mines in America this year.\n  This new law also mandates the purchase of wireless tracking and \nmessaging equipment and extra oxygen for miners underground. Both of \nthese provisions could also have saved lives.\n  My concern with Mr. Stickler's nomination is not solely that he is a \ncoal executive--that doesn't disqualify him--but that he clearly stated \nduring his confirmation hearing that these new provisions in the law \nare not needed. He unequivocally stated that no new laws are needed and \nthat the laws on the books, which haven't been updated, incidentally, \nin 30 years, to adjust for new technology in coal mining, according to \nMr. Stickler, those 30-year-old laws are just fine. And he said this \nafter the Sago mine explosion that took the lives of 12 coal miners.\n  I can't support a nominee to be head of mine safety when he opposes \nthe recently passed Miner Act. This law, which the Senate passed by \nunanimous consent, without one single Senator dissenting, was a \nrecognition by all of us that mine safety laws need to be updated in \norder to protect the coal miners and to stop the unnecessary and sad \nand tragic loss of life. But Mr. Stickler, who wants to be head of this \nFederal agency to protect coal miners across America, disagrees.\n  Furthermore, Mr. Stickler argues that the duty to comply with safety \nlaws falls on the shoulders of the mine companies, and that the agency \nhe wants to head plays no role. He told a committee of the Senate that \nhe believes there is a compliance problem, not an enforcement problem, \nin the mine industry. Mr. Stickler doesn't seem to understand that \nwithout enforcement, there will be no compliance. Any industry left on \nits own to comply with Federal and local laws will often fail to do so. \nThat is a reality--a reality Mr. Stickler doesn't even understand.\n  I am astonished that President Bush would nominate a person to head \nthis important safety agency who has such little regard for the need to \nenforce the laws of the land, to protect the lives of coal miners, and \nto spare families from the grief that so many have suffered this year.\n  Mr. Stickler's statements at his confirmation hearing fly in the face \nof reality, and I ask: What do his comments say to the families of \nthose 33 lost miners?\n  Many of these families oppose the confirmation of Mr. Stickler \nbecause of his opposition to revising mine safety laws and his live-\nand-let-live position on enforcement regulations. They are not alone. \nThe United Mine Workers and the AFL-CIO also oppose Mr. Stickler's \nnomination. All of us in the Senate supported passage of a new law to \nsave miners' lives. We unanimously supported it. Mr. Stickler doesn't \nbelieve that legislation was even necessary.\n  We also know that enforcement of the laws is needed to compel mine \noperators to comply with the laws. Mr. Stickler, again, disagrees.\n  We learned a bitter lesson about 11 months ago on the gulf coast. \nHurricane Katrina, the worst natural disaster to strike America, came \nwith warning, devastating New Orleans and many communities in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Even with 3 or 4\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\ndays' warning that this hurricane was about to strike and could have \ndevastating impact, the Federal Emergency Management Administration was \nnot ready. They were not prepared.\n  Unfortunately, the person who headed up the agency effort, Mr. \nMichael Brown, didn't do everything he could have done and, as a \nresult, lives were lost, people suffered, there was damage that was \ntotally unnecessary, and the rescue effort was slow to come and, sadly, \ntoo late for many.\n  The lesson from Michael Brown at FEMA was that you don't put a person \nwhose speciality in life is Arabian horses in charge of the Federal \nEmergency Management Administration. He wasn't ready for the job, and \nas a result of that people died and people suffered.\n  So now what do we have today? We have Mr. Richard Stickler, an \nexecutive from a coal company, who is now going to be put in charge of \nwatching coal companies. Why? Because he is charged with the safety of \ncoal miners. When one listens to his responses to the questions at the \ncommittee hearing, it is clear that he has taken a position with which \nmost coal companies would agree: We don't need no more regulation; we \ndon't need no more enforcement; we don't need no more meddling Federal \nagencies.\n  Maybe that point of view would have prevailed some time past, but \nthis year we know better.\n  Coal mining, one of the most dangerous occupations in America, has \nclaimed 33 lives this year. This Congress understood it. We passed \nunanimously a change in the law to protect those coal miners. We cannot \nafford to put in that agency a person in charge who is not going to \nspend every minute and every ounce of his strength to protect those \ncoal miners and be an advocate for their families. Mr. Stickler is not \nthat person.\n  On behalf of the 3,500 coal miners in my home State of Illinois and \nall of the coal miners across the country, I urge my fellow Senators to \noppose the confirmation of Mr. Stickler for this important position.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nIllinois in expressing my deep concern about the nomination of Richard \nStickler to be Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health. \nThat is a long title, but it means one thing: This is the person who is \ngoing to be in charge of the health and safety of every miner in \nAmerica.\n  That is a very serious responsibility, and it requires a serious \nleader, someone with a strong background in mine safety and a strong \ncommitment to aggressively protect America's mine workers. I sit on the \ncommittee that oversees the nomination. I have to tell the Senate, Mr. \nStickler offered neither. I believe the President, respectfully, should \nwithdraw his nomination and send us at this time a more suitable \nnominee.\n  As we all know, just 6 months ago, 12 miners were killed in the Sago \ndisaster. In the wake of that tragedy, many of us in the Senate worked \nhard--and I commend the Senator who is sitting in the chair for his \nwork--on this incredibly important issue. We did the right thing. We \ncame together and passed the most comprehensive mine safety update in a \ngeneration.\n  I was honored to work on that historic bill with Senators Kennedy and \nEnzi, Senator Isakson, who is in the chair, and Senators Rockefeller \nand Byrd. But we have to do more than just pass a law. We need to make \nsure we provide the resources, and we need to make sure we provide the \nleadership to carry this out. That is why it is so disturbing to me \nthat the Senate majority leader is today trying to push an unqualified \nnominee through to head this agency.\n  Senator Byrd, who represents the Sago families, has raised some very \nvalid concerns about Mr. Stickler's qualifications and, following \nSenate tradition, those concerns should be heeded. They should give all \nof us pause. Indeed, we see the leadership today departing from the \nusual process and trying now to push this nominee through the Senate. I \nbelieve that is the wrong course of action when the lives of our \nAmerican miners are at stake.\n  Mr. President, as you well know, I am very passionate about this \nissue because I have worked on mine safety issues with you and with the \nSenator who is arriving on the floor as I speak, Senator Kennedy. In \nfact, at the hearing of this nominee, it was my questioning of his \nconfirmation hearing that revealed to me his business-as-usual approach \nto miner health and safety.\n  When Richard Stickler testified at his HELP confirmation hearing in \nJanuary, he told me he believed the current mine safety laws are \nadequate. That was before we passed our legislation. He said those \ncurrent mine safety laws were adequate. I couldn't disagree more, and \nneither could the House and Senate, which, after that, passed the most \nsignificant mine safety improvements in a generation.\n  I was disappointed in his responses at the hearing, so I asked him \nfurther questions in writing. In reply to that, Mr. Stickler could not \nsuggest a single way to improve mine safety--not one single suggestion. \nThink about that for a minute. We would not put someone in charge of \nfood safety who has no idea about how to make consumers safe. \nWe wouldn't put someone in charge of airline safety who has no idea how \nto make air traffic safer. And we certainly shouldn't put someone in \ncharge of mine safety who has no idea about how to make our mines \nsafer.\n\n  We need a leader now more than ever at the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration who will not just accept the status quo that has cost \nminers their lives in this country. It is a wrong turn to have the \nenforcement of our mine safety laws turned over to a former coal \ncompany executive with no background in miner health and safety.\n  Here is how the head of the United Mine Workers of America put it in \na letter to President Bush. He said:\n\n       The Nation's miners cannot tolerate having another mine \n     executive running the agency responsible for protecting their \n     health and their safety. For too many years, miners have \n     endured an agency directed by coal mining executives. Too \n     often these mining executives place a priority on \n     productivity, but fail to focus on miners' health and safety. \n     Too many times MSHA has not done all it is charged with doing \n     to promote miners' health and safety.\n\n  Clearly, we need a new direction at that agency and, clearly, Mr. \nStickler does not provide a new kind of direction.\n  The words that I just quoted are the words of Cecil Roberts, \ninternational president of the United Mine Workers of America. He and \nthe AFL-CIO oppose this nomination and with good reason.\n  With America's miners risking their lives every day, as we all know--\nand a new law in place, thankfully, because of the leadership of the \nPresiding Officer, that has to be vigorously enforced--we cannot \nentrust our mine safety to someone who has not shown the background or \nthe passion or the desire to make sure those laws work well and will \nfight for the health and safety of American miners.\n  When it comes to mine safety, we know now that we cannot tolerate \nbusiness as usual. I believe the Senate should reject this nominee and \ndemand a leader, someone who will stand up for our miners.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator be good enough to yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Chair, how much time do we have remaining on \nour side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 12 minutes 55 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Presiding Officer let us know when we have 7 \nminutes remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington, who \nis the ranking member of the subcommittee that has been dealing with \nthis issue, for an excellent statement. I wonder if she agrees with me \nthat we have passed very important mine safety legislation that the \nPresident of the United States is going to sign. It has strong \nbipartisan support. Our committee, which was led by Chairman Enzi, \nvisited the Sago mine. We had extensive hearings on the issue. Does the \nSenator agree with me that if we are going to have this new beginning \nin terms of mine safety that we need to have someone who is going to \neffectively run that program, who is going\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\nto be someone who understands both the history of what has been \nhappening in the mines in West Virginia, in Pennsylvania, in Kentucky, \nand throughout the Midwest, and has demonstrated leadership in terms of \nprotecting miners? Does the Senator agree with me that what we are \nlooking for is strong leadership to implement that legislation?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from \nMassachusetts through the Acting President pro tempore, I couldn't \nagree more. I think the country sat at its dinner tables and watched \nthe mine accidents that have occurred increasingly over the past year. \nSo we understand what it takes in this country is leadership at an \nagency. Just look back at what happened with Katrina with the head of \nFEMA. It takes leadership in an agency. It takes all of us to put laws \nin place. But if there is not someone at the head of that agency who is \nsending a direction down through the ranks that our miners' safety and \nhealth has to come first, any law we pass will just be something \nwritten in a book.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, would the Senator agree with me that \nthere are, it seems to me, three major tests. We all know that Mr. \nStickler was a miner and comes from a mining family, and we respect \nthat. We have a great deal of respect for that. I am sure he was a \ngreat miner, as is his family, I am sure. But what we are looking at \nnow is the record of Mr. Stickler regarding mine safety.\n  Would the Senator agree with me that if you look over the record that \nhe has in terms of mine safety--this chart represents the Stickler-\nmanaged mines which racked up thousands of safety citations. This is \n1989 all the way through 1996. There were a total of 2,800 citations, \n97 closures, and we have here--there is some time overlap between that \nchart and this one--the Eagle's Nest Mine where the managed mine injury \nrate is nearly triple the national average.\n  So we have the citations which are an indication in terms of the mine \nsafety, we have a comparison with what has happened in terms of the \naverage, and then when he was running the mine safety program in \nPennsylvania, we had inspectors who were threatening to quit because \nthey thought he was failing to protect miners. This chart shows the \nmine safety inspectors and harmed coal miners, and his policy--that is \nthe policy of Mr. Stickler--is a detriment to safety that would, \nwithout a doubt, make the coal industry less safe for two-thirds of its \nworkers.\n  So we have his record in terms of mine safety in the mines. As an \nadministrator, we have inspectors of the mines who are prepared to \nresign. Then, the third strike, which I think is enormously powerful, \nis, as the Senator from Washington pointed out, his response to the \nquestions.\n  The Senator remembers, because she commented on this, when he was \nasked whether there needed to be any changes in the existing law, he \nsaid he thought that the existing laws were adequate. This is prior to \nthe time that we passed the new legislation, as I remember.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would answer the Senator in saying, \nthat is absolutely correct. Prior to any action by this body and the \nHouse in passing tougher laws, this nominee said no changes were \nneeded.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And when he was asked whether he would implement the law \nrequiring a mine rescue team on site at every mine, Mr. Stickler said: \nNo, Senator, I can't commit to that at this time. I will study this.\n  Does the Senator remember that when asked what he would do with \ninformation about new mine safety technology, Stickler said: I think \nthat needs to be looked at.\n  When asked whether he would require the use of new technology like \ntracking devices, Stickler said: I look forward to reviewing the \nresults of the technical evaluation.\n  When asked whether he would enforce the current standard prohibiting \nthe use of belt air if it was shown that the use of belt air caused the \nAlma mine fire, Stickler said: I would reevaluate the standard. Here \nare the series of questions, many of them asked by the Senator from \nWashington and others.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me having read the answers, plus \nattending the hearing, that one could say that the miners of this \ncountry deserve to have someone who is going to be more aggressive in \nterms of looking at new technology and in looking at additional safety \nstandards, in looking at more effective kinds of enforcement and \nprotecting the lives of the workers?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would ask the Chair to let us know when 2 minutes \nremain.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would just say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I want in charge of this agency someone who will stand \nup and say, We are going to make the mines safer for the families who \nsend a loved one there every day.\n  I went to that hearing, and all of what the Senator from \nMassachusetts just presented and the attitude this nominee presented--\nto me, this is not someone, despite his background, who is going to \nstand up and lead. I believe that we need to send this nominee back and \nwe need to have somebody who we can proudly say is going to lead this \nagency at a most critical time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, finally, I would like to get the \nSenator's reaction to these letters that we have gotten from families \nof those who were lost in the Sago mines and in other mines. I found \nthem enormously powerful. When we visited the Sago mine, we had--I see \nin the Chair presiding over the Senate a member of our committee and \nsomeone who was enormously involved and active in getting this \nlegislation passed, and I pay tribute to Senator Isakson. But in that \nmeeting, I can remember it was the sense of all of the members, \nRepublicans and Democrats, who were so moved by the tremendous tragedy \nand sadness, particularly when they had the sense of hope at the Sago \nmines that their loved ones might have been able to survive we made a \ncommitment to them that we were going to do everything possible to make \nsure that others who go into the mines were going to be protected. We \nhave come back here and passed a good, bipartisan bill, and also in the \nHouse of Representatives. There was a real question among many of us \nhere whether we could get a good one that the President would sign, and \nnow the President has announced that he is going to sign it on \nThursday.\n\n  The mines themselves are having record problems. The mines themselves \nwe find out are having record deaths. We passed good legislation and we \npromised those individuals that we were going to do everything we \npossibly could to make sure that the tragedies that happened to their \nloved ones would not happen again.\n  We passed the legislation. Now we have the letters from so many of \nthese families who have read the record of this individual and have \npleaded with us--pleaded with us--pleaded with us, that if we honor the \nmemory of those who died in these mines, that we put someone in charge \nwho is going to really implement that legislation and to fight for \nsafety.\n  Is the Senator not moved, as I am, by the letters we received from \nthe miners' families who have been lost, many of whom came to our \nhearings and who listened to the testimony on this individual? They \nhave studied his record, and now they plead with us--plead with us--\nthat we get someone else to provide the leadership for implementing the \nmine safety laws. Is the Senator moved by those letters?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, every Senator on this floor should take a few minutes to \nread those letters from the families who have been impacted by mining \ndisasters. I would say to my colleagues and to the President that we \nought to be thinking we have to put someone in place in this agency who \nis going to wake up every single day he is on the job and say, What am \nI doing to make sure that in my responsibility of taking care of \nhundreds of miners every single day, I am moving the ball forward.\n  I have to say to the Senator from Massachusetts, there was no passion \nwhen I saw the presentation. I did not see someone in front of me who \nunderstood the tremendous responsibility that he was being given and \nwho would wake up every single day and say, What am I doing to improve \nmine safety? That is my responsibility.\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\n  That is the kind of person I want in charge of this agency, I say to \nmy friend from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. If I could have \nrecognition myself.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 2 \nminutes and 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nWashington again. We have worked very closely together. We have worked \nwith the administration. We have worked with our colleagues and \nfriends, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Byrd. We have worked together \nwith Governor Manchin and other Governors. We have worked with the \nworkers, the mine workers, the families. We have worked very closely \ntogether. This isn't in any sense a partisan issue. We have come \ntogether. There wasn't a dissenting vote here in the U.S. Senate in \npassing this legislation. There were a few votes in the House that \nwanted to have even stronger legislation. So we are basically all \ntogether and we are asking ourselves, given the fact we are all \ntogether and given the fact that we have this extraordinary challenge \nand problem that is affecting these workers, are they not entitled to \nsomeone who is going to be an effective leader in terms of providing \nsafety.\n  I commend the Senator from Washington for making a strong case. We \nwant to try to have a common position with our colleagues and friends \nwithin the administration. But this person--if we are going to I think \nmeet our responsibility to those miners, we have to do better.\n  I thank my friend from Washington for her excellent presentation. I \nthank her for her conclusions.\n  We are facing a major challenge in this Nation about safety in our \nmines. We have seen the expansion of these mines as our energy \nsituation has become more acute, and now is the time to have real \nimplementation. Now is the time to fulfill our commitment to these \nfamilies and to these workers. Now is the time to honor the memory of \nthose who have gone into the mines and who have lost their lives. Now \nis the time to help those whose primary desire is honoring the members \nof their families by passing an effective bill and have it implemented \neffectively. Now is the time to do that. If we are going to do that, \nthis is not the individual who is equipped to be able to do it. He is a \nfine gentleman, and I admire the fact he and his family have been \nminers. But you have to look at the record: Whether he has been running \nthe mines and overseeing the mines effectively. In testifying, by \nnature of disposition, he is not the man to implement this, and we \nshould reject his nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement which we \nadopted last night, it is my recollection that on the Democratic side \nwe were going to be offering an amendment immediately following the \npending Warner amendment.\n  I stand corrected. Apparently there was an understanding on this, \nbetween myself and Senator Warner, which was not incorporated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An understanding but not a consent agreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer. Pursuant to that \nunderstanding, then, I ask unanimous consent that the pending Warner \namendment be temporarily laid aside so I can offer an amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4205\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4205, an amendment \non behalf of Senator Lautenberg, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration following the disposition of the Warner bipartisan \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin) for Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4205.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide a temporary prohibition on an increase in \n copayments required under the retail pharmacy system of the pharmacy \n             benefits program of the Department of Defense)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 707. TEMPORARY PROHIBITION ON INCREASE IN COPAYMENTS \n                   UNDER RETAIL PHARMACY SYSTEM OF PHARMACY \n                   BENEFITS PROGRAM.\n\n       Subsection (a)(6) of section 1074g of title 10, United \n     States Code, as amended by section 702(b) of this Act, is \n     further amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(D) During the period beginning on April 1, 2006, and \n     ending on December 31, 2007, the cost sharing requirements \n     established under this paragraph for pharmaceutical agents \n     available through retail pharmacies covered by paragraph \n     (2)(E)(ii) may not exceed amounts as follows:\n       ``(i) In the case of generic agents, $3.\n       ``(ii) In the case of formulary agents, $9.\n       ``(iii) In the case of nonformulary agents, $22.''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the President's budget proposes that the \ncopays for prescriptions under the TRICARE Prescription Benefit Program \nbe increased for our troops and their families and for retirees, and \nthat the increase in the copays be, on the generic prescriptions, from \n$3 to $5; on brand-name prescriptions from $9 to $15. The amendment \nthat Senator Lautenberg is offering and that I very much support would \nfreeze the current copays in place until December 31, 2007.\n  This is not the time, in the middle of a war, to be raising copays on \nour military personnel and their families. They should not have to \nworry about whether their families are going to be able to afford to \nbuy prescription drugs. The copays that currently exist are not \nstatutory, so the Department of Defense does not need legislative \nauthority to increase them. They have their authority. The problem is \nthat our bill is silent on this subject so they would be increasing the \ncopay because there is no prohibition in our bill on their doing so.\n  About 43 percent of the prescriptions filled through the TRICARE \npharmacy benefits program are filled in retail pharmacies. The increase \nwhich the administration proposes would significantly increase \nbeneficiary cost shares for medical care. Of course, the fear is not \nonly that it would be additional\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\nmoney coming out of the pockets of our troops and their families, but \nalso this increase would discourage beneficiaries from using their \nmilitary health care benefit.\n  The Department of Defense has estimated that the copayments would \ncreate additional revenue of $81 million in fiscal year 2007. They also \nbelieve beneficiaries would not use their military pharmacy benefits to \nthe same extent and that would mean that there would be savings to the \nGovernment of $54 million and there would also be some savings if \nbeneficiaries switch to mail order rather than retail pharmacies.\n  I don't think we ought to be assuming savings or counting on savings \ncoming out of the pockets of our troops and their families while we are \nat war. I think it is a totally inappropriate time to do so, so I \nsupport the Lautenberg amendment. For a soldier in combat, under these \ncircumstances, the circumstances that exist these days, to have a worry \nthat a spouse or children would not get needed prescriptions because of \nthe administration's desire to save some money is simply \nunconscionable.\n  The Senate bill directs a Comptroller General study of the DOD \npharmacy benefit program to examine the cost and copayments structure \nof the program. We clearly ought to await that before we allow these \ncopays to be increased as the administration budget proposes.\n  I see my dear friend and colleague, Senator Warner, our chairman, on \nthe floor now. We had an understanding that we would lay down this \namendment this morning, that I would lay it down on behalf of Senator \nLautenberg and speak briefly in support of it, and that after the \ndisposition of the chairman's amendment, which is a bipartisan \namendment, we would then come back to the Lautenberg amendment and at \nthat point there would be additional debate--Senator Lautenberg would \nspeak in support of his amendment and any others who wish to debate it \nwould have an opportunity at that time.\n  We thought, given our understanding last night, we would lay this \namendment down at this time. I have just done so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member, my good \nfriend, the Senator from Michigan, is correct. We laid down an \namendment on this side under the understanding this is the amendment \nthat he selected to be laid down. I am just wondering if we can try to \nget some idea of the magnitude of the debate? I am not able to assess \nit on my side. I judge you are not. So we have some understanding of \nthe time that is likely to be consumed in the debate--this is an \nimportant amendment--we will work on that together, in hopes we can get \nsome time agreement and therefore we can then move on to other \namendments.\n  I would simply ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \ndebate or the disposition of this amendment, that I be recognized to \noffer another amendment at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my distinguished colleague, it is my hope then \nwe could alternate from side to side, so we could consider your \namendment which would follow the third amendment, which I will put on.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate that. That is fine with us.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask the time be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time allotted to the \nquorum call will be equally divided.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brownback are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield the floor.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma may require. He will be speaking with regard to a \nvery important trip to Iraq. It bears directly on the pending measure; \nthat is, a resolution on the success of our military in eliminating al-\nZarqawi.\n  I yield to the Senator such time as he desires.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia, the \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and also for the great \njob he has done in bringing this Defense authorization bill to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, on early Thursday morning, about 5:30, my radio alarm \nwent off and I heard the three words--al-Zarqawi is dead. I think that \naffected me by just hearing that. I sat up in bed, and I thought it did \nwork. It is happening. I told the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee that I have to go to Iraq.\n  The two most significant things that have happened in Iraq since \nbringing down Saddam Hussein happened on the same date, coincidentally. \nIt is just remarkable: first of all, bringing down al-Zarqawi, the \nmonster, and at the same time confirming the ministers in Iraq. We \nthought that would be a long, enduring battle. It sailed through, and \nit happened on the same day.\n  I can't tell you what a profound effect it had on the people of Iraq \nand on our troops over there. And now we find out about the surprise \nvisit by the President. I figured out that our planes crossed on the \nway. I was coming back from Iraq and he was going to Iraq. If I had \nknown that, I would have stayed. But it was a pretty well-guarded \nsecret. Of the two places I spent most of my time, this one was where \nal-Zarqawi was actually killed, just a couple of miles north of Balad \nAir Force Base and then in Baghdad.\n  It was such an incredible thing to be there after it happened and to \ntalk to the different ministers. Defense Minister Jasim is the new \nDefense Minister, and he had a lot of things to say. In fact, he asked \nme to bring back this message for the American people. I am going to \nread this, because this came just a few hours ago from Defense Minister \nJasim to me to take to the American people. He said:\n\n       Tell them their sacrifice is for a very noble cause, they \n     have given freedom to 26 million people. I believe they are \n     waging a just war for humanity. The terrorism must be stopped \n     or it will spread all over the world, like a carbon copy of \n     fascism and communism. This is the first world war of the \n     21st century. The American victims have borne the price of a \n     freer world . . . We are very grateful . . . The war in Iraq \n     is a just war and we have no option but victory. It is not a \n     war that affects Iraq alone, but is truly a world war.\n       The terrorists are a sickness that must be eliminated . . . \n     There is great transformation taking place in Iraq but the \n     international media does not focus on positive things \n     happening. They only focus on the negative, the bad things \n     happening . . . what the terrorists are doing . . . they will \n     publish anything bad . . . They try to say Americans are \n     leading the way and we the Iraqis are in the back. This is \n     the opposite. We are in the front and Americans are in the \n     back.\n       We started with the multi-national forces in front and us \n     at back. Then we worked side by side as very good partners. \n     Now we are often in front and the multinational forces are in \n     a supporting role.\n       Your presence here is very important. From the beginning to \n     now, we have always had an American partner. I am sad when my \n     American partner leaves me. But, when he leaves and returns \n     to the U.S. I feel we have a voice going back to America. I \n     fell in love with the American people.\n\n  That is Abdul Jasim, who is the newly confirmed Minister of Defense. \nHe said so many other things when we were there that I would like to \nshare, but it is very difficult to do that because he was so emotional \nat the time.\n  Well, this happened to be my 11th trip over to the Iraq AOR, and I \nhave been watching, as the months have gone by--every other month or so \nbeing over there--and seeing the differences, seeing the changes that \nare taking place.\n  Just to give you an example, one of the tests we use to determine how \nstrong the Iraqi people are supporting us is the number of qualified \ntips that come in. The way they come in is where someone says, for \nexample: There is a safe house over here. We suspect something. These \nare Iraqi people saying where the terrorists are. And those numbers of \ntips have increased tenfold in the last 12 months. I can remember when \nthere were only 30 or 40 tips a month. There are now 5,000 tips a \nmonth, and they are qualified tips. Some of these tips led to not just \nbringing down al-Zarqawi but also\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\nsome 17 others on the same day. So these things are going on. These \nthings are happening.\n  As to the quality of the Iraqi security forces, I think Minister of \nDefense Jasim is right. He sees that our media is not accurately \nreporting what is going on over there. How many people in America know \nthat as of the current time, 75 percent of the special operations by \nIraqis are actually led by Iraqis, not by Americans? We are leading 25 \npercent. I remember when it was zero percent. Now, they are leading 75 \npercent. And 62 of the 112 battalions are at level 2 or level 1. That \nmeans they are capable of going out and fighting. That is half of them.\n  One of the statistics we got from Dr. Rubaie, who is the National \nSecurity Adviser--a real sharp guy and one who really has his hand on \nthis--says 66 percent of the hospital beds are occupied by Americans \nand 34 percent by Iraqis. However, 66 percent of the surgeries are on \nIraqis and 34 percent are on Americans. That kind of tells you what is \nhappening over there and the change that is taking place. They are the \nones who are doing it.\n  While we were over in Balad, we had occasion to learn there were \nseveral attacks on Iraqis. Some 50 Iraqis were killed last night, and \nthey were killed by the terrorists. Here is the important thing. \nZarqawi was not an Iraqi; he was Jordanian. Osama bin Laden is not an \nIraqi; he is Saudi. Now, this new guy, al-Muhajer, we don't know about \nhim. All we know is he is not an Iraqi. In other words, this is a war \nbeing waged by people from outside of Iraq on the Iraqis, and the Iraqi \npeople are very sensitive to it. They know it.\n  It is interesting, one of the things the Minister of Defense said is \nthat a lot of things are American issues, they are not really issues \nover there. For example, all we talk about in the media here is, well, \nwe have the Shiites and the Sunnis, and they do not like each other. \nAnd he said that is not true at all. He said: We are Iraqis first, and \nthen we are Sunnis or Shiites or Kurds second. To demonstrate that, \nthere is a structure over there in Baghdad which is comparable to our \nTomb of the Unknown Soldier. We stopped there. They had an honor guard \nthere. The honor guard had nine people. They had one leader and eight \nothers. When I asked him the question, through a translator: What about \nthe problem that exists between the Shias and the Sunnis, he said: No, \nthat is not true at all. He said: I am a Shia. My wife is Sunni. And I \nhave been working on the honor guard with these people for several days \nhere at our Unknown Soldier event, and I don't know who they are. I \ncan't tell you who one of the eight is in terms of being a Sunni or a \nShia.\n  So those are American problems. Those are not things resonating over \nthere. And the quality of what they have done in terms of being quality \nsoldiers is something the American people are not aware of. I had \noccasion to be up in Fallujah back when the last election took place, \nand I was there when the Iraqi security forces actually were doing \ntheir thing, voting. They were taking their lives in their own hands by \ndoing it because this is Fallujah, one of the most dangerous areas over \nthere.\n  They came back very proud. No one was killed while they were trying \nto do it. They came back and said: We are participating in an election. \nThat was during the last election. Now everyone is confirmed. The \ngovernment is in place. They know what they are doing. And the most \nrecent thing, which you may not have heard of because it just happened, \nis that Dr. Rubaie, the National Security Adviser for the Iraqis, said \nhe believes that in a matter of a very short period of time--by the end \nof the year--he will ask our troops to leave, except for 100,000. In \nother words, we are slowly bringing it down.\n  We have heard in the field a lot of things you do not hear when there \nare hearings here in Washington, DC. If you go over there and you talk \nto the people on the ground, talk to the commanders on the ground, they \nhave said for a long period of time that when we can get to the point \nwhere we have 10 Iraqi divisions of trained and qualified and equipped \nIraqi security forces--10 divisions--then they will be able to take \ncare of their own security. Well, the number that equates to 10 \ndivisions would equal 325,000 trained and equipped Iraqi troops. Well, \nwe are right now, today, at 264,000 trained and equipped Iraqis.\n\n  Now, some of the adversaries over here say they are not really \ntrained to do a good job, they are not really good soldiers. Let me \ntell you, they are. All you have to do is talk to our soldiers who \ntrain them. Now they train themselves.\n  Last week, I was over in Afghanistan, and they are doing a good job \nof training their own troops over there. And that model has worked very \nwell in Iraq. So we are rapidly getting to that point. Will we be out \naltogether? No, we will not be out altogether, but they will be \nproviding their own security. We still have troops in Kosovo and Bosnia \nand Sinai and other places but not providing the security. They will be \nproviding their own security. We are getting so close to that point. \nWhat has happened in just the last few days is very significant.\n  So as to al-Zarqawi, there is no one who has been a more brutal \nterrorist than he has been. He was the No. 1 terrorist in the world, \nand he is down now. Al-Zarqawi was the one responsible for the \nassassination of our U.S. diplomat, Lawrence Foley, in 2002. We all \nremember the horrific things we saw: the beheading of Nicholas Berg in \n2004--that was al-Zarqawi--the 2005 bombing of three hotels in Jordan, \nthe countless bombings and terrorist attacks against U.S. forces and \nIraqi civilians. He was trying to create a sectarian civil war in Iraq \nby murdering Shiites and acting as al-Qaida's commander in Iraq. Osama \nbin Laden called him the ``Prince.'' I think most people considered \nhim, if anything, to have been even worse than Osama bin Laden. So that \nwas a great change. That was a great victory for the coalition forces, \nbut, more importantly, it was a victory for the Iraqi people.\n  So with these things happening--and you look at the good side that \nyou do not get sometimes in the media--there are 18 provinces in Iraq, \nand 15 of them are relatively secure. There are hardly any incidents \ntaking place there. Most of the problems are in just three of them. And \nkeep in mind, these are not Iraqi terrorists; these are outsiders who \nare coming in. They are having a harder and harder time recruiting \npeople to carry out their terrorist activities. We have found that \nrecently they are actually changing their homicide vests for suicide \nvests so they can put them on individuals and force Iraqis to go and \nperform certain acts. And if they do not do it, they can, remotely, \ndetonate and blow that Iraqi up.\n  So things like that are happening right now. At the same time, good \nthings are happening with the administration. The government is in \nplace. I cannot tell you how impressed I was personally with Dr. \nRubaie. I have known him for a long period of time. And I would say \nthat the Defense Minister, Abdul Jasim, has already acknowledged, from \nthe quotes I have given, that he is one of our very best friends. He is \nthe one who said al-Zarqawi was suffering from the same disease as \nHitler and Stalin, and he is one who is going to finish the job that we \nhelped them with in the beginning.\n  I would say this is a time when good things are happening, and we \nfeel very good about the progress the Iraqi security forces are making, \nvery good about the constitutional government that is in place, very \ngood about the new Ministers who have been confirmed now. And we are \nlight-years ahead of where we were only 6 months ago.\n  So this, what I have characterized as probably America being in the \nmost threatened position we have been in in our history, is now showing \nthat we are at the core of the terrorist activities, which is in Iraq. \nWe are now winning. The Iraqi people are winning. So I feel very good \nabout that.\n  Let me say to Senator Warner, the chairman of our committee, I am \nvery proud of the bill we have put together. I have some amendments, \nand I will want to be recognized at the appropriate time to bring them \nup.\n  I ask the Senator, do you have other people coming down wanting time \nright now?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at the present time the bill is being \namended by the amendment which you just addressed, and there is a \npending amendment offered by the minority. That is the next order of \nbusiness. This afternoon, I think there would be opportunity for \nadditional amendments.\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That would be good. I thought maybe I could describe what \namendment would be coming and why.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator so desires.\n  But, Mr. President, I first inquire as to the allocation of time on \nthe pending measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, the majority controls an \nadditional 11 minutes, the minority controls 23 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator would like to take a minute or two, I \nwould be happy to have you alert the Senate as to some of the matters \nyou will be bringing up.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No. I say to the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, this amendment is very significant, and I will have \nample opportunity to explain it. Hopefully, we can do that this \nafternoon.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The time \nwill be charged equally.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSessions be added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 4208.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to return to the pending amendment offered \nby myself on behalf of the joint leadership of the Senate, this \nbipartisan amendment commends basically the U.S. Armed Forces, the \nintelligence community, and other agencies, along with coalition \npartners for the actions taken on June 7, 2006, that resulted in the \ndeath of Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaida in Iraq. The military \noperation that resulted in the death of Zarqawi was truly an \nextraordinarily professional accomplishment of the combined U.S. and \ncoalition forces and the infrastructure of intelligence, both civilian \nand military, that supported the operation. It displayed the precision, \nperseverence, and professionalism of our Armed Forces, supported by a \nsophisticated and superb intelligence apparatus that included U.S., \nIraqi, and coalition intelligence organizations.\n  Behind the details that were made public so far, I assure all that \nthere were months of coordinated hard work by analysts, human \nintelligence operatives, special operations forces, and military \nplanners which were in place at the time various pieces of information \nwith a precise direction to the whereabouts of Zarqawi came into the \nknowledge of the intelligence operators.\n  The death of Zarqawi is certainly a significant blow to the terrorist \nnetwork in Iraq, Osama bin Laden's international network, and the al-\nQaida organization wherever they lurk in the world today in the shadows \nof death and destruction to the freedom of others. At Camp David \nyesterday the President was very careful to, with a sense of deep \nhumility, commend the men and women of the Armed Forces and others who \nperformed this mission, but he put the results of the mission in the \ncontext of the realities of the situation in Iraq. The press today \nreports from Camp David the following by the President:\n\n       Zarqawi is dead, but the difficult and necessary mission in \n     Iraq continues. We can expect the terrorists and insurgents \n     to carry on without him. We can expect sectarian violence to \n     continue. Yet the ideology of terror has lost one of its most \n     visible and aggressive leaders.\n\n  I will have further comments today with regard to that important \nconference in Camp David. Zarqawi was the most prominent insurgent in \nIraq and the most active of any of Bin Laden's affiliates around the \nglobe. While Bin Laden hides in mountain caves capable of making \noccasional audio tapes, Zarqawi was working to trigger a civil war, \ndisrupt the newly unified democratic process of the new unity \nGovernment in Iraq, and then use Iraq as a base to launch attacks \nthroughout the region. There is proof of that intent by Zarqawi. This \namendment proudly salutes the brave and professional work of our \nmilitary forces as well as the formidable efforts of our military, \ncivilian, and allied intelligence operations for our efforts to end \nthis brutal reign of terror.\n  The operation that resulted in the death of Zarqawi was not an \nisolated act. It triggered 56 more raids against targets connected with \nZarqawi's organization in the 48 hours after his death as U.S., \ncoalition, and Iraqi forces capitalized on this mission by taking \naction to disrupt other parts of the al-Qaida network. This amendment \nalso commends our coalition partners in Iraq's new government of \nnational unity for their invaluable assistance in the operation and \ntheir extraordinary efforts to secure a free and prosperous Iraq. The \namendment closes by most appropriately commending our civilian \nleadership, from the Commander in Chief on down, and military \nleadership for their continuing efforts to eliminate the leadership of \nal-Qaida in Iraq and elsewhere. In all, this was a very successful \njoint and combined military operation. This mission was planned and \nexecuted by talented and courageous Americans, Iraqis, and coalition \npartners.\n  They all had one purpose--to eventually make Iraq safe and secure.\n  The operation that resulted in the death of Zarqawi may have eclipsed \na very significant political development, the appointment of Ministers \nof Defense and the Interior, thereby ending weeks of political debate \nand completing the formation of Iraq's first permanent unity \ngovernment. The death of Zarqawi and the appointment of these two \nMinisters are two very significant events in our unrelenting effort, \nwith the coalition forces, toward a free and prosperous Iraq. While \nIraq's insurgency and its divisions along religious lines will not \neasily recede, the death of Zarqawi and the complete formation of \nIraq's government of national unity are reasons for renewed confidence \nthat 2006 is a period of transition in Iraq and that our objectives are \nachievable.\n  I point that out because a year ago when we considered this bill, I, \ntogether with Senator Levin, put in an amendment which outlined the \nprogress that had to be made in 2006. These are chapters toward \nachieving the goal we stated in that amendment which was part of our \nbill last year.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see one of our distinguished colleagues \nseeking recognition for an important set of comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kohl are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Without objection, the time will be divided equally.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in first thanking the \nmen and women of our military services who were responsible for the \nmyriad of actions that were taken years ago that led to the ultimate \nelimination of such a vicious terrorist as Zarqawi. We also thank the \nmen and women of our military services who are serving multiple tours \nof duty in arduous and dangerous locations with great personal \nsacrifice and great disruption in their lives and those of their family \nmembers.\n  The killing of Zarqawi is very welcome news. It is not the panacea \nfor addressing the extreme levels of violence in Iraq or for solving \nthe large\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\nnumber of vexing issues--and the President has acknowledged as much--\nbut it is an important step and one that will reduce the influence of \nal-Qaida in Iraq. He was responsible for a number of spectacular \nterrorist attacks that produced a large number of casualties and \ngrizzly murders of kidnap victims. Zarqawi, while not the dominant part \nof the insurgency but a part of it, needed to be attacked and needed to \nbe addressed. The insurgency, however, primarily is made up of \ndisaffected Iraqi Sunnis. Zarqawi played a role in stirring up ethnic \nconflict between the Sunnis and the Shiites. Much of the violence \nrelating to that conflict is traced to the reaction of Shiite militias \nto the Sunni insurgency and to, of course, their reaction to the Shiite \nmilitias. Our security forces need to confront those militias and the \nother armed groups.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there needs to be a political solution in \naddition to the military force which is present. Indeed, probably a \nmore important event than the killing of Zarqawi was the selection by \nthe Prime Minister and the ratification by the Iraqi Council of \nRepresentatives of the key ministries, Defense and Interior, and the \nNational Security Adviser. Those vacancies lasted too long. Their \nfilling, hopefully with people who have the support of all the Iraqi \npeople who want Iraq to become a nation, is even a more important step \nthan the killing of Zarqawi, as important as that step is.\n  As we all support--hopefully unanimously--this bipartisan amendment \nwhich is before us, we also need to recognize that there is critical \nwork that remains to be done, and while this is a step toward, \nhopefully, a direction of Iraqi nationhood, most of the steps remain to \nbe taken.\n  While Senator Durbin is on the floor, I ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately after the disposition of the next amendment of Senator \nWarner, Senator Durbin then be recognized, as we are alternating \namendments, by my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I concur in that recommendation, and it is \nmy hope that I can be a cosponsor on this side of the aisle because the \namendment is very important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4208\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The pending amendment, Mr. President, as I understand it, \nis the amendment of Senator Warner on behalf of Senator Frist, Senator \nReid, and myself.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate will vote today to commend the \nU.S. Armed Forces for their efforts in Iraq. I will support this \namendment, as I have supported other amendments and resolutions to \ncommend our military personnel serving overseas for their service and \ncommitment. I oppose the policy that sent our troops to Iraq, but I \nstand by our servicemen and servicewomen 100 percent.\n  However, I am concerned that the amendment may have unintended \nconsequences. Previous statements that boast of substantial victories \nin Iraq have been proven wrong at the cost of American lives. Declaring \nvictory because of the elimination of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi could be a \ncostly mistake. I agree with the President's comment on June 9, 2006, \nin which he said, ``I don't want the American people to think that a \nwar is won with the death of one person.''\n  Our troops are still facing daily attacks in Iraq. I thank them for \ntheir service, and I am particularly proud of the efforts of the West \nVirginia National Guard in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other locations \naround the world. Instead of seeking a lofty sounding but largely \nmeaningless resolution from the Congress, the President should instead \nbe working to send Congress a plan to start bringing our troops home \nwith the honor and the thanks they have earned from this grateful \nNation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12:15 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to a vote on amendment No. \n4208.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4208.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Gerald Ford)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1013. NAMING OF CVN-78 AIRCRAFT CARRIER AS THE U.S.S. \n                   GERALD FORD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Gerald R. Ford has served his country with honor and \n     distinction for the past 64 years, and continues to serve.\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\n       (2) Gerald R.

Monterey \n     (CVL-26) during World War II, taking part in major operations \n     in the Pacific, including at Makin Island, Kwajalein, Truk, \n     Saipan, and the Philippine Sea.\n       (3) The U.S.S. Monterey earned 10 battle stars, awarded for \n     participation in battle, while Gerald R. Ford served on the \n     vessel.\n       (4) Gerald R.

Gerald Ford.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the scheduled \nrecess today be extended to 3:30 p.m., further that the cloture vote on \nthe nomination of Richard Stickler be vitiated and at 3:30 p.m. the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of the conference report \nto accompany H.R. 4939, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wonder if my friend from Massachusetts, who was engaged \nwhen that request was made, has anything in response?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator be kind enough to vitiate the consent? \nI had talked to the leader and the concern--reserving the right to \nobject--was if we vitiated this, the administration would go ahead and \nhave a recess appointment. We understand we have the signing of the \nMine Safety Act on Thursday. This was a real coming together, a \nbipartisan effort. The President is supporting it. It passed \noverwhelmingly in the House. It is a very important bill and will make \na big difference. It has the support of the families.\n  We were at least looking for some opportunity, if it was going to be \nthe position of the administration to go ahead and recess-appoint it--\nwe wanted at least some assurance that we would have a chance to have \nthe cloture vote prior to the time of the appointment. That is \nbasically what we were looking at.\n  We have no objection to following the leaders, to vitiate this, but \nthere is concern that we have vitiating this particular amendment. We \nunderstand even if we do or do not get cloture, the President could \nstill have a recess appointment. But nonetheless, for those who feel \nvery strongly about this nominee, at least at this point we are able to \nget a vote in one way or the other prior to the time of a recess \nappointment. It was that particular position that we did not want to \ngive up.\n  Just so the Senator has some understanding about what we are looking \nfor, we want to work with the leadership. As the Senator knows, there \nis a constitutional issue whether you can appoint during the short \nrecess, which would be the Fourth of July recess. More often than not \nit is done in the August recess, which is well down the road, and we \nhave the pending business which is of great importance to this.\n  We are glad to work with the leadership. If we could have the \nassurances from the Senator from Virginia that he understands our \nposition and will make a good-faith effort to at least give us the \nopportunity--maybe the leadership doesn't want to give us that \nopportunity. That is what our position is, those who feel strongly \nabout the Stickler nomination.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Massachusetts \nand my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, I am not at \nliberty--I have no instructions from my leadership beyond propounding \nthis. It was my understanding it was cleared on both sides. I assumed \nthat when it was handed to me, and therefore I proceeded to request by \nunanimous consent these actions.\n  I think Members are anxious to go to a series of events now, namely \nthe party caucuses, followed by the traditional photograph, and then \nthere is a briefing at 2:30 by the Secretaries of State and Defense, \nwhich I believe is very important for Senators to have the opportunity \nto attend.\n  That is the purpose of this unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator just defer and offer this maybe when \nwe come right back in? Let's just work this out.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator has the right to object. That \nwould do it. I can certainly say that I will relay the Senator's \nconcerns to my leader. If that would suffice for the moment to allow \nthis unanimous consent agreement to go forward? Would that be \nsufficient?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. I think we will be able to work this out. We want \nto. We have every desire to try to work it out. We would just like some \nassurances from the leader that our position will----\n  Mr. WARNER. I have just been given a note indicating the leader will \nbe fully briefed about the concerns of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield, whoever has the floor?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I believe, I say to the distinguished former leader, \nI have the floor, but I yield the floor to him.\n  Mr. BYRD. I simply thank the very distinguished Senator from Virginia \nfor his response to the request and his willingness to withhold his \nunanimous consent request for the time being. I thank him.\n  Mr. WARNER. I propound the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia reserves the \nright to object. Does he in fact object?\n  Mr. WARNER. You have my full attention.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am only reserving the right to object. I hope we would \nhave just a little while to talk about this. I am very much opposed to \nthis. But I read the tea leaves very well. If the Senator would just \ndesist for the time being, please?\n  Mr. WARNER. If it is the desire of the Senator from West Virginia to \nobject, I respect that right. The matter will now be put aside, if that \nis your desire.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry I was not on the floor. I thought we had this \nall worked out. It is my understanding there are people who want to go \nforward with the cloture vote, is that right? Because either we do the \ncloture vote at 3:30 or we take it off. The majority leader has told me \nthat we take it off and he has the ability to reset it at any time he \nchooses or we have the vote at 3:30. It is as simple as that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, what we were looking for is \nthat--we are glad to take it off. But we were hopeful, if it was going \nto be the desire to go ahead with a recess appointment, whenever that \nwas, we at\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\nleast have an opportunity to have this vote sometime in the future. If \nthey are not going to have the recess appointment, this disappears. But \nI hope we would have that opportunity at the present time. I do not \nthink that is an unreasonable request, if it is the desire of the \nadministration to move ahead with this nominee with a recess \nappointment, that at least we come back to where we are now and would \nhave some opportunity to express ourselves. We would be giving that up \nif we just vitiate the whole thing. He could say we are going to go \nahead and he is going to appoint him as a recess appointment during the \nJuly break or sometime in the August break. That is the dilemma that we \nare in.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the majority leader. I hate to be speaking \nfor him here, but he is not here. The majority leader said he has not \nspoken to anybody about a recess appointment. He doesn't know if they \nhave any intention of doing that. He doesn't know. But he doesn't want \nto be constrained, so it would be my suggestion we just go ahead at \n3:30, then, because doing anything other than that I think puts the \nmajority leader in a real bind. I am willing to put him in a bind but \nnot for anything that is my cause.\n  I suggest we withdraw the unanimous consent request and go ahead with \na vote at 3:30, if people are demanding there be some conditions on \ntaking away the vote. The unanimous consent request, as I understand \nit, is that the vote would be vitiated and the leader would reset that \nvote at any time he chose fit. Certainly the distinguished Senators \nfrom West Virginia and Massachusetts can talk to the majority leader, \nif they want to do that, following the vote being vitiated.\n  But unless there is an agreement on this unanimous consent request, \nbasically that the vote scheduled for 3:30 today be vitiated and we go \nto the conference report on the emergency supplemental--if that is not \nthe agreement, then I assume we would go to the vote at 3:30 and go to \nthe supplemental at some later time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it seems to me that we could have the \ncertainty, then, if the vote is to be held, that we could go \nimmediately following the vote to the supplemental.\n  Mr. REID. That was discussed. I am not ready to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I think for the moment that we are confronted with \nthe parliamentary situation whereby there is objection.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Chair, what time is the vote set for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is set for 2:30, with an hour of \ndebate.\n  Mr. REID. The reason that is very awkward is because we have \nSecretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Rice coming here, and to have a knock-\ndown, drag-out debate on this at this time doesn't seem to be very good \nfor the body because it is reported that the President is on the way \nback from Iraq. I think we should go ahead with that schedule, which \nwas to vitiate this vote, but we got wound up somehow in recess \nappointments the majority leader and I have never talked about. As I \nsaid to the floor and to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nhe has not spoken to anybody about a recess appointment.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from West \nVirginia: Do we go ahead with the schedule as we have it laid out, that \nat 2:30 p.m. we start the vote on Stickler, and those who want to be \nhere for the debate on Stickler could do that, and those who want to go \nto the Rice-Rumsfeld hearing can do that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is satisfactory.\n  Mr. REID. There is no unanimous consent request that we come here at \n2:30 to start the debate on Stickler, and there will be a vote at 3:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Virginia withdraw his \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WARNER. No. Leave the unanimous consent request there. I \nunderstand there is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts objects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5746-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled \nrecess today be extended until 3:30 p.m.; further that the cloture vote \non the nomination of Richard Stickler be vitiated and that at 3:30 p.m. \nthe Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 4939, the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thought \nwe talked with the leader about a process and a procedure, of which the \nleader was agreeable, that we would have a chance--if there is going to \nbe a recess appointment--that we would have an opportunity to go ahead \nand have a cloture vote prior to that time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the discussion among the Democratic \nleadership and Republican leadership was, indeed, that we vitiate the \nvote today and that at a time that is mutually agreed upon this vote \nwill come back to this body.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. To this body prior to the recess appointment?\n  Mr. FRIST. Prior. That is the understanding. And the discussion was--\nI have had absolutely no conversations with the administration about a \nrecess appointment----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Right.\n  Mr. FRIST. But if there were to be such a recess appointment, that \nthen this vote could come back, would come back at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leader. We are going to have a very \nimportant Thursday signing of the Mine Safety Act. It is a reflection \nof the good work of our chairman, Senator Enzi, and many others on our \nHuman Resources Committee. It is very good legislation, passed by the \nHouse of Representatives, and to be signed by the President. It is \ngoing to be enormously important. We look forward to that and hopefully \nto its effective enforcement.\n  I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nnomination of Richard M. Stickler to be the Assistant Secretary of \nLabor for Mine Safety and Health. Mr. Stickler's nomination was \nreferred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. On \nMarch 8 of this year, the committee reported the nomination favorably \nout of the committee.\n  The Senate acted just 2 weeks ago on mine safety legislation which \nthe House passed on Wednesday. It is anticipated that the President \nwill sign this into law expeditiously. It is extremely important for \nthe Mine Safety and Health Administration to have permanent leadership \nto implement this important mine safety law; therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of Mr. Stickler's nomination today.\n  Despite decades of improving safety in our Nation's mines, this year \nwe witnessed a series of tragic accidents in the coal mines of West \nVirginia and Kentucky. Those tragedies, in part, led to a thorough \nreview of our mine safety laws. The Senate Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, which I am privileged to chair, and the \nSubcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety, chaired by Senator \nJohnny Isakson, conducted extensive hearings and roundtables on the \nissues related to mine safety. We conducted an exhaustive review of the \ncurrent Mine Safety and Health Act and met, at length, with \nrepresentatives from the mining industry, labor, the professional \nsafety community and State and Federal regulators, all in an effort to \ndetermine how we could act in a responsible and constructive way to \nimprove workplace safety for our Nation's miners. The result of these \ncollective efforts was the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response \nAct. The MINER Act is the first comprehensive\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\nreform of U.S. mine safety laws in a generation. Following its \nintroduction, the MINER Act was unanimously reported out of the HELP \nCommittee and, almost immediately thereafter, was passed in this body \nby unanimous consent on May 24. The House passed this bill on Wednesday \nnight. It is expected that the President will sign the bill into law \nvery soon.\n  What has marked the MINER Act from the outset has been its bipartisan \nnature. The bill was drafted and moved through Congress as the direct \nresult of continual efforts, on both sides, to reach across the aisle \nand reconcile differences. The passage of the MINER Act has shown that \nensuring the safety of miners is not a partisan issue.\n  While amending the Mine Safety Act is an important step in meeting \nour responsibility to ensure miner safety, it is not the only step. We \nmust not only give the Mine Safety and Health Administration the \nstatutory tools it needs to get the job done; we must give it the \npermanent leadership it needs as well. This, too, should be an action \nin which partisanship should play no part. The Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration has been without a permanent, Senate-confirmed, \nAssistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health since November of 2004. \nThis is too long under any circumstance but particularly in the wake of \nthe recent coal mining tragedies, and on the eve of implementing the \nmany changes that will result from enactment of the MINER Act.\n  We have the opportunity today to address this issue and to provide \nMSHA with the permanent leadership it needs by voting to confirm \nRichard M. Stickler, the President's nominee to head MSHA. Mr. Stickler \nis an experienced nominee whose leadership is needed during this \ncritically important period. He is one of a very few individuals who \nhas experience in mining at all levels from a miner to management to \nState regulator.\n  Born and raised in West Virginia the son and grandson of underground \ncoal miners, Mr. Stickler has spent his entire 37-seven year career in \nthe mining industry. He began his career as an underground miner and \nworked his way up to foreman, assistant superintendent, superintendent \nand manager. The bulk of this experience was not behind a desk but was \nunderground, actually working in a mining environment. Because of this \npractical, day-to-day experience, he will be better able to understand \nand respond to the needs of today's underground coal miners and to \nprovide seasoned leadership at MSHA.\n  While working as a miner, Mr. Stickler also attended Fairmont State \nCollege and earned a degree in engineering. In addition to his \nengineering background, he is certified as a mine safety professional \nby the International Society of Mine Safety Professionals.\n  Mr. Stickler also served as captain of a mine rescue team. As we have \nall seen over the course of the last several months, mine rescue teams \nare a critically important component of mine safety. The heroic miners \nwho volunteer for this service endanger their own lives and donate \nsignificant amounts of time to ensure they are prepared to help their \nfellow miners. The MINER Act, which passed the Senate unanimously 2 \nweeks ago, mandates some changes to the mine rescue team system. \nNamely, we require mine rescue team members to have a higher level of \ntraining and experience and to be available more quickly when needed. I \nbelieve there could be no one better to implement these changes than a \nformer mine rescue team captain.\n  In 1997, Richard Stickler left employment in the private sector to \nbecome director of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Deep Mine Safety, where \nhe served for 6 years. He held that position at the time of the \nQuecreek mine accident in the summer of 2002. The accident drew \nnational attention as nine miners were trapped underground for several \ndays before being successfully rescued.\n  The Mine Safety and Health Administration is facing its most \nsignificant challenge in decades. It needs an experienced leader at its \nhelm to implement the MINER Act and to continue the vital task of \nensuring the safety and well-being of our Nation's miners. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the nomination of Richard Stickler and vote in \nfavor of his nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record additional \nmaterials regarding the nomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Arguments and the Facts About Richard Stickler\n\n       Argument: Stickler Opposed the MINER Act.\n       Fact: Mr. Stickler has NEVER stated that he opposes the \n     MINER Act. In fact he SUPPORTS the MINER Act and has stated \n     that he would expeditiously implement its provisions.\n       Fact: When he testified before the HELP Committee the bill \n     had not even been introduced yet. No Senator who made this \n     allegation this morning has ever asked Mr. Stickler if he \n     opposed the MINER Act. If they had bothered to do so, as I \n     have, they would have learned that he supports the bill, as \n     does President Bush who nominated him.\n       Argument: Stickler does not believe any changes to the Mine \n     Safety and Health Act are necessary.\n       Fact: In the committee testimony he is on record as \n     supporting an additional penalty provision for Flagrant \n     Violators of mine regulations with a new, higher monetary \n     penalty of up to $220,000. This is included in the MINER Act.\n       Fact: The record shows that he also stated support for \n     storing additional supplies of breathable air in mine exit \n     ways to assist miners in escaping in the event of a fire or \n     explosion. This change would also be required by the MINER \n     Act. It is a safety precaution that Mr. Stickler instituted \n     in the mines he managed many years ago, even though it was \n     not required by any law or regulation.\n       Fact: His record testimony also reveals unqualified support \n     for the use of any and all technology that would make miners \n     safer.\n       Fact: Mr. Stickler supports the changes made by the MINER \n     Act.\n       Argument: Stickler was a mining company executive.\n       Fact: Richard Stickler grew up in West Virginia as the son \n     and grandson of underground coal miners. He is only the third \n     presidential nominee to head MSHA to have worked as a rank \n     and file miner.\n       Fact: Richard Stickler worked his way through college to \n     become an engineer. He continued working his way up the \n     ladder to mine manager. He never worked at corporate \n     headquarters.\n       Fact: Richard Stickler left employment in the private \n     sector to become Director of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Deep \n     Mine Safety, where he served for six years. He has been \n     retired since 2003 and has no current ties to industry.\n       Argument: Mines managed by Stickler had injury rates double \n     the national average.\n       Fact: Richard Stickler was a hands-on manager committed to \n     safety. All of the mines he managed for Beth Energy \n     Corporation had lower injury rates when he left than when he \n     began managing the mine.\n       Fact: Data from both MSHA and the Pennsylvania Bureau of \n     Deep Mine Safety (PA BDMS) show that injury rates declined \n     steadily during Richard Stickler's tenure as Director of the \n     PA BDMS from 1997-2003. During the last 3 years of his \n     service (2001-2003), the injury rate for underground coal \n     mines was below the national average.\n       Argument: A grand jury determined that the PA BDMS should \n     have noticed problems with mine maps earlier.\n       Fact: The grand jury found no evidence of reckless conduct \n     and made no finding with regard to negligence by the PA BDMS. \n     The faulty mine map that was found to have caused the \n     accident at Quecreek carried the certification of a qualified \n     engineer as required. Likewise, the report of the Office of \n     Inspector General made no negative findings with respect to \n     PA BDMS or Richard Stickler.\n       Fact: Investigations into tragic mine accidents like \n     Quecreek always provide an opportunity for viewing an \n     accident with 20/20 hindsight. Improvements in mine map \n     records were a direct result of the Quecreek experience.\n       Argument: Stickler believes existing mine laws are \n     sufficient.\n       Fact: Richard Stickler testified that the Mine Act provided \n     sufficient tools for enforcement, but that tough enforcement \n     measures allowed under the Act should be used more often \n     against mine operators who only comply with standards when \n     MSHA inspectors are on site or against operators who appear \n     to view MSHA penalties as just a cost of doing business.\n       Fact: Richard Stickler also testified that he supported \n     increased minimum and maximum penalties, unwarrantable \n     failure orders, and would not hesitate to invoke ``pattern'' \n     provision for recalcitrant operators having repeat serious \n     violations.\n       Argument: Stickler does not have the expertise or vision to \n     head MSHA.\n       Fact: The President nominated a highly qualified candidate \n     for this important position. Richard Stickler has nearly 40 \n     years experience in mining. He worked underground. He was an \n     eye witness to the awful tragedy of the Farmington Mine \n     accident that gave rise to the 1969 mine safety laws. He \n     served as captain of a mine rescue team. He was a mine \n     superintendent and manager. He is a trained engineer. He \n     served as the chief enforcement officer for the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania.\n       Fact: Richard Stickler has a clear agenda for moving MSHA \n     forward.\n       (1) Learn the lessons from Sago, Aracoma, and Darby. Follow \n     through on the investigations and internal reviews.\n\n[[Page S5748]]\n\n       (2) Review the regulatory agenda. Determine whether items \n     previously dropped should be reinstated or if new items \n     should be added.\n       (3) Use all the tools in the Mine Safety and Health Act, \n     including warrantable failure orders and pattern of \n     violations orders where appropriate.\n       (4) Examine the penalty structure. Penalties must be \n     effective incentives for compliance.\n       (5) Analyze accident and violations data. Focus technology \n     development, training, and enforcement on areas of most \n     frequent accidents.\n       (6) Establish goals and performance measures.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement of Richard Stickler, Nominee for Assistant Secretary of Labor \n                       for Mine Safety and Health\n\n       I fully support the recently passed MINER Act and will do \n     my best to expeditiously implement it if I am confirmed to be \n     MSHA Administrator. I have never stated that I did not \n     support this legislation.\n       I would like to clarify what I stated during my \n     confirmation hearing. I testified that I support tough \n     enforcement and that I would make use of the enforcement \n     tools that already exist in the statute. I testified that I \n     believe penalties must be meaningful deterrents to violating \n     MSHA safety standards, and appreciate that the MINER Act \n     raises both minimum and maximum penalties.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of \nRichard Stickler to be the head of the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on cloture \non this nomination.\n  There is a safety crisis in our Nation's mines. In less than 6 \nmonths, 33 workers have been killed in our coal mines--11 more than \nlost their lives in all of last year. Since Richard Stickler was \nnominated to lead MSHA last September, 53 miners have been killed in \nmining accidents.\n  As a recent front page article in the Wall Street Journal said, there \nhas been ``an alarming upswing in coal-mining accidents, at a time when \nthe coal industry is in the midst of a boom.'' Coal profits are \nskyrocketing, but miners are paying the price with their lives.\n  This was brought home to me all too painfully when I traveled with \nother members of the HELP Committee to West Virginia this winter. We \nmet with the families of the 12 miners killed at Sago Mine, and we \npromised to fix this broken system.\n  As these grieving families can tell you, their government has let \ncoal miners down. And if we confirm Richard Stickler to head the Mine \nSafety and Health Administration, we will be letting them down again.\n  Our Nation's miners and their families deserve a strong and visionary \nleader to lead the Mine Safety and Health Administration during this \ntime of turmoil in the mine industry. As his record clearly \ndemonstrates, Mr. Stickler is not the man for this critical job. He has \nshown over and over again that safety is his last priority.\n  He spent the overwhelming part of his career as a coal industry \nexecutive, focused on profits and production, not on worker safety. In \nsome mines that he managed, injury rates actually went up--sometimes \nfar above the national average.\n  For example, when he was Senior Manager at the Eagle's Nest Mine in \nVan, WV, the injury rate was almost three times the national average. \nWhile he ran the Marianna Mine from 1983 to 1987, the injury rate \nclimbed dramatically during his tenure.\n  In the 8 years leading up to his appointment to lead the Pennsylvania \nBureau of Deep Mine Safety, mines he managed had a total of nearly \n3,000 safety violations. One hundred of the violations were so serious, \nthey resulted in MSHA closing part of the mine.\n  During Mr. Stickler's tenure as the head of the Pennsylvania Bureau \nof Deep Mine Safety, he continued to favor mining companies over miner \nsafety. He granted waivers and bent the rules for coal mining companies \nover and over again. He created huge loopholes in rules designed to \nprevent mine fires on conveyor belts and to guarantee that miners could \nreach safe places to protect themselves from runaway railcars.\n  Things got so bad in Pennsylvania during his tenure that one mine \ninspector called Stickler's special favors for the coal industry, ``a \ndetriment to safety . . . that would, without a doubt, make the coal \nindustry less safe for two-thirds of its workers.''\n  He was also in charge when the terrible accident at Quecreek \noccurred, trapping nine men underground in a flooded mine shaft for \nmore than 3 days. We all sent our prayers and support to the miners' \nfamilies as we watched the rescue operation hour by hour on television. \nAmerica was horrified that this could happen. A grand jury inquiring \ninto that accident confirmed our suspicions when it found that the \nsystem of regulating underground coal mines in Pennsylvania, which \nincluded Mr. Stickler's job of protecting miner safety, was \n``inadequate, antiquated, and in need of significant changes.''\n  That accident was a clarion call for the need to dramatically improve \nmine safety. The lessons of Quecreek mean that Mr. Stickler, more than \nanyone, should have known of the need to overhaul our mine safety, and \nparticularly emergency rescue laws.\n  In addition to the Quecreek experience, when Mr. Stickler testified \nbefore our committee earlier this year, the coal mine tragedies in West \nVirginia had just gripped the Nation. Sixteen men had already died in \nour Nation's coal mines in just 4 weeks. They had lost their lives \ndoing their jobs. Their families were left only with their memories. We \nowed it to those families to stand with them and demand immediate \naction to prevent more deaths.\n  Yet when we asked Mr. Stickler whether mine safety laws needed \nreform, he told us that he ``thinks the laws are generally adequate.''\n  Time and again, his response to the most pressing questions on mine \nsafety was that he needed to think about it. We asked him about how to \nspeed the adoption and encourage the development of new mine safety \ntechnology. We asked him whether he thought mine rescue teams should be \nreadily available, as required by current law. We asked him whether \nrescue chambers should be required in every coal mine. We asked him \nwhether he would ban the use of conveyor belts to ventilate mines. We \nasked him whether he would implement MSHA's rule decreasing diesel \nfumes in mines.\n\n  Did he agree with our call to action? Did he promise to take concrete \nsteps to save the lives of coal miners in danger? Not at all. Over and \nover again in the hearing, in the midst of the tragedy, he responded \nonly that he needed to ``study,'' ``analyze,'' ``review,'' or \n``reevaluate'' the situation.\n  This heartless performance showed how out of step he is with this \nCongress and with mining families in America. Congress has enacted \nsweeping mine safety legislation that is now on its way to the \nPresident's desk. Four States--including West Virginia, Illinois, \nPennsylvania, and Kentucky--have also passed or are considering strong \nnew mine safety laws. Yet the person the President wants to lead our \nmine safety agency is content with the status quo. It is no wonder that \nMr. Stickler's nomination is opposed by the United Mineworkers of \nAmerica, the Steelworkers and Petrochemical Atomic Workers, the \nBoilermakers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and \nthe AFL-CIO.\n  The Charleston West Virginia Gazette also opposes this nomination, \nand urges President Bush to ``find a qualified MSHA nominee to send \nbefore the U.S. Senate.''\n  Most importantly, Mr. Stickler's nomination is opposed by the people \nwho have the most to lose with a weak mine safety leader--the families \nof coal miners themselves. I have received letters from women in West \nVirginia, Kentucky, and Alabama, who lost their husbands and fathers in \nmining accidents this year--pleading with this Congress to oppose this \nnomination.\n  I think Peggy Ware from West Virginia summarizes their thoughts best: \n``I know it is too late for my father and the other miners that have \nlost their lives this year but we can make it safe for all our current \nminers. Our miners deserve better leadership than someone who will not \nbe aggressive and someone that doesn't appear to recognize there is a \nproblem with our mining industry. This has been one of the deadliest \nyears in mining history. So once again I ask you to please oppose Mr. \nStickler's nomination.'' I will ask that these letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Our Nation's miners and their families have had enough of the status \nquo. They deserve someone who is going to fundamentally change course \nin miner safety, not cover for the industry. They\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\ndeserve someone who will make the United States once again a leader in \nmine safety, instead of a place where miners have to rely on safety \nequipment that is 30 years old. They deserve more than more of the same \ncuts to mine safety enforcement, and withdrawal of safety regulations, \ninstead of pioneering new safety standards. Congress decided it is time \nfor a change by passing the MINER Act, the most significant improvement \nto mine safety law in a generation, and President Bush is expected to \nsign it into law this week. We saw unprecedented cooperation between \nindustry and labor, Republicans and Democrats on this legislation \nbecause the mandate for action was clear. We had to act to stop the \ntragic trend that started with the New Year and the disaster at Sago.\n  The act imposes broad new requirements to protect miners in the event \nof an emergency, and ensures that communications, oxygen, and rescue \nteams are in place to help miners survive.\n  This new law will usher in a new era in mine emergency response. MSHA \nwill be responsible for reviewing mines' emergency response plans. It \nwill issue regulations to raise the standard for seals on abandoned \nsections of mines to prevent the next Sago or Darby disaster, and it \nmust make critical decisions about the use of conveyor belts to \nventilate mines and refuge chambers.\n  These choices will determine the state of mine safety for another \ngeneration. They will determine whether coal miners will live or die \nthe next time there is an accident. How can we entrust these critical \nreforms in the MINER Act to an agency head like Richard Stickler who \nthinks they are unnecessary?\n  We owe it to the miners who have died this year and to those who go \ninto those same mines every day to demand a leader for MSHA who find \nsolutions, not someone who can't even recognize the problem.\n  For the sake of the miners and their families, I am voting no on \ncloture on this nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 11, 2006.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy and Senator Rockefeller: First, we \n     would like to express our gratitude to you for your steadfast \n     commitment to the Mine Act. We hope that passing the Mine Act \n     will aid in preventing future deaths of miners and save other \n     families from the grief that we have endured because of the \n     Sago Disaster. We would like to see additional requirements \n     set forth to protect the health and safety of our nation's \n     miners and we will continue to serve as advocates for miners.\n       We are profoundly disheartened by President Bush's \n     nomination of Richard Stickler for Assistant Secretary of \n     Labor for Mine Health and Safety. Mr. Stickler is a long-time \n     coal executive and because of his connections with the coal \n     industry, we are concerned that his primary objectives may be \n     solely on compliance and production, not on miners' health \n     and safety. Richard Stickler worked 30 years in numerous \n     management positions for the coal industry. He was a mining \n     company executive at a subsidiary of Massey Energy in West \n     Virginia, one of the nation's biggest coal companies. This is \n     not the type of person we want to head MSHA.\n       The Clinton administration was working on a rulemaking \n     proposal to require additional oxygen, a rule that could have \n     saved the lives of our Sago Miners and many other miners who \n     have perished due to an insufficient supply of oxygen in \n     America's underground coal mines. This proposal was dropped \n     after President George W. Bush took office. MSHA has also \n     admitted to knowing since at least 1998, that the previously \n     required one-hour air supply was inadequate to allow escape \n     by miners in more than a third of the nation's underground \n     coal mines.\n       At his nomination hearing, Mr. Stickler declined to endorse \n     new mine safety rules, such as those passed in January 2006 \n     by the West Virginia legislature. He failed to recognize the \n     inadequacies within MSHA and the coal industry. This lack of \n     awareness and concern on behalf of Richard Stickler is \n     appalling, especially following one of the deadliest seasons \n     of coal mining in recent history. He offered no insights \n     about what he would do if he were to become head of MSHA. It \n     is our opinion that Mr. Stickler displays no signs of \n     leadership or competence in the ability to head MSHA.\n       President Bush's nomination of Richard Stickler is \n     characteristic of his pattern in appointing coal industry \n     insiders to serve as senior executives to MSHA. Under this \n     administration, regulations have been mitigated in favor of \n     industry, fines have been reduced for mine safety violations, \n     and MSHA's requirements have not been updated to keep pace \n     with the advancement of mine safety technologies. We conclude \n     that the nomination of Richard Stickler would best be \n     described by a quote taken from UMWA President, Cecil \n     Roberts, ``just another fox guarding the henhouse''.\n       MSHA is an agency that was developed to protect miners' \n     health and safety and not to promote the interests of coal \n     companies. Our nation's miners deserve an agency staffed with \n     executives who would aggressively advocate miners' health and \n     safety. We oppose the nomination of Richard Stickler as \n     Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Health and Safety. We \n     assert that Mr. Stickler is not the right person for the job \n     and urge you to oppose his nomination. Please do not allow \n     the government to fail our nation's coal miners as it failed \n     our fallen miners at Sago.\n           Thank you,\n     Debbie Hamner,\n     Sara Bailey.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 11, 2006.\n       Dear Senator Byrd and Senator Rockefeller: I first would \n     like to thank you for all the leadership and efforts you have \n     put forth helping to get the Miner Act together and passed. I \n     admire you for being so concerned about our miners' safety. \n     These changes needed made due to the recent tragic deaths of \n     all our miners. I am the daughter of Fred G. Ware, Jr. He was \n     one of the miners killed at the Sago Accident. I have been \n     following closely to make sure changes are being made.\n       However, I am writing this letter to express my concern of \n     President Bush's nominee for Assistant Secretary of MSHA: \n     Richard Stickler. I know that he has background in mine \n     management. My concern is that he will yet be another one \n     worried about ``compliance'' but not aggressive enough to \n     enforce the Mine Act. During his nomination hearing, Mr. \n     Stickler didn't even seem to recognize that there are any \n     problems at MSHA or within the industry.\n       Mr. Stickler seems to have a lack of awareness of the \n     current conditions of the coal industry. This lack of \n     awareness bothers me due to the fact we have had so many \n     deadly mining accidents since January 2, 2006. My father was \n     taken away from me in one of these deadly accidents. Mr. \n     Stickler offered no insights about what he would do if he \n     were to become the head of MSHA. This is not the kind of \n     leader we need for MSHA. We need a leader that will assure \n     the health and safety of our miners by being aggressive and \n     enforcing the Mine Act.\n       Thirty years ago when the Mine Act was passed, Congress \n     said that miners' health and safety are supposed to be the \n     top priorities, and MSHA being responsible with pursuing that \n     mission. Mr. Stickler said nothing at his confirmation \n     hearing that suggests he would serve as an aggressive \n     advocate for miners' health and safety. Our miners deserve \n     nothing less. I believe that Mr. Stickler is not the right \n     person for the job and thus urge you to oppose his \n     nomination.\n       I urge you to do this for all the miners' health and \n     safety. I know it is too late for my father and the other \n     miners that have lost their lives this year but we can make \n     it safe for all our current miners. Our miners deserve better \n     leadership than someone who will not be aggressive and \n     someone that doesn't appear to recognize there is a problem \n     with our mining industry. This has been one of the deadliest \n     years in mining history. So, once again, I ask you to please \n     oppose Mr. Stickler's nomination.\n       May God bless you all and your families. God bless our \n     miners!!!!!!\n           Sincerely,\n     Peggy Ware Cohen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 10, 2006.\n       Dear Senators: As you probably remember, our husbands were \n     two of the 13 coal miners who were killed in the Jim Walters \n     Mine No. 5 on September 23, 2001. Since then we have spoken \n     out in favor of improving the health and safety of coal \n     miners. To that end, we thank you for your vote in favor of \n     the MINER Act. We hope it will prevent more needless deaths \n     in the coal mine industry and will save other coal mining \n     families from the grief we have suffered. Of course, there is \n     still a lot to do to further miners' safety and health; we \n     continue to serve as advocates for coal miners.\n       Today we write to you to voice our serious reservations \n     about President Bush's nominee for Assistant Secretary of \n     MSHA, Richard Stickler. Mr. Stickler has a background in mine \n     management. From all that he has indicated so far in \n     connection with the confirmation process, he will be much \n     more inclined to continue Mr. Lauriski's focus on \n     ``compliance'' at the expense of Mine Act enforcement. In \n     fact, when he had his hearing, which followed the terrible \n     tragedies in West Virginia in January 2006, Mr. Stickler \n     didn't even recognize that there's any problem at MSHA or \n     within the industry. He had no absolutely no new ideas about \n     what should be done to make MSHA any better. In short, he \n     showed no leadership at all.\n       When Congress passed the Mine Act, it stated unequivocally \n     that miners' health and safety are supposed to be the top \n     priorities. MSHA's job should be to protect miners. \n     Unfortunately, Mr. Stickler has said nothing to suggest he \n     would serve as an aggressive advocate for miners' health and \n     safety. However, miners deserve nothing less. We believe that \n     Mr. Stickler is not the right person for\n\n[[Page S5750]]\n\n     the job and thus urge you to oppose his nomination.\n           Thank you,\n     Freda Sorah,\n       Debord, KY.\n     Wanda Blevins,\n       Tuscaloosa, AL.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 10, 2006.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy and Senator Rockefeller: First, thank \n     you for your leadership and persistence in bringing the MINER \n     Act to reality. We hope it will prevent more needless deaths \n     in the coal mine industry and will save other coal mining \n     families from the grief we have suffered. Of course, there is \n     still a lot to do to further miners' safety and health. We \n     will continue to serve as advocates for miners, as we have \n     already traveled to speak on the subject.\n       Our most immediate concern today is President Bush's \n     nominee for Assistant Secretary of MSHA: Richard Stickler. \n     Mr. Stickler comes out of a background in mine management. At \n     first I thought this would be a good idea, but I fear he will \n     be yet another ``fox'' charged with minding the henhouse. He \n     will be more likely to pursue ``compliance'' rather than \n     aggressive enforcement of the Mine Act, though enforcement is \n     what's needed now more than ever. We need someone to stand up \n     for the mining community, not go along with what ever seems \n     to please the companies.\n       At his nomination hearing, Mr. Stickler failed to even \n     recognize that there's any problem at MSHA or within the \n     industry. How will he be able to fix and improve something he \n     thinks has no problems. This lack of awareness was startling \n     because his hearing was held on the heels of the deadliest \n     season of coal mining in recent history. He offered no \n     insights about what he would do if he were to become the head \n     of MSHA, and he showed no signs of leadership.\n       When it passed the Mine Act nearly 30 years ago, Congress \n     said that miners' health and safety are supposed to be the \n     top priorities, and MSHA is charged with pursuing that \n     mission. Mr. Stickler said nothing at his confirmation \n     hearing that suggests he would serve as an aggressive \n     advocate for miners' health and safety. However, miners \n     deserve nothing less.

The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4939) making emergency supplemental appropriations for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of June 8, 2006.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lautenberg are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida are printed in the Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, after a great deal of hard work by both \nbodies, I am pleased that the Senate now has under its consideration \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 4939, the fiscal year 2006 \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Overall, this bill which was requested by the President has two major \npoints of focus. First, it provides needed funding to replenish the \nspending accounts of the Department of Defense, the Department of \nState, and other agencies and departments of the Government engaged in \nthe global war on terror through the remainder of this fiscal year. \nSecond, this supplemental includes critical funding for continued \nefforts to address the damage caused by the hurricanes in the Gulf of \nMexico in 2005.\n  The bill was adopted by the Senate on May 4, and we began discussions \nwith our colleagues from the other body shortly thereafter. A \nbipartisan majority of the conferees reconciled the differences between \nthe two bills and reached agreement on the conference report on June 8. \nThe House approved the conference report this morning by a rollcall \nvote of 351 to 67.\n  The conference agreement provides a total of $94.519 billion. Of this \namount, over $70 billion is provided to carry out the global war on \nterror and to cover the expenses of ongoing operations and \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Title II of the conference agreement provides $19.338 billion for \nhurricane-related damage and recovery costs. Title III provides $500 \nmillion for agriculture disaster assistance to hurricane affected \nareas. Title IV includes $2.3 billion for influenza pandemic \npreparation and response activities. Title V provides $1.9 billion for \nvarious border security initiatives. Title VI includes $27.6 million \nfor the Architect of the Capitol to address health and safety concerns \nin the utility tunnels in the Capitol complex. Finally, title VII \nincludes general provisions and technical corrections.\n  This conference agreement is the result of hard work and true \ncompromise between the House and Senate. This bill provides critically \nneeded funding to our troops in the field and it helps continue the \nrecovery process on the gulf coast. The overall funding level meets the \namount requested by the administration, and I hope this agreement will \nreceive bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  All members have had the opportunity to review the conference \nagreement, and I am happy to respond to any questions Senators may have \nabout its contents. I do hope we will not indulge in needless delay and \nproceed with some dispatch in the consideration and approval of this \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes in morning business with respect to a tribute to Senator \nByrd and then make another statement with respect to the conference \nreport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reed are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as indicated previously, I would like to \nmake a short statement pertaining to the supplemental appropriations \nconference report before us.\n  It is interesting, my colleague from Florida spoke about the lessons \nof Hurricane Katrina. One of those lessons is we have to be prepared. \nIn Rhode Island, we worked with Chairman Cochran, Ranking Member Byrd, \nand also with Senator Harry Reid to incorporate within the supplemental \nappropriations bill an appropriation to help prepare our hurricane \nbarrier in Providence, RI. I thank the chairman, Senator Byrd, and \nSenator Reid for this effort.\n  Unfortunately, this provision did not survive the conference \ncommittee, and we are not able today to tell the people of Rhode Island \nthat we are giving\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\nthem much needed help to strengthen the Fox Point hurricane barrier.\n  The Fox Point hurricane barrier literally is the protection that will \npreserve Providence, RI, and the surrounding areas from a devastating \nhurricane. It protects the city. It protects all the key resources \nthere, such as the infrastructure. It is right at the head of \nNarragansett Bay. That is where Providence sits, and in a hurricane, if \nit roars up that bay, there is not much to stop it except this barrier.\n  It was built in the 1960s. It was at that time a modern, state-of-\nthe-art construction, but the years have intervened. It is no longer a \nstate-of-the-art construction. It needs work. It needs the electro-\nmechanical system control system replaced. It is one of the few major \nfacilities in the country that I think is still operated by its \noriginal electrical components. The barrier employs three 35-foot-high \ngates that are electronically operated. This is not only to keep the \nwater out, but to make sure they can still continue to pump water from \nthe rivers that back up the hurricane barrier.\n\n  Now, most people don't think Rhode Island is the prime target of \nhurricanes, but in 1938 and in 1954 we were dealt devastating blows. In \nfact, the damage from the hurricane in 1938 in those dollars was $125 \nmillion. Today it would be $1 billion. Hurricane Carol in 1954 flooded \nProvidence, leaving the city under 8 feet of water and destroying 4,000 \nhouses.\n  So we have a need to help the city upgrade these facilities to \nprovide the kind of improved equipment and improved performance that \nwill assure us that if a hurricane comes--and we all know that \neventually they will come to Rhode Island and to the rest of the \neastern seaboard--we will be prepared.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and others for their work to put the \nmoney in, and I am disappointed that the money was taken out. I hope \nthat in the future we can find another way in which we can protect the \npeople of Providence, RI, and the whole State of Rhode Island.\n  Mr. President, with that, I once again congratulate Senator Byrd, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Senator Byrd as \nwell. What a wonderful gentleman. What a gentle spirit, but what a firm \nvoice. We value your service and we appreciate what you can teach us \nand what you have taught us.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Cochran for the hard work that he has \ndone on this supplemental bill. He also has put up with a lot of grief \nfrom myself and others. The bill is important. I am going to spend a \nfew minutes on things I think the American people ought to be asking \nabout this bill.\n  The fact that we have the largest supplemental appropriations bill \never to come before this body to me is a great problem. It tells me \npart of the system is broken. The fact that the administration would \nrequest such a large emergency appropriation, and the fact that we \nwould pursue it and pass it tells us that the system of the true \nappropriations and authorizing process is broken.\n  We are in the fourth year--the third-and-a-half year--of a war, and a \nlarge portion of what is in this bill has been known in advance that we \nwere going to need it and it should go through the regular order. The \nfact that we take it outside of the budget caps, the fact that we take \nit outside of the regular order when we know we are going to spend $60 \nbillion to $70 billion at least in executing and prosecuting the war \nand put it in an emergency supplemental I think says a lot about our \nprocess that we need to take very seriously and try to change.\n  That is a criticism for the administration as well. A lot of the \nmoney in this is for the National Guard to refurbish and bring things \nup that we knew and in regular order we are going to be processing in \nthe Defense appropriations bill that is going to be coming before this \nbody in the next couple of months. So the excuse to say this is all \nemergency falls short, because it is not. It is not all emergency. We \nhave known all of this money is going to be spent, it should have come \nthrough the regular process, and we really don't have a good excuse to \ntell the American people why we are not doing that.\n  The second criticism I have of this bill is that the administration \nrequested no rescissions whatsoever. There is nothing in the Federal \nGovernment that we could trim to help pay for this emergency bill. That \nis the assumption of the request by the administration. I want to tell \nyou that is the wrong assumption. Employees who work for the Federal \nGovernment, the valuable employees, they know that is not true. People \noutside of Washington know that is not true. Constituents all across \nthis land know that if we had to find money and if we could drive \nthings to make them more efficient, we could do it. The fact that we \nare not doing it is another problem with our process. That is not a \ncriticism of individual Members of this body; it is a criticism of the \nprocess that we find ourselves in and that we are blinded in the forest \nby the trees.\n  We ought to be back to regular order, and if we truly have \nemergencies, we ought to look to say, How can we trim from somewhere \nelse to pay for it? Because, in effect, this $94.5 billion, my \ngrandchildren, your grandchildren, and the generation that follows are \ngoing to pay for. Nobody that is working today is going to pay for \nthis. We are transmitting the cost to our children and grandchildren. \nWe are saying that we can't make an effort, or the administration \ndoesn't request us to make an effort, or we don't make an effort to \nfind other areas that are less important, lower on the obligation level \nfor us, that we will just print the money and sign the notes and sell \nthem overseas and say, Children and grandchildren, you pay for this \nbecause we don't have the courage to do the hard work to pay for it. We \nought to take that criticism and say, Is that really what we want to be \nknown for? Do we want to be known for not making the hard choices that \nare necessary to fund this war and at the same time not take away \nopportunity from our children and grandchildren? That is not a personal \ncriticism, but that is a legitimate criticism that the American people \nought to be asking.\n  The third thing is there are things in this bill that are pure \npolitics in nature. Let me just describe one. I withdrew this amendment \non the floor, but I think the American people ought to understand what \nis going on. There is over $200 million in this bill for Osprey \naircraft, the V-22 that has never proven itself in combat. It has never \nmade the test in battle simulation that says it is a viable option. \nNeither the administration nor the Defense Department requested this \nmoney, and this money is going to be spent, it is in the bill, and this \nbill is going to pass and the President is going to sign this bill. But \nwe are going to spend money, a quarter of a billion dollars, on this \nprogram, not because it was requested by the Pentagon, not because it \nwas requested by the administration, but because it was requested by a \nbusiness to continue a program that hasn't proven itself yet.\n  There has to be some risk to those who don't perform when they are \nsupplying our military with the latest in terms of equipment and \nmaterials, and there is not any, if we continue to do it this way. I am \nnot an expert in the Defense appropriations process, but I have read \nwhat the Defense Subcommittee has said on this, and I have read what \nthe articles have said on this, and it doesn't meet the test. Yet, we \nare going to spend it.\n  The reason we are going to spend it is because there are enough \nMembers in this body that have employment with this company throughout \nthe country that the pressure to not fund it is greater than the \npressure to do what is right. I believe we ought to ask ourselves about \nthe criticism of that. That is not a way to run the future of this \ncountry, and it is certainly not a way to protect the heritage for our \nchildren in giving them the opportunity that we have all experienced in \nbeing in the freest and greatest country in the world.\n  The risk for our country is a risk that we will lose that heritage of \nsacrifice today to create opportunity tomorrow. I know I am like a \nbroken record to the appropriators, but my heart says that we should \ncreate at least the same opportunities in the future that we have all \nexperienced, and to do less than that denies the very heritage that was \ngiven to us.\n  So I haven't decided for sure whether I am going to vote for this \nbill. I know\n\n[[Page S5752]]\n\nit is important to take care of the critical needs in the hurricane \narea. I have had two hearings on that, part of my subcommittee, the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse associated with that. But I must emphasize, out \nof 37 hearings in the Federal Financial Management Oversight Committee, \nwe found over $200 billion--$200 billion--of waste, fraud, and abuse in \nthe last year and 2 months. Forty billion dollars of it in Medicaid in \nterms of false and inappropriate payments, $46 billion in Medicare, and \n$16 billion in Medicaid fraud in New York City alone. Yet we don't \nrespond to it. There is no action on it.\n  We had the Pentagon in 2005 pay $6 billion--$6 billion--in \nperformance payments to contractors who did not meet the performance \nrequirements of their contract. Yet we paid it anyway. But we haven't \nhad a prohibition on that.\n  I know on the Defense authorization as we get to that, Senator McCain \nis going to offer an amendment that I think is appropriate that we \nrequire that portion of the funding of the war that is legitimate to go \nthrough the appropriations process and regular order will be there. \nThere are certain portions of that which are unexpected and we will \ncontinue to have to do supplementals to do that. But I would remind my \ncolleagues that we are not going to be measured on what we do now; we \nare going to be measured on what is the opportunity for America 10 \nyears from now and 15 years from now.\n  We were sent here to make the hard choices, and they are not fun. But \nwe are not making the hard choices, because we are not looking at the \nprograms that aren't effective, that aren't accomplishing the goals and \neliminating them to pay for the things that we think are; we are just \nignoring them and paying as we go, except we are not paying as we go. \nWe are asking our children and grandchildren to pay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to thank the very able Senator who \nhas just spoken for his service to the Nation and to this body. I thank \nthe very able chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator \nThad Cochran, for all of his meticulous--meticulous--work on this bill.\n  The President asked the Congress to approve $92.2 billion of \nemergency spending and $2.3 billion to combat pandemic flu. When the \ncommittee opened its hearings on the supplemental on March 7, I stated \nmy belief that it is our duty--our duty--to scrutinize the President's \nrequest, not only for what is in it, but also for what is not in it.\n  The conference report that is before us includes $65.7 billion for \nthe Department of Defense to fund the wars--and there are two of them \ngoing on--two wars: the war in Iraq, to which I was opposed, and I feel \nI was right, and in Afghanistan, which I supported; I support that war, \nand I supported that war from the beginning in Afghanistan--an amount \nsaid to be sufficient to prosecute those wars and supply our troops.\n  Upon passage of this legislation, the total amount appropriated for \nthe war in Iraq, including the cost of reconstruction, will be $318 \nbillion--$318 billion. That is $318 for every minute that has passed--\nevery minute--$318 for every minute since Jesus Christ, praise the \nLord, was born. That is a lot of money. Mr. President, $318 for every \nminute that has passed since Jesus Christ was born 2,000 years ago. \nThat is a staggering figure. And what is even more unbelievable is that \nthe monthly cost of this war in Iraq, which I have opposed from the \nbeginning, has been steadily escalating from $5 billion per month in \n2004 to more than $8 billion per month now.\n  The American people--hey, those people who are out there in the \nprairies, in the Rocky Mountains, in the lands between Washington, DC, \nand the Rocky Mountains--they are all asking: How on Earth has the \nmonthly cost of the war in Iraq grown so much in just 2 years? The Bush \nadministration announced that major combat operations ended in May of \n2001. Remember that? The banner that we saw on the ship? Let me repeat. \nThe Bush administration announced that major combat operations ended in \nMay of 2003. But the costs of the war continue to spiral. How can that \nbe? Why? Why? This administration does not want to answer these \nquestions. Instead, the administration continues to request funds for \nthese wars--two wars, Afghanistan and Iraq. The administration \ncontinues to request funds for the wars through ad hoc emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bills.\n  Regrettably, the Congress continues to duck for cover. Since the \nPresident took us to war in Iraq in 2003, the Congress has approved \neight different emergency supplemental appropriations measures to fund \nthe wars--eight. None of those measures received the full scrutiny that \nis required of such massive expenditures. You know it. I know it. We \nknow it. Everybody should know it. The President refuses to include the \nfull costs of these wars in his regular budget request. Instead, he \nsends the Congress emergency requests with little or no detailed \njustification.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this President has \nrequested $515 billion of emergency spending--yes, you heard me, $515 \nbillion of emergency spending that does not appear in the budget. This \nconference report includes language that I authored, urging the \nPresident to put the full costs of the wars in his annual budget. This \nis the fifth time the Congress has approved such a provision.\n  My amendment was approved 94 to 0. It is time for the President to \nget the message. The administration's failure to budget for the wars \nmeans that neither the White House nor the Congress is making the tough \ndecisions about how to make the most of public funds to pay for the \nongoing wars.\n  Tales of waste abound. Our troops deserve better treatment, as do \nyou, the American people out there. I am pleased that the conference \nagreement includes $35.6 million for improved mine safety and health \nprograms. Since January of this year there have been 19 coal mining \ndeaths in the State of West Virginia, and another 14 mining deaths in \nthe States of Kentucky, Alabama, Maryland, and Utah. This conference \nreport will ensure that an adequate number of safety inspectors will be \nprovided for our Nation's mines and will expedite the introduction of \ncritical safety equipment into the mines. These are critical dollars \nwhich will begin to fill the gaps, the unacceptable gaps at the Federal \nMine Safety Agency. There are too few inspectors, there is too much \nout-of-date safety technology, there are too many unprepared rescue \nteams, and the litany of problems at the Federal Mine Safety Agency \ngoes on while the lives of our Nation's coal miners continue to be at \nrisk.\n  In the past 5 years at the Mine Safety Agency, safety has taken a \nback seat. At least 217 coal safety inspector jobs have been \neliminated--wiped out. The political leadership at MSHA puts protecting \nminers' lives on the back burner.\n  We have a moral obligation to make our coal mines safer. This funding \nwill jump-start the job of protecting our coal miners' lives and \nproviding some peace of mind to the coal miners' families.\n  I know how those families feel. I grew up in a coal miner's home. My \nwife's father was a coal miner. You are looking at somebody who speaks \nthe coal miner's language. I do. Coal mine safety should not take a \nback seat to coal production. Protecting the lives of our coal miners \nhas to be job No. 1 in the mines.\n  I cannot find the words to adequately express my heartfelt \nappreciation for the support of Chairman Thad Cochran of Mississippi \nand the other Senate conferees, particularly Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin, for their cooperation. With this funding and with the \nrecent approval of the mine safety authorization bill, Congress will \nhave given clear, unmistakable direction to the administration. The \nsafety of our coal mines and the brave miners who work in them must be \nparamount, uppermost. I will say that once more. The safety of our coal \nmines and the brave miners, men and women, who work in the coal mines \nmust be paramount.\n  With regard to funding required to recover from the gulf coast \nhurricanes, the chairman of our Senate Appropriations Committee took \nthe bull by the horns. Under Senator Thad Cochran's leadership, the \nSenate added $9.2 billion to the President's budget request to aid the \nvictims of the hurricanes. In addition, the Senate added funds to meet \npressing emergency needs for drought relief, port security, the \nsecurity of U.S. borders, and much needed\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\nmedical care for the Nation's veterans. Sadly, the President, our \nPresident, threw down the gauntlet and threatened--yes, threatened--to \nveto the bill. The White House insisted that $14 billion of what it \ncalled low-priority items be dropped from the bill. As a result, the \nRepublican leadership of the House and Senate sat down with White House \nstaff and agreed to drop from the bill emergency disaster drought \nrelief for our farmers, funding for critical veterans' medical \nservices, and funding for increased security at the U.S. ports. Over $9 \nbillion of critical funding for the victims of the hurricanes--over $9 \nbillion--has been eliminated, including housing assistance, education \nassistance, and transportation funds. Where are our priorities?\n  Instead, this administration has put its highest priority not on \ndisaster needs but on massive tax cuts to the tune of $254 billion for \n2006, tax cuts--yes, hear me, tax cuts at a time when the Nation is at \nwar and spending on that war is on the order of $8 billion per month. \nThat is like spending $8 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born--\n$8 for every 60 seconds since our Lord Jesus Christ was born.\n  The administration continues to have a huge credibility gap when it \ncomes to homeland security. There is a continuing drumbeat that another \nterrorist attack is likely.\n  Yet once again the administration is trying to secure the homeland on \nthe cheap.\n  The White House insisted that the conferees strip away $648 million \nfor port security and $600 million for the Coast Guard from the bill. \nTake it out. The administration's speechwriters and the \nadministration's policywriters seem to be living in different worlds.\n  How serious is the administration about port security when the \nadministration decides to allow Dubai Ports World to operate six major \nU.S. ports before the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of \nDefense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security were made aware of the \ndecision? Who is in charge? Who is in charge? What a fiasco.\n  How serious are we about port security when Customs inspects only 5 \npercent of the 11 million containers that come into the country each \nyear? How serious are we about port security when the Coast Guard \ninspects only one-third of foreign ports that trade with the United \nStates? Yet at the insistence of the White House--hear me now--at the \ninsistence of the White House $648 million for port security is \neliminated--gone, gone with the wind.\n  With regard to border security, the administration continues to be a \nday late and a dollar short. They opposed my efforts--this little boy \nfrom the hills of West Virginia--yes. The administration continues to \nbe a day late and a dollar short. They opposed my efforts last year to \nadd funds for border security. How about that--your security, border \nsecurity.\n  Fortunately, Chairman Gregg, the great Senator from New Hampshire--I \nlike him. No, he is not a Democrat. What difference does that make? I \nlike him.\n  Fortunately, Chairman Gregg and our House counterparts agreed--yes, \nthat old boy from the mountains--agreed with me, and we now have 1,500 \nmore Border Patrol agents. We now have 1,500 more Border Patrol agents \nand 581 more immigration investigators and agents, and 1,950 more \ndetention beds.\n  On May 18, 3 weeks after the Senate adopted the comprehensive Gregg-\nByrd border security amendment, the White House sent up its own border \nsecurity package. Rather than following our lead--Senator Gregg and \nSenator Byrd--the White House insisted on reducing the package for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security by $728 million--that isn't chicken \nfeed--and narrowing the focus to just the Southwest border.\n  While some may view border security through a microscope, Chairman \nJudd Gregg and I share the view that when the border is tightened in \none place, the threat will move elsewhere. We should anticipate that \ninevitable dynamic so that our border enforcement agencies will have \nthe tools to effectively do their jobs when they need those tools, not \n2 or 3 years from now. Yet the President requested no funds--no funds, \nnone--for the Coast Guard and no funds--none--for the northern border.\n  Just few days ago, 17 alleged terrorists were apprehended in Toronto, \nCanada. This ought to have served as a wake-up call to all of us that \nthe threat to this country is not only on our Southwest border but on \nall of our borders.\n  Regrettably, the President had his way in conference. While I \nappreciate that we have another $1.2 billion for border security, I \nworry that the funds are not based on a sound plan for border security.\n  In conference, Chairman Thad Cochran offered an amendment to \nestablish a limit on discretionary spending for fiscal year 2007. He \ndid so to expedite the consideration of the appropriations measure \nthrough the Senate in the absence of a final budget resolution. \nChairman Thad Cochran and I share the goal of debating in the Senate \nand sending to the President 12 individual, fiscally responsible \nappropriations bills.\n  I support setting clear, enforceable limits on the spending contained \nin the appropriations bills. The issue is: At what level should we cap \nspending? Chairman Thad Cochran presented to the conference a deeming \nresolution that would limit spending to $872.8 billion, the level \nproposed by the President.\n  Once again, the President's budget represents an irresponsible plan \nthat trades America's long-term future for short-term political gain. \nIf the Congress approves the President's request for Defense and \nHomeland Security, the President's budget will fall $14 billion short \nof what is needed for domestic programs, just to keep pace with \ninflation.\n  The President proposes the largest cut to education funding in the \n26-year history of the Education Department, $2.1 billion or a 4 \npercent reduction. This is a nonsensical squandering of the future of \nour children.\n  How are we going to compete in the global marketplace unless our \nyoung people have the tools they need?\n  Although we have thousands of veterans returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, the President wants to collect $795 million in new or \nincreased fees charged to whom? To our veterans to pay for whose health \ncare? Their health care. He also proposes $800 million of additional \nfees for the health care of military retirees. What a way to say thank \nyou to our dedicated troops.\n  The President proposes a level of funding for Amtrak that will force \nit into bankruptcy. The logic behind that decision totally escapes me. \nWith gas prices soaring, why would we want to eliminate a major \nprovider of public transportation?\n  At a time when we are facing record energy prices, our President is \nalso proposing a $1.4 billion cut in funds for Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance. What a farce.\n  Despite the fact that the White House continues to raise the specter \nof another terrorist attack, the President proposes to cut first \nresponder grants by 25 percent. The President proposes to cut fire \ngrants by 55 percent. These are just more examples of budgeting in a \ncloset.\n  This week the FBI announced that in 2005 this country had the largest \nincrease in violent crime in 15 years. And yet the President proposes \nto cut grants for State and local law enforcement by over $1.2 billion.\n  So may I say that while our President talks a good game on investing \nin alternative energy supplies, his budget includes only half of the \nfunds necessary to implement the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  To complicate matters even more, the President has proposed that the \nAppropriations Committees approve $7.4 billion of new user fees and \nchanges in mandatory law, most of which are not even under the \njurisdiction of the committees. For example, the President wants us to \napprove a $1.2 billion increase in the ticket tax charged airline \npassengers. At a time when the airlines are already facing financial \ndifficulties, this is folly, pure folly. If there is one lesson that we \nshould have learned from Hurricane Katrina, it is that there are \nconsequences to starving Federal agencies. FEMA, which performed \nmarvelously after the Northridge earthquake, the Midwest floods, and \nthe 9/11 attacks, FEMA was no longer up to the task when Hurricane \nKatrina hit.\n\n[[Page S5754]]\n\n  After 5 years of starving domestic agencies, I wonder which other \nagencies will be the next FEMA. Will it be the Coast Guard? Will it be \nthe Food and Drug Administration's ability to approve safe drugs or the \nability of the Food Safety and Inspection Service to protect food \nsupplies?\n  I offered an amendment in conference to modify the amendment offered \nby Chairman Cochran to increase discretionary spending for fiscal year \n2007. One of the amendments was adopted on a bipartisan vote of 15-13 \nto increase spending by $7 billion.\n  Sadly, the White House and the House majority leader objected to the \ninclusion of the deeming resolution as modified by my bipartisan \namendment. The conference report that is before the Senate, therefore, \nlimits total discretionary spending to the President's stingy--too \nstingy--$872.8 billion request.\n  At this funding level, the Senate will have little choice but to \nstarve Federal agencies of the resources they need to responsibly meet \nthe needs of the American people. That means relegating people's needs \nto the bottom of the barrel.\n  The White House got what it wanted in this conference report. Less \nmoney for the victims of the hurricane, less money for drought relief, \nless money for key border security programs, no money for port \nsecurity, and a ``cheap Charlie'' limit on other domestic spending.\n  The President has just made a surprise visit to Baghdad.\n  Let me say that again. Today, a little while ago, the President made \na surprise visit to Baghdad. That is all right. Supporting our troops \nis very important. However, I have to ask, when will the President be \nvisiting American ports to determine if they are safe?\n  When will the President visit American farms that have been \ndevastated by drought?\n  When will the President meet with our Governors, our mayors, our \npolice chiefs to understand why violent crime is on the rise?\n  When will the President visit our Nation's hospitals to learn why \nhealth care in this country is unaffordable?\n  When will the President visit our Nation's campuses to learn why the \ncost of a college education has grown 57 percent during his \nadministration, while the level of Pell grants has been frozen for 5 \nyears?\n  When will he start to look and listen to the voices of American \ncitizens who want a leader for their future here at home?\n  We now have appropriated $318 billion for the war in Iraq while \nAmerica's needs go begging. I wonder if the President will ever ask \nhimself about the consequences of that choice.\n  While I have serious reservations about what has been dropped from \nthe conference report, the conference report that is before the Senate \nprovides essential resources for our troops and help for hurricane \nrelief. Therefore, I will support the adoption of the conference \nreport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act which, as the venerable and esteemed \nSenator from West Virginia stated, provides critical funding for \nAmerica's troops, money for hurricane recovery, money for mine safety, \nwhile staying within the $94.5 billion funding level called for by the \nPresident.\n  I am going to support this package. I support our troops. I applaud \ntheir efforts. I am a strong proponent of fiscal responsibility, and I \nunderstand and recognize the tough choices that needed to be made in \norder to put this supplemental together. But with that said, a large \ncomponent of this package is disaster assistance. When it comes to \nhelping our fellow Americans through a crisis, we need to assist all \nwith equal zeal.\n  The fact is, while this bill offers some Americans a helping hand, it \ngives some others a cold shoulder. While this bill provides needed \nfunding for agricultural disaster assistance in the gulf to producers \naffected by the hurricanes, it will not send a dime to Minnesota's \nfarmers struggling to survive their own natural disaster.\n  The Senate bill contained that helping hand. Chairman Cochran fought \nfor--and has fought a number of times, by the way. And I thank the \nchairman for all the work he has done and all the work he has done on \nthe supplemental and I certainly thank him for his sensitivity to the \nneeds of Minnesota producers. I served with him when he was chairman of \nthe Agriculture Committee before he became chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. But this relief never made it through the \nconference. It is not in the final bill.\n  I find it incomprehensible, if not irresponsible, to provide weather-\nrelated disaster assistance for one region of the country while \nwithholding it from another. At its core, this is an issue about equity \nfor all regions that are suffering.\n  And to the thousands of Minnesotans whose very livelihood has been \njeopardized and those losing their farms due to last year's disastrous \nweather, this bill is nothing short of cruel. The absence of this piece \nin the bill is nothing short of cruel.\n  The images from Minnesota in 2005 speak volumes, surreal images of a \nmounting storm that almost defies description. Once unleashed, these \nominous clouds transformed into tornadoes and a devastating downpour. \nImagine looking out your living room window and seeing the shadow of \nthis storm, as shown in this picture, cast on a farm you have worked \nall your life to build--a farm you have seen through good times and \nbad, from performing chores before school as a kid to managing the cash \nflow of a modern farming operation as an adult. These clouds must have \nbrought great anxiety in their path.\n  But these families would not have to wait long to find out what this \nstorm would bring as they sought shelter from the tornadoes and from \nthe high winds as they found cover from the 15 inches of rain that fell \nin 1 single day.\n  When the sky cleared, this is the scene, as shown in this picture, \nvictims of the storm found. These are the fields, carefully cultivated \nevery year, that were the lifeblood of family farms. These fields, left \nin utter destruction, a source of great pride when covered by a healthy \ncrop, became a source of great concern to producers who understood all \ntoo well that no amount of hard work and careful planning would undue \nthe damage done to their fields.\n  For many farmers, their worst fears were confirmed. In the sugar \nsector alone, revenue was reduced by $60 million in Minnesota in 2005, \nthanks to this natural disaster. In one county, crop loss exceeded $52 \nmillion and farmers were prevented from planting over 90,000 acres, \nthanks to saturated fields.\n  Yet the real story cannot be told through statistics. I have met \nthese farmers, and I have listened to their personal trials endured as \na result of this catastrophic weather. I was up in Lake Bronson, MN, up \nin the northwest part of the State, Kittson County. I think the town \nhas about 180 people. I was there on some other matters. In a town of \nabout 180 people, farmers came from surrounding areas. One hundred \nfarmers showed up to talk about what they have been through, to ask for \nmy help in trying to protect this disaster assistance relief.\n  I looked at the faces of these men and women who are hard working--\nyou could just kind of see that strength in their hands and in their \nfaces--and I turned to one of my staff and said: This is why America \nwon Two World Wars. These are people who have been there for our \ncountry time and again. And they were hurting.\n  Farmers are losing their operations, pure and simple. Some of these \nproducers will not be coming back to the fields next year thanks to \nthis storm. They are not just losing a business, many are also losing a \nfamily tradition.\n  America is losing something here. Thousands of farmers are struggling \nto figure out how they will make their cash flow work this year. It is \neasy for us to talk about terrible crop loss numbers in black and white \nfigures on a page, but these numbers do not quite sum up the weight \nfelt by the farmer who is anxiously wringing his ball cap in his hands \nas he surveys a barren field and wonders how he will convince the bank \nto give him one more season.\n\n  It may shock many Americans to learn these images behind me are not\n\n[[Page S5755]]\n\nfrom the gulf but, instead, that they describe the natural disaster \nthat struck northern Minnesota in the spring of 2005. Even more \nshocking to Americans might be the fact that, of the millions of \ndollars in agriculture disaster aid in this emergency supplemental, \nnone will go to these Minnesota farmers.\n  I traveled to the gulf so see the hurricane damage firsthand in order \nto fully understand what my fellow Americans who live far from my \nMinnesota home are suffering, and I have supported their cause in \nCongress. I do not know that any of my colleagues from the gulf have \nventured to my part of the world to witness the dire situation going on \nin places like Kittson County--and, again, in size and scope what \nhappened in the gulf is almost incomprehensible--but I urge us not to \nforget what is happening in other parts of the country. For the farmers \nimpacted, this is their life, this is what they got. It is underwater. \nI invite my fellow Senators who are interested in meeting these farmers \nto come to Minnesota. And not just to Minnesota; I think this same \nscene would be replayed in North Dakota and South Dakota and probably \nreplayed in Missouri and other parts of the country.\n  It is true that the suffering in the gulf is great. I have seen the \ntremendous damage, and I am committed to helping. But the burden \nexperienced by the farmers I met in places such as Lake Bronson, MN, is \nalso great. Congress should come to the aid of all Americans who find \nthemselves victim of natural disaster and are left in financial peril \nand economic hardship too great for them to resolve on their own.\n  This is simply a matter of fairness. The agricultural disaster aid \npackage that was included in the Senate version of this emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill--of which I coauthored that piece--was \nfair. It provided assistance to farmers afflicted by natural disasters \nregardless of region or the type of natural disaster. This is a simple \nmatter of fairness.\n  What this conference report does is divide the Nation. If not \nexcluded for regional reasons, then I suppose we are left with the \nconclusion that hurricanes are the only true natural disasters that \ndeserve congressional attention. We all know that is false. And \ntaxpayers know better. They deserve better. The fact this conference \nreport does not provide one dollar for Minnesota's farmers is a true \ninjustice.\n  I will vote in favor of this emergency supplemental bill because it \nprovides critical funding for our troops. That is what it is about. I \nam going to be there for that. But I will come to the floor again and \nagain and again to raise the issue of disaster assistance for Minnesota \nfarmers and others in the region. And at every turn I will work to move \nthis funding. I will not let this inequity stand.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to talk \nabout the supplemental bill before us. And I thank the Senator from \nMinnesota for his remarks on agricultural disaster spending. I agree \nwith him how critical this is for his State, and for many others, \nincluding mine. And I was deeply disappointed that the administration \nopposed the Senate's agricultural assistance proposal that was in our \nbill.\n  Their letter to us said they opposed it on principle because the 2002 \nfarm bill was designed, when combined with crop insurance, to eliminate \nthe need for ad hoc disaster assistance. Unfortunately, that policy has \nreally harmed us in many of our States. I hope to work with the Senator \nfrom Minnesota and others to make sure we recognize these disasters \nthat occurred to our agricultural communities. And I, too, am deeply \ndisappointed it is not part of the supplemental.\n  Mr. President, I do want to speak for a few minutes this afternoon \nabout funding for the war in Iraq and hurricane recovery and other \nnational priorities.\n  I want to share with my colleagues that I have three real concerns \nwith the bill. First, really, is that it continues the charade we have \nhad that this war be funded off-budget. And, second, this bill leaves \nout critical funding for areas such as veterans health care, port \nsecurity, and emergency transportation assistance on the gulf coast.\n  Much of the progress we made on the Senate floor, through many hours \nof debate, was thrown out because of an arbitrary limit that was set by \nthe President that is really going to hurt a lot of our communities.\n  Finally, I want to talk about how this bill improperly included a \nbudget ceiling that is going to affect every single spending bill and \nmany of the decisions we need to make in the coming months. I believe \nthe supplemental is the wrong place to be enacting a budget that was \nnever passed by this entire Senate. I want to talk about each of these \nconcerns.\n  I will, like all of my colleagues, vote for this bill in the end \nbecause it is important that we provide the funding for our troops to \ncarry out their mission as we have asked them to do and because, of \ncourse, it supports the recovery efforts along the gulf coast.\n  My first concern is that the administration keeps trying to fund this \nwar outside of the regular budget process. Instead of including the \nmoney our troops need in the annual budget, they keep sending us \nsupplemental emergency requests. This may seem like a very small issue, \nbut it has two real large impacts. First, every dollar we spend through \nemergency funding adds a dollar to our national debt. With every \nsupplemental, we are burdening our children and grandchildren with more \ndebt. It used to be that emergency spending bills were for emergencies, \nthings we couldn't foresee such as natural disasters. The need for the \nfunding for the war in Iraq is not a surprise. It is not like \nresponding to an earthquake that no one could predict. We should not \nhand over to the President the final authority on what deserves \nemergency funding.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing concern about this \nbecause this administration's approach is going to burden future \ngenerations. I don't think we should hide the true cost of the war from \nthe American public, which we do through this supplemental process.\n  Communities at home today are sacrificing because of the cuts that \nthis administration and Congress have imposed on the annual budget. If \nthe administration had to fund the war in the annual budget, those cuts \nat home would be a lot more painful. By funding the war off-budget, \nRepublicans are hiding the true cost of the war and the real tradeoffs \nthat we have to make because of it. I hope the administration will be \nhonest with all of us about how much this war is costing and the \ninvestments that we are being denied at home because of the way this \nadministration has chosen to fund the war.\n  I believe the administration should not have the sole authority to \ndecide what is worthy of emergency funding and what is not because we \ndo have emergencies in our backyard as well as overseas.\n  My second concern with this bill is that it leaves out many of the \ncritical investments we fought to add right here on the Senate floor to \nthe supplemental. Here in the Senate we worked very well on a \nbipartisan basis to make sure the bill funds priorities such as \nveterans health care. I commend Senator Cochran for his work in trying \nto get this bill through the Senate and working with all of us to make \nsure our needs were addressed. But, unfortunately, the President set an \narbitrary limit for the size of this bill and said he wouldn't sign a \nbill that cost a penny more. What happened? The leadership rolled over, \nagreed to the President's limit, and now that is going to hurt our \ncommunities at home.\n  One of the groups of people it is going to hurt the most is America's \nveterans. In April, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the Murray-Akaka \namendment to ensure that our veterans get the help they need. Our \namendment had broad bipartisan support. We worked with Chairman \nHutchison and others to make this funding emergency spending. But what \nhappened? That amendment was removed from this bill. That is a huge \nsetback for the men and women coming home from the war today and \nentering a VA system that is now overwhelmed and underfunded. This \nfunding would have allowed us to provide soldiers returning from Iraq \nand Afghanistan with timely access to the health care they earned.\n  We know today that the VA is facing funding challenges. In March, the \nVA\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\nthemselves told us that they are seeing 38 percent more Iraqi war \nveterans than they budgeted for. In fiscal year 2006, the VA expected \nto provide medical care to 110,000. That number is now rumored to be \nnearly 170,000. In fact, the VA has treated 74,000 Iraq war veterans in \nthe first quarter of this fiscal year alone. We are hearing that \nveterans have to wait over a year to get the specialty care they \ndeserve. Some are waiting over 18 months to get their benefits. We have \nlong waiting lists with thousands of names on them at our major VA \nhospitals. Recently, a VA official actually told us that long waiting \nlists make care for mental health and substance abuse virtually \ninaccessible.\n  I am frustrated that the funding we worked to get on the floor of the \nSenate for our veterans is no longer in the bill that is in front of \nus. I believe our veterans deserve better, and I hope that we address \nthis issue again in the near future.\n  I also want to take some time to mention other investments that were \nremoved from this bill to meet the President's arbitrary limit. I am \nthe ranking member of the Transportation-Treasury subcommittee. I can \ntell my colleagues that some very important funding initiatives were \nleft on the cutting room floor, initiatives that were sorely needed to \nhelp the residents of the gulf and to help that region's economy \nrecover. Let me give an example.\n  The Senate-passed bill included $200 million in emergency assistance \nfor transit authorities in the gulf region. In prior supplemental \nappropriations bills, we have included $2.75 billion for the Federal \nAid Highway Emergency Relief Program, but there is no such companion \nprogram for transit agencies. So right now the principal transit agency \nin the city of New Orleans is operating on funding through a mission \nassignment from FEMA. But FEMA has made it clear that this funding \nsupport is going to expire at the end of this month. Without any \nadditional Federal help, the very limited amount of bus service that is \nnow being provided is going to be severely curtailed. In fact, I am \ntold that as a result of the $200 million being eliminated during the \nconference deliberations on this bill, the New Orleans transit \nauthority is likely to be required to lay off between 300 and 450 \nemployees. They are going to have to cut back their extremely limited \nservice even more.\n  Prior to Katrina, New Orleans had about 62 separate bus routes. By \nnext month, they may have to cut that back to 17. New Orleans is \ndesperate to generate the economic activity that is going to allow this \ncity to again stand on its own two feet. They need workers, including \nworkers who depend on mass transit, to fill all kinds of jobs. Cutting \noff those transit routes is not going to help that city recover, and \nthrowing bus drivers on an unemployment line is not going to help that \ncity recover.\n\n  In Baton Rouge, city leaders are desperate for transit assistance to \nhelp them serve the thousands of Louisiana residents now relocated to \nthat city. You can't just add bus service and commuter rail services \nand expect to cover that cost through the fare box. They have to be \nsubsidized, just like transit services across the country. The city of \nBaton Rouge never budgeted for these subsidy costs. That city is \nstruggling to provide city services all across the board. They just \ncan't tax all of these new residents. In fact, some of them were left \nwith just the clothes on their backs. I am deeply disappointed that \nthis Congress acquiesced when President Bush chose to ignore all of \nthose needs and draw a line in the sand saying he would veto any bill \nthat exceeded his request.\n  Because of that demand, the conference was also required to eliminate \nfunding items for the gulf that the President himself requested. Here \nis why. The President set a limit, and if we wanted to fund anything \nnew that went beyond that limit, the money would have to come out of \nthe investment he requested. And one of those requested items that got \neliminated in this conference was a $202 million request for HUD for \ntenant-based rental assistance. That funding was intended to serve some \n44,000 families, including families who had received HUD support prior \nto Katrina, and homeless families. The bill that passed the Senate \nexpanded the purpose of this money to include the reconstruction and \nrepair of HUD projects in the afflicted region and to provide vouchers \nfor about 4,500 needy citizens in the region, especially the disabled \nand homeless.\n  That provision received widespread support from numerous national \norganizations, such as AARP, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, \nAmerican Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, and \nVolunteers of America. But all that support didn't matter when it came \nto cutting billions of dollars out of the supplemental. The end result, \nthe conference report now before the Senate eliminated every penny that \nthe President requested and the Senate included for that activity.\n  My final concern with this bill is, as I said before, it includes a \nbudget ceiling that is far different from the one that was passed in \nthe Senate. That budget ceiling is going to tie our hands when we work \nto try to help our communities. This undermines the work we do on the \nBudget Committee to meet America's needs. I know this was done once \nbefore, but I am still very concerned about the precedent we are \nsetting. About 12 weeks ago, the Senate adopted a budget resolution by \nthe narrowest of margins, 51 to 49. That budget included more funding \nthan the President's request. That is because from the floor we did our \njobs as Senators. We offered a number of amendments. Some were \naccepted; some were not. Some were added during the floor on \nconsideration of the resolution.\n  Here on the floor we adopted amendments to boost funding for \nAlzheimer's research, for cancer research, for low-income energy \nassistance, for homeland security, for mine safety, for land and water \nconservation, and we added funding to help recruit a larger Army to \nease the burden on all of those who are now serving. Only after those \namendments were adopted was the budget resolution found to be \nacceptable by the bearest majority in the Senate.\n  Since that time, the conference committee has made no progress in \nreaching a final budget resolution for this year. It is this complete \nbreakdown of the budget process that has now brought us to this point.\n  As Members of the Senate are aware, the budget resolution claims to \ndo many things. But the most significant thing it does is impose a \nspending ceiling on the Appropriations Committee. Now that the Congress \nhas failed to adopt a conference report on the budget, the decision was \nmade to include a provision in this supplemental conference report we \nare now considering that imposes a new spending ceiling on the \nappropriations process. Never mind that there is no such provision in \neither the House or the Senate bill.\n  This emergency supplemental conference report now before us includes \none small but extraordinarily meaningful paragraph that masks the fact \nthat this Republican Congress has failed to enact a budget for the U.S. \nGovernment. Worse still, the ceiling that is included in this emergency \nsupplemental bill is not the same one that was agreed to by the Senate \nwhen they barely passed a budget resolution 51 to 49. Instead, the \nceiling that is included in this conference report is $9 billion lower \nthan the level the Senate adopted, and $7 billion lower than the \nceiling for fiscal year 2008. The ceiling that is included in this bill \ndeliberately ignores the amendments that were adopted by this Senate \nback in March. So we are basically being presented with a spending \nceiling that would wipe out the amendments that were adopted on the \nSenate floor and bring our ceiling right back down to the level \nrecommended in the President's budget. The Senate already was presented \nwith that ceiling in the resolution that was reported by the Budget \nCommittee. But the Senate amended that proposal many times to add about \n$16 billion in spending to it, and only then did they find 51 votes to \npass it.\n  I am sorry the spending ceiling is now included in this bill. I don't \nthink it belongs in an emergency supplemental bill for the war or for \nthe needs of the people who live on the gulf coast.\n  I do want to acknowledge that Chairman Cochran notified us that he \nwould seek to add the deeming resolution to the supplemental. The \nbottom line is that a new appropriations ceiling does not belong in \nthis emergency supplemental. The Democratic Senators on\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\nthe Appropriations Committees want to enthusiastically support the \nappropriations bills that our committee is going to produce over the \nnext several weeks and months. We want those bills to pass on a broad \nbipartisan basis. We want those bills to address the critical funding \nneeds of the functions of our Government, whether it is health research \nor education or infrastructure investment or agriculture or the needs \nof our troops.\n  In reality, it is going to be hard enough to produce appropriations \nbills that are going to get broad bipartisan support at the levels we \nadopted back in March. It is going to be almost impossible to do so if \nwe ignore the amendments adopted on the Senate floor and impose a \nspending ceiling that was not proposed by the President.\n  So I am very troubled by this bill. It used to do a much better job \nof meeting our priorities at home. But the President set a limit and \nthe Republican Congress went along, and I think that is going to hurt \nthe families that we represent.\n  I will vote for the emergency supplemental because our troops need \nthe resources to do their jobs and the gulf coast needs our help. But I \nam really deeply disappointed at the missed opportunities that are \nrepresented in this bill. We can do better, and I hope we stop the \npolitical games and start determining the right direction. Frankly, our \ntroops and our country and our future depend on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire be recognized immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Courthouse Shooting In Reno\n\n  Mr. REID. In Reno, NV, yesterday, a friend of mine, Chuck Weller, was \nshot in the chest. He is a family court judge. We have in Nevada \ndistrict court judges that do everything but domestic relations and \nchild custody and that kind of thing, which the family court judges \nlike Judge Weller do. He was working at his desk and somebody shot him \nin the chest through a window. His condition has been recently changed \nfrom critical to serious. We think he is going to be OK.\n  This is a real tragedy for our system of justice. They have not \napprehended the man who shot him. They believe they know who did it. We \ndon't know if the man has killed anyone else, but it is a real tragedy.\n  Judge Weller is a person who does his very best to be fair and \nreasonable to those people who appear before him. When you deal with \nchild custody matters, support matters, they are very personal, and a \njudge has a difficult time because there are intense feelings involved \nin divorce and child custody.\n  I am really concerned about his wife, Rosa Maria, and their two \ndaughters. They face difficult days ahead. Everyone in Nevada is \ngrateful for Judge Weller's public service, and we stand with the \nfamily during these difficult days.\n  I think of the men and women in law enforcement in Nevada and around \nthis country; they are the finest that we have. They are the ultimate \nfirst responders. I am confident that they will bring Judge Weller's \nattempted assassin to justice and in the process restore peace to the \nReno community. People are concerned. This happened 24 hours ago or \nmore. The man has still not been apprehended.\n  Judge Weller moved to Nevada in the early 1980s. He graduated from \nGeorgetown School of Law in Washington, DC. He was elected to the Reno \nfamily court a couple years ago. During his election, he said he wanted \nto be a judge because ``you can help a lot of people.'' He was right. \nJudges do help a lot of people. They make decisions that are very \nimportant, but they help us all by administering justice across the \ncountry.\n  We were reminded yesterday that sometimes judges need our help, \nparticularly when it comes to protecting them from violence. It is an \nunfortunate fact that violence against judges, such as we saw in Reno \nyesterday, is not unique. It happens far too much.\n  Federal judges receive an average of 700 inappropriate communications \nor threats every year. State court judges, because there are so many \nmore, receive thousands. There is no room in our country for violence, \nbut certainly not in our courthouses. That is where Judge Weller was, \nin the courthouse. These are some of the most heinous crimes we \nexperience, I believe.\n  But for the bravery of the men and women who serve on the bench in \nour courthouses, this violence undermines our entire system of justice. \nWe can and must do everything we can to prevent these tragedies.\n  Judges like Chuck Weller, clerks, jurors, and others who are serving \ntheir country at courthouses and upholding the law must be free to do \nso without threats to their lives.\n  One of my valued employees, Darrel Thompson--a fine person--was \ncalled to jury duty in Washington, DC. He apologized and said, ``I am \nsorry I cannot be at work today.'' I said, ``Darrel, this is your \nobligation. I wish I could serve on a jury.''\n  Mr. President, I have tried cases before more than a hundred juries. \nI told Darrel this is his civic duty. I feel that way so strongly that \nthe system of justice must be administered without intemperance, \nwithout threats of violence.\n  In Reno, the city and county are in the process of determining what \nactions they can take to prevent incidents like this from occurring at \nthe courthouse. One of the things they are going to try is to put a \nfilm on the window so you cannot see as well. One of the people said, \n``I don't think we can afford bulletproof windows.'' That is up to \nlocal government. Certainly, we at the Federal level should do whatever \nwe can to assist in the administration of justice all over the country.\n  I have contacted the county commissioner in Washoe County to extend \nmy support in doing whatever we can do from here to prevent such \ntragedies. If we can give Federal assistance all around the country, \nthen we should do that. Certainly, we cannot have things like this \ntaking place.\n  A good place to start would be passing the court security bill, S. \n1968. This was introduced last year by Senators Specter and Leahy, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I intend to \noffer--unless they do it--the text of that bill as an amendment to the \nnext amendable bill on the Senate floor.\n  S. 1968 was introduced following a wave of violence against judges \nand their families in our country. A State court judge in Atlanta was \nkilled by a criminal defendant. We also know that family members of a \nFederal judge in Chicago were killed by a deranged litigant. In the \nlast 25 years, three Federal judges have been killed. Now Judge Weller, \na State judge, has fallen victim. We are hopeful and confident that he \nwill pull through.\n  The Specter-Leahy bill would improve protections for both Federal and \nState judges. For State courts like the Reno Family Court, the bill \nwould authorize Federal grants to improve security. These Federal \ngrants might be used to strengthen courthouse infrastructure, such as \nadding bulletproof windows, or it might be used to hire additional \nsecurity personnel in the courthouse.\n  There are times when the Federal Government must step forward. One \nexample, which is so important, is when the Federal Government stepped \nin to give rural police officers the money to buy bulletproof vests. \nLittle counties in Nevada and other places simply could not afford \nthem. They need bullet proof vests for protection. So there are things \nwe can do to help in the administration of justice and police officers \ngenerally.\n  The Federal Government already plays a role in educating State court \njudges. I have played a role in helping to fund the National Judicial \nCollege and keep it funded. It is based in Reno. Judges, I am sure, \nfrom New Hampshire, Tennessee, North Dakota, judges from all over the \ncountry, have been to the State judicial college in Reno. It is a \nwonderful facility for training judges. It is now entirely appropriate \nfor the Federal Government to bolster its support for protecting State \ncourt judges from physical harm.\n  The States will take the lead in protecting their own State court \nofficers, but the Federal Government can and should help develop best \npractices and replicate successful security models around the country. \nCongress should take immediate steps to try to prevent\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\na recurrence of the Reno tragedy from occurring in other places.\n  I want to extend my thoughts and prayers once again to the Weller \nfamily that all will be well with Chuck. It is a difficult time for \nthem and the entire Reno community. I ask everybody here to keep the \nWellers in their thoughts, because this could be a judge in your State. \nBut, in fact, it is in Nevada, and we are going to do everything we can \nto protect the administration of justice in our country. I appreciate \nvery much the senior Senator from New Hampshire allowing me to speak \nbefore him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I speak \nSenator Dorgan be recognized, and then that Senator Vitter be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak a little about the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, which is now pending. I want to begin \nby congratulating the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, for the \nextraordinary job he did in producing this bill. When it left the \nSenate, it was around $105 billion. It comes back to us from conference \nat $94.2 billion or $94.3 billion--I forget the exact number. It was \nnot easy to bring it down from the Senate position to what was \nacceptable to the President and to the House. It was really a result of \nSenator Cochran simply saying that we are going to make these difficult \ndecisions and we are going to have a bill that meets the conditions the \nPresident laid down for our spending responsibility. He deserves a \ngreat deal of congratulations and respect for having accomplished that.\n  Within the bill, he has included also an issue which I am interested \nin as chairman of the Budget Committee. It is what is called a \n``deeming resolution.'' It sets the amount of money that can be spent \non the discretionary side of the budget. That is those accounts that we \nappropriate, on which we spend every year, and which are automatic \nexpenditures for things like education and some of the health care \naccounts and national defense are some of the big ones, as is homeland \nsecurity.\n  This deeming resolution has set a number of $873 billion, which I \nthink is a very responsible number, which the President sent up in his \nbudget, and the number the House had in their budget. It wasn't the \nnumber that left the Senate when we passed our budget. One of the \nSenators who spoke before me from the other side was upset that the \nnumber that passed the Senate was not included in the deeming \nresolution, which is a fairly ironic position for anybody to take since \nthey voted against the budget as it left the Senate.\n  In any event, the deeming resolution as it is in this budget is the \nnumber that was agreed to between the Republican leadership of the \nSenate and the House, and it was the number that the President felt was \nappropriate. It will be a difficult number to obtain, there is no \nquestion. It represents significant fiscal restraint. It is a clear \nmarker that we are going to try to restrain the rate of growth of the \ndiscretionary side of the budget, which is critical to putting in place \nfiscal responsibility.\n  I think it is important for people to know that, yes, we presently \nhave a very large deficit. But this deficit is coming down rather \nprecipitously from where it was projected to be 6 months ago. It was \nprojected that we would have a deficit of well over $400 billion. We \nare projecting this year that it will be in the $300 billion range. \nThat is a very positive move in the right direction. Part of that move \nis a function of the fact that we have started to control the rate of \ngrowth of the Federal Government, independent of our needs relative to \nfighting the war on terrorism and Katrina, which are events that we \nneed to simply spend money on because of the catastrophe of Katrina and \nbecause of the need to have our troops in the field and have what they \nneed to be adequately supported.\n  Another reason the budget deficit has come down so much in the last \nfew months is because our revenues are coming in as a result of the \nPresident putting into place, and the Republican Congress supporting \nthe effort, economic policies which energized the economy \ndramatically--putting in place a tax policy that is fair to \nentrepreneurs and risk-takers in this country. We have seen people who \nare willing to go out and take risk, taking action that creates taxable \nevents. Specifically, they have created new companies, created new \neconomic activity and new jobs.\n  As a result of those things, revenues are jumping dramatically. We \nhave seen the largest revenue increase in the last 40 years, I believe, \nin this last year; and the year before that, we saw a historic revenue \nincrease. The Federal Government is back to essentially where they \nwere, in a historical context, over the last 20 years as a percent of \ngross national product. Those revenues had dropped precipitously over \nthe last 3 years because of the breaking or bursting of the Internet \nbubble and the attack of 9/11, which caused a recession.\n  So we are seeing the economy come back. We are seeing 5.3 percent \ngrowth, which is extraordinary. We are seeing a job situation where we \nhave virtually full employment. According to the economists, when you \nget down to an unemployment level below 5 percent, you are basically \ntalking about full employment. We have seen this as a result of this \nexpansion of the economy that has now been going on for 39 straight \nmonths, or something like that. We have seen a huge jump in revenues, \nand the effective result of that is that the deficit is coming down \nalso. In fact, if you were to take out the cost of fighting the war \nagainst terrorism and the cost of paying for the Katrina tragedy, we \nwould essentially be functioning on what would be statistically \nconsidered to be almost a balanced budget.\n  We would be at a historic low relative to the deficit as a percentage \nof the gross national product over the last 20 years. So we are moving \nin the right direction. By putting in place this deeming resolution \n873, we are asserting we are going to be aggressive to try to control \nthe rate of growth on the discretionary side. That is all positive and \ngood, and it largely comes about because we have very strong leadership \non the Appropriations Committee through Chairman Cochran and his \ncommitment to fiscal discipline.\n  Another issue I wish to talk about and put the issue in the correct \ncontext so people understand what is actually happening is the issue of \nborder security because there has been a lot of confusion as to how \nmuch money we are spending on border security, where we are spending \nit, and what it is being spent on.\n  I have the good fortune of chairing the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. As chairman of that \nsubcommittee, I suggested we put in the supplemental as an emergency \nitem--not as an emergency item, we paid for it--$1.9 billion, the \npurpose of which would be to pay for capital items which were in dire \nneed by Customs, the Border Patrol, and the Coast Guard. These are \nitems such as airplanes--Customs is flying 20 or so P-3s, and they were \nall grounded a month ago because they are 40 years over their useful \nlife and they have serious structural issues that have to be checked \nall the time or they have the potential of serious structural issues--\nnew helicopters because the helicopters are 20 years past their useful \nlife; new cars to be used on the border because the Border Patrol goes \nthrough cars rather rapidly because of the harshness of the terrain in \nwhich they have to use them; sensors; and unmanned vehicles. With the \nCoast Guard, it is fast boats to be used to make sure our shorelines \nare protected from people coming across who shouldn't be coming across \nand maybe want to do us harm.\n  These are all capital items. The reason I suggested we do capital \nitems is because I didn't want to create an outyear cost which we \ncouldn't afford to pay for under the present budget system, but I did \nwant to take off the table items I knew we were going to spend money on \nif we were going to have an effective Border Patrol, to have an \neffective Customs agency, and to have an effective Coast Guard.\n  The White House looked at that number and said they really didn't \nwant to do that. Instead, they shifted over and said: Let's do \noperational items, and they decided to take, of that $1.9 billion, \nabout $800 million and spend it putting the National Guard on the \nborder, and the balance of the money they\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\nbasically used to project the hiring of new people and the addition of \nbeds for detention, both of which I support, but both of which create \ncertain issues, and that is what I want to talk about briefly--the \nissues created by the supplemental and what will occur in the followup \nappropriations bills of Homeland Security so everybody knows the \nplaying field that is being defined.\n  The practical effect of this supplemental is, yes, there will be \nmoney in place to hire an additional 1,000 agents. We already had money \nin the pipeline to hire an additional 1,500 agents this year. It takes \nabout 40,000 applications before you can get 1,000 agents. It is not \neasy to hire them. Then you have to train them, and you have to have a \nphysical facility to train them, which we have in New Mexico. But that \nfacility doesn't have the capacity to train 2,500 agents a year; maybe \n2,000 but not 2,500. It is unlikely we can hire an additional 1,000 \nagents before the end of this fiscal year--maybe 300 or 400, maybe even \n500. But I will agree that by putting the money in now, we accelerate \nwhat we planned to do next year, which is to hire another 2,000 agents. \nSo we are accelerating that event, if that is the goal.\n  Secondly, the proposal basically prefunds bedspace which should be \nfunded and creates an outyear cost as a result of that and does a \nseries of other operational things and actually some capital items with \nwhich I totally agree, such as technology investment and unmanned \nvehicle investment.\n  But the practical effect of doing it this way is we create what is \nknown as a budget tail or an expense in the outyear which we are going \nto have to pick up, and that is the point I wanted to make today in as \nfactual a way as I can because it is a very big issue we are going to \nhave to deal with as a Congress, and that is this: The President sent \nup a budget proposal for next year, 2007, which was essentially $32 \nbillion, rounded up. That request had an assumption of 1,500 new \nagents, 1,500 new agents we put in this year would be paid for, and \nthen an additional assumption of another 1,500 agents, I believe, on \ntop of that for next year.\n  It also had in it a request that part of the money, the $32 billion, \nbe paid for by raising the airline fee which people pay as a tax when \nthey get on an airplane basically to fund the increase in the border \nsecurity activity, primarily with the Border Patrol agent expansion, of \n$1.2 billion. That proposal of $1.2 billion had been sent up 2 years \nago, and it was rejected out of hand. Why? Because the chairman of the \nauthorizing committee, in what I think is a fairly legitimate view of \nthe issue, said: You shouldn't be raising the tax of people getting on \nairplanes for the purpose of protecting the borders. The airplane tax \nshould go to TSA and FAA and things which are used to make air \ntransportation safer, but it shouldn't tax the airline transportation \nindustry, specifically the passengers, to fund border activity.\n\n  When it was sent up again this year, it was basically dead on \narrival, which the administration knew it would be. It wasn't a \nsurprise because they had gone through this before. Actually, what they \nsent up was a request for about $32 billion in spending but funding for \nabout $30.8 billion in spending, which means there was a $1.2 billion \ngap. That will be difficult to fill in, in and of itself, were that the \nonly problem. But in order to fill that, basically Senator Cochran, as \nchairman of the full committee, is going to have to take it from some \nother committee to give it to my Homeland Security Subcommittee to pick \nup that $1.2 billion, if he is generous to do that or believes it is \nthe right policy. He will have to take it from somebody else. I assure \nyou, whomever he takes it from is not going to be all that appreciative \nof having lost $1.2 billion.\n  That would be a major hurdle to begin with. Now throw on top of that \n$1.2 billion shortfall the fact that in this bill, they have forward-\nfunded 1,000 agents plus a lot of other operational expenses, and they \nhave not funded the Coast Guard costs of what is called their fast boat \nor the expansion of their coastal protection efforts. They have taken \nthe $600 million we intended to use to do that and spent it on the \nNational Guard. And we have created approximately--the number \nfluctuates on what one deems to be capital and doesn't deem to be \ncapital. My guess is we are somewhere in the range of $1.4 billion in \noperational expenditures which are now put in the pipeline which are \nnot funded for the year 2007.\n  In addition, the administration tells us--and I would agree with this \nif we could do it--in the 2008 budget, they are going to ask for 3,500 \nnew agents so that we can ramp up as quickly as possible to the \nultimate goal, which is 20,000 agents. It is possible by the 2008 \nperiod that we will have the training facilities at a position where we \ncan hire 3,500 agents. It is also possible that we could get 100,000 \napplications or 120,000 applications or so, whatever it would take to \nget 3,500 people. So that is a possibility. But the implications of \nthat are significant in the form of cost.\n  What does this put at risk? All these costs have been put in the \npipeline in a manner which is basically upfronting operational costs \nbut not taking off the table capital needs. The practical implications \nof the $1.2 billion, if it is not found by Senator Cochran--and I am \nnot asking him to. I think if the administration is going to take this \nposition, if they are going to make their bed, they ought to be asked \nto sleep in it.\n  If Senator Cochran cannot find that $1.2 billion, the practical \neffect is we could not maintain the funding for the 1,000 agents that \nhave just been put in the supplemental. We also could not add the new \n1,500 agents we would need in order to fund what we expected to do in \nthe 2007 bill. We would have to reduce technology and science and \nsensor technology by about $100 million. We would have to limit \ninfrastructure construction, especially fence construction, by about \n$100 million. We would have to reduce detention expansion capability by \nabout 6,700 beds.\n  We would have to reduce fugitive operations, where we try to find \nthese people and get them out of the country, by about $60 million. We \nwould be unable to forward-fund the effort to get the IDENT and the \nEFIS systems to communicate with each other for the purpose of a U.S. \nvisit, which is absolutely critical. That is where you come across the \nborder, and they fingerprint you. They take two fingerprints of you. By \ntaking 2 fingerprints of you, they can't communicate with the FBI \ndatabase which has all the criminals in it because that database \nrequires 10 fingerprints. So essentially we are limiting our capacity \nto figure out who is coming across the border as it relates to the FBI \ndatabase. There is a protocol where they try to get the worst people \nand make it work, but the fact is, we have tens of thousands of \nfingerprints that are not able to be adequately vetted. That would have \nto be put off. The need to come up with a card with biotics attached to \nit so we could have a tamperproof identification system would probably \nhave to be put off because we couldn't pay for that. That is a big one.\n  These items would have to be put off, plus the Coast Guard--and this \nreally frustrates me--the Coast Guard, in order to build out the fleet \nthey need--and they are functioning under old boats, a lot of old \nboats, and they have helicopters which are not properly structured, \nmany of them, most of them, the vast majority of them are not armed--\nbuild out program to get things right and get positioned correctly to \nprotect our coastline, instead of being completed in 2015, which was \nour goal under our supplemental request, will end up being completed in \n2023 or 2024 and cost more money to do it because of the spread out.\n  So we are facing a lot of very serious issues as to what we will be \nable to fund and how much we will be able to fund under the present \ngame plan or blueprint as it is set out for this year and next year as \na result of this supplemental.\n  I thought it was important to come down to the Chamber and try to lay \nout the specifics because at some point, we are going to have to face \nup to the reality that there is a disconnect between what is being \nproposed and what is being paid for. This is not going to work.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Budget Committee, I regularly \ncomment on Appropriations bills that are brought to the Senate for \nconsideration and present the fiscal comparisons and budgetary data. \nBecause of its importance, I will also follow that practice for the \npending conference report.\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\n  The conference report to accompany the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2006, H.R. 4939, provides $94.430 \nbillion in budget authority and $24.327 billion in outlays in fiscal \nyear 2006 for contingency operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the \nglobal war on terrorism; relief from Hurricane Katrina; other emergency \nassistance; border security; and avian flu. Of these totals, there are \nno mandatory funds included. $143 million in outlays in the conference \nreport are not designated emergency; these outlays will count against \nthe discretionary allocation for regular appropriations for fiscal year \n2006.\n  The budget authority in the conference report is within the level of \nthe President's request of February 16, 2006, when adjusted for avian \nflu. It is also $14.468 billion less than the Senate-passed bill, which \nclearly demonstrates significant progress in conference with respect to \nconforming the measure to the initial request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee's estimate of the bill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n H.R. 4939, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the \n           Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006\n\n                     [Fiscal year 2006, $ millions]\n\nPresident's request: \\1\\\n  Budget authority...............................................92,221\n  Outlays........................................................23,626\n\n        Conference report:                              General purpose\nTotal spending:\n  Budget authority...............................................94,430\n  Outlays........................................................24,327\n  Emergency:\n    Budget authority.............................................94,541\n    Outlays......................................................24,184\n  Non-emergency:\n    Budget authority...............................................-111\n    Outlays.........................................................143\n\nRemaining 302(a) allocation prior to enactment of supplemental:\n  Budget authority................................................9,279\n  Outlays.........................................................4,365\n\n     \\1\\ The President's 2007 budget request included $2.3 billion \n     for avian flu; for comparison purposes the President's \n     supplemental request adjusted for avian flu totals $94.521 \n     billion in budget authority.\n     Note.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals \n     adjusted for consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the issues that have just been discussed \nby my colleague, and others as well, about fiscal discipline are very \nimportant issues. I would make the point that I don't think one can \nfind fiscal discipline around here with a high-powered telescope. There \nis no fiscal discipline around here, unfortunately. In fact, the very \nbill we are debating at this point is appropriating something over $90 \nbillion, none of it paid for--none of it.\n  Emergency funding for defense, emergency funding for Hurricane \nKatrina. We have done emergency funding for defense previously. We have \ndone it again, we have done it again, we have done it again. We are now \nover the hundreds of billions of dollars, all in emergency funding, and \nwe are pretending somehow we have some discipline. It is imperative for \nthis Congress to begin thinking about what this means for our kids and \ngrandkids.\n  The conference report before us is a conference report that falls \nshort on this very specific area about which I am concerned. Let me \nmention another area first.\n  One of the things this bill does is fund a great deal of money for \nthe Defense Department for money that has been consumed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan in prosecuting the war. It replenishes military accounts, \nand we are going to do that, we understand that. We have a \nresponsibility. We cannot send American troops abroad and decide we are \nnot going to fund that which they need to do their jobs. We understand \nthat. It would be smarter if we paid for it all, by the way. It would \nmake a great deal of sense if we decided to pay for this rather than \ncharge it to the kids and grandkids. But here we are, once again.\n\n  One amendment that was stuck in the bill when it left the Senate was \nvery simple. It was the determination of the Senate that we were not \ngoing to have permanent military bases in the country of Iraq, that we \nwere not going to have permanent military basing in Iraq. The Senate \nagreed with that. My expectation is that we are in Iraq because we want \nto provide freedom for the Iraqi people, we want to deal with the \ninsurgency, and at some point bring our troops home.\n  Saddam Hussein was found in a rat hole. He is now on trial. Perhaps \nhe will be executed. The Iraqi people are rid of Saddam Hussein, who \ncommitted mayhem and murder on a grand scale. There are unbelievable \nnumbers of skeletons of people who were murdered by Saddam Hussein who \nturned up in mass graves. So we are there. And we want the American \ntroops to finish their mission and to be able to come home.\n  But the Senate had previously decided on this bill that we wanted not \nto have long-term military basing in Iraq. One of the reasons for that \ndecision I think is the administration asked originally for $1.1 \nbillion to build a U.S. embassy in Iraq, which would be the largest \nembassy in the world: 1,200 employees and $1.1 billion. So I regret \nthat the provision dealing with a decision that we were not going to \nhave a permanent military presence, military basing in Iraq was taken \nout in conference. That was a bipartisan decision by the Senate to put \nit in, and I regret it was taken out. Nonetheless, it was.\n  Let me describe just for a moment my concern about another \nsignificant part of this bill. I am happy to be supportive of the \nefforts to help the people in the gulf region who were devastated by \nthe worst natural disaster to ever hit this country. When Hurricane \nKatrina hit, people were displaced and people were killed, and it was \ndevastating to be there, and devastating to watch, for that matter. I \nthink this Congress very quickly said to those people in the gulf \nregion, You are not alone and we want to help you. I come willingly and \nin an interested way to be a part of the people who say we want to help \nyou.\n  But this piece of legislation that is now before us with respect to \nfamily farming--and that is what I want to talk about specifically--\nsays something very unusual and very unfair. It says those farmers in \nthe Gulf of Mexico who lost their crops due to a hurricane called \nKatrina are going to get some help. They are going to get some disaster \nrelief. All the other farmers across this country who lost their crops: \nSorry, you are out of luck.\n  The U.S. Senate included a provision that I authored in the \nAppropriations Committee that provided $3.9 billion in disaster \nassistance for all farmers in this country who lost their crops due to \na disaster. Let me just describe what happened around this country last \nyear.\n  Last year around this country we had a whole series of things happen. \nWe had serious drought, the third worst year for drought purposes in \nIllinois since 1895. We had the third driest year in well over a \ncentury. In Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, Arkansas: The worst drought since \nthe 1980s. Oklahoma wildfires destroyed--burned--one out of every 100 \nacres. In North Dakota, this is an example of what the fields looked \nlike. We had 1 million acres that could never be planted. It was never \nplanted. One million acres was planted and washed away. We had farmers \nwho had just dramatic amounts of rainfall. We had one farmer who \nreceived one-third of all of the yearly rainfall in one day; just \nwashed everything away. This farmer lost everything.\n  Once again the U.S. Senate said: We are going to provide disaster \nhelp to farmers who lost their crops. It doesn't matter where they are. \nIn the Gulf of Mexico? Yes. To a hurricane? Yes. But then when we got \nto conference, the President prevailed. The President said, I will veto \nthis bill if it has disaster relief in it, and the Speaker of the House \nand the folks who march to that tune in the conference said: No, you \ncan't have disaster relief; we will only allow disaster relief for gulf \nfarmers who lost their crops.\n  So that is the way it came out of the conference. The folks who were \nburned out, the folks who dried out, the folks who were flooded, those \nfarmers were left behind, once again. And it starts at the doorstep of \nthe White House.\n  It was this President who came to North Dakota some long while ago \nand said to farmers: When you need me, I will be there. I will be there \nfor you. Well, we needed him. He is the one who said, I will veto the \nlegislation if you provide disaster relief for farmers. So\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\nhe was successful. They stripped the Senate provision out of the bill. \nWhen it came out of the Senate, it was a bipartisan provision. It was \nsupported by the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. It \nwas supported by the Senate conferees upon a motion of mine, once \nagain, in the conference. I sat downstairs in this building at 1 \no'clock in the morning. We fought for five hours to try to put this in \nconference, to keep the Senate provision in conference, and we lost.\n  Someone once said that common sense is genius dressed in work \nclothes. The question of common sense here is this: Why should we have \na circumstance that we are going to legislate now with this conference \nreport that says if you are a farmer in one part of the country and \nlost everything, you get a little help. If you are a farmer in the rest \nof the country, Sorry, Charlie, it is over; no help for you.\n  Rodney Nelson, who is a cowboy poet in North Dakota, wrote an op-ed \npiece once in the North Dakota papers, and he asked a question about \nfarming. There aren't many people here who are farmers. We come wearing \nsuits. We have nice, shined shoes. We do our work in white shirts. \nNobody here is in farming. But the people out there living on the land, \nraising livestock, planting a seed, hoping they will grow a crop, \nhoping they will be able to harvest and go to the grain elevator, and \nperhaps make some money, and be able to carry over for spring planting \nthe next year, those are America's heroes. Those family farmers \nstruggle.\n  Rodney Nelson asked this question: What is it worth to a country to \nhave a kid that knows how to plant a crop? What is it worth to a \ncountry to have a kid that knows how to fix machinery, how to hang a \ndoor, how to weld a seam, how to grease a combine, how to butcher a \nhog? What is it worth to a country to have a kid know how to feed a \nnewborn calf out of a pail? What is it worth to a country to have kids \nthat know all of these things? What is it worth to a country to have a \nkid know how to go out and work in bitter cold winters or hot summer \nsun? What is that worth to a country?\n  The only university that teaches all of those things is American \nfamily farming. It is out under the yard light on the family farm \nsomeplace. That is where they teach these courses. Carpentry, welding, \nmechanics, and horticulture, all of these things you learn on the \nfamily farms--agriculture, livestock.\n\n  Once again, the farmers who have had these fields and ended up having \nno crop, some of whom are now out of business, they will lose those \nfarms because they can't go a year without income. The bank doesn't \nsay, We are sorry about that. I will tell you what. We won't need our \nmoney from you. You just don't need to pay us.\n  Some of these farmers will have been gone by now. But we were trying \nto say to them, You are not alone. We know you got hit really hard with \ntorrential rain in North Dakota and drought in Missouri and Illinois. \nThat is what the Senate was saying. The Republicans and Democrats here \nsaid that. And then we got to conference and the President and the \nHouse conferees led by the Speaker said: No way; we don't intend to do \nthat.\n  We are not asking for the moon. This was just a little bit spilling \nfrom the barrel. We have talked about all of this money, billions and \ntens of billions and now hundreds of billions of dollars, all of which \nhave gone through an Appropriations Committee, none of which has been \npaid for to deal with wars and all of these issues. I understand why we \nhave to do this. What I don't understand is why we are not willing to \ndo what we should do as a Nation to farmers last year who got hit with \nnatural disasters and who lost everything.\n  I don't come to the floor to say that the people in the gulf \nshouldn't be helped. Of course they should. I don't come to the floor \nto say farmers who lost their crops in the gulf shouldn't be helped. Of \ncourse they should. I am the first to support them. But I do come to \nthe floor of the Senate to say it is fundamentally unfair to decide \nthere are a couple of classes of farmers who lost everything, and the \nfirst is a class that lost it to a natural event, a weather event that \nhas a named called a hurricane.\n  My colleague, Senator Durbin, suggested maybe our problem was that--\nsince we had a weather event in June of last year that provided one-\nthird annual rainfall in 24 hours and washed every seed out of the \nground--maybe our problem was we didn't name it. They name hurricanes. \nThey didn't name that torrential rain. Maybe if they had named it, then \nwe would have a circumstance where the President and others would say, \nLet's treat everybody the same. If you got hurt, if you lost \neverything, we are here to help. That should have been the refrain from \nthis Congress and should have been the refrain from the White House. \nRegrettably, it wasn't.\n  So, after working for months, after beginning in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee on a bipartisan basis, with the chairman of \nthe committee and others, Senator Burns from Montana and many others, \nafter doing that, after coming from the floor of the Senate and \ndefending it, getting it through the Senate and going to conference, we \ngot stiffed. When I say ``we,'' I am talking about people who lost \neverything out there that fully expected this Congress to do the right \nthing.\n  Regrettably, this conference report, while it does the right thing in \nsome areas, in my judgment shortchanges a lot of farm families who had \nhigh hopes that this Congress would do the right thing for them.\n  So we will live to fight another day for fairness, but this \nconference report with respect to the way it treats family farmers who \nsuffered disasters last year certainly cannot be linked under the \ncategory of fairness, in my judgment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of this \nsupplemental appropriations bill. There are many, many very important \nreasons to support it, and certainly one is because of the essential \nsupport it gives all of our Armed Forces around the world, particularly \nwith regard to the crucial fight in Iraq. That is an essential reason \nto support it. Certainly the important money it puts toward border \nsecurity, and we must do so much more with regard to border security.\n  I stand first and foremost and primarily with a focus on the crucial \nchallenge of hurricane recovery all along the gulf coast, including in \nmy home State of Louisiana. I strongly and proudly support this bill \nbecause it is an enormous help, an enormous commitment at the Federal \nlevel of keeping true to President Bush's Jackson Square pledge to make \nsure we have a full and robust recovery on the gulf coast.\n  This hurricane experience has been surreal for so many, literally \nmillions who lived through it, including me. And it hasn't just been \nHurricane Katrina which, of course, devastated southeast Louisiana as \nwell as Mississippi and parts of Alabama. It has been Hurricane Rita, \ntoo, which damaged, devastated south Acadiana and southwest Louisiana \njust a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina.\n  It has been quite an experience in terms of introducing me to my work \nin the Senate. I will never forget so many of the experiences I lived \nthrough and saw firsthand, obviously Hurricane Katrina hitting on \nAugust 29 and seeing the aftermath of that, the unbelievable \ndevastation, particularly because of the levee breaches in the New \nOrleans area. After living there on the ground, working on those issues \nday in and day out, I finally returned to the Senate on September 13 \nand stood here on the floor and tried to communicate exactly what I \nsaw, but it was difficult because, again, so many of those images were \njust so surreal, so outside the realm of anything I had experienced \nbefore.\n  Then, just a few weeks later, September 24, it was almost \nunbelievable, but it happened. We were socked by a second devastating \nHurricane Rita that went into the Texas-Louisiana border area, but \nreally affected the entire Louisiana coast because it came in at an \nangle from the southeast to the northwest, in that direction, pushing \nflood waters all up and down, east and west of the Louisiana coast, but \nof course particularly devastating southwest Louisiana and south \nAcadiana.\n  I remember in that entire period thinking many times, and I will be\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\nhappy to admit this, none too proudly, that this was heavy, heavy \nlifting in terms of my new job in the U.S. Senate. I remember on more \nthan one occasion e-mailing my wife Wendy that this just seemed so \ntough a haul in terms of what we needed to do, including through \nFederal legislation, particularly as it was hitting when understandable \nconcerns about spending at the Federal level were at an all-time high. \nI noted in several of those e-mails that it just seemed like a very, \nvery tough haul.\n  After months and months of work and joining with so many others in \nthe gulf coast and outside the gulf coast and all around the country, I \nam so delighted that we are really getting that job done in terms of \nthis Federal support. What seemed like such an uphill battle so many \nmonths ago is finally coming together, in terms of very aggressive, \nvery robust Federal help.\n\n  Let me make clear, that is not primarily because of my effort. That \nis not primarily because of the effort of the rest of the Louisiana \ndelegation--which has been completely united and which has worked very \nhard, yes--but that is primarily because of the leadership of others \nand their efforts. So I primarily come to the floor today to say thank \nyou to those leaders.\n  Of course, we have to start with President Bush, the President of the \nUnited States. On September 15 he stood in Jackson Square and addressed \nthe Nation. I was there personally. I will never forget that moment. It \nwas surreal, in some ways, because the entirety of the French Quarter \nwas dark, uninhabited, but there we were in Jackson Square and the \nPresident was speaking to the Nation, making a firm commitment that New \nOrleans and Louisiana and the gulf coast wouldn't just come back but \nwould be rebuilt smarter, better, stronger than ever.\n  This legislation keeps that pledge. It makes good on that promise, \nand it only is happening because of the President's strong leadership \nin this regard. So in all my thanks--and we have many people to thank--\nI want to start first and foremost with President Bush. He stated it \nunequivocally, boldly, strongly on September 15 in Jackson Square, and \nhe has made good on that pledge and that promise. This legislation \nhelps do exactly that.\n  I also want to specifically thank all my fellow Senators, \nparticularly leaders in this regard such as Senator Cochran, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee. In the months following the \ntragedies of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, some of the most \nimportant work I participated in was getting fellow Senators, fellow \nMembers of Congress, down to the devastated regions, allowing them to \nsee the scope of the devastation firsthand. So many came and so many \nresponded in terms of really getting it, really understanding exactly \nthe unprecedented scope of this devastation. So I thank all my \ncolleagues who did that, all my colleagues who joined together in this \nenormously important boost for the gulf coast and for Louisiana.\n  Again, there are very many folks who worked hard on it, but none \nharder than the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nCochran, himself, of course, from a devastated State. So I deeply and \nsincerely thank all those fellow Members of the Senate.\n  What is it that we have accomplished? It really is a lot from the \nFederal level: passing the funding, the support, the help we need on \nthe gulf coast for our full recovery. I am proud and happy to say in \nall of this the Senate has led the way through the leadership of \nSenator Cochran and others, in terms of passing the levels of support \nwe need. The Senate led the way, the Senate bill led the way in the \nconference committee.\n  Several categories are enormously important. First, in this bill $4.2 \nbillion for Louisiana of community development block grant funding. \nThat is enormously important. It will complete a $12 billion package \nfor Louisiana primarily dedicated to homeowners, many of whom lost \neverything, and to housing needs. That is crucial in terms of \nrevitalizing and rebuilding our community for the better.\n  Another absolutely crucial issue as a threshold concept is rebuilding \nthe levees far better than before to give everyone in the region peace \nof mind that we will have adequate protection in the future. Again, in \nthis bill, $3.7 billion will go to the Corps of Engineers for their \nongoing emergency levee repairs and reconstruction. Just as important \nis crucial authorization language that is necessary to allow them to \nget that work done immediately. Again, a crucial threshold issue. \nNothing will happen in terms of a robust recovery in the New Orleans \narea without knowing that we will have the levees we need to give \nindividuals, families, businesses real security in the future.\n  Other important categories--$500 million for agricultural relief, \nfocused on the gulf coast region where the devastation from Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita happened. Again, I acknowledge Chairman Cochran, who \nkept that package in the bill--slimmed down, yes, but vitally important \nnonetheless--and preserved it in the conference committee negotiations. \nThat was enormously important.\n  Similarly, fisheries, $118 million for fisheries that were decimated \nall along the gulf coast, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi, is \nanother crucial component in the bill.\n  This is so important and is vital particularly when coupled with our \nearlier legislation, a big bill in December where we passed billions in \nDecember also in CDBG funds, in levee money, in health care--Medicare \nand Medicaid--in education, passing money that followed the evacuee \nchild wherever that child went so we can pay for those extraordinary \nneeds, and in higher education, in extraordinary help for local \ngovernment where the tax base was decimated for the foreseeable future, \njurisdictions such as Saint Bernard's, the sheriff's office, local \ngovernment, the city of New Orleans, and others.\n  Also, crucial legislation in December on the tax side of the \nequation--GO Zone legislation--to provide powerful incentives for \nbusinesses, families, and individuals to come back and rebuild and \nbring the jobs with them to revitalize our economy because that is at \nthe core of our recovery as well.\n  I say thank you to the President of the United States, to all of my \nSenate colleagues, to all who worked on this crucially important \nlegislation. I say it with every piece of sincerity and heartfeltness \nin my body because this has just been a matter of survival, of life and \ndeath for all of us in Louisiana.\n  The most important way I can say thank you is in continuing to work \nwith folks on the ground in Louisiana to assure all of you, to assure \nthe President of the United States, to assure the American people, that \nthis money gets spent right on the ground; that it is not just thrown \nat a problem but actually helps fund positive change and reform on the \nground in Louisiana because that is exactly the leadership we need to \nmove in the direction we need to take.\n  As we turn our attention to how that money is spent on the ground, I \nassure you I will be an active participant in that work, an active \nplayer in that debate. I will continue to use all of my leadership \nskills, everything I can muster, to make sure, again, that this \nenormous Federal support that everyone here--the President and others--\nhas made possible goes to fund positive change and reform on the ground \nin Louisiana. We certainly need it in a whole host of categories: \npolitical reform, levee board reform, health care restructuring, \neducational improvement through charter schools, and the like, and on \nand on.\n  That is my pledge to my colleagues. That is, perhaps, the best way I \ncan continue to say thank you for this vitally important help that will \nmean New Orleans, LA, including southwest Louisiana, decimated so hard \nby Rita, the entire gulf coast comes back--but also comes back better, \nstronger than ever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to try to bring \na sense of urgency to the Senate about getting this conference report \nfinally approved. The House has approved it. The conference report has \nbeen duly approved by a majority of the Appropriations Committee. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Thad \nCochran, is here now. I, as chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, want \nto point out that this supplemental was received by the Senate on \nFebruary 17, and it is now June 13.\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\n  The Army has notified us of the need, and we have approved \nreprogramming of $1.4 billion to carry the Army through June. The \ndifficulty is that we are now informed, despite the circumstances of \nthe reprogramming, the Army, at the end of June, will have only $300 \nmillion left in its O account. The O account is the money to pay \nbills for any of the departments, and I think as we look at this, \nMembers of the Senate should realize all over the country there are \nactions being taken now to the detriment of many of our bases, our \nports, and various installations even here at home, here in the United \nStates.\n  But the main thing is that the Chief of Staff of the Army, GEN Peter \nSchoomaker, has asked Chairman Cochran, on May 17, to do his best to \naccelerate the approval of this bill because almost half of the money \nthat is in this supplemental appropriations bill is for the Army. I \ndon't think there are many Senators who realize that every time there \nis a reprogramming it involves a real change in the overall structure \nof the Army. They must take money from various accounts and reprogram \nit into the operation and maintenance account in order to meet current \nbills--not only current bills here at home but in the war zone.\n\n  Very clearly, the impact of this is being felt, as I said, all over \nthe country. For instance, I received notice from Fort Greely, in \nAlaska--that is the national missile defense base--that there have been \na series of layoffs now at that small fort due to the program that the \nArmy has had to undertake. I have before me the instructions that were \ngiven by GEN Dick Cody, the Vice Chief of Staff. He gave it to all \ngeneral officers on May 26; that is, he has given instructions--really \na command to the Army--to reduce spending while ensuring that life, \nhealth, and safety issues are covered. The priority is to continue \ncritical support to ongoing operations and readiness activities for \nunits and personnel identified--and that meant with regard to rotation \nconcepts. But with the exception of those concepts, General Cody has \ncommanded that the bases--and this was beginning May 26--not order \nnoncritical spare parts or supplies.\n  He advised the Army Materiel Command to reduce the purchases and to \npostpone and cancel all nonessential travel and training conferences \nand to stop the shipments of goods unless necessary to support deployed \nforces and units with identified deployment dates.\n  What I am trying to tell the Senate is that right now, beginning on \nJune 15, here are the orders starting 2 days from now: Release all \ntemporary civilian employees funded with O accounts or performing O \nfund work. That includes depot operations. Freeze all contract awards \nand new task orders on existing contracts. Process solicitation of new \ncontracts only up to the point of award. Suspend the use of all \nGovernment purchase cards. And if this bill is not approved by June 26, \nbeginning June 26 release service-contracted employees to include \nrecruiters, if doing so will not carry penalties and termination costs.\n  General Cody has advised there may be other painful actions necessary \nif they don't get these funds.\n  I think this is a critical situation right now. The impact of not \ngetting these funds now really causes duplicate actions. They not only \nhave to seek reprogramming for transfer of the funds from other \naccounts to O, but then when they get these funds they will have to \nhave authority to reprogram the funds from this account back into the \naccounts from which they are taken. This really causes enormous \nmanpower problems in the Department of the Army handling situations \nlike this.\n  I have come to plead with the Senate, let's settle the disputes on \nthis bill. The bill is final now, in terms of the conference report. It \nis not subject to amendment. I can tell every Member of the Senate, the \nlonger this bill is delayed the more people are going to be laid off in \nevery State of the Union. It doesn't make any sense at all to delay \ngetting this bill to the President. It is ready, it is overdue, and it \nis time we realized there are substantial costs to the military, when \nwe know they have a crisis that requires supplemental appropriations, \nnot to get the bill approved and to the President as soon as possible.\n  I plead with the leadership, I plead with both sides, let's approve \nthis conference report and get it to the President tomorrow. In doing \nso, it will prevent that list of items I just mentioned that will occur \nstarting June 15 because I am assured the President will sign the bill \nas quickly as possible after Congress has approved it and the Senate \nwill take final action on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska for his comments. He is insightful. He is experienced. He \nunderstands the implications that would flow from the failure of the \nSenate to act promptly in approving this conference report. He is \nchairman of the Defense appropriations subcommittee. He has previously \nserved as chairman of the full committee. He has had a wide range of \nexperience in the military service himself during World War II. I think \nwe should listen to him and we should act in accordance with his \nsuggestions and recommendations. I hope the Senate will not prolong \nthis debate unnecessarily.\n  Everybody has a right to be heard. Everybody has a right to express \ntheir views. But the opportunity is now. Let's finish talking about \nthis bill this evening and let's vote on it the first thing in the \nmorning--whenever it is the pleasure of the leader for us to do so. I \ncommend him and thank him for his strong leadership.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to state that I will vote \nfor the emergency supplemental conference report that is before us, and \nI will do so without hesitation. I expect that most of my colleagues \nwill also join in that vote. We will vote in that way because we know \nour brave men and women in uniform are currently in harm's way. They \nare in harm's way, and they need the resources this bill provides for \nthem to move forward.\n  I also strongly support the hurricane relief and the reconstruction \nelement of this conference report. Those funds are very much needed to \naddress the urgent issues we are facing in the gulf coast and the \nreconstruction of that area from the disaster which was caused by \nHurricane Katrina.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Cochran and the rest of the \ndelegation from the Gulf Coast States that has brought this matter to \nthe urgent attention of the American Nation. But I also rise to express \nmy disappointment in what is not in this conference report and to help \ngive voice with my colleagues to the millions of farmers, ranchers, and \nrural communities where needs have not been met in this report.\n  I am disappointed with the prevailing attitude in our Nation's \nCapital for the men and women who produce an abundant supply of the \nsafest and highest quality food in the world. This bill is literally \nleaving them out to dry.\n  Last year, a bipartisan group of Senators recognized the dire \nsituation that was facing our Nation's farmers and ranchers. We \nintroduced the Emergency Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act of 2006. \nThat bill would provide $3.9 billion in emergency disaster assistance \nfor farmers and ranchers who suffered losses due to natural disasters. \nThis was an excellent piece of legislation which could have only been \nwritten by a consensus, hard work, and a bipartisan approach. We are \nall extremely proud that the Senate included both provisions in the \nemergency supplemental but in part because it included this assistance \nfor farmers and ranchers. And there was a Presidential veto that came \non the bill we passed out of the Senate. Because these provisions were \nstripped from the supplemental bill, our rural communities will suffer \nan unnecessary wrong.\n  I stand with the farmers and ranchers of rural America today because \nI recognize that this problem we face today in rural America will not \ngo away. It will not simply disappear when the Senate\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\nstands adjourned until the final vote on this emergency supplemental.\n  As I travel across Colorado, I hear from farmers and ranchers who \nhave been consistently hit by disaster emergency after disaster \nemergency. With the rising cost of fuel and other interest costs, this \nproblem can and will only get worse.\n  The 2005 winter wheat crop in Colorado was the fifth below-average \ncrop in 6 years, with potential losses for producers of $50 million in \nmy State alone in 2005. Corn producers are reporting that their crops \nwill be 20 percent below average. Sugar beet growers in my State of \nColorado will see a decline of almost 50 percent. Farm fuel has \nincreased 79 percent from where it was in September of 2004. It cost \n$2.60 a gallon in September 2005. It was $1.40 in December 2004, and we \nexpect it will probably be higher this September of 2006. One of my \nconstituents, a farmer in Kit Carson County, a very rural and very \nremote place in the eastern plains of Colorado, estimated that he will \nneed an additional $46,000 to cover the increased cost of fuel alone \nthis year.\n  I have often heard here on this Senate floor that rural America is \n``the forgotten America.'' I very much agree with that characterization \nof rural America. The conference committee, faced with the looming \nthreat of a Presidential veto and pushed by House leadership which is \nout of touch with rural constituencies, abandoned this opportunity for \na renewed commitment to rural America.\n  I will join with my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, in \nmaking sure we do not abandon rural America. I will continue to stand \nwith the hard-working folks of rural America and with my colleagues who \nunderstand the hardships that are faced in more than 50 percent of the \ncounties of our great State.\n  The drought in my State of Colorado has not miraculously ended in \n2006. It continues. Flooding and other natural disasters are still \naffecting producers across the country. Therefore, my colleagues and I \nwill be back, and again we will push for agricultural disaster \nassistance to ensure that our farmers and ranchers in rural communities \nhave a real voice here in Washington, DC.\n  I am also deeply disappointed that a small but very important \namendment I authored--an amendment that was accepted by the Senate--was \nstripped in conference. That provision would have increased the funds \navailable to deal with the wildfire season which is upon us right now \nand particularly to address the hazards presented by the massive \ninfestation of beetles that has turned vast swaths of our forests into \nswaths of dry fuel for wildfires.\n  There was never any doubt in my mind or in the minds of the people of \nthe West that this was, in fact, an emergency situation we face. There \nwas never any doubt that these resources were needed--and they are \nneeded at this time.\n  Try to imagine how painful it is for communities to brace themselves \nfor the worst when they have approved mitigation plans that are simply \nsitting on the shelf just waiting for resources so they can be \nimplemented and wood fuel can be safely removed. We had an opportunity \nto help ease this pain and to do it in this supplemental. Now that \nopportunity has passed us by.\n  I was heartened when my Senate colleagues joined in support of the \namendment, just as I am so disappointed that it is not finally included \nin the conference report before us. When across our State the fires \nstart burning during this summer, I will again remind my colleagues \nthat we had a chance to avert this disaster and to address this \nemergency we know exists, and again we were not able to do so. But on \nthis point, too, I will not give up. I do not believe our Senate should \ngive up. We should keep fighting to address the urgent threat and the \nunderlying causes of the tremendously dangerous wildfire situation in \nwhich Colorado communities and communities across America find \nthemselves. That truly is a disaster emergency we face.\n  Finally, I regret that almost $650 million in funding for important \nport security programs included in the Senate-passed version was left \nout of this conference report. Those funds would have been used to pay \nfor new imaging machines to allow inspectors to look inside cargo \ncontainers as they arrive in American ports, to add Customs inspectors \nat dozens of foreign ports, and to place more U.S. Coast Guard \ninspectors at foreign and domestic ports. These should be high \npriorities, especially given the bipartisan concern about foreign \nownership of U.S. ports and the fact that port inspectors currently \ncheck less than 5 percent--that is less than 5 percent--of the more \nthan 11 million containers that enter American ports every year. As a \ncosponsor of the Greenlane Maritime Cargo Act, a bipartisan bill to \nshore up our port security system, I regret the action that has been \nproduced by this conference report, stripping it of the $650 million we \nincluded in the bill for port security.\n\n  In conclusion, I will vote for the emergency supplemental because it \nis before the Senate and we must make sure we are reconstructing the \ngulf coast and supporting our men and women in uniform. However, the \nsupplemental emergency conference report is flawed because it does not \ndo what it should be doing for farmers and ranchers who have been \ndealing with disaster emergencies, and it does not take care of the \nlooming fire emergency we will face across America over the summer \nmonths.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are happy to have an indication of \nsupport for the conference report from the distinguished Senator from \nColorado.\n  I, too, join him in regretting we could not do more for the \nagricultural producers who sustained setbacks all around the country \nbecause of unfortunate weather conditions and other problems earlier \nthis year.\n  We had, as the Senate remembers, an amendment in the markup of this \nbill in this Senate Committee on Appropriations adding about $4 billion \nfor a wide range of needs in the agricultural sector. I regret, too, we \nwere not able to sustain that provision in negotiations with the House \ncounterparts on the Committee on Appropriations.\n  We did have difficulty in expanding the provisions beyond the narrow \nrequest the President made for funding for the Departments of Defense \nand State to continue to wage a successful war against terror and to \nprovide needed assistance in the gulf region for further recovery \nefforts and rebuilding efforts as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Those \nwere the limitations.\n  The President had threatened to veto the bill if it contained any \nmore than had been requested by the administration for urgent \nsupplemental funding. We were over the barrel, as they say. In \nnegotiations with the House, this is the best we could do.\n  The conference agreement is the result of a lot of hard work and \ncompromise, as well, between the House and the Senate. The bill \nprovides critically needed funding to our troops and helps continue the \nrecovery as a result of the damages sustained in Hurricane Katrina. The \nfunding level meets the requests of the administration. We will look at \nthe other needs in agriculture and other areas in the regular fiscal \nyear 2007 funding cycle.\n  We are having hearings now throughout our Committee on Appropriations \nand the subcommittees that have jurisdiction over these different areas \nof responsibilities. I am assured we are going to do our best to \ncontinue to meet the needs of production agriculture around the \ncountry. It is a vital industry. It is the most important industry in \nmy State, surely. More people are involved in agriculture and in \nprocessing agricultural commodities than any other economic activity.\n  I share the Senator's concerns and assure him we will work to \nidentify the needs in his State and around the country as we go through \nthe appropriations process during this next fiscal year. I thank the \nSenator for his comments.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of the pending conference report on Wednesday \nimmediately following morning business. I further ask consent that \nthere be 25 minutes of debate controlled by the chairman and 75 minutes \ncontrolled by the ranking member. I further ask consent that following \nthe use or yielding back of time, the conference report be set aside, \nand further that at 10 o'clock a.m. on Thursday, June 15, the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the adoption of the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 4939, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, with no \nfurther intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Monday, Senator Robert Byrd of West \nVirginia reached an extraordinary milestone: 17,327 days in the United \nStates Senate, almost 48 years. He has cast over 17,000 rollcall votes. \nHis congressional career has spanned the tenure of 10 Presidents, \nbeginning with President Dwight David Eisenhower. In West Virginia, he \nhas run 14 times and never lost.\n  He has served for over 60 years in both the House and the Senate and \nother public service. This year he is running for his unprecedented \nninth term as a United States Senator from West Virginia. Suffice it to \nsay, he is the longest serving Senator in the history of West Virginia, \nas he is in the history of the United States. He is the only person in \nWest Virginia to carry every county in the State, all 55. He has run \nunopposed for the Senate because of the regard, the respect, and, \nindeed, the affection of the people of West Virginia.\n  He is 88 years old. He is not slowing down, he has never slowed down, \nand he will keep it up. As a Member of the Senate, he has been a \nleader--Democratic whip, majority and minority leader, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and President pro tempore of the Senate on \ntwo occasions.\n  In everything he has done, he has been a champion of the Constitution \nand the people of West Virginia. He secured billions of dollars in \nfunding for his home State, and he has been a leader on mine safety and \nother issues that are so closely tied to his constituents.\n  In May 2001, Senator Byrd was given the award that everyone \nrecognizes is his due. Gov. Bob Wise and both houses of the West \nVirginia General Assembly named him ``West Virginian of the 20th \nCentury,'' and he is striving now for the 21st century.\n  He is an individual who is a self-made man, starting off in war \nindustries in a shipyard, and earning his law degree cum laude from \nAmerican University while a Member of the United States Congress. He is \nalso someone who recognizes the need for education of others. He \ncreated the Robert C. Byrd National Honors Scholarship. This \nscholarship provides opportunities for young Americans to pursue \neducation as he has pursued his education.\n  He is a historian--a historian of this Senate and the Roman Senate. \nIn fact, his 3,000-page ``History of the United States Senate'' is the \npremier history of this August body. He is a defender, a supporter, \nand, in some cases, the living embodiment of the United States \nConstitution. He carries it with him everywhere and every time. He is \nsomeone who not only talks about the Constitution, but on the floor of \nthis Senate and in this country defends it each day.\n  He is an individual of great prominence. He is an individual of great \nhumanity.\n  There is only one fact, I think, that is dimming this very special \noccasion for the Senator, and that is, it is not being shared by his \nbeloved wife Erma Ora Byrd. But she is looking on this day with the \nsame satisfaction, the same sense of accomplishment.\n  It is only fitting to close with a quote from Senator Byrd because I \ncan in no way match his oratorical skills. In September 1998, he \naddressed the history of the Senate and he said:\n\n       Clio being my favorite muse, let me begin this evening with \n     a look backward over the well-traveled roads of history. \n     History always turns our faces backward, and this is as it \n     should be, so that we might be better informed and prepare to \n     exercise wisdom in dealing with future events.\n\n  His grasp of the past has given him a wise and insightful view of the \nfuture. He has always encouraged us to learn our history and then \npractice our history to shape the future of this country in this Hall \nof the Senate.\n  He has stood tall on so many occasions, but most notably I think was \nin October 2002. With an iron will and articulate voice, he questioned \nthe policy of this Government as we entered this fight in Iraq.\n  History, I think, will record his wisdom, his decency, and his \ncontribution to the country. Although I am a day late, I hope I am not \na dollar short.\n  Congratulations to Senator Byrd on his model accomplishment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I join our colleagues in the \naccolades and commendation for our colleague, the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia. I believe there is no other Senator who commands the \nrespect and the admiration and the love of fellow Senators as does \nSenator Byrd.\n  My first encounter with Senator Byrd, I will never forget. Right over \nthere at that desk, 5\\1/2\\ years ago, I rose to make my maiden speech \nin the Senate. In the course of that speech to a fairly empty Chamber \nof the Senate, I happened to mention that it was my maiden speech. In a \nfew moments, suddenly the doors of the Senate flung open and in strode \nSenator Byrd. He sat down at his desk and listened very politely and \npatiently as I continued my first oration in this tremendous, most \ndeliberative body. As I finished, Senator Byrd stood and said, ``Would \nthe Senator from Florida yield?'' I said, of course, ``I yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.'' He proceeded to give a \nhistory of the Senate about maiden speeches. He told how, in the old \ndays, when word would get out that a new Senator was going to give his \nfirst speech, all of the other Senators would gather around because \nthey wanted to hear what the new Senator was saying. Of course, you can \nimagine what an impression this made on this new Senator 5\\1/2\\ years \nago by not only the conscience of the Senate but the historian of the \nSenate, the keeper of the rules of the Senate, the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia. And, of course, he passed a milestone \nyesterday. All of us are proud for him, and we are exceptionally proud \nfor this institution, that it would have a Senator such as the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  I want the Senate to know that this Senator is very privileged that \nhe has had the opportunity not only to call him a friend and colleague \nbut that this Senator has had the opportunity to sit at his knee and \ntry to soak up the wisdom of the years, the exceptional historical \nknowledge of this institution and the extraordinary knowledge of \nhistory of planet Earth that the Senator brings to this Chamber.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a significant \nevent that took place yesterday in the U.S. Senate, and that is the \nfact that we have now a new longest serving U.S. Senator in the history \nof our country. Senator Byrd nears the end of his eighth term here in \nthe Senate but holding more than just another significant record. His \ncontribution to our country has been almost beyond compare. He already \nholds Senate records for the most leadership positions held and for the \nmost rollcall votes cast, over 17,600 and still counting.\n  Starting in 1946, Senator Byrd has run in 14 elections for the West \nVirginia House of Delegates, the State Senate, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and the U.S. Senate. He inspires the envy of all of us \nbecause he has won all of these races, and I have no doubt that voters \nin West Virginia will reelect him to a ninth Senate term this fall. \nThat is going to enable him in December of 2009 to pass the record that \nCarl Hayden has as the longest serving Member of Congress in United \nStates history. But Bob Byrd is not here\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\nmerely to set and break records. He is here to serve the people of West \nVirginia and all Americans, and he has done so admirably.\n  Senator Byrd is a testament to the values of hard work and \nperseverance. Almost from the start, he has had a hard life, but he has \ntriumphed. His mother died from the 1918 flu pandemic, when Senator \nByrd was just an infant. His aunt and uncle raised him in the \nhardscrabble coalfields of West Virginia during the Great Depression. \nHe was the valedictorian of his high school class, but he couldn't \nafford to go to college. After high school, Senator Byrd went to work. \nHe pumped gas, sold produce, became a meat cutter and welder. During \nWorld War II, he helped to build Liberty and Victory ships in the \nBaltimore and Tampa shipyards.\n  Following the war, he began his career as an elected official, \nwinning a seat in the House of Delegates in West Virginia. In 1952, he \nwas elected to the first of three terms in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. In 1958, he was elected to the U.S. Senate. In his \nraces since then, he has carried all 55 of West Virginia's counties. In \nthe year 2000, he won all but seven of West Virginia's 1,970 precincts. \nWhat a record. It is hard to find one that compares in any way to the \nallegiance that he has had from the constituents in West Virginia who \nnot only send him back here but love him as their representative at the \nsame time.\n  It just wasn't winning elections. Senator Byrd could have rested on \nhis laurels, but that is not his style. His life and career have been a \nrelentless pursuit of self-improvement. In 1963, after 10 years of \ntaking classes at night, Senator Byrd earned his law degree cum laude \nfrom American University. He didn't have to do that because he wasn't \ngoing to become a lawyer, but he thought it would make him a better \nperson and a better Senator.\n  Senator Byrd is a great example to all of us, but he is especially \ninteresting for America's young people for three reasons. First, he is \ntruly a self-made man. Nothing has been handed to him. He has earned it \nall. He knows what it is like to be poor, and he knows what it is like \nto do hard manual labor. That is why he has always been the working \nman's champion.\n  Second, he is always striving to learn more and do more. No other \nSenator can match his extensive knowledge on so many subjects or can \nrecite so many passages from the Bible or from Roman history or from \nShakespeare and other playwrights and poets. Senator Byrd isn't content \nmerely to memorize what others have written. He literally wrote the \nbook on the history of the U.S. Senate. No one can match his knowledge \nof Senate rules, precedents, and parliamentary procedure.\n  Finally, Senator Byrd is a shining example to all of us because of \nhis steadfast commitment to principle, especially with regard to the \nrole of a U.S. Senator. He has never wavered in his defense of our \ninstitution. All Americans are deeply indebted to him for that \ndedication and loyalty. At a time when the current administration is \nintent on usurping powers that the Founding Fathers reserved for \nCongress, we need Senator Byrd more than ever, his reminders to all of \nus about what is appropriate in terms of obeying the rules and the \nprocedures we have adopted, but more importantly, the honor that this \ninstitution has developed over more than 200 years.\n  Senator Byrd has demonstrated that fearlessly standing on principle, \neven when it is unpopular, is the key to a successful political career \nand in life generally. His concern for his State and his constituents, \nand his ability to deliver for them, are legendary. But above all, \nSenator Byrd has stood up for the Constitution. He is what we refer to \nas a Senator's Senator. We are truly fortunate to have him here, and we \nare truly privileged to serve with him. He is also a wonderful \ncolleague. He never forgets a birthday or other important occasion, \nnever fails to remind us of the beauty of the seasons.\n  Yesterday his service here in the Senate reached 17,327 days, a \nrecord for which he can be appropriately proud. I know that day was \nbittersweet because it also marked the birthday of his beloved wife, \nErma Ora James, his high school sweetheart, and a coal miner's \ndaughter. We were all so sad when Erma passed away this past March, \njust 2 months shy of their 69th wedding anniversary. Their love for \neach other, their respect for each other, was an inspiration to every \none of us.\n  Senator Byrd's record-setting day yesterday was tinged with some \nsorrow and reflection, but I hope he can take comfort in knowing that \nso many people here in the Senate and all across America hold him in \nsuch high regard.\n  I would like to borrow a page from Senator Byrd by quoting \nShakespeare, who in ``Twelfth Night'' wrote:\n\n       Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have \n     greatness thrust upon them.\n\n  Senator Byrd has achieved greatness in the U.S. Senate. He achieved \nit through his tireless service to the people of West Virginia and his \nfearless defense of the Constitution of the United States of America. \nThe Senate and the Nation are far better for his efforts. We wish him \nwell, a continued ability to serve, and look forward to hearing from \nhim when he talks about subjects that are so familiar to him and yet \nare so far removed from the typical daily thought that we run into.\n  Senator Byrd, when I first came here, invited me into his office. He \ndelivered a treatise on the former rulers of Great Britain, the Kings \nof England. From memory, he recalled the length of their term, how they \ndied, who succeeded each and every one of them. I sat there feeling \nlike I was back in the university or even earlier than that, because he \nhad this incredible and has this incredible memory of so many things, \nand he can relate them wonderfully.\n  I come out of the computer business. Until I got here and got to know \nBob Byrd, I didn't realize that there is someone who has the knowledge, \nthe database, the information that is very difficult to find in other \nthan very large capacity computers.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I do want to talk for a minute about \nSenator Byrd and recognize he has set a record in the Senate, as many \nof my colleagues have noted on the floor.\n  He marked his 17,327th day in office yesterday and became the longest \nserving Senator in history. That is truly a remarkable accomplishment, \nand I personally have many fond memories of working with Senator Byrd \nand look forward to many more.\n  I remember well when I came here as a freshman Senator 13\\1/2\\ years \nago. Senator Byrd at the time brought in all of us freshmen Senators to \nsit across from him in his very important office and looked down at us \nand told us that we would be presiding, as is the Presiding Officer \ntoday, and told us about our responsibilities and made it very clear he \nwould be watching from his office, and if we were reading any other \nmaterial or talking to anyone it would be noted.\n  I certainly did remember that during the many hours I spent in the \nPresiding Officer's chair because I knew he was watching. But I think \nit was a simple reminder to all of us as to the importance of the \noffice we hold here and the respect we have to have for our colleagues.\n  I remember as well that he invited me to lunch several months later \nwith the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield, a Republican, to sit down \nand talk with me about the responsibilities I had as a Senator. And I \nwas so impressed sitting in the room with Senator Byrd and Senator \nHatfield, never in my life expecting to have that kind of opportunity. \nAnd at that meeting they impressed upon me the importance of working \nacross the aisle and respect for the minority and how important \neverybody's voice is here. It was an important lesson and one I think \nwe all should be reminded of more often.\n  But just that simple act of inviting me to lunch with two incredible \nleaders in the Senate is a memory I hold dear, and I thank my colleague \nfor doing that.\n  But, frankly, I think what I most will remember Senator Byrd for--and \nis a good reminder to all of us, too--is several years ago when my \nhusband came out here to Washington, DC--he lives in Washington State. \nI go home every weekend. But he came out here because it was our \nwedding anniversary, and instead of me having to fly home, he flew out \nhere. He was coming up the steps of the Capitol, and I met him as \nSenator Byrd was walking out to his car.\n  Senator Byrd saw my husband, and he said: Welcome. Nice to have you\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\nhere at this end of the country. What brings you here?\n  And my husband said: Well, it is our wedding anniversary.\n  And Senator Byrd, who, as we well know, lost his beloved wife just a \nfew short weeks ago, was about to celebrate I think it was his 67th \nwedding anniversary. He looked at my husband and said: Which \nanniversary is this?\n  And my husband said: It is our 32nd.\n  Senator Byrd paused and said: Well, it is a good start.\n  I think the message of that is important for all of us in our \neveryday lives, in our responsibilities as spouses, and as Senators, to \nremember it is a good start every day, and you can't rest on your \nlaurels and think back: Well, we have done this for 32 years. The next \n32 will be easy. Every day you have to come out and work hard at \nwhatever role you are in at the time.\n  I certainly say to my good friend, Senator Byrd, how much I respect \nhim and admire him. And today, as he marks his 17,328th day in office, \nI say to him: It is a good start.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Senator Byrd, a man \nI am honored to call colleague and friend.\n  Senator Byrd is a hero and a patriot--as noble and eloquent as the \ngreat Senators--from Cicero to Richard B. Russell--of whom he has \ntaught us all so much. He is a living example of the great opportunity \nin America. He is a living tribute to the preeminence of our \nconstitutional democracy.\n  Senator Byrd lives to serve the people of West Virginia who sent him \nhere, just as he would die to protect the Constitution that guides his \nevery step. It is his duty and joy to use his prodigious legislative \nskill for West Virginia, and it is West Virginians' great fortune to be \nrepresented by a man who knows and does his job so well.\n  Several years ago, Senator Byrd turned one of my worst days in the \nSenate into one of my best. It was the end of session, late in the \nevening, and I had lost a fierce battle over dairy policy. Most \nSenators were wandering out to make their planes, and Senator Byrd \nstood up. In ringing tones, he made a short speech about the battle I \njust lost. In part, he said: ``He has stood up for the people of \nWisconsin. That is what I like about him. He stands for principle. He \nstands for his people.''\n  No kinder words have been spoken about me in this Chamber--no \naccolade of which I am more proud. Senator Byrd, you too stand for \nprinciple. You stand for your people. And that's what I like about you.\n  I am not an orator like Senator Byrd, and I certainly don't have the \nwords to say what his friendship has meant to me and what his \nstewardship has meant to this country. Let me instead borrow the words \nof Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a poet Senator Byrd quotes often here on \nthe floor and often from memory. I'm sure he knows this one, too:\n\n     Lives of great men all remind us\n     We can make our lives sublime,\n     And, departing, leave behind us\n     Footprints on the sands of time\n\n  Senator Byrd is a great man. His dedication to duty, his love of \ncountry, and his devotion to his family are examples to us all. He \nleaves footprints in the very soil of this Nation that have and will \ncontinue to shape--for the better--who we are. I am grateful for his \nfriendship and honored to serve with him.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to the chorus of \npraise for an extraordinary member of this institution--my dear friend \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Robert Byrd.\n  What a pleasure it has been to serve with Senator Byrd.\n  I am constantly inspired by his grace--his brilliance--and his \nunmatched work ethic.\n  Today we honor Senator Byrd for reaching the milestone of longest-\nserving Senator in history--8 terms--48 years--and 17,666 votes.\n  These are stunning numbers, but this legend is much more than the Cal \nRipken, Jr., of the Senate.\n  Longevity is only part of the story. We know him best for his \nintellect, his devotion to the people of West Virginia, and his \nreverence for the institution of the Senate; for keeping a copy of the \nConstitution in his breast pocket--next to his heart--at all times, not \nfor symbolism but for constant counsel, for having served beside 11 \nPresidents--both Democrat and Republican; for standing with them when \ntheir cause is just--yet never backing down from a fight with any \nPresident when he believes important principles are at stake, \nparticularly when our role as a coequal branch of government is \nthreatened.\n  And that is what I admire most about Senator Byrd: He always stands \non principle and fights for what he believes, no matter what the odds.\n  What an inspiration this has been to me and to so many of us.\n  What an inspiration--his love of this country, his integrity, his \nabsolute dedication to honest and principled government.\n  And what an inspiration--his 68-year partnership with his wife Erma--\nwhom I know he misses dearly--and whom I know is looking down on him \ntoday with tremendous pride and love.\n  And it is for these reasons--far more than for his longevity--that we \nhonor him today.\n  But anyone who knows Senator Byrd realizes that these words of praise \nare not sought because, despite his well-earned title of Senate \nHistorian--Senator Byrd is not one to dwell on the past. He is a \nforward thinker.\n  For him, this special day is really just another day at the office.\n  Because as Robert Byrd knows best of all--there are crucial issues to \ndebate. Problems to solve. And many more votes to be cast.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend and \ncolleague Robert Byrd, who yesterday officially became the longest \nserving Member in the history of the Senate.\n  As of June 12, 2006, Senator Byrd had officially served West Virginia \nin the Senate for 17,327 days. That is an astounding 47\\1/2\\ years \nsince he took office on January 3, 1959. It was a time when a postage \nstamp cost $0.04, gasoline was $0.25 per gallon, and you could buy a \nbrand new Ford car for a little over $2,100.\n  Senator Byrd has served through 10 Presidencies, statehood for Alaska \nand Hawaii, wartime and peacetime, surplus and deficit, the dawn of \nspace travel and the advent of the Information Age. And, as I stand \nhere today, I have to chuckle at the fact that when I was just \nbeginning the first grade, Senator Byrd was already serving his second \nterm in the Senate.\n  However, the indelible mark he has left on this institution has more \nto do with the quality of his service than the length of his service. \nSenator Byrd has a deep love for his beloved home state of West \nVirginia, for the institution of the U.S. Senate, and for our country. \nAlways ready with a copy of the Constitution in his pocket, Senator \nByrd understands just how sacred this document truly is, and he fights \nevery day to protect it.\n  He literally wrote the book on the rules and traditions of the \nSenate, and he teaches by example, offering the kind of eloquent, \nprincipled debate that has historically filled this Chamber. His \nspeeches are honest and heartfelt, with a Shakespearean rhythm, \npeppered with stories from his boyhood in the coalfields of Appalachia. \nHe is never shy about scolding colleagues when they put politics before \nprinciples or when they violate the practices of this great \ninstitution.\n  And yet he also exemplifies the cordial tradition of the Senate, \ndisagreeing without being disagreeable, and always willing to offer a \nhandshake to a political opponent at the end of hard-fought debate. He \nis a man of integrity, who has demonstrated that an honest search for \ntruth can lead to a principled change of heart and a desire to seek \njustice for all.\n  I know this remarkable accomplishment is a bittersweet one, since \nSenator Byrd is not able to share it with his beloved wife Erma, who \npassed away in March. Yesterday, the day on which Senator Byrd set this \nrecord, was also Erma's birthday. It is fitting that he marks this \nmilestone on the same day he celebrates Erma's life, because he has \noften credited Erma's unconditional love and support with sustaining \nhim through his years of service.\n  When asked last week about achieving this milestone, Senator Byrd \nreplied that ``records are fine, but what's important is what I do for \nthe people of West Virginia.'' That humble devotion to the people he \nserves is what brought Robert Byrd to the Senate more than 47 years \nago, and it is what continues to drive him each and every day.\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\n  After I was sworn in last January, one of the first Senators I met \nwith was Senator Byrd. We sat down in his hideaway on the first floor \nof the Capitol. After we posed for a few photographs, I inquired after \nhis wife, who I had heard had taken a turn for the worse, and asked \nabout some of the figures in the many photos that lined the walls. \nEventually I asked him what advice he would give me as a new member of \nthe Senate.\n  ``Learn the rules,'' Senator Byrd said. ``Not just the rules but the \nprecedents as well.'' He pointed to a series of thick binders behind \nhim, each one affixed with a hand-written label. ``Not many people \nbother to learn them these days. Everything is so rushed, so many \ndemands on a Senator's time. But these rules unlock the power of the \nSenate. They're the keys to the kingdom.''\n  We spoke about the Senate's past, the Presidents he had known, the \nbills he had managed. He told me too many Senators today became quickly \nfixated on reaching the White House, not understanding that in the \nconstitutional design it was the Senate that was supreme, the heart and \nsoul of the Republic.\n  ``So few people read the Constitution today,'' Senator Byrd said, \npulling out a pocket copy from his breast pocket. ``I've always said \nthis document and the Holy Bible, they've been all the guidance I \nneed.''\n  On many occasions over the past year and a half, I have remembered \nthese wise words as I have performed my duties in the Senate.\n  I am proud to call Robert Byrd a colleague, a friend, and a mentor. I \ncongratulate him on this remarkable achievement and wish him all the \nbest for many more years of service to our country.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd, who today, on his 17,327th day in \noffice, becomes longest serving Member of the Senate.\n  As I thought about Senator Byrd's remarkable career, I wondered: What \ncan I say that would properly honor his long labors in service to this \nSenate and this Nation?\n  I decided to look back in history, the history that Senator Byrd has \nquoted time and again, and seek the advice of other Senators known for \ntheir oratory. And while many great speakers have blessed the United \nStates Senate over its history, including Senator Byrd, I found wisdom \nin the advice of the great Roman Senator and orator, Cato the Elder.\n  He said: ``Rem tene; verba sequentur.'' (rem TEN-ay WHEREba \nseKENtoor)--``Grasp the subject, the words will follow.''\n  So I sat back and thought about Senator Byrd, both over his long \ncareer that I have read about, and the 18 years I have been privileged \nto work with him as a colleague.\n  A lot of thoughts came to mind.\n  Warm. Courteous. Kind.\n  Hardworking. Humble. Humorous.\n  Both well read and an accomplished author well worth reading.\n  But none of these were quite right. I still hadn't grasped the \nsubject.\n  Then an image hit me, the image of Senator Byrd reaching into his \ncoat pocket for that copy of the Constitution he always keeps by his \nheart.\n  That was it. I knew I had grasped my subject.\n  Time after time, Senator Byrd has taken this floor to remind us we \nhave duties beyond our parties, beyond our passions, beyond our \npersonal philosophies.\n  Our overwhelming duty is to our Nation's Constitution and the unique \nresponsibilities it assigns each House of the legislative branch.\n  In particular, Senator Byrd constantly reminds us that our duty as \nSenators is to be the more deliberative of the two legislative bodies \nas the Framers envisioned this Chamber to be. Federalist No. 62 says \nthe Senate should be a body that does not ``yield to the impulse of \nsudden and violent passions'' or be ``seduced into pernicious \nresolutions.''\n  So I thought about the history of this Senate. And I would like to \nreflect on the very first Senator, William Maclay of Pennsylvania, \nbecause his spirit is alive today in Senator Byrd. Senator Maclay \nbecame known among his colleagues as a stickler for following the \nConstitution, which sometimes put him at odds with those same \ncolleagues. He also kept a meticulous diary of the proceedings of that \nfirst Senate.\n  One of the earliest debates in the first Senate was over what to call \nGeorge Washington. It is hard to imagine now, but there were many back \nthen who thought that ``President of the United States'' was not a \nfitting title, that something grander was needed.\n  A Title Committee was appointed in the Senate to consider titles such \nas, Your Elective Highness, and His Highness, the President of the \nUnited States and Protector of the Rights of the Same.\n  And those were some of the more modest proposals. The Senate also \nthought about giving special, nobility-style titles to members of the \nexecutive branch.\n  Senator Maclay found this absurd and in violation of the \nConstitution. He waited for someone else to speak out. But when no one \nelse did, the very first Senator of the very first Senate rose and \nsaid:\n  ``Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States has designated \nour chief magistrate by the appellation of President of the United \nStates of America. This is his title of office. We cannot alter, add \nto, or diminish it without infringing on the Constitution. As to grades \nof order or nobility, nothing of the kind can be established by \nCongress.''\n  In his diary, Maclay was even more biting about attempts to establish \nlofty titles because he thought they violated both the letter and the \nspirit of the Constitution.\n  He wrote:\n  ``Never will I consent to straining the Constitution, nor will I \nconsent to the exercise of doubtful power. We come here the servants, \nnot the lords, of our constituents.''\n  Now does that sound like anybody we know?\n  Looking toward the future, Senator Maclay went on to write:\n  ``The new government, instead of being a powerful machine whose \nauthority would support any measure, needs help . . . and must be \nsupported by the ablest names and most shining characters which we can \nselect.''\n  I believe everyone here agrees that Senator Byrd embodies the \n``shining character'' and dedication to the Constitution that the first \nSenator of the first Senate thought would be crucial to the new \nNation's success.\n  I also believe Senator Byrd has done so by following the advice of \nthat ancient Roman Senator who he has quoted so often, Cato the Elder. \nSenator Byrd has truly grasped his subject--the Constitution--and the \nwords have followed for nearly half a century.\n  I hope his words will continue to enlighten this Senate and this \nNation for years to come.\n  Senator Byrd, thank you.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Book of Proverbs says: ``The silver-\nhaired head is a crown of glory.''\n  Today, the crown of glory rests upon the silver-haired head of our \ndear friend and colleague, Robert C. Byrd. For yesterday, he became the \nlongest-serving Senator in the history of the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd has served in the Senate since January 3, 1959. That is \nlonger than there have been 50 States in the Union. That was before \nCharles de Gaulle was President of France. That was before NASA had \nastronauts.\n  Senator Byrd has served as Senator during the terms of 10 Presidents, \n9 majority leaders, and 8 Speakers of the House of Representatives.\n  For 12 years, Senator Byrd served as the leader of Senate Democrats. \nHe served as majority leader, minority leader, and then majority leader \nagain.\n  Senator Byrd has served as the Senate's historian, elder statesman, \nand conscience.\n  Senator Byrd has zealously defended the power of the purse. Senator \nByrd has zealously defended the Senate. And Senator Byrd has zealously \ndefended the Constitution of the United States.\n  But notwithstanding his having held the high rank of Senator for \nlonger than any human being, Senator Byrd has never forgotten whence he \ncame.\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd grew up in the bituminous coalfields of West \nVirginia, graduated from high school class in the depths of the Great \nDepression, and worked pumping gas, selling\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\nproduce, cutting meat, and welding ships. Even though Senator Byrd \nreached the zenith of power, Senator Byrd has always remained a man of \nthe people.\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd is an assiduous pursuer of knowledge, a \ntenacious friend, and a man of deep, abiding faith.\n  Now Senator Byrd surpasses in length of service the likes of Strom \nThurmond, Carl Hayden, John Stennis, Russell Long, and Richard Russell. \nAnd now Senator Byrd stands in quality of service with the likes of \nDaniel Webster, John Calhoun, Henry Clay, Robert La Follette, and \nRobert Wagner.\n  I thank almighty God that for more than 47 years, Americans have been \nable to call him ``Senator.'' I thank God that for more than 27 of \nthose years, I have been blessed to serve here with him. And I thank \nGod that for more than 27 years, I have been blessed to call him \n``friend.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5769-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5769-S5770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Captain Douglas A. Di cenzo\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to U.S. Army \nCPT Douglas A. DiCenzo, of Plymouth, NH, a brave American who has made \nthe ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.\n  Douglas, or Doug to his family and friends, graduated from Plymouth \nRegional High School in 1995. While there, he gave us a glimpse of the \ncharacteristics that would later make him a remarkable soldier. He was \na scholar-athlete in the truest sense. He exemplified leadership as \nclass president, captain of both the football and wrestling teams, and \nan all-state offensive guard for the State champion Bobcat football \nteam.\n  Daniel Webster said, ``God grants liberty only to those who love it, \nand are always ready to guard and defend it.'' In this spirit, after \nhigh school, Doug earned an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at \nWest Point, NY. Upon graduating with his fellow cadets as a second \nlieutenant with the Class of 1999, he earned an assignment as an Army \ninfantry officer. Subsequently Doug completed the arduous infantry \nofficer, Army Airborne, and Ranger courses. Next came a tour of duty to \nFort Wainwright, AK, 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, beginning as \na platoon leader with B Company, Mortar Platoon Leader for Headquarters \nand Headquarters Company, executive officer for C Company and then \nbattalion maintenance officer. Then, in July 2004, Doug was assigned to \nHeadquarters, V Corp in Germany and a year later was assigned to \ncommand the 150 soldiers of C Company, 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry \nRegiment 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, based in Baumholder, \nGermany.\n  In November 2005, he deployed with his unit to Kuwait, and then Iraq, \nin support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Tragically, on May 25, 2006, \nthis brave soldier, along with a comrade from his unit, was killed \nduring combat operations in Baghdad, Iraq, when an improvised explosive \ndevice detonated near his military vehicle. Captain DiCenzo's awards \nand decorations include the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Army \nCommendation Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Achievement Medal \nwith three Oak Leaf Clusters, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq \nCampaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, Army Service Medal, \nOverseas Service Ribbon, Combat Infantry Badge, Expert Infantryman \nBadge, Parachutist Badge, Ranger Tab, Army Presidential Unit Citation, \nand Army Valorous Unit Award.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Baghdad--and U.S. Army CPT \nDouglas A. DiCenzo served in that fine tradition. Captain DiCenzo was a \nwell-respected and natural leader who exemplified the principles of the \nU.S. Military Academy at West Point--duty, honor, country. This \noptimistic, passionate, and patriotic American demonstrated the virtues \nextolled in the Cadet Prayer, ``Encourage us in our endeavor to live \nabove the common level of life. Make us to choose the harder right \ninstead of the easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth \nwhen the whole can be won. Endow us with courage that is born of \nloyalty to all that is noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with \nvice and injustice and knows no fear when truth and right are in \njeopardy.'' CPT Douglas DiCenzo was dedicated to serving his country in \nthese chaotic and violent times because he thought it was his duty to \ndo this.\n  My heartfelt sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Doug's wife \nNicole and their 18-month-old son Dakin, as well as to Doug's parents, \nLarry and Cathy, his brother Daniel, and his family and friends who \nhave suffered this grievous loss. The death of Doug, only 30 years old, \non a battlefield far from New Hampshire is also a great loss for our \nState, our Nation, and the world. Although he will be sorely missed by \nall, his family and friends may sense some comfort in knowing that \nbecause of his devotion, leadership, sense of duty, and selfless \ndedication, the safety and liberty of each and every American is more \nsecure. May God bless CPT Douglas A. DiCenzo.\n\n\n                       Private Benjamin J. Slaven\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to express my sympathy over the loss \nof U.S. Army PVT Benjamin J. Slaven from Nebraska. Private Slaven died \nwhen an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle while on \npatrol in Ad Diwaniyah, Iraq on June 9. He was 22 years old.\n  Private Slaven grew up in Plymouth, NE and received his high school \nequivalency diploma from Southeast Community College in 2005. He was \ndeployed to Iraq in March after serving in the U.S. Army Reserves. \nBefore being deployed, Private Slaven worked with developmentally \ndisabled young adults at the Beatrice State Development Center in \nBeatrice, NE. He was a member of Detachment 1, 308th Transportation \nCompany based in Lincoln, NE. Private Slaven will be remembered as a \nloyal soldier who had a strong sense of duty, honor, and love of \ncountry. Thousands of brave Americans like Private Slaven are currently \nserving in Iraq.\n  Private Slaven is survived by his mother, Judy Huenink of Plymouth, \nNE; father, Bruce Slaven of Beatrice, NE; and sister, Misti Slaven. \nJudy and Bruce both served in the Air Force, and Misti is training to \nbe a medical lab technician in the Army Reserve at Fort Bliss, TX. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time. America is \nproud of Private Slaven's heroic service and mourns his loss.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring PVT \nBenjamin J. Slaven.\n\n\n                      Lance Corporal Brent Zoucha\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to express my sympathy over the loss of \nU.S. Marine Corps LCpl Brent Zoucha from Nebraska. Lance Corporal \nZoucha died of wounds received while conducting combat operations in Al \nAnbar province, Iraq on June 9. He was 19 years old.\n  Lance Corporal Zoucha was a lifelong resident of Clarks, NE and \ngraduated from High Plains Community High School in 2005. In high \nschool, he was a standout athlete, earning second place in the high \njump at the 2005 State track meet. He was also named honorable mention \nto the Omaha World-Herald's all-Nebraska basketball team. Lance \nCorporal Zoucha enlisted in the Marine Corps while still in high school \nand served with his brother, CPL Dyrek Zoucha, in the same unit in \nIraq. He was a member of the 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st \nMarine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, Twentynine Palms, CA. \nLance Corporal Zoucha will be remembered as a loyal soldier who had a \nstrong sense of duty, honor, and love of country. Thousands of brave \nAmericans like Lance Corporal Zoucha are currently serving in Iraq.\n  Lance Corporal Zoucha is survived by his mother, Rita; brothers, \nDyrek and Dominic; and sister, Sherri, of Duncan, NE. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with them at this difficult time. America is proud of Lance \nCorporal Zoucha's heroic service and mourns his loss.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring LCpl \nBrent Zoucha.\n\n\n                          Private Tim Madison\n\n  Mr. President, I further express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. \nArmy PVT Tim Madison from Nebraska. Private Madison was killed in a \ntraining exercise at Fort Carson, CO, on June 8. He was 28 years old.\n  Private Madison grew up in Bellevue, NE, and graduated from Bellevue \nEast High School in 1997. Private Madison was a loving father of three \nchildren and loved being outdoors. He was a member of the Army's 2nd \nBrigade\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\nCombat Team, Fort Carson, CO. Private Madison will be remembered as a \nloyal soldier who had a strong sense of duty, honor, and love of \ncountry. Thousands of brave Americans like Private Madison are \ncurrently serving in the U.S. military.\n  Private Madison is survived by his wife Melissa; children, Hailee, \nJonathan and Michael of Fort Carson, CO; parents, Ken Madison, Sr., a \nretired Air Force master sergeant, and Nancy Madison; brothers, Kenneth \nJr., Anthony, and Richard; and sister, Christina, all of Bellevue, NE. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time. America \nis proud of Private Madison's service and mourns his loss.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring PVT Tim \nMadison.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5770-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5770-S5771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HURRICANE SEASON AND INSURANCE COMPANIES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to address a topic that \nis appropriate, since tropical storm Alberto is on the coast of \nFlorida--in the Big Bend area of Florida--right now. Fortunately, \nAlberto stayed a tropical storm, although there was a moment last night \nwhen the National Hurricane Center thought it was going to become a \nhurricane, which is 74-plus miles an hour.\n  Isn't it interesting that here we are in early June--normally, \nhurricanes don't really start brewing up until July, and the severe \nones don't start brewing up until August and September. But we see the \nconfluence of two things. We see not only the active hurricane cycles \nthe meteorologists will tell you about, that these are 10- and 15-year \ncycles and hurricanes will become much more active and much more \nfrequent. When you add that meteorological phenomenon to the fact of \nglobal warming where, as the Earth's temperatures rise because of the \ntrapping of the greenhouse gases, the rising of the temperature of the \nwater, the rising of the temperature of the atmosphere--the effect of \nthat is more frequent and more ferocious storms. Whether that global \nwarming is affecting this particular cycle, I know not. But I know that \nthe phenomenon of global warming added to--if we are in a 10- or 15-\nyear meteorological phenomena of hurricane cycles, that can add all the \nmore to the distress, dismay, and tragedy that the Atlantic and the \ngulf coast of the United States will suffer over the coming number of \nyears.\n  That brings me to the subject matter: the cost of insurance, \nparticularly homeowners insurance, which is going to--if it hasn't \nalready--become prohibitive for coastal dwellers. It is not just \ncoastal dwellers because the insurance rates are spread in a particular \nway where the property owner will share in the burden of the cost of \ninsurance no matter whether the homeowner lives on the coast or lives \ninland. This is exactly what has happened to the gulf coast as a result \nof Katrina. It is what happened in Florida for the active hurricane \nyear of 2004, in which four hurricanes hit Florida within a 6-week \nperiod. As a result, you see insurance rates that are absolutely \nescalating, with the phenomenon that is now occurring in Florida and \nGulf States, including Alabama; Mississippi, the home of the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, who is on the floor at \nthe moment; Louisiana; and eventually it will happen to Texas when they \nget pounded a couple of times--that is, the phenomenon that homeowner \ninsurance rates are going through the roof.\n  In addition to that, insurance companies--if they have not gone \nbroke--are bailing out; they are canceling policies right and left. \nThose which are staying are canceling policies, and other insurance \ncompanies are canceling all of their homeowners coverage. The bottom \nline is that this is a tough time for homeowners just to be able to \nafford financially the cost of what is known as windstorm insurance.\n  Now, I rise to tell the Senate about a package of bills that has been \nfiled but one in particular that I suggest to the Senate is a way of \naddressing not only the pleas of our constituents back home, the pleas \nof insurance companies, the pleas of reinsurance companies, the pleas \nof insurance regulators, the insurance commissioners of the 50 States, \nbut the pleas particularly of our constituents who are paying the tab. \nThis is the question: Can any one insurance company or any one State \nwithstand the financial losses we anticipate from the megahurricanes of \nthe future? The answer to that is no. That is why they are now turning \nto the Federal level of government.\n  May I say that 11 years ago, I was confronted with one of the \ntoughest jobs I have ever had in a lifetime of public service when I \nwas elected the Florida State treasurer, which is also the position of \nthe elected insurance commissioner of Florida. I inherited the chaos in \nthe aftermath of the monster hurricane, Hurricane Andrew, in the early \n1990s. It had paralyzed the insurance marketplace of Florida, not only \nin south Florida where the hurricane hit but the entire State of \nFlorida, because what is happening today happened in the mid-1990s--\ncompanies had gone broke, they were fleeing the State of Florida, and \nthose which were staying were canceling policies right and left. \nCompanies were asking the insurance commissioner for rate increases \nthat were being hiked to the Moon. It is the same phenomenon we have \ntoday.\n  I can tell you that we had to make up the solution as we went because \nthat kind of financial impact to the insurance industry and to the \npeople served by that industry had never happened. Andrew was a $16 \nbillion insurance loss storm. That, in today's dollars, is about a $23 \nbillion insurance loss storm. But what really scared the ``bejeebers'' \nout of the insurance marketplace was the realization that if the \nhurricane had turned 1 degree to the north and drawn a bead on the Dade \nCounty-Broward County line instead of south Dade in Homestead, a \nrelatively unpopulated part of Dade County, if it turned that 1 degree \nto the north and hit that more populated area, it would have been a $50 \nbillion loss storm, and that would have taken down every insurance \ncompany that was doing business in the path of the storm--taken them \ndown financially. It would have drained all of their reserves.\n  That is the circumstance we have facing the States of the gulf coast \nas well as the Atlantic coast today because you put a category 4--by \nthe way, remember, by the time Katrina hit Louisiana, it was only a \ncategory 3. Look at what it did to the Mississippi coast. If you put a \ncategory 4, which is winds up to 145 miles per hour, or a category 5, \nwhich is in excess of that, into a concentrated area of high urban \ndensity and you have major loss, you will have insurance companies \ngoing down the tubes financially.\n  So what are they doing? They are coming to us. Well, the problem is \nthat the Federal level of government has never dealt with insurance. It \nwas back in the 1930s that the McCarran-Ferguson Act was enacted, which \nsaid the regulation of insurance is going to be done by the 50 States. \nAnd they are coming to us because of the financial enormity of loss not \nonly to insurance companies but to our respective States as well. And, \ntherefore, what do we do? It is hard to get consensus here because we \ndon't deal in insurance matters, and it is hard to get consensus \nbecause the insurance industry is not unified on what to do. Certainly, \nthe reinsurance industry has a different perspective than the insurance \nindustry. The insurance regulators have another perspective.\n\n  So, after consulting with my dear friend and senior colleague from \nMississippi and with the senior Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, \nwe have filed a bill modeled after what the State of Florida had to do \nafter the monster mega-hurricane in the nineties, and that was build \nconsensus by forming a prestigious commission representative across the \nboard of all the peoples and organizations that are affected by this \nenormous question and ask that commission, that emergency national \ncommission--which is exactly what we did in Florida in 1995. We formed \nwhat we called then the academic task force headed by presidents of the \nuniversities of Florida. They reported back within 3 months.\n  We took that package to the State legislature. We got the legislature \nto pass it into law. The law enabled the insurance commissioner then to \nhelp the insurance companies restore the marketplace at affordable \nprices so the people would have available affordable insurance.\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\n  So the three of us--Senator Cochran, Senator Landrieu, this Senator--\nhave filed this bill setting up a national commission under law \nappointing specific designees that are a broad representation of the \nindustry, of the problem, to come back to the Congress and to the \nexecutive branch within 90 days with their recommendation that then we \ncan deliberate the work product thereof to see if we can have some \nsolution as to these dire economic conditions that our people, that our \nStates, and, in fact, private industry are facing as we now face \nanother active hurricane season.\n  I conclude by saying that we are very happy that the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners, that organization that \nrepresents all 50 insurance commissioners of our States, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, plus the Virgin Islands, plus Puerto Rico, have \nall come together and unanimously endorsed this concept.\n  We cannot get consensus here because everybody has a different idea, \nincluding the industry, but we can take what happened successfully in \nFlorida and use that model to build consensus so that we will know what \nto do and then can pass appropriate legislation.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to share this right as the winds are hitting \nthe State of Florida from the first named storm of this hurricane \nseason, the storm named Alberto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida for his initiative in bringing this issue in this form to the \nSenate. I am pleased to cosponsor the legislation with him, Senator \nLandrieu, and others who may cosponsor this legislation.\n  We are reaching out to the industry and to experts in related \nbusiness activities who have experience, a depth of understanding about \nthis challenge we face to give us the benefit of their advice and their \ncounsel.\n  There are specific recommendations, if they can come to a consensus, \non how Government can more responsively address this critical issue. In \nour State of Mississippi right now, there are people in limbo trying to \ndecide whether they take on the burden of increased costs of insurance, \nof chances that they may not get insurance they can afford. So \nrebuilding is slow. Recovery is slow. Businesses are reluctant to \nembark upon expansion or remodeling, refurbishing, rebuilding, \nreconstructing from slabs the businesses they had in the gulf coast \nregion.\n  This is a real dilemma, and it is an economic challenge that no one \nState can really overcome using the resources of a State government or \na national blue ribbon commission, such as the one brought together by \nHaley Barbour of Mississippi. Our Governor has reached out to the \nbusiness community and individuals who have experience who could be of \nhelp in recovering from the disaster that hit our State.\n  This is bigger than one State, bigger than our State's commission \nthat Governor Barbour has appointed and that is working hard and making \na big difference and making us believe that we can recover, and we will \nrecover. That is a very important part of this situation and this \nchallenge.\n  I think this is a very important step to take, and it comes at a time \nwhen we have laid before the Senate now a conference report making \nsupplemental appropriations to the Departments of State and Defense for \nthe war on terror, but as far as our current domestic challenges are \nconcerned, $19 billion to help sustain the recovery and rebuilding that \nis underway, recovering from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita that were so \ndevastating to our gulf coast region.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5771-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On June 10, 2006, gay performance artist Kevin Aviance was severely \nbeaten in New York City. According to reports, Aviance was walking home \nfrom a local bar when four teens began shouting obscenities and \nattacked him from behind. During the attack Aviance was kicked and \npunched while the attackers yelled sexually derogatory slurs at him.\n  An officer with New York's Hate Crimes Taskforce reported that four \nmen were arrested and charged with a hate crime in connection to the \nattack.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5771-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FLORIDA CITRUS-CANKER QUARANTINE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, yesterday was the annual commemoration of \nthe International Labor Organization's, ILO, World Day Against Child \nLabor, the day we set aside to speak out against the fact that millions \nof children around the globe continue to be trapped in forced and \nabusive labor, often in extremely hazardous conditions.\n  The good news, this year, is that child labor is in decline across \nthe globe. According to the recent ILO report, ``The End of Child \nLabor: Within Reach,'' released on May 4 of this year, between the \nyears 2000 and 2004, the number of child laborers worldwide fell by 11 \npercent, from 246 million to 218 million. Even better, the number of \nchildren and youths aged 5-17 trapped in hazardous work decreased by 26 \npercent, declining from 171 million in 2000 to 126 million in 2004. \nAmong younger child laborers, the drop was even sharper at 33 percent.\n  This is remarkable progress in just 4 years' time. And looking to the \nfuture, the ILO report cautiously predicts that, ``if the current pace \nof decline is maintained, and if global efforts to stop child labor \ncontinue.'' We have a real opportunity to eliminate child labor in its \nworst forms within 10 years' time. However, difficult challenges lie \nahead, especially in agriculture, where 7 out of 10 child laborers \nwork. I know this firsthand from my work trying to end child labor in \nthe cocoa industry. Child labor is deeply entrenched in cocoa \nplantations in Ivory Coast and elsewhere. But, with the cooperation of \nthe chocolate industry, we are making progress in fighting it.\n  Likewise, in the broader fight against child labor, the ILO report \nverifies that we are on the right track to eliminating abusive and \nexploitative child labor. The great work of the ILO's International \nProgram on the Elimination of Child Labor, IPEC, really vindicates the \nconfidence I placed in this program early on. I secured the first \nFederal appropriation for the IPEC program back in 1996, and over the \nlast decade, I have secured a total of more than $323 million for the \nprogram. Clearly, that money has made a\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\nreal difference in the lives of children. It has given them an \nopportunity to get an education and to break the cycle of poverty.\n  In August 2005, I visited Pakistan and spent time at an IPEC program \nfunded by the U.S. Department of Labor to combat child labor in the \nPakistani carpet industry. I was able to sit down and talk with young \nadults who had been laborers in the carpet industry as children but had \nbeen removed and given the opportunity to go to school. In Pakistan, \nthe Department of Labor's international child labor program has helped \nto ensure that 20,000 children between the ages of 10-18 have been \nremoved from hazardous work conditions and provided with either \nnonformal education or vocational training. I have also visited child \nlabor rehabilitation programs in Brazil, Nepal, and Bangladesh. These \nvisits have showed me the incredibly beneficial impacts that \ngovernments can make, but I also realize that industry partnerships are \nessential to the real eradication of child labor.\n  Although there has been a tremendous amount of progress in ending \nchild labor, now is not the time to become complacent. Unfortunately, \nhundreds of millions of children are still forced to work illegally for \nlittle or no pay. Economic development alone is not enough, and we must \nfocus on human rights and educational opportunities for those in \npoverty. Social change must go hand in hand with economic development, \nwhich requires workers' and employers' organizations. Our keys to \nsuccess will be mainstreaming child labor efforts with other human \nrights and development goals, as well as getting national governments, \nNGOs, and international organizations all working cooperatively to end \nchild poverty.\n  We should not think about these children only on June 12 each year. \nWe should think about this last vestige of slavery 365 days a year. I \nhave remained steadfast in my commitment to eliminating abusive and \nexploitative child labor. It was in 1992 that I first introduced a bill \nto ban all products made by abusive and exploitative child labor from \nentering the United States. In my view, we can make significant \nprogress to eliminate this scourge if we all do our part and redouble \nour efforts. This means that governments must not merely pass laws but \nenforce them, while also striving to provide quality, free education. \nBusinesses must take responsibility, as well, by not hiring children, \nand by paying adults livable wages so they can provide for their \nfamilies. Multilateral institutions must also play a robust role. \nTogether, we can eliminate the worst forms of child labor by 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5772-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BROADCAST DECENCY ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

The Broadcast Decency \nEnforcement Act enables the Federal Communications Commission to \nsignificantly increase the fines on television and radio broadcasters \nwho violate the FCC decency rules regarding over-the-air public \nbroadcasts. Specifically, this legislation will increase the maximum \nfine for the broadcast of obscene, indecent, or profane material to \n$325,000 for each violation, with a cap of $3 million for any single \nact or failure to act. This is a tenfold increase over the current \nmaximum fine per offense.\n  The First amendment states, ``Congress shall make no law . . . \nabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.'' However, the \nSupreme Court has determined many times that not all forms of speech \nare protected. In fact, the Court has deemed fit to regulate such forms \nof speech as obscenity, defamation, speech that incites violence, \nspeech that is harmful to children, and speech that is broadcasted on \nradio and television.\n  Unfortunately, broadcasters have recently started playing fast and \nloose with the decency guidelines. Some of the infractions have made \nthe headlines, but many others never do. Either way, the broadcasters \nhave a responsibility to America's viewing public, and particularly to \nAmerica's parents. Their behavior demands a response. Allowing obscene, \nindecent, or profane material over our unrestricted airways can make \nthe job of raising children in today' s world even tougher than it \nalready might be. Putting in place a fine that means something \nsignificant to broadcasters who violate decency regulations will help \nparents who are trying to surround their young children with good role \nmodels and decent behavior.\n  My parents provided me with a strong value system that I depend on to \nthis day. As a father of two teenage daughters, I am doing my best to \nmake sure my girls understand the difference between right and wrong as \nthey prepare for life on their own. Parents will always have the \nprimary role of instilling values in children, supported by teachers, \nchurch leaders, and friends. Decent television will never take the \nplace of good parenting, but if there is a modest action that we can \ntake here in Washington to keep the airwaves a little cleaner, I \nbelieve we should take that action. I am proud to support this effort \nto do just that.\n  Mr. President, the House has recently passed this same legislation, \nand I call on the President to sign the bill into law. American \nfamilies deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5772-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5772-S5773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    APPRECIATION FOR LARRY Q. NOWELS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nextend the appreciation of the Senate to a dedicated public servant at \nthe Congressional Research Service, CRS, of the Library of Congress. \nLarry Q. Nowels is retiring from CRS after more than 30 years of \nservice to the Congress. This length of public service is not only a \ncredit to Mr. Nowels but also a demonstration of the dedication that \nthe staff of the Congressional Research Service brings in its support \nof our work in Congress.\n  Mr. Nowels first joined CRS in 1973 as an information resources \nassistant, while simultaneously pursuing an advanced degree in \ninternational relations at American University. His primary \nresponsibility at CRS was to help in the management of the Foreign \nAffairs Division library, a task for which he was well prepared, having \nworked throughout his high school years as a library page in Claremont, \nCA. In a very short time he was promoted to division librarian, then to \ntechnical information specialist, to foreign affairs analyst, and \nfinally to foreign affairs specialist. He served as section head of the \nInternational Organizations, Development, and Security Section of the \nForeign Affairs and National Defense Division from 1985 to 1997, and \nfor a period in 1992, served as acting assistant chief of the division.\n  Mr. Nowels' first research assignment at CRS was to assist senior \nstaff in monitoring reporting requirements in the foreign affairs \nfield, a joint committee project begun in 1975 for the Senate Committee \non Foreign Relations and House Committee on International Relations. \nFor the next 30 years, Mr. Nowels would assist Congress in tracking, \nmoderating, and understanding the use of reporting requirements in \nfulfilling its oversight responsibility. In that first year, Mr. Nowels \nwas also involved in the preparation of three other contributions by \nCRS to the congressional committees dedicated to foreign relations: the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations' biennial Legislative History; the \nCommittee on International Relations' annual Congress and Foreign \nPolicy; and the annual Legislation on Foreign Relations, a joint \ncommittee project begun by the 88th Congress and continued to this day \nas a joint effort of the Congressional Research Service, Committee on \nForeign Relations, and Committee on International Relations. Mr. Nowels \nremained intimately involved with each of these projects for many years \nand also provided mentorship to a notable succession of CRS staff.\n  During his career, Mr. Nowels wrote nearly 500 memoranda and reports \nfor Members of Congress and congressional committees, organized \nnumerous seminars, provided many briefings to Members and congressional \nstaff, accompanied congressional delegations abroad, and testified \nbefore congressional committees, primarily on issues related to foreign \nassistance. Over the years, he introduced congressional staff persons, \nboth new to Washington\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\nand those most senior, to the appropriations process through courses in \nthe Graduate Legislative Institute and briefed newly elected Members of \nCongress at biennial Williamsburg seminars. He provided groundbreaking \nanalysis to the Congress on U.S. aid to Communist nations, implications \nof the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction on foreign policy, debt \nforgiveness including heavily indebted poorest country--HIPC--\nInitiatives, post-Cold War aid, Israeli loan guarantees, numerous \ncongressional-executive efforts at foreign aid reform, international \nfamily planning programs, third-country foreign aid programs, \nestablishment of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and multiyear \nforeign policy budget trends.\n  Mr. Nowels attended the National War College at the National Defense \nUniversity in 1986-1987, where he won an award for his writing. On \nseveral occasions he was detailed to committees to serve alongside \ncommittee staff. In recent years, he traveled extensively on behalf of \nthe Department of State's Speakers Program to speak to foreign \nofficials, academics, and journalists on the U.S. Congress and U.S. \nforeign policy.\n  Mr. Nowels' exemplary contribution and service has been recognized by \nthe Congressional Research Service with numerous special service \nawards, performance awards, and outstanding performance evaluations. \nHis sustained excellence was acknowledged and honored by the Library of \nCongress with a Meritorious Service Award in 1992.\n  Larry Nowels is a fine example of those many dedicated staff of the \nCongressional Research Service who help inform Congress as it \ndeliberates important public policy issues. His gracious demeanor and \nconsiderable expertise on U.S. foreign aid and U.S. foreign policy made \nhim an invaluable asset to Congress for many years. On behalf of my \ncolleagues, I extend our deep appreciation to Larry for his service and \nwish him the very best in future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5773-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5773-S5774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL KEITH W. LIPPERT\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a lifetime \ncommitment of service to the United States of America, our Defense \nDepartment and our great U.S. Navy by a true patriot, VADM Keith W. \nLippert, Supply Corps, U.S. Navy. On September 1, 2006, Vice Admiral \nLippert will retire after 37 years and 8 months of dedicated and \nexceptionally distinguished service in the U.S. Navy. In addition to \nhis retirement, Vice Admiral Lippert will relinquish command as the \n14th Director of the Defense Logistics Agency, DLA, and I would note \nthat he will retire as our longest serving DLA Director having spent \nthe last 5 years at the helm of a Defense agency that has become \nincreasingly important to the Nation. The Admiral's departure is indeed \na loss for our nation since over these last 5 years, he has made \nremarkable accomplishments and I would highlight a few of them here.\n  The remarkable success of our military servicemen and women in the \nfield, and the battles won every day by our forces engaged in the \nglobal war against terrorism could not be accomplished if not for the \nunparalleled logistics support our military so critically depends upon. \nOn Admiral Lippert's watch this support has increased to the extent \nthat 95 percent of the materials used by the entire U.S. military is \nprovided by the 22,000 personnel hard at work in DLA activities around \nthe globe and many here in Virginia. I am proud to note that Virginia \nhosts the DLA Headquarters and the Defense Energy Support Center at \nFort Belvoir in Northern Virginia, the Defense Supply Center, Aviation, \nand Distribution Depot in our State capital of Richmond, and another \nDistribution Depot right on Virginia's Navy waterfront in Norfolk.\n  DLA has facilities in 48 States and 24 countries around the world and \neach facility is a source of pride for all of the DLA employees. All of \nthe fuel supporting our jets, helicopters, ships and tanks is purchased \nby DLA. All of the food, military clothing, and supplies needed to \nsustain our forces is managed by the DLA workforce.\n  The DLA Defense Distribution system, a total of 26 distribution \ndepots here in the United States and in overseas locations such as \nKuwait, Korea, Japan, Italy, and Germany are all crucial to the steady \nflow of materials to our troops and these depots constitute a national \ntreasure in their own right.\n  Allied forces that have partnered with DLA on Admiral Lippert's watch \nalso enjoy this same support.\n  Remarkably, Admiral Lippert has aggressively driven down the cost of \nmanaging this enterprise to the lowest level in the 45-year history of \nDLA while dramatically improving the inventory validity of our critical \ndefense stocks, championing a series of transformational initiatives, \nleading the most successful enterprise resource planning software re-\nengineering initiative in the entire Defense Department, and greatly \nimproving the quality of customer service provided by this amazing \nAgency. I would add that the Agency has become equally important to the \nCoast Guard, FEMA and other Agencies in our Federal, State, and local \ngovernments. This support was especially significant to our country \nafter the last hurricane season when millions of Meals Ready to Eat, \nMREs, were sent en masse from Norfolk to our fellow citizens in need.\n  Thirty-eight years ago, Vice Admiral Lippert earned his commission \nthrough the Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps program at Miami \nUniversity in Oxford, OH, with a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics \nin 1968. He received his master's degrees in management and in \noperations research from the Naval Postgraduate School. In 1994, he \nattended the senior executive program in national and international \nsecurity at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard \nUniversity.\n  The admiral has spent a significant time on sea duty tours including \nservice as the supply officer on the nuclear submarine USS Queenfish, \nSSN 651, as assistant supply officer on the Submarine Tender USS Simon \nLake, AS 33, and as the supply officer on the Submarine Tender USS \nCanopus, AS 34. The admiral has had increasingly important shore duty \ntours including assignments as assistant comptroller, Commander \nSubmarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, operations research officer at the \nNavy Ships Parts Control Center, Mechanicsburg, PA; inventory analysis \nstaff, Naval Supply Systems Command, Washington, DC; executive officer, \nNaval Supply Center, Jacksonville, FL; and director, spares programs \nand policy branch in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations \nfor Logistics.\n  In 1990, he rejoined the Naval Supply Systems Command as the deputy \ncommander for financial management/comptroller. From July 1993 to July \n1995, Admiral Lippert served as the commander, Defense General Supply \nCenter in the great capital of our commonwealth, Richmond. In August \n1995, he became the first commander of the Naval Inventory Control \nPoint with offices in Philadelphia, PA, and Mechanicsburg, PA. Admiral \nLippert officially entered the Flag Officer Corps when he was awarded \nthe rank of rear admiral, lower half, in November 1995. From 1997 to \n1999, he served as the vice commander for the Naval Supply Systems \nCommand and received his promotion to rear admiral, upper half, in \nOctober 1998. From 1999 to 2001, he commanded the Naval Supply Systems \nCommand and served as the Navy's 41st chief of Supply Corps. In May of \n2000, President Clinton appointed Vice Admiral Lippert to represent the \nNavy as a member of the President's Committee for Purchase from People \nwho are Blind or Severely Disabled. He assumed his current position as \nthe director of DLA in July of 2001 and received his promotion to vice \nadmiral in September of 2001.\n  His decorations include the Defense Superior Service Medal, three \nLegion of Merits, four Meritorious Service Medals, two Navy and Marine \nCorps Commendation Medals, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and \nSubmarine Supply Dolphins. He is also the recipient of the Society of \nLogistics Engineers 1992 International Award for outstanding \nperformance in financial management/inventory control. Under Admiral \nLippert's tenure as Director, DLA received two Joint Meritorious Unit \nAwards.\n  In closing I wish to commend Vice Admiral Lippert for his nearly 38 \nyears\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\nof distinguished service to our Nation, protecting our freedoms of \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and wish him the best in \nhis future endeavors. His departure is a great loss to our Navy, but we \nare markedly better for having had him aboard. He leaves us with a \nDefense agency that is indeed a national treasure and one that has been \nvastly improved on his watch. I honor this patriot and dedicated public \nservant, wishing him a fond farewell, fair winds for his sails and \nfollowing seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5774-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE LIFE OF JERRY W. LEE\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the \nlife of a distinguished civil servant and friend, Jerry W. Lee, who \npassed away on June 7. Jerry's dedication to the working families of \nour State kept him involved in public service up until his death, doing \nhis part to help Hoosiers from all walks of life. I know that he will \nbe greatly missed.\n  Jerry was a good and decent man who dedicated his life to serving \nothers. From his work with organized labor to his involvement in the \ncommunity, his career was filled with acts of conscientious service on \nbehalf of friends, family members, and Hoosiers across Indiana. The \ncontributions he made touched countless lives, and his presence and \nstraight talk will be sorely missed.\n  For the past 20 years, Jerry served as secretary-treasurer and \nbusiness manager of the Laborers' Indiana District Council, standing up \nfor the working men and women of our State. He devoted all of his \nenergy to ensuring good jobs at decent wages for his workers and \nhelping take care of their families. He is survived by his mother; his \nwife, Benetta Jo Woodruff Lee; his son, Darren Lee; his three \ndaughters, Stephanie Bean, Christina Brown and Connie Phillips; his two \nbrothers, Sammy Joe Lee and Donald Dean Lee; 11 grandchildren; and five \ngreat-grandchildren.\n  A lifelong Hoosier, he was also involved in numerous other labor \nassociations and was a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. It is a rare man \nwho can make such an impact on so many people over the course of one \nlife. Hoosiers will miss Jerry as a friend, a community leader, and an \nadvocate for working Hoosiers.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jerry Lee in the official \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to the State of \nIndiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5774-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING NEWPORT POLICE CHIEF MICHAEL CAPRIGLIONE\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to commend Police Chief Michael Capriglione of the town of \nNewport, DE. Chief Capriglione has been recognized by the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration with a Public Service Award for \nhis outstanding dedication to the fight against drunken driving in the \nState of Delaware.\n  Chief Capriglione was nominated for this award by the mid-Atlantic \noffice of the NHTSA, which began the Checkpoint Strikeforce Campaign in \nDelaware in 2001. The Checkpoint Strikeforce Campaign is an initiative \nthat works to decrease the number of impaired driving crashes through \nincreased police presence on the roads and statewide sobriety \ncheckpoints on weekends and during holidays. The campaign has continued \nto grow since its inception, with increasing numbers of affiliated \npolice agencies and officers joining the program each year. In 2003, \ncounty teams were created to pool resources and enhance the efficiency \nof the campaign in each of Delaware's three counties. Chief Capriglione \nwas named the head of the New Castle County DUI Task Force and has \nserved as the primary law enforcement advocate for the Checkpoint \nStrikeforce Campaign in Delaware.\n  The campaign had been highly successful; an increasing number of DUI \narrests are made each year, with 685 intoxicated drivers arrested \nbetween July and December 2005 alone. This results in safer roads for \nour citizens to travel: 2004 saw the lowest number of alcohol-related \nhighway deaths ever recorded in the State. The campaign has also \nexpanded from its original half-year scope to become a year-round \ninitiative. Under Chief Capriglione's leadership, the New Castle County \nDUI Task Force has established checkpoints during major holidays and \nother events typically associated with higher rates of impaired \ndriving, including Super Bowl Sunday and St. Patrick's Day. During the \nrecent Cinco de Mayo holiday, the county teams conducted checkpoints \nthat resulted in 19 DUI arrests, as well as 7 drug arrests, 8 felony \narrests, and the apprehension of 3 wanted individuals.\n  Chief Michael Capriglione has been instrumental in the development \nand success of the Checkpoint Strikeforce Campaign in Delaware. Through \nhis exceptional leadership and commitment to public service, Delaware's \nroadways have become safer and its citizens more secure. He is the \nembodiment of public service and deserves all of the recognition he has \nreceived for his remarkable efforts, and more. We are fortunate to have \ncommitted, effective law enforcement professionals such as Chief \nCapriglione working to combat the problem of drunken driving throughout \nDelaware and the Nation, and I ask the Senate to join me in thanking \nChief Capriglione for his dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5774-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL DANIEL JAMES III, USAF\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor LTG Daniel \nJames III who recently retired as Director, Air National Guard. To say \nthat General James has had a distinguished career at the National Guard \nBureau would be an understatement due to his unmatched success in \nformulating, developing, and coordinating all policies, plans, and \nprograms affecting more than 106,000 Guard members throughout the \nUnited States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the \nVirgin Islands.\n  The general personifies the model commander with a career in the \nmilitary that spanned almost four decades. He earned his commission as \na distinguished graduate of the University of Arizona's ROTC program in \n1968. The general is a command pilot with approximately 4,000 hours in \nfighter and trainer aircraft. A combat veteran with two Distinguished \nFlying Crosses, General James completed two Active-Duty tours in \nSoutheast Asia, logging 500 combat hours as a forward air controller \nand F-4 Phantom aircraft commander. Prior to becoming ANG Director, \nGeneral James was the Adjutant General for Texas National Guard \nheadquarters. In June of 2002, he was appointed to the position as \nDirector, Air National Guard.\n  In closing, I ask my fellow colleagues to join me in expressing our \ndeep appreciation for the numerous contributions Lieutenant General \nJames has made on behalf of our brave service men and women. It is my \nhonor to recognize the general for his distinguished service to our \nNation. Recalling our national anthem, to our veterans and Armed \nForces, I say, we would not be ``the land of the free'' if we were not \nalso ``the home of the brave.'' We wish Daniel and his family continued \nsuccess as he closes out his service to the Air Force and the people of \nthis grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5774-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5774-S5775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JACK BANDY\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish today to honor in the \nRecord of the Senate my friend, B. Jackson Bandy, a great Georgian, a \ngreat American, and a great citizen of Whitfield County. I honor Jack \nupon his induction into the Junior Achievement Northwest Georgia \nBusiness Hall of Fame.\n  Junior Achievement was founded in Dalton, GA, in 1964 and sends \nvolunteers from the community into local schools to teach students \nabout business, economics, and personal finance. Each year the local \ndistrict serves more than 8,900 students in 44 schools, including more \nthan 30 schools in Whitfield and Murray Counties. The district has more \nthan 300 volunteers. Nominees from this community for this award were \nselected based on business excellence, inspiring leadership, community \ninvolvement, and innovation.\n  In addition, Jack was one of three founders in 1956 of the tufted \ncarpet business Coronet Industries, which was eventually bought by \nBeaulieu. But Jack is more than just a businessman\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\nand great golfer. He is a family man--a wonderful and devoted father \nand grandfather. He would do anything for his family and friends and \nhas touched the lives of many who will never be able to meet or thank \nhim.\n  Jack worked for many years as a volunteer on the Hamilton Healthcare \nSystem Board of Trustees in Dalton and is now an honorary trustee. For \nall of his charitable giving and hard work, the hospital named the \n``Bandy Parking Plaza'' in honor of Jack. He is the backbone of his \nMethodist Church and has worked on the board of the United Way. With \nhis Junior Achievement honor, it is clear that Jack is devoted to \neducating young people at all levels, but he has also endowed the Bandy \nChair in Preaching at Emory University, and the gym at Dalton State \nCollege is named for him.\n  Jack Bandy is a class act who is well loved in work and at home. He \nis interested in the lives and achievements in others and will be \nembarrassed that I am honoring him today. But I feel I would be remiss \nif I did not honor him for his achievements and sacrifices. He has \ngiven a great deal of his time and money to make Dalton, the State of \nGeorgia, and our Nation a better place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5775-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF CHELSEA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 100th \nanniversary of the founding of the town of Chelsea, SD. Chelsea is a \nrural community in Faulk County. Small towns like Chelsea are part of \nthe backbone of our wonderful State.\n  Chelsea originally began in the middle of a wheat field, where \nextensions of the Minneapolis and St. Louis railways met. There are \ncompeting stories for how the town was named. One says that Chelsea was \nnamed after the borough of London, one that it was named for a \nlandowner in Chelsea, OK, and another that says it was named for \nsomeone from Chelsea, MA.\n  The first building to go up in Chelsea was two-story poolhall and \nsaloon, built by H.E. Batteen. Other businesses soon followed. By 1909, \nthere were 30 businesses in Chelsea, including a post office, weekly \npaper, bank, butcher, lumber yard, and drug store. There were at least \nthree churches, including the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, which is \nstill active today.\n  The area in which Chelsea is situated has both fertile farmland and \nexcellent fishing and hunting. In particular, the area is known for its \ngreat pheasant shooting and the numerous hunting lodges that dot the \nlandscape around Chelsea.\n  Small communities such as Chelsea do not always get the attention \nthat they deserve, but it is places like Chelsea that help to maintain \nSouth Dakota's agricultural roots and deep-seated character. I am proud \nto honor Chelsea on its 100th anniversary, and I am confident that the \nnext 100 years will bring still more progress and prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5775-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF ABERDEEN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n125th anniversary of the founding of one of South Dakota's great \ncities, Aberdeen. Aberdeen is the third largest city in the State, and \nthe county seat of Brown County. Aberdeen boasts a robust economy, \nfirst-rate hospital, two 4-year universities, art, culture, shopping, \nand outdoor recreation. Taken all together, Aberdeen has an exceptional \nquality of life, and things are only getting better for this dynamic \ncity.\n  Aberdeen was founded in July of 1881 with the arrival of the \nMilwaukee Railroad and takes its name from the home town of the \nMilwaukee Railroad's Scottish President, Alexander Mitchell. As more \nrailroads came into the area, Aberdeen became known as the ``Hub \nCity,'' referring to its role as a busy intersection for trainlines. \nAberdeen's citizens are justly proud of their city's history, and they \nhave undertaken numerous successful projects designed to preserve and \ncelebrate this heritage. The city's many historic attractions include \nthe Granary Rural Cultural Center, Dacotah Prairie Museum, and J.L. \nZeitlow Telephone Pioneer Museum, among others. In addition, Aberdeen \nis home to and promotes a lively and renowned antique market.\n  Perhaps Aberdeen's most famous early resident was Lyman ``Frank'' \nBaum, who would eventually write ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'' During \nhis time in Aberdeen, Baum owned a store, Baum's Bazaar and later \nedited The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer. Many believe that Baum's \ndescription of Kansas in ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ``was based on \nhis time in Aberdeen. Storybook Land, a theme park based on ``The \nWonderful Wizard of Oz,'' commemorates Baum.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of the city of Mellette, SD.\n  Mellette was incorporated into South Dakota in 1881, with the first \nstore opening the same year. The community was named after Arthur \nMellette, the first governor of South Dakota. By 1882, Mellette was a \nthriving town with 39 businesses including doctors, lawyers, and other \nprofessionals. The Western Enterprise was the first newspaper in \nMellette, and by the time publication ended in 1941, the newspaper was \nthe oldest, continuous paper in Spink County.\n  Today, Mellette is the home of 240 residents, 8 businesses, churches, \nand other civic organizations. The Mellette Volunteer Fire Department, \nestablished in 1895, still keeps residents safe. Northwestern \nElementary, Middle, and High Schools also call Mellette home.\n  I am pleased to announce that Mellette celebrated its 125th \nanniversary with a community celebration on May 26 to 27. There were \nnumerous events, such as karaoke, a flea market, a parade, an antique \ntractor pull, a horseshoe tournament, kid's games, and a Harley \nmotorcycle raffle, followed by a community supper. A historical display \nincluded ``Old Time'' Mellette videos. The festivities were a fitting \ncelebration to honor a wonderful community.\n  I am proud to publicly honor Mellette on this memorable occasion. \nAfter 125 years, Mellette still exemplifies what it means to be a great \nSouth Dakota community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5775-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5775-S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF GROTON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the city of \nGroton, SD, and to recognize the 125th anniversary of its founding.\n  Groton was founded in 1881 in Brown County. Still standing from those \nearly days is Trinity Episcopal Church which was built in 1884 as a \nplace for the newly formed town to come together and gather as a \ncommunity. Groton now has six churches and multiple gathering places to \nhouse its growing and thriving community.\n  Groton is home to the Granary Rural Cultural Center. Groton's \ncommitment to fine arts and culture shines through in this \nestablishment where art shows from artists from both North and South \nDakota are on display. The Granary Rural Cultural Center not only \npromotes the arts, but also the heritage of those living in the Dakotas \nwhile celebrating and caring for the land.\n  One of the most notable pieces of Groton's history took place in 1923 \nwhen $1,000 was stolen from the First\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\nNational Bank, while the tellers were held at gunpoint. During the \nholdup, one brave citizen ran outside to ring the alarm alerting the \nauthorities of the situation. Fortunately, only minor injuries were \ninflicted in the ordeal.\n  Groton will be celebrating its 125th anniversary with a variety of \nevents. Among the festivities will be an all-school reunion, Legion \nbaseball, pancake breakfast, water carnival, bingo, tractor pull, \nparade, dance, fireworks display, and community church service. The \nanniversary will serve as an occasion to bring this close-knit \ncommunity even closer together.\n  I am proud to publicly recognize Groton and congratulate the \ncommunity on this achievement. As the people of Groton take this \nopportunity to appreciate how far the city has come from its \nbeginnings, I know they will understand the important role Groton plays \nin making South Dakota the great State that it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5776-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CENTENNIAL OF THE FOUNDING OF BRENTFORD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I rise in order to pay \ntribute to the centennial of the founding of the city of Brentford, SD. \nThe community is distinguished as the only ``Brentford'' in the United \nStates.\n  Brentford was established in 1906 along the Minneapolis and St. Louis \nRailroad line and named by a railroad employee for Brentford, England. \nThe town was built in less that a year and reached a peak population of \naround 300, with a current population around 70.\n  There are a church, gas station, restaurant, and two construction \ncompanies located in Brentford. Additionally, the Brentford Volunteer \nFire Department serves Brentford City, Tetonka, and LaPrairie \ntownships, and part of Clifton Township.\n  I am pleased to announce that Brentford will be celebrating its \ncentennial on June 23 through 25. There are numerous events scheduled, \nincluding a parade, performances by Brentford area musicians, \nfireworks, a paintball tournament, and an antique tractor pull. This \ncelebration is a fitting way to recognize this milestone for this \npleasant and progressive community.\n  One hundred years after its founding, Brentford continues to be a \nvital community and a great asset to South Dakota. I am proud to honor \nthe achievements of Brentford on this memorable occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5776-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING KENNETH BLACK OF MAINE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the grand \nopening of the Maine Discovery Center and dedication of the Chief \nWarrant Officer Kenneth Black Exhibition Hall in Rockland, ME. This \nevent represents the culmination of a lifetime of exceptional \nachievement by former Coastguardsman Kenneth Black who nearly single-\nhandedly amassed the largest collection of lighthouse lenses on display \nin a museum anywhere in the United States.\n  The monumental efforts of Ken Black, known by many as ``Mr. \nLighthouse,'' have been a lifelong pursuit and truly a labor of love. \nKen started his first exhibit many years ago at the base of America's \nfirst light Station in Boston Harbor. When he was commanding officer of \nthe Rockland Coast Guard Station in the 1970s, he created a display of \nartifacts at the entryway building at the base of the tower, and a \nsmall collection started to grow and take on a life of its own. So much \nso--that when the admiral in charge of the first Coast Guard district \nin Boston took note of what Ken was doing, he named him as the official \ncurator of the First Coast Guard District Marine Exhibit. That \nappointment offered Ken a fortuitous opportunity to begin amassing \nlighthouse artifacts.\n  Exemplifying the best of Maine's can-do spirit, Ken meticulously went \nto great lengths, literally piece by piece, to seek out, collect, and \nstore these maritime marvels. Eventually, this collection would be \nhoused in what would become known as the Shore Village Museum. Lacking \npretense of any kind, this unassuming, home-spun dream became a \nlandmark museum and a destination point for maritime and lighthouse \nenthusiasts everywhere until its closing in 2004.\n  Because of Ken's persistent pursuit and uncommon initiative, his \nlegacy of work can now be viewed as part of the Maine Lighthouse Museum \nwhich has the distinction of being home not just to the world-renown \nlighthouse lenses but also to one of the most revered exhibits of \nlighthouse artifacts and Coast Guard memorabilia in the United States. \nOne thing is clear above all else, we owe Ken a great debt of gratitude \nfor having the unrelenting industry, foresight, and diligence to \ncollect, preserve, and showcase these artifacts.\n  As the sponsor of the Maine Lights Program in the 104th Congress, I \nam extraordinarily proud of the indispensable contribution Ken has made \nto the discipline of lighthouse history. As I said in my letter on the \nopening of the Maine Lighthouse Museum last June, this legislation \nallowed many outstanding individuals and organizations to share their \nfondness for lighthouses by working to record the history of \nlighthouses and keep that history alive. And, indeed, that is precisely \nwhat has happened.\n  Through the tireless and indomitable work of Kenneth Black, for whom \nthis exhibition hall is rightfully named, generations today and to come \nwill have the pleasure of viewing these time-honored artifacts. I saw \nthem firsthand last summer when I toured the museum and was awed and \nextremely impressed, and I know that this new addition will be equally \nremarkable. For all of these reasons, I am deeply pleased to honor the \nastounding contributions that Ken has made toward bringing to greater \nlight these valuable gems of history. I also want to acknowledge and \nthank the many individuals and groups who have shared in Ken's vision \nand joined with him in making this dream a reality. The city of \nRockland and the State of Maine are incredibly fortunate to have this \nexceptional Lighthouse Museum in its midst. It is most fitting that the \nU.S. Coast Guard presented a well-deserved lifetime achievement award \nto Ken Black for unflagging vigilance and continued perseverance in \nsaving and presenting these lighthouse artifacts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5776-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO R. GERALD DAVIDSON\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a \nremarkable Missourian. The First Baptist Church of Arnold, MO, has \nannounced the retirement of its longtime and much beloved pastor, R. \nGerald Davidson. Dr. Davidson has served as a pastor for the last 50 \nyears, the last thirty of which, he has dedicated to the First Baptist \nChurch of Arnold.\n  Dr. Gerald Davidson is a visionary leader and has been instrumental \nin furthering and directing the ministry of the church. Today, the \nFirst Baptist Church of Arnold is the third largest church in the \nMissouri Southern Baptist Convention. Dr. Davidson's personal \ndedication to the gospel has never faltered, and his own personal \nexample has set the standard for both his church members and Baptist \nleadership throughout the Nation.\n  In fact, Dr. Davidson's vision and his good works have reached \nthroughout the world. On numerous mission trips he has preached the \ngospel in Mexico, Haiti, Jamaica, South Africa, Taiwan, Brazil, \nIndonesia, Russia, Romania, Belarus, Slovenia, Croatia, Bolivia, India, \nTurkey, United Arab Emirates, and Kenya.\n  However, Dr. Davidson's dedication starts at home. He has been \nmarried to his wife Verlena Stone Davidson for 51 years. She has been \nan equal partner in the ministry, serving side by side with her \nhusband. The Davidson's have three children, Doug, Debbie, Darla, and \nare blessed with 10 grandchildren.\n  Dr. Davidson's many accomplishments throughout his distinguished \ncareer are a result of hard work and dedication. The Arnold community \njoins me in appreciating Dr. Davidson's dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5776-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5776-S5777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION FOR MURDO, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to strengthen performance management in the Federal \nGovernment, to make the annual general pay increase for Federal \nemployees contingent on performance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nWorkforce Performance Appraisal and Management Improvement Act. Before \nI describe for my colleagues the details of this legislation, I would \nlike to provide background on why I believe it is important for \nCongress to consider legislation reforming the performance appraisal \nprocesses of the government.\n  My interest in the federal workforce began after working with the \nFederal Government for 18 years as an outside force, 10 years as mayor \nof Cleveland and 8 years as Governor of Ohio. Through my work as \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the \nFederal Workforce and the District of Columbia, I continue to observe \nthat investing in personnel and workforce management; in fact, \nmanagement in general, struggles to be a priority in the Federal \nGovernment. My own experience as county auditor, county commissioner, \nmayor, and governor has taught me that, of all the things in which \ngovernment can invest, resources dedicated to human capital bring the \ngreatest return.\n  I continue to applaud the current administration for its systematic \napproach to improving and scrutinizing the management practices of the \nFederal Government through the President's Management Agenda and its \nrelated scorecard. Each year, the administration raises the bar as to \nwhat earns an agency a green, or successful, rating. One of the \ncriteria used to evaluate a department or agency for strategic \nmanagement of human capital this year is demonstrating a strong \nperformance appraisal system for the Senior Executive Service, agency \nmanagers, and 60 percent of the workforce.\n  I believe that an effective performance management system is \nfundamental to building a results-oriented organization. By developing \na system where employees have regular discussions with their \nsupervisors about expectations for their performance, both employees \nand supervisors will be more effective in achieving their agency's \nmission. The primary goal of the Federal Workforce Performance \nAppraisal and Management Improvement Act of 2006 is to build and \nmaintain this environment.\n  This legislation would strengthen and improve the employee \nperformance appraisal system, which now is vague in its requirements. \nWhile some organizations have taken steps to modernize their \nperformance management systems and tools such as the President's \nManagement Agenda have moved agencies in that direction, there is no \ncomprehensive governmentwide mandate to do so. This legislation would \nbegin the reform process by layering a modern performance management \nsystem over the existing General Schedule system.\n  This legislation would require that every Federal employee receive \nannually a written performance appraisal. That appraisal must align \nwith the agency's strategic goals, be developed with the employee, make \nmeaningful distinctions among employee performance, and use the results \nin making decisions for training, rewarding, promoting, reassigning, \nand removing employees.\n  This legislation would require the Office of Personnel Management to \nprovide technical assistance to agencies and approve the system. The \ngovernment must utilize the Office of Personnel Management's \ninstitutional expertise.\n  This legislation would require that managers receive the appropriate \ntraining to judge the performance of their subordinates, make \nexpectations clear to employees, and give constructive feedback.\n  This legislation would stipulate that if an employee does not achieve \na successful rating under the new appraisal system, then that employee \nwould be ineligible for the annual pay increase or a within grade \nincrease.\n  This legislation would provide individuals hired as senior level or \nsenior technical to access level II of the Executive Schedule with an \nOPM certified performance appraisal system, consistent with statute for \nthe Senior Executive Service.\n  I am introducing this legislation because I believe that employees \nshould receive a rigorous evaluation each year and that their pay \nshould be determined based upon their performance. I agree with the \nobservation that has been made repeatedly by Comptroller General David \nWalker, that the passage of time should not be the single most \nimportant factor in determining an employee's pay. Instead, it should \nbe determined by productivity, effectiveness, and contributions of that \nemployee.\n  I have implemented pay for performance before, and it can work. \nHowever,\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\nit requires a significant commitment on behalf of managers and leaders. \nInstead of taking one giant bite at the apple, I believe it will be \neasier for Federal agencies to implement enhanced employee appraisals \nfirst. By instituting a more rigorous performance management standard \non top of the current general schedule, I am optimistic this will \ncreate less anxiety among Federal employees.\n  I also would like to stress that I intend this effort to be \ncompletely bipartisan. The proposal I have outlined here today is not \nset in stone, and I imagine that it will undergo many changes.\n  I would like to transform the culture of the Federal workforce into a \nhigh-performing, continually improving organization that focuses on \nachieving results for the American people. The Federal workforce must \nbe as agile, nimble, and intellectually energetic as the leading \nnongovernmental organizations or dot-com companies, capable of \naddressing the wide ranging challenges facing the U.S., from national \nsecurity to global economic competitiveness to providing vital social \nservices.\n  We must discuss the challenges before us and ask if the rules and \nculture of today's Federal workforce get the job done. We must engage \nin a dialogue about the future of the public service and ask the \ndifficult questions about what we want it to achieve and how do we make \nit happen. This conversation will make many people uncomfortable, but \nit must take place. For as all of us who work on Federal workforce \nissues know, there is great disagreement about the types of reforms and \nchanges that should be made going forward. We must ask, what should the \nFederal workforce be doing for America to meet the challenges of the \n21st century? Once we have answered that question, we can begin to \ndiscuss how we build that workforce.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3492\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of \nVietnam; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I introduce with Senator Gordon \nSmith a bill to grant Vietnam permanent normal trade relations status.\n  Thirty-one years ago, the lights went out on the relationship between \nthe United States and Vietnam. Diplomatic relations were broken off, \nand trade ceased. The story between our two countries became one of \nrefugees, prisoners of war, and soldiers missing in action. Hostility \nand mistrust prevailed. Normalization was a dream of the visionary or \nthe fool.\n  In 1991--16 years after the last helicopters took off from the roof \nof the U.S. Embassy in Saigon--flickers of reconciliation emerged out \nof the darkness. In April of that year, President George H.W. Bush \npresented the Vietnamese government with a roadmap for normalization. \nThat started a process of healing that lasted through successive \nRepublican and Democratic administrations and was supported by \ncourageous bipartisan action in the Congress: Between 1991 and 1993, \nveterans Senator John Kerry, Senator McCain, and former Senator Bob \nSmith led the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in the most \nexhaustive investigation of the status of POWs and MIAs ever conducted. \nIn Feberuary of 1994, President Bill Clinton lifted the trade embargo \non Vietnam. 17 months later, in July of 1995, he announced the \nnormalization of political relations with Vietnam. In July of 2000, the \nUnited States and Vietnam concluded a comprehensive Bilateral Trade \nAgreement, allowing the United States to provide, for the first time, \nnondiscriminatory treatment to Vietnam's products. And just last month, \nthe United States and Vietnam signed another trade agreement, paving \nthe way for Vietnam's accession to the World Trade Organization.\n  Today, we continue the legacy of reconciliation.\n  This morning, Senator Smith and I--along with Senators McCain, Kerry, \nHagel, Lugar, Murkowski, and Carper--introduced a bill to grant Vietnam \nPermanent Normal Trade Relations status, or PNTR. I congratulate \nRepresentatives Ramstad and Thompson for introducing the House version \nof this bill.\n  This is the final step on the road to normalization. With this bill, \nwe will complete the process begun 15 years ago.\n  Today, we open a new book to the future.\n  With 83 million people and a median age just over 25 years old, \nVietnam is one of the most important emerging markets in Asia. Our \ntrade with Vietnam has grown to 30 times what it was in 1994.\n  With PNTR, we begin the story of full engagement between the United \nStates and Vietnam. It is a story of economic cooperation and cultural \nunderstanding. It is a story where trade and markets overshadow \nmemories of guns and war.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate and House colleagues, the \nadministration, and all interested parties to pass this historic bill \nby the August recess.\n  I ask that a copy of the text of the bill be printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3495\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In July 1995, President Bill Clinton announced the \n     formal normalization of diplomatic relations between the \n     United States and Vietnam.\n       (2) Vietnam has taken cooperative steps with the United \n     States under the United States Joint POW/MIA Accounting \n     Command (formerly the Joint Task Force-Full Accounting) \n     established in 1992 by President George H. W. Bush to provide \n     the fullest possible accounting of MIA and POW cases.\n       (3) In 2000, the United States and Vietnam concluded a \n     bilateral trade agreement that included commitments on goods, \n     services, intellectual property rights, and investment. The \n     agreement was approved by joint resolution enacted pursuant \n     to section 405(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2435(c)), and entered into force in December 2001.\n       (4) Since 2001, normal trade relations treatment has \n     consistently been extended to Vietnam pursuant to title IV of \n     the Trade Act of 1974.\n       (5) Vietnam has undertaken significant market-based \n     economic reforms, including the reduction of government \n     subsidies, tariffs and nontariff barriers, and extensive \n     legal reform. These measures have dramatically improved \n     Vietnam's business and investment climate.\n       (6) Vietnam is in the process of acceding to the World \n     Trade Organization. On May 31, 2006, the United States and \n     Vietnam signed a comprehensive bilateral agreement providing \n     greater market access for goods and services and other trade \n     liberalizing commitments as part of the World Trade \n     Organization accession process.\n\n     SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE IV OF THE TRADE \n                   ACT OF 1974 TO VIETNAM.\n\n       (a) Presidential Determinations and Extension of Non-\n     Discriminatory Treatment.--Notwithstanding any provision of \n     title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.), \n     the President may--\n       (1) determine that such title should no longer apply to \n     Vietnam; and\n       (2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with \n     respect to Vietnam, proclaim the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations \n     treatment) to the products of that country.\n       (b) Termination of the Applicability of Title IV.--On and \n     after the effective date of the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of Vietnam under \n     subsection (a), title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 shall cease \n     to apply to that country.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to join the Senator from Montana, \nMr. Baucus, in offering legislation that would grant Vietnam permanent \nnormalized trade relations treatment and help to pave the way for \nVietnam's accession to the World Trade Organization. I am proud to also \nbe joined in this effort by Senators McCain, Kerry, Hagel, Lugar, \nMurkowski, and Carper.\n  Last December, I was privileged to lead a delegation of U.S. Senators \nto Vietnam. During our visit, we met with President Luong and other \nVietnamese officials to discuss the importance of our bilateral \nrelationship and the need to get a good market access agreement between \nthe United States and Vietnam that will help cement that relationship.\n  I congratulate Ambassadors Rob Portman and Susan Schwab and the USTR \nteam for their work to get this agreement. This is a great achievement.\n  Over the last decade, our relationship with Vietnam has been \ncharacterized by increased cooperation and engagement. The passage of \nour legislation will enhance those ties and create new economic \nopportunities for U.S. businesses.\n\n[[Page S5786]]\n\n  In recent years, Vietnam has undertaken a number of market-based \neconomic reforms, including the reduction of government subsidies, \ntariffs, and non-tariff barriers, and extensive legal reforms. These \nreforms have spurred dramatic economic growth. Vietnam is now the \nfastest growing economy in Southeast Asia and a growing market for U.S. \nexporters.\n  In 2000, the United States and Vietnam concluded a bilateral trade \nagreement. Since that agreement entered into force, U.S. exports to \nVietnam have increased by 150 percent. Last year alone, U.S. exports to \nVietnam rose by 24 percent.\n  The recently negotiated market access agreement will build upon that \nsuccess by further lowering trade barriers to a wide range of U.S. \nindustrial and agricultural products and services. Upon Vietnam's \naccession to the WTO, U.S. businesses will enjoy greater access to a \nmarket of more than 83 million people.\n  Agricultural producers will benefit from immediate tariff reductions \non U.S. exports as well as new commitments by Vietnam to improve \nimplementation of sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Oregon growers \nwill benefit as tariffs on apples and pears are cut from 40 percent to \n10 percent over the next 5 years and tariffs on frozen French fries are \nreduced from 50 percent to 13 percent over the next 6 years.\n  Oregon manufacturing and branding companies have long had a presence \nin Vietnam. These companies will immediately benefit from increased \nmarket access and greater regulatory transparency.\n  Having Vietnam within the rules-based global trading system will be \ngood for U.S. businesses. This accession agreement will be key to \nensuring that Vietnam follows global trade rules.\n  It will also ensure that the Vietnamese people will be able to \nrealize the benefits of trade liberalization. By increasing \ntransparency and implementing market-based reforms, Vietnam is \nessentially opening itself to international commerce. Countries that \nopen themselves to trade attract investment, which in turn creates jobs \nand enhances individual welfare.\n  The passage of PNTR legislation will mark the final step toward \nnormalizing our relationship with Vietnam. This bill represents a \nhistoric moment in our relationship with Vietnam and a definitive \nstatement of how we have moved beyond our past divisions.\n  I am especially pleased with the strong bipartisan support that we \nhave received for this bill. I am hopeful that we will be able to move \nthis bill before Congress leaves for the August recess, so that it can \nbe signed into law before President Bush's visit to Vietnam in \nNovember.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCAIN):\n  S. 3497. A bill to provide for the exchange of certain Bureau of Land \nManagement land in Pima County, Arizona, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain to introduce the Las Cienegas Enhancement Act of 2006. This \nlegislation directs a land exchange between the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the Las Cienegas Conservation, LLC. in southeastern \nArizona. The bill is the product of consensus. State and local \nofficials, conservationists, and other stakeholders have worked \ntogether to structure an exchange that is fair and in the public \ninterest.\n  Let me explain the details of the exchange. The land to be \ntransferred out of Federal ownership, approximately 1,280 acres, is \nreferred to as the ``Sahuarita property.'' This property is BLM-managed \nland south of Tucson near Corona de Tucson. The land is low-lying \nSonoran desert and has been identified for disposal by the BLM through \nits land-use planning process.\n  The private land to be brought into Federal ownership is \napproximately 2,392 acres of land referred to as the ``Empirita-\nSimonson property.'' This property lies north of the Las Cienegas \nNational Conservation Area managed by the BLM. The Empirita-Simonson \nproperty lies within the ``Sonoita Valley Acquisition Planning \nDistrict'' established by Public Law 106-538, which designated the Las \nCienegas National Conservation Area. The act directed the Department of \nthe Interior to acquire lands from willing sellers within the planning \ndistrict for inclusion within the conservation area to further protect \nthe important resource values for which the area was designated.\n  Although this bill is centered on the land exchange I just described, \nit also accomplishes two other important objectives: addressing water \nwithdrawals at Ciengas Creek and providing road access to a popular \nrecreation destination, the Whetstone Mountains controlled by the \nForest Service.\n  Let's talk about water. Arizonans understand that protecting our \nwater supply is crucial to the State's future. For this reason, when we \ncan, we look for ways to promote responsible use of our limited water \nsupply. This bill is one of those examples of responsible use. There is \na prior claim to a well site on the private land that will be \nexchanged. That prior claim would allow the developer to withdraw 1,600 \nacre feet of water a year. Pima County and the community at large are \nconcerned about the future of Ciengas Creek and the entire riparian \narea if these water withdrawals occur.\n  To address this concern, the land exchange is conditioned on Las \nCienegas Conservation Inc. conveying the well site to Pima County and \nrelinquishing those water rights it controls. The net result is a water \nsavings of 1,050 acre-feet per year. This is a significant benefit to \nthis riparian area.\n  Overall, this bill allows us to accomplish important environmental \nand conservation objectives while managing our development. It is a \nbill with broad support that includes the Governor of Arizona, Pima \nCounty, the city of Tucson, and many others. I urge my colleagues to \nwork with me to approve this legislation at the earliest possible date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Cornyn, \n        Mr. Brownback, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Burns, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. \n        Allen):\n  S. 3499. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect \nyouth from exploitation by adults using the Internet, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Internet SAFETY \nAct of 2006. The word ``SAFETY'' in the bill's title stands for Stop \nAdults Facilitating the Exploitation of Youth. It is a fairly \ndescriptive acronym, for the provisions of the Internet SAFETY Act are \ndesigned to crack down on the spread of Internet child pornography and \nrelated conduct. The act does so by creating new Federal offenses and \ncauses of action targeted at those who produce or knowingly facilitate \nInternet child pornography, by increasing penalties for child \npornography, sex trafficking, and sexual abuse offenses, and by \nincreasing resources available for prosecution and prevention of child \nsexual-abuse offenses, including authorizing 200 new assistant U.S. \nattorneys across the country to prosecute child pornography and sexual \nexploitation crimes.\n  The need for renewed law-enforcement attention to child pornography \nis demonstrated in a recent report of the U.S. Justice Department \ntitled ``Project Safe Childhood.'' I will ask to have an extended \nexcerpt from the report printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. As the report notes, ``judging simply by [recent] crime \nstatistics, it is clear that the Internet is helping to fuel an \nepidemic of child pornography'' in this country. Unfortunately, by \nproviding greater technical ease and increased anonymity in trading \nimages, the Internet has ``taken down barriers that one time served as \na deterrent to child pornographers.'' In 2003, an estimated 20,000 \nimages of child pornography were posted on the Internet every week. \nBetween 1998 and 2004, child pornography reports made to the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children increased from 3,267 to \n106,119--a thirty-fold increase over a 6-year period. The Justice \nDepartment also notes that there has been an escalation in the severity \nof abuse depicted in child pornography in recent years, ``with the \nimages found today more frequently involving younger children--\nincluding toddlers and even infants--and despicable acts such as \npenetration of infants.'' The Project Safe Childhood report concludes \nthat ``the nation should be alarmed at the fact that child pornography \nis being produced,\n\n[[Page S5787]]\n\npossessed, and distributed in record numbers.'' As the report notes, \nchild pornography's harm extends beyond that done to the children who \nare sexually abused to produce such images: ``child pornography [also] \nplays a central role in child molestations, serving to justify \noffenders' conduct, assist them in gaining compliance with their \nvictims, and to provide a means to blackmail the children they have \nmolested in order to prevent exposure.''\n  The Internet SAFETY Act does the following things. It creates a new \nFederal offense, punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison, for \nfinancially facilitating access to child pornography on the Internet. \nThe act also deters Internet facilitation of child pornography by \nimposing civil penalties for Internet communications providers that \nfail to report child pornography, criminal penalties for Web site \noperators who insert words or images into source code with the intent \nto deceive persons into viewing obscene material on the Internet, and \nby requiring commercial Web site operators to place warning marks \nprescribed by the Federal Trade Commission on Web pages that contain \nsexually explicit material.\n  The Internet SAFETY Act also punishes the operation of child \npornography enterprises. It creates a new Federal offense, punishable \nby a minimum of 10 years in prison, for the operation of an enterprise \nthat profits from the sexual exploitation of children. The act also \nimposes mandatory, consecutive 10 year sentences for any child \npornography or exploitation offense committed by a registered sex \noffender. In addition, the act increases penalties for offenses \ninvolving child pornography, child prostitution and sex trafficking, \nchild sexual abuse, and sexual assault.\n  The Internet SAFETY Act also expands the Federal private right of \naction against child pornographers. It allows a victim, including \nparents of a minor victim, to seek civil remedies, and also allows a \nvictim to seek remedies as an adult. This provision is inspired by a \nyoung girl named Masha who was adopted from Russia by a man who \nrepeatedly molested her, photographed her, and posted pornographic \nimages of her on the Internet. In addition, the act adds the obscenity \nand child pornography statutes to the RICO predicates and adds \nelectronic mail fraud to the wiretap predicates.\n  The Internet SAFETY Act also establishes within the Justice \nDepartment an Office on Sexual Violence and Crimes Against Children to \ncoordinate sex offender registration and notification programs and \ngrant programs, and to assist State, local, and tribal governments and \nother entities with sex offender registration or notification and other \nmeasures.\n  Finally, the act authorizes and directs the Attorney General to make \ngrants to States, local governments, Indian tribes, and nonprofit \norganizations for child sexual abuse prevention programs. In addition, \nthe act authorizes appropriations for 200 additional child exploitation \nprosecutors in U.S. Attorneys' Offices around the country and 20 \nadditional Internet Crimes Against Children task forces.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following passages from the Justice \nDepartment's report Project Safe Childhood be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n Project Safe Childhood--Protecting Children From Online Exploitation \n                               and Abuse\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       The Internet and other communications technologies are \n     increasingly used by sexual predators and abusers as tools \n     for exploiting and victimizing our children. First, these \n     technologies have contributed to a significant increase in \n     the proliferation and severity of child pornography. They \n     provide pornographers with an easily accessible and seemingly \n     anonymous means for collecting large number of images of \n     child sexual abuse. Eventually, some predators turn to \n     producing their own images. The result has been that images \n     of child sexual abuse today are more disturbing, more \n     graphic, and more sadistic than ever before, and they involve \n     younger and younger children. Second, as the Internet and \n     related technologies have grown, children have become \n     increasingly at risk of being sexually solicited online by \n     predators. Law enforcement is uncovering an escalating number \n     of ``enticement'' cases, where perpetrators contact children \n     in chat rooms or through instant messaging and arrange to \n     meet at a designated location for the purpose of making \n     sexual contact.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n    Part II. The Need for a national initiative to protect children\n\n       Two types of dangers to children are especially \n     problematic. First, the threat of sexual predators contacting \n     children online, with the hope of luring them to meet in \n     person, has been amply demonstrated by academic studies as \n     well as recent investigative journalism reports. A Youth \n     Internet Safety Survey conducted between August 1999 and \n     January 2000 found that approximately one in five children \n     per year receives an unwanted sexual solicitation online. One \n     in thirty-three children per year receives an aggressive \n     sexual solicitation--i.e., one in which a solicitor asks to \n     meet them somewhere, calls them on the telephone, or sends \n     mail, money, or gifts. And one in four per year has an \n     unwanted exposure to sexually explicit material. Meanwhile, \n     only 25 percent of the youth who encountered a sexual \n     solicitation told a parent. Only a fraction of all episodes \n     were reported to authorities, such as a law enforcement \n     agency, an Internet service provider, or a hotline. According \n     to a recent media report, at any given time, 50,000 predators \n     are on the Internet prowling for children. These figures make \n     clear that the threat of online enticement of children is \n     immense.\n       Second, the victimization of children through the \n     production and distribution of child pornography is equally \n     troubling, and on the rise. It was estimated, even in 2003, \n     that more than 20,000 images of child pornography are posted \n     on the Internet each week. NCMEC's CyberTipline logged a 39 \n     percent increase in reports of the possession, creation, or \n     distribution of child pornography in 2004. The gravity of \n     these increases is more dramatically demonstrated by \n     comparing the actual number of reports in 1998 to those \n     logged in 2004, rather than merely reciting percentage \n     increases. In 1998, the CyberTipline received 3,267 \n     reports of child pornography. In 2004, the CyberTipline \n     received 106,119 of these reports, marking more than a 30-\n     fold increase in child pornography reports in a six year \n     period. Judging simply by crime statistics, it is clear \n     that the Internet is helping to fuel an epidemic of child \n     pornography.\n       Not only is there an increase in the volume of pornographic \n     images, there is also an escalation in the severity of the \n     abuse depicted, with the images found today more frequently \n     involving younger children-including toddlers and even \n     infants-and despicable acts such as penetration of infants. \n     And technology lends itself to the dissemination of more \n     graphic images via the web, with its easy access, low cost, \n     and apparent anonymity.\n       Experts agree that the escalation in both the prevalence \n     and severity of child pornography is driven at least in part \n     by advances in computer technology and increased access to \n     the Internet. According to a recent study, 78.6 percent of \n     Americans go online, and almost two-thirds of Americans use \n     the Internet at home. While it is impossible to determine \n     exactly how many people are looking at child pornography, \n     experts attribute the escalation in the quantity of child \n     pornography being created and distributed to the growth of \n     the Internet, and the concomitant ease with which child \n     predators can now buy, sell, and swap images. The resulting \n     sense of community among child predators is in turn helping \n     to embolden those who may have had misgivings about a sexual \n     interest in children, and it is thus driving a market for new \n     images with fresh faces. Before the Internet, it was \n     difficult and risky for child exploiters to go out and find \n     other child exploiters with whom to share images, which left \n     the child pornography industry relegated to small black \n     markets in underground bookstores or secret mailings. Today, \n     the Internet has provided these pedophiles with an \n     accessible, convenient, and anonymous means for interacting \n     with their community and obtaining illicit material. The \n     Internet has thus taken down borders that at one time served \n     as a deterrent to child pornographers.\n\n\n     THESE ESCALATING TRENDS PRESENT A SERIOUS RISK TO OUR SOCIETY\n\n       The harm caused by enticement offenses is beyond question. \n     Sexual abuse is a serious crime that deeply affects any \n     victim, especially children, and it has dramatic secondary \n     effects on our society. The looming danger of our children \n     being preyed upon by pedophiles in chat rooms or through \n     social networking sites is, in short, among the gravest \n     threats facing children today.\n       The impact of child pornography on victims, and on society \n     as a whole, is far less appreciated today than the threat of \n     enticement offenses. Child pornography images are not just \n     pictures, akin to any number of other images legally \n     available on the Internet. Most images of child pornography \n     depict victims--children--who have been exploited and abused. \n     These images are permanent visual records of child sexual \n     abuse. For this reason, the very term commonly used to \n     describe these terrible images--``child pornography''--does \n     not adequately convey the horrors these images depict. A more \n     accurate term would be ``images of child sexual \n     abuse,'' because the very production of the images \n     necessarily involves the sexual abuse of a child. And the \n     child is re-victimized each time they are viewed.\n       The nation should be alarmed at the fact that child \n     pornography is being produced, possessed, and distributed in \n     record numbers.\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\n     According to a 2005 study entitled ``Child-Pornography \n     Possessors Arrested in Internet-Related Crimes: Findings from \n     the National Juvenile Online Victimization Study,'' which \n     studied defendants arrested and charged with possession of \n     child pornography between July 2000 and June 2001:\n       More than 80 percent of arrested [child pornography] \n     possessors had images of prepubescent children, and 80 \n     percent had images of minors being sexually penetrated. \n     Approximately 1 in 5 (21 percent) arrested [ child \n     pornography] possessors had images of children enduring \n     bondage, sadistic sex, and other sexual violence. More than 1 \n     in 3 (39 percent) [child pornography] possessors had videos \n     depicting child pornography with motion and sound.\n       Although their identities are often unknown, many of the \n     children in these graphic images were sexually victimized and \n     assaulted. Those who possess these pictures--for sexual \n     gratification, curiosity, as a means of profit, or for other \n     reasons--are adding to the burdens of these young victims, \n     whose trauma may be increased by knowing their pictures are \n     circulating globally on the Internet with no hope of \n     permanent removal or could be entered into circulation in the \n     future.\n       Child pornography victimizes children in a very real and \n     dramatic way. Of course, no child can consent to being \n     sexually exploited through the production of sexually-\n     explicit images. Each time the image is viewed or \n     distributed, the child is again victimized. ``[N]o mere words \n     could ever truly describe the daily torture of victims who \n     were forced to participate in child pornography years ago and \n     now, as adults, see images of themselves `performing' on the \n     Internet. In addition to the obvious physical injuries that a \n     child can suffer due to sexual abuse, the emotional and \n     psychological trauma is devastating, and lasting. Many child \n     victims suffer from depression, withdrawal, anger, and other \n     conditions that often continue into adulthood. They \n     experience feelings of guilt and responsibility for the \n     abuse, a sense of powerlessness and feelings of \n     worthlessness.\n       Thus, for the sole fact of the victimization and damage \n     that child pornography visits upon children, possession of \n     child pornography is a heinous crime that must be stamped \n     out. But that is only half of the story of the pernicious \n     effect of child pornography. Possession of child pornography \n     is a serious crime for four additional reasons, each of which \n     is described more fully below:\n       1. The exchange of child pornography by and between child \n     exploiters validates and encourages them in their beliefs and \n     behaviors;\n       2. The greater availability of child pornography has led to \n     the production, receipt, and distribution of more shocking, \n     graphic images, which are increasingly involving younger \n     children and infants;\n       3. The compulsion to collect child pornography images may \n     lead to a compulsion to molest children, or may be indicative \n     of a propensity to molest children; and\n       4. Child pornography is frequently used by molesters as an \n     affirmative tool, either to silence their victims, to \n     blackmail them into further exploitation, or to entice other \n     children.\n\n\n                      Validation and Encouragement\n\n       Use of the Internet by child pornographers to exchange \n     images and communications regarding those images provides \n     positive reinforcement for them in their beliefs and \n     behaviors, encouraging further exploitation of children. One \n     study of offenders revealed that exploiters' relationships \n     with other offenders, forged online, ``legitimize[d] and \n     normalize[d] their interests'' in their own minds. In short, \n     the process of collecting and trading child pornography bonds \n     the offenders together, and having an extensive child \n     pornography collection heightens an offender's status within \n     this community. The incentives to abuse children, capture the \n     abuse, and share the images are strong, allowing the producer \n     a way into the community and a means for obtaining yet more \n     images of abuse from other producers or distributors. Child \n     pornography is used as a means of establishing trust and \n     camaraderie amongst child exploiters and molesters, as proof \n     of good intentions when initiating contacts with one another. \n     It is, in part, for these reasons that offenders are \n     frequently found with thousands of images.\n       In considering this factor, one can see the important role \n     that the Internet has played in the growth of the child \n     pornography market. Before the Internet, child exploiters \n     were isolated. Without knowing that others like them existed, \n     pedophilia or a sexual interest in children was a shameful \n     secret. Through the Internet, however, persons who desire to \n     exploit children get to know that others like them exist, \n     they share their preferences and their child pornography, and \n     they no longer feel abnormal. The child exploiter sees in the \n     Internet a way of validating his behavior: he is able to \n     convince himself that his behavior or obsession is not \n     abnormal, but is in fact shared by thousands of other \n     people who, in the predator's mind, are sensitive, \n     intelligent, and caring people.\n\n\n                     MORE SHOCKING, GRAPHIC IMAGES\n\n       A more distressing trend is that, as pedophiles collect \n     more and more images of child sexual abuse, they become de-\n     sensitized to the horrors contained within their existing \n     collections, and they seek gratification through novel and \n     yet more disturbing images. The only way that this demand can \n     be met is through a supply of new images involving more \n     horrific images of I hands-on sexual abuse than that already \n     present in the person's collection of images. The result has \n     been a rise in demand for pornographic images of younger \n     children, including babies and toddlers. Twenty percent of \n     the images seized depicting sexual exploitation of children \n     involved images of babies and two- and three-year-olds. And, \n     disturbingly, the abuse is getting worse, with the depictions \n     being more sadistic than ever.\n\n\n           INCREASED COMPULSION/PROPENSITY TO MOLEST CHILDREN\n\n       As an offender's interest in children draws him to the \n     child pornography market, his compulsion to view and collect \n     images may become entwined with, or lead to, a compulsion to \n     molest children. A study conducted by Ethel Quayle and Max \n     Taylor revealed that the subject's access to child \n     pornography ``intensified his levels of sexual arousal and \n     behavior and fueled his desire to engage in a relationship \n     with a child.'' The subject progressed from viewing images, \n     to entering chat rooms, to attempting to meet children \n     offline.\n       Several factors other than mere sexual perversion may cause \n     the tendency of child pornography collectors to begin to \n     molest children. For instance, a collector's desire for novel \n     and more graphic images could provide an incentive simply to \n     produce the images himself, and computer technology today \n     makes it easier to create the images and distribute them. In \n     addition, collectors often feel that they have to produce new \n     images because, in order to continue trading for new images, \n     they have to offer up their own new images as part of the \n     rules of some child pornography communities.\n       Empirical studies support the proposition that individuals \n     who view child pornography are often also child molesters. \n     According to a study completed in 2000 by Dr. Andres E. \n     Hernandez, Director of the Sex Offender Treatment Program at \n     the Butner Federal Correctional Complex in North Carolina, \n     79.6% of 54 offenders convicted of child pornography offenses \n     admitted that they had molested significant numbers of \n     children without detection. On average, the offenders had \n     26.37 child sex victims and admitted to over 1,424 contact \n     sexual crimes. Of these 1,400+ contact sexual crimes, only 53 \n     were detected or known about and taken into account at \n     sentencing.\n       Consistent with these studies, a 1986 Report of the U.S. \n     Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Child \n     Pornography and Pedophilia stated: ``No single characteristic \n     of pedophilia is more pervasive than the obsession with child \n     pornography. The fascination of pedophiles with child \n     pornography and child abuse has been documented in many \n     studies and has been established by hundreds of sexually \n     explicit materials involving children.''\n       Although the U.S. Senate Subcommittee found no direct \n     evidence of causality--i.e., that possession of child \n     pornography causes people to commit child sex offenses--it \n     did conclude that child pornography plays a central role in \n     child molestations, ``serving to justify [the offender's] \n     conduct, assist them in seducing their victims and provide a \n     means to blackmail the children they have molested in order \n     to prevent exposure.'' In a 2005 study of child pornography \n     possessors arrested in Internet-related crimes, the reviewers \n     concluded that ``one out of six [child pornography] \n     possession cases beginning with an investigation of or \n     allegation about [child pornography] possession discovered a \n     dual offender who had also sexually victimized a child or \n     attempted to do so.''\n       According to Raymond Smith, Assistant Inspector-in-Charge \n     of the Special Investigations Division and the manager of \n     USPIS's Child Exploitation Program, the USPIS began in 1997 \n     compiling statistical information on the number of child \n     pornography suspects arrested by U.S. Postal Inspectors that \n     were also child molesters. Additionally, the USPIS began to \n     collect data on the number of child victims identified and \n     rescued from further sexual abuse as a result of \n     investigations conducted by Postal Inspectors. Since 1997, \n     802 child molesters were identified and stopped, and 1,048 \n     victimized children were rescued. According to Smith, of the \n     more than 2,400 individuals arrested since 1997 for using the \n     U.S. Mail and the Internet to sexually exploit children, \n     child molesters were identified in one out of every three \n     cases.\n\n\n                     AFFIRMATIVE TOOLS OF MOLESTERS\n\n       Not only do images of child pornography record horrific \n     abuse and victimization of children, but they often are also \n     used as affirmative tools by the abusers. Abusers frequently \n     use such pornography to lower another child's inhibitions \n     with images that appear to show the victim enjoying the abuse \n     or to validate sex between children and adults as normal. \n     Moreover, offenders use the images to blackmail the victim \n     into silence or into performing further acts of abuse, \n     threatening to release the images to parents, peers, or \n     others if the victim talks or does not allow further \n     exploitation. Such blackmailing even can be aimed at forcing \n     kids into prostitution and the child trafficking trade.\n       Child pornography plays a central role in child \n     molestations, serving to justify offenders' conduct, to \n     assist them in gaining compliance from their victims, and to \n     provide a means to blackmail the children they have molested \n     in order to prevent exposure. Consequently, child pornography \n     does not simply involve abuse of the individual child victim \n     whose image is created; it is also used\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\n     affirmatively to perpetuate the sexual exploitation of the \n     same child or other children.\n       Child and adult pornography is frequently used by child \n     exploiters to lure children into physical sex acts. After a \n     child molester befriends a child and gains the child's trust, \n     he will expose the child to pornography to persuade the child \n     that the behavior is normal and acceptable, and to coax him \n     or her into participation. The Sexually Exploited Child Unit \n     of the Los Angeles Police Department conducted a ten year \n     study and found that adult and child pornography was \n     reportedly used in over 87% of all their child molestation \n     cases. Child pornography is therefore not just a tool for \n     perpetuating more (and more graphic) child pornography--it is \n     also a tool for exploiters to gain opportunities to exploit \n     and molest even more children.\n\n\n                             A CALL TO ARMs\n\n       The measures taken to this point have not served to \n     dramatically lessen the number of incidents of child \n     exploitation. Indeed, all of the evidence leads to the \n     conclusion that the exploitation of children is a burgeoning \n     problem. The explosion in the production and trafficking of \n     child pornography, in particular, represents nothing short of \n     an epidemic confronting our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Roberts, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Burns, \n        Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Thune, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. \n        Murkowski and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 3500. A bill to amend title VIII of the Social Security Act to \nprotect and preserve access of Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas to \nhealth care providers under the Medicare program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe Rural Hospital and Provider Equity, R-HoPE, Act of 2006 with \nSenator Conrad, Senator Harkin, Senator Roberts, and fellow Senate \nRural Health Caucus members Senators Collins, Dayton, Salazar, Burns, \nDomenici, Dorgan, Thune, Johnson, Ben Nelson, and Murkowski. As always, \nit is important to note that rural health care legislation has a long \nhistory of bipartisan collaboration and cooperation.\n  The 108th Congress reaped unparalleled successes in terms of rural \nhealth care legislation. When Congress enacted the Medicare \nModernization Act, MMA, it included a comprehensive health care package \nspecifically tailored with rural communities, hospitals, and providers \nin mind. This was the largest rural provider payment package ever \nconsidered by Congress.\n  As Republican cochairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, I was \nproud to help lead the effort to put rural providers on a level playing \nfield with their urban neighbors. We enacted commonsense Medicare \npayment equity provisions critical to maintaining access to quality \nhealth care in isolated and underserved areas. Rural America achieved a \nsignificant victory, and we have much to celebrate. However, our \nmission is not complete. Several of the MMA's rural health provisions \nhave expired, or are set to expire this year. That is why I have \nintroduced the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act--to finish the \nwork we started 3 years ago.\n  This legislation not only reauthorizes expiring rural MMA provisions \nbut also takes additional steps to address inequities in the Medicare \npayment system that continually place rural providers at a \ndisadvantage. My bill recognizes the unique needs of rural hospitals \nand levels the playing field between rural and urban providers.\n  Rural hospitals are more dependent on Medicare payments as part of \ntheir total revenue. In fact, Medicare accounts for almost 70 percent \nof total revenue for small, rural hospitals. Rural hospitals have lower \npatient volumes, but must compete nationally to recruit providers due \nto the nursing--and other health professional--workforce shortages. \nAdditional burdens are placed on rural hospitals and providers because \nof higher uninsured and underinsured rates in rural America. Also, \nseniors living in rural areas tend to be poorer and have more chronic \nconditions than their urban and suburban counterparts.\n  First, the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act recognizes the \nspecial circumstances rural hospitals face and addresses these issues \nby equalizing Medicare disproportionate share hospital, DSH, payments. \nThese add-on payments help hospitals cover the costs of serving a high \nproportion of low-income and uninsured patients. Current law allows \nurban facilities to receive unlimited add-ons corresponding with the \namount of patients served. However, small or rural hospital add-on \npayments are capped at 12 percent. This measure eliminates the rural \nhospital cap, bringing their payments in line with the benefits urban \nfacilities receive.\n  Second, the bill recognizes that low-volume hospitals have a higher \ncost per case which results in negative operating margins. To alleviate \nthis problem, we established a low-volume inpatient payment adjustment \nfor hospitals that have less than 2000 annual discharges per year and \nare located more than 15 miles from another hospital. This provision \nwill improve payments for approximately one-third of all rural \nhospitals.\n  In addition to these Medicare payment reforms, this legislation \nstrengthens the over 3,000 rural health clinics that serve many rural \nAmericans. Under current law, rural health clinics receive an all-\ninclusive payment rate that is capped at approximately $63. This \npayment has not been adjusted--except for inflation--since 1988. To \nrecognize the rising costs of health care, this bill raises the rural \nhealth clinic cap to $82, making it comparable to the rate Community \nHealth Centers receive. By caring for folks in underserved areas, rural \nhealth clinics and community health centers are a key component of the \nrural health care delivery system. As not every small town can sustain \na hospital, we need to ensure these types of facilities are paid \nadequately and are provided enough flexibility to meet the health care \nneeds of the communities they serve.\n  Home health care agencies are another critical element of the \ncontinuum of care in rural areas. These providers face unique \ncircumstances in the distances they are required to travel to provide \nservices. The current Medicare payment system does not make adequate \nadjustments to reflect the reality of rural and frontier health care. \nThis bill recognizes the situation these providers face by ensuring \ntheir Medicare payments cover their costs to provide Medicare services.\n  As you all may know, there are approximately 1,165 hospitals \nnationwide that have converted to critical access hospital, CAH, \nstatus. This program was created in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to \nensure folks in small, rural communities would have access to 24-hour \nemergency services as well as some hospital care in their hometowns. \nFifty-two percent of my State's hospitals have downsized to Critical \nAccess Hospital status. The measure I have introduced contains several \nprovisions to strengthen this important rural hospital program.\n  The Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act will also ensure rural \nareas can maintain access to important emergency medical services, EMS. \nRural EMS providers are primarily volunteers who have difficulty \nrecruiting, retaining, and educating EMS personnel. Rural EMS providers \nalso have less capital to buy and upgrade essential, lifesaving \nequipment. The legislation will assist ambulance providers in \ncollecting payments for transporting patients to the hospital after \nanswering a 911 call regardless of the final diagnosis. This is a \ncommonsense approach and ensures that all aspects of emergency care are \noperating under the same definition of emergency.\n  It is important for the Federal Government to remember that one \npayment system does not fit all.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Thomas \nin introducing the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act, or R-HoPE. \nThis\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\nproposal will help shore up health care in rural areas and give rural \nAmericans hope that health care will be available when they need it.\n  R-HoPE is the next step in addressing the inequities that exist in \nMedicare reimbursement and ensuring access to health services, like \nambulance, mental health and home health care, in rural communities. \nThe proposal has strong bipartisan support. In fact we're pleased to \nhave over 12 cosponsors today from both sides of the aisle.\n  Our proposal also has broad support among provider groups including \nthe National Rural Health Association, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the American Ambulance Association, Federation of American \nHospitals, the National Association of Rural Health Clinics, National \nAssociation for Home Care and Hospice, and the American Academy of \nNurse Practitioners.\n  As my colleagues know, prior to the Medicare Modernization Act, \nMedicare was shortchanging rural providers. Our reimbursement was \nsignificantly less than our urban counterparts. For example, Mercy \nHospital in Devil's Lake North Dakota received half as much \nreimbursement for treating pneumonia as Mercy Hospital in New York City \ndid. While I will be the first to admit that health care can be more \nexpensive in urban areas, it certainly isn't twice the cost. And for \nthat matter, rural hospitals don't get a ``rural discount'' when they \ngo to buy supplies or new technology. It costs rural hospitals even \nmore to purchase technology and supplies because they can't achieve the \neconomies of scale that larger, more urban hospitals can.\n  The MMA recognized this disparity in reimbursement and took steps to \nclose the gap. We secured over $25 billion for rural health care, but \nmost of the changes were only temporary. Even with the MMA funding, \nmany rural hospitals and providers continue to experience negative \nmargins. In 2003, before the MMA passed, rural hospitals had overall \nMedicare margins of negative 5.4 percent--compared to negative 0.9 \npercent for urban providers. In its March 2006 report, the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission projected that rural hospitals would \nexperience negative 4.5-percent margins this year. Facilities cannot \ncontinue to provide high quality services if they lose over 4 percent \non every Medicare patient.\n  R-HoPE will help continue the progress made by the MMA and add new \nprovisions that will protect access to rural health care.\n  First, it will help ensure that everyone who chooses to live in a \nrural community has a hospital nearby. For example, the proposal \nrecognizes that rural facilities can't achieve the same economies of \nscale as large hospitals by giving extra payments to hospitals with \nfewer than 2,000 patients a year. R-HoPE also reinstates provisions \nthat protect rural hospitals against losses under the current \noutpatient payment system. Next, the bill extends an MMA provision that \nhas helped rural hospitals to better meet their labor costs by \nimproving their ``wage index'' calculation. In addition, the proposal \nwould close the gap in payments hospitals receive for serving low-\nincome patients by giving the same level of special ``disproportionate \nshare payments'' that urban areas enjoy. Lastly, the bill establishes a \nnew loan program to help rural hospitals repair crumbling buildings.\n  Second, R-HoPE would guarantee that rural Americans can see a doctor \nwhen they are sick. As is the case with most rural States, much of \nNorth Dakota is designated as a health professional shortage area, \nHPSA. Recruiting doctors to these areas is very difficult, and the \nMedicare program recognized that extra payments are needed when it \nestablished the 10-percent physician scarcity payment for doctors who \nserve Medicare patients in HPSAs. R-HoPE would extend these vital bonus \npayments. Our proposal also extends a provision from the MMA that \nerases geographic inequities in physician payments.\n  Third, our bill would guarantee that when there is an emergency in a \nrural area, an ambulance is there to respond. Many rural ambulance \nservices are closing because of low Medicare reimbursement. These \nservices are often staffed by volunteers; few first responders are \npaid. R-HoPE would protect rural ambulance services by improving how \nMedicare pays EMS providers in rural areas. The bill also extends a 2-\npercent bonus payment for rural ambulance services and takes steps to \nreduce the number of wrongful denials of payment by Medicare \ncontractors.\n  Fourth, R-HoPE helps to bolster a vital rural health care safety net \nprovider, rural health clinics. Our bill would help preserve this \nimportant source of health care by increasing the all-inclusive payment \nfrom $63 to $82. In addition, our bill encourages rural health clinics \nto collaborate with community health centers to provide care in rural \nareas.\n  Fifth, R-HoPE takes a number of steps to protect the availability of \nhome and mental health in rural areas by increasing the number of \nproviders who are allowed to order and provide these vital services. It \nalso extends the rural add-on payment for home health services provided \nin rural areas and creates a pilot project to use home monitoring \ntechnology to provide home health services.\n  This bill also removes barriers to telehealth. Specifically, the bill \nwould address problems that arise when telehealth services are provided \nacross State lines and payment is denied because the practitioner isn't \nlicensed in the State where the patient resides.\n  Finally, the bill we are introducing includes two small changes to \nthe critical access hospital, CAH, program that will put these \nfacilities on a much sounder financial footing. These provisions would \nensure CAHs could afford to provide quality ambulance care and receive \nfair reimbursement for lab services provided outside the hospital.\n  Rural America is the backbone of this country. We must not turn our \nbacks on rural Americans and their health care needs. They have a right \nto the same quality health care enjoyed by other Americans. And that \nright is being threatened by low Medicare reimbursement and limited \naccess to providers. R-HoPE truly gives hope to those living in rural \ncommunities by erasing the inequities in current law that impede access \nto care.\n  I want to thank my Senate colleagues who have joined in this effort, \nas well as the organizations who worked with us, for their cooperation \nin developing this important health care proposal. It is my hope that \nthis legislation will help strengthen our rural health care system and \npreserve it for generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 3501. A bill to amend the Shivwits Band of the Paiute Indian Tribe \nof Utah Water Rights Settlement Act to establish an acquisition fund \nfor the water rights and habitat acquisition program; to the Committee \non Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend the Shivwits Band of Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Water Rights \nSettlement Act 2000 in order to bring that settlement to an orderly \nconclusion. That act ratified a negotiated settlement of the Shivwits \nBand of Paiute Indian Tribe's water entitlement to flow from the Santa \nClara River in Utah. The Department of the Interior requested the \namendment and provided technical assistance in crafting the \nlegislation.\n  As part of section 10, Water Rights Settlement, of the Shivwits \nSettlement Act a water rights and habitat acquisition program was \nauthorized. Congress authorized $3.0 million to be appropriated to \nimplement section 10. However, when the Department of the Interior \nattempted to implement the provision in section 10, which was intended \nto maintain the $3.0 million in an interest bearing account, the \nTreasury Department advised that the language in section 10 was \ninsufficient for this purpose. The Treasury Department and Department \nof the Interior developed technical correction language to address this \ndeficiency in the settlement act by amending the statutory language for \nthe establishment of the acquisition fund and investment of the \nacquisition fund.\n  The bill I am introducing today will allow the Shivwits Band water \nrights and habitat acquisition program authorized under section 10 of \nthe settlement act to move forward. This legislation is supported by \nthe Department of the Interior and will fully implement the Shivwits \nBand of Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Water Settlement Act of 2000. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S5795]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3501\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modernize the education system of the United \nStates, to arm individuals with 21st century knowledge and skills in \norder to preserve the economic and national security of the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, American families face great challenges \nin dealing with the rapidly changing global economy. The value of their \nwages is declining, the cost of living is going up, and many jobs are \nmoving overseas. More and more Americans feel the American dream is \nslowly slipping out of reach.\n  We can and must deal more effectively with this problem. We have a \nresponsibility to make the investments that are necessary to our \nprogress--a responsibility to our families, to our economy, to our \nNation, and even to our national security.\n  We can guarantee America's continuing prosperity in the future, but \nwe must work for it. We must sacrifice for it. The rest of the world is \nplaying for keeps. We cannot just tinker at the margins if we expect to \ncontinue to be a leader in this rapidly shrinking world.\n  We must ensure that our citizens can achieve the American dream once \nagain. To do so, our highest priority must be a world class education \nfor every American. We must make the American employee and employer the \nbest educated, best trained, and most capable in the world. We need to \nstrengthen the capacities of every person in the Nation.\n  This isn't just my opinion. In recent years, study after study has \nemphasized education as the solution to keeping America competitive in \nthe years to come.\n  Last year, the Council on Competitiveness urged a focus on lifelong \nskill development--through elementary, secondary and higher education, \nand through training and workforce support, as essential to keeping \nAmerica on the cutting edge of innovation.\n  A recent National Academy of Sciences report contains these \nrecommendations. Two of the report's four major recommendations state \nthat education is the solution to meeting the global challenge.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers has also issued a report \nurging a renewed focus on education and training to keep American \nbusinesses competitive.\n  Other industrialized countries are embracing education as the key to \ncompeting in this new economy, but America is slipping behind. We rank \n28th out of 40 nations in math education. We were 3rd in the world in \n1975 in the production of new scientists and engineers, but now we rank \n15th. By 2008, 6 million U.S. jobs will go unfilled because our \nworkforce will not be qualified to fill them.\n  These shortcomings threaten both our economic security and our \nnational security.\n  The last time America was shocked into realizing we were unacceptably \nbehind in math and science was in 1957, when the Soviet Union launched \nSputnik. To meet that crisis, Republican President Eisenhower worked \nclosely with a Democratic Congress to pass the National Defense \nEducation Act. The new law declared a national ``education emergency,'' \nand we doubled the Federal investment in education virtually overnight.\n  Today I join with my colleagues, Senator Clinton and Senator Kerry, \nto introduce a new National Defense Education Act for our own day and \ngeneration.\n  To respond to this major challenge, we must ensure our education \nstandards are internationally competitive, so that our high school \ngraduates can succeed in the new economy. We must make a commitment to \nall students--regardless of the studies they choose to pursue--that \ncost will not be a barrier to a college degree. We must strengthen math \nand science education in this country by making college free for \nstudents training to become math or science teachers in high need \nschools.\n  Our New National Defense Education Act responds to each of these \nimperatives. It modernizes our education system and equips Americans \nwith 21st century knowledge and skills.\n  It provides incentives and resources for schools to develop and \nimplement more rigorous standards in math, science and reading.\n  The legislation updates the Nation's report card--the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress--to ensure that it sets a national \nbenchmark which is internationally competitive and is aligned with the \ndemands of the 21st century global economy. It expands our ability to \nmonitor science achievement. It requires the NAEP to measure student \npreparedness to enter college, the 21st century workforce, or the armed \nservices. It also requires the Secretary of Education to examine \nthe gaps in student performance on State-level assessments and NAEP \nassessments, and to assist States in understanding those gaps. It \nprovides critical resources to states to create PreK-16 Preparedness \nCouncils to help them with their efforts to improve state standards and \nensure that they are aligned with the expectations of colleges, \nemployers, and the Armed Services. It also provides funding to States \nworking in collaboration to establish common standards and assessments.\n  The New NDEA also directs resources to high need schools, to enable \nthem to invest in math, science, engineering and technology textbooks \nand laboratories, and give their students equal\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\naccess to a curriculum that will provide the skills they need to be \nsuccessful in the 21st century global economy.\n  The legislation recognizes the critical role of the National Science \nFoundation in ensuring our children have access to cutting-edge science \nand technology programs, by doubling the investment in elementary, \nsecondary, and postsecondary education programs at NSF.\n  The New NDEA also helps open the doors of college to all by creating \nthe Contract for Educational Opportunity grant program, or ``CEO \nGrants,'' which guarantee students that if they work hard and are \nadmitted to college, their financial need will be met through \nadditional State and Federal financial aid.\n  The legislation also offers additional grants to make college tuition \nfree for low- and middle-income students studying science, technology, \nengineering or math, as well as critical-need foreign languages.\n  The bill provides larger grants to students studying to become \nteachers in these fields who agree to work in a high poverty school for \nat least 4 years. It also provides teachers with tax credits, increased \nloan forgiveness and additional incentives to continue to teach where \nthey are needed the most. It provides grants to institutions of higher \neducation to develop innovative programs for recruiting and training \nnew teachers, and invests in teacher training programs to support their \ncontinuing education.\n  The bill recognizes that it is increasingly important for students to \nbe exposed to other languages and cultures. In recent years, foreign \nlanguage needs have significantly increased throughout the public and \nprivate sector because of the wider range of security threats, the \nemergence of new nation states, and the globalization of the U.S. \neconomy. American businesses increasingly need employees experienced in \nforeign languages and international cultures to manage a culturally \ndiverse workforce.\n  The New NDEA responds to these needs by providing grants for \nelementary and secondary critical-need language programs, summer \ninstitutes to improve teachers' knowledge and instruction of foreign \nlanguages and international content, and study abroad and foreign \nlanguage study opportunities for high school students, and \nundergraduate and graduate students.\n  The New NDEA also continues to invest in our current workforce. The \nbill builds on existing formula funds for job training with competitive \ngrants to support innovative strategies to meet emerging labor market \nneeds.\n  From our earliest days as a nation, education has been the engine of \nthe American dream. Our country is home to the greatest universities in \nthe world, and our education system has produced the world's leading \nteachers, scientists, writers, musicians, and inventors. We cannot let \nthese achievements stall. Slogans are not enough. We have to put first \nthings first, and give children, parents, schools, communities and \nstates the support they need to refuel the amazing engine of education \nand keep our country great in the years ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in making this strong new commitment \nto securing our Nation's future by supporting the New National Defense \nEducation Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the New \nNational Defense Education Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3502\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``New National Defense \n     Education Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Throughout our Nation's history, the skills and \n     education of our workforce have been a major determinant of \n     the standard of living of the people of the United States.\n       (2) Spurred into action by the launch of Sputnik, Congress \n     passed the National Defense Education Act of 1958 (Public Law \n     85-864, 72 Stat. 1580). The law, now nearly 50 years old, \n     declared a national ``educational emergency'', and Federal \n     expenditures for education more than doubled in the 4 years \n     after its passage. The programs authorized under the Act \n     helped the United States to improve rapidly in mathematics, \n     science, engineering, technology, and foreign languages and \n     led to our dominance in the arms race and the global economy.\n       (3) Today, our Nation once again faces an international \n     challenge in education: we must confront a shortage of highly \n     skilled and educated workers, especially in mathematics, \n     science, engineering, technology, and critical-need foreign \n     languages. As a percentage of total first university degrees \n     granted, the United States produced fewer graduates in \n     mathematics, science, and engineering in 2002 than the Nation \n     did in 1985. Currently, the United States Government requires \n     34,000 employees with foreign language skills in 100 \n     languages across more than 80 Federal agencies. These trends \n     pose a threat to our national security and our economic \n     security.\n       (4) Student achievement in mathematics and science in \n     elementary school and secondary school lags behind other \n     nations, according to the Trends in International Mathematics \n     and Science study and other studies, including the Programme \n     for International Student Assessment, that recently ranked \n     United States secondary school students 28th out of 40 first- \n     and second-world nations, and tied with Latvia, in \n     mathematics performance and problem solving.\n       (5) According to the most recent National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress, less than 40 percent of the students in \n     grade 4 and 30 percent of the students in grade 8, and only \n     17 percent of the students in grade 12, reach the proficient \n     level in mathematics, and approximately \\1/3\\ of the students \n     in grades 4 and 8, and nearly \\1/2\\ of the students in grade \n     12, do not reach the basic level in science.\n       (6) A State-by-State comparison of the 2005 National \n     Assessment of Educational Progress average scale scores for \n     8th grade mathematics reveals that 31 States--more than \\1/2\\ \n     of the States in the Nation--scored more than 10 points \n     (about 1 grade level) below the highest scoring State, \n     Massachusetts.\n       (7) More than 200,000,000 children in China are studying \n     English, a compulsory subject for all Chinese primary school \n     students. By comparison, only about 24,000 of approximately \n     54,000,000 elementary and secondary school children in the \n     United States are studying Chinese.\n       (8) There is a significant shortage of trained and \n     qualified mathematics and science teachers in the United \n     States. According to the National Science Board, in 2002, \n     between 17 and 28 percent of public secondary school science \n     teachers (depending on the specific scientific field), and 20 \n     percent of public secondary school mathematics teachers, \n     lacked full certification in their teaching field.\n       (9) More than \\1/2\\ of the 20 fastest growing occupations \n     require postsecondary degrees in mathematics or science. \n     According to the National Science Board, out of more than \n     15,000,000 college students, less than 400,000 Americans a \n     year graduate with a bachelor's degree in mathematics, \n     science, engineering, or technology. According to the \n     National Science Foundation, only 75,000 American \n     undergraduate students obtain a master's degree in \n     mathematics, science, engineering, or technology.\n       (10) In a 2002 Government Accountability Office report, the \n     United States Army reported that it was experiencing serious \n     shortfalls of translators and interpreters in 5 of its 6 \n     critical languages: Arabic, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, \n     Persian-Farsi, and Russian. According to the Modern Language \n     Association, enrollment in foreign languages declined from 16 \n     percent of college students in 1965 to 8 percent in 1974, \n     rebounding to just 8.6 percent in 2002. Less commonly taught \n     languages accounted for only 12 percent of all language \n     enrollments. This means that 1 percent of American \n     undergraduate students are studying these critical languages.\n       (11) In 2002, 79 percent of Americans agreed that students \n     should have a study-abroad experience sometime during \n     college. Only 1 percent of all United States undergraduate \n     students studied abroad in the 2001-2002 school year.\n       (12) The Government Accountability Office estimates that \n     the number of students enrolled in science, technology, \n     engineering, or mathematics doctoral degree programs at \n     United States institutions of higher education declined from \n     217,395 during the 1995-1996 academic year to 198,504 during \n     the 2003-2004 academic year.\n       (13) The extent of this crisis requires a coordinated \n     Federal response and an increased Federal investment in \n     programs of the Department of Education and the National \n     Science Foundation.\n\n            TITLE I--MODERNIZING AMERICA'S EDUCATION SYSTEM\n\n         Subtitle A--Prekindergarten Through Grade 16 Education\n\n     SEC. 111.

A bill to prohibit the unauthorized removal or use of \npersonal information contained in a database owned, operated, or \nmaintained by the Federal government; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am introducing the Data Theft Prevention \nAct of 2006 in response to concerns that arose following the recent \ntheft of computer equipment from the home of a Department of Veterans \nAffairs employee in early May. I would like to thank my friends Senator \nSchumer, Senator Murray, and Senator Clinton for being original \ncosponsors of this legislation.\n  The stolen equipment contained personal information on as many as \n26.5 million veterans, Active Duty, National Guard and Reserve \npersonnel. These files had been downloaded from VA databases over a \nperiod of 3 years by the employee without any authorization, then taken \nout of VA and placed on personal computer equipment at the employee's \nhome.\n  I am sure my colleagues will be as alarmed as I was when I tell them \nthat this unauthorized removal of the personal information from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs was not an illegal act. In fact, I was \ntold by VA's inspector general that the employee's only misdeed was of \na recently established VA Security Guideline, which only carries the \nweight of suggested employee behavior. Despite VA's efforts to provide \ncyber security for the myriad of databases the Department controls, at \nthe time of the theft there was no policy or law in place to prevent or \ndeter an unauthorized act.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would establish Federal \npenalties for anyone, whether a government employee or government \ncontractor, who knowingly and without authorization views, uses, \ndownloads, or removes any means of identification or individually \nidentifiable health information that is in a Federal database. Although \nthe incident which triggered my present concerns occurred in VA, this \nlegislation would apply to all Federal departments and agencies. The \nlegislation would also penalize those who would use any such personal \ninformation for criminal purposes.\n  This legislation is intended to compliment existing Federal personal \ninformation security policies and to emphasize the need for all Federal \ndepartments and agencies to review existing policies and clearly lay \nout who is and isn't authorized to use, view, or download personal \ninformation.\n  This legislation would send the clear message that anyone who \nknowingly and without authorization removes personal or health \ninformation from a Federal database does so at their own risk.\n  VA Secretary Nicholson testified last week before the House \nGovernment Reform Committee that he thought that there should be \nconsideration of ``putting some kind of teeth in an enforcement \nmechanism for the compromising and careless and negligent handling of \npersonal information.'' This measure would do just that.\n  If enacted, violation of the provisions of this law could result in a \nfine of up to $100,000, imprisonment for 1 year, or both. These \npenalties are similar to those which currently apply to Internal \nRevenue Service employees who are responsible for breaches of tax \ninformation.\n  Given the potential impact to our veterans, Active Duty, National \nGuard, and Reserve personnel through identity theft and the incredible \ndisruption and costs incurred by the government from the theft of the \nVA data, it is vital that we take steps to deter any future incidents \nand hold accountable those who are responsible.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this important legislation and to \nwork with me for its prompt enactment. We must do all we can to prevent \nany further compromise of personal data in the hands of the government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be published in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3506\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 507\n\n       Whereas tens of millions of Americans have served in the \n     Armed Forces of the United States during the past century;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Americans have given their \n     lives while serving in the Armed Forces during the past \n     century;\n       Whereas the contributions and sacrifices of the men and \n     women who served in the Armed Forces have been vital in \n     maintaining the freedoms and way of life enjoyed by the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas the advent of the all-volunteer Armed Forces has \n     resulted in a sharp decline in the number of individuals and \n     families who have had any personal connection with the Armed \n     Forces;\n       Whereas this reduction in familiarity with the Armed Forces \n     has resulted in a marked decrease in the awareness by young \n     people of the nature and importance of the accomplishments of \n     those who have served in the Armed Forces, despite the \n     current educational efforts of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs and the veterans service organizations;\n       Whereas the system of civilian control of the Armed Forces \n     makes it essential that the future leaders of the Nation \n     understand the history of military action and the \n     contributions and sacrifices of those who conduct such \n     actions; and\n       Whereas, on November 2, 2005, President George W. Bush \n     issued a proclamation urging all the people of the United \n     States to observe November 6 through November 12, 2005, as \n     ``National Veterans Awareness Week'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of November 5 through November 11, \n     2006, as ``National Veterans Awareness Week''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate educational activities.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the week that includes \nVeterans' Day, corresponding this year to November 5-11, 2006, be \ndesignated as ``National Veterans Awareness Week''. This marks the \nseventh year in a row that I have introduced such a resolution, which \nhas been adopted unanimously by the Senate on all previous occasions.\n  The purpose of National Veterans Awareness Week is to serve as a \nfocus for educational programs designed to make students in elementary \nand secondary schools aware of the contributions of veterans and their \nimportance in preserving American peace and prosperity. This goal takes \non particular importance and immediacy this year as we find ourselves \nagain with uniformed men and women in harm's way in foreign lands.\n  Why do we need such an educational effort? In a sense, this action \nhas become necessary because we are victims of our own success with \nregard to the superior performance of our Armed Forces. The plain fact \nis that there are just fewer people around now who have had any \nconnection with military service. For example, as a result of \ntremendous advances in military technology and the resultant \nproductivity increases, our current armed forces now operate \neffectively with a personnel roster that is one-third less in size than \njust 15 years ago. In addition, the success of the all-volunteer \ncareer-oriented force has led to much lower turnover of personnel in \ntoday's military than in previous eras when conscription was in place. \nFinally, the number of veterans who served during previous conflicts, \nsuch as World War II, when our military was many times larger than \ntoday, is inevitably declining.\n  The net result of these changes is that the percentage of the entire \npopulation that has served in the Armed Forces is dropping rapidly, a \nchange that can be seen in all segments of society. Whereas during \nWorld War II it was extremely uncommon to find a family in America that \ndid not have one of its members on active duty, now there are numerous \nfamilies that include no military veterans at all. Even though the \nIraqi war has been prominently discussed on television and in the \nnewspapers, many of our children are much more preoccupied with the \nusual concerns of young people than with keeping up with the events of \nthe day. As a consequence, many of our youth still have little or no \nconnection with or knowledge about the important historical and ongoing \nrole of men and women who have served in the military. This omission \nseems to have persisted despite ongoing educational efforts by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and the veterans service organizations.\n  This lack of understanding about military veterans' important role in \nour society can have potentially serious repercussions. In our country, \ncivilian control of the armed forces is the key tenet of military \ngovernance. A citizenry that is oblivious to the capabilities and \nlimitations of the armed forces, and to its critical role throughout \nour history, can make decisions regarding our military involvement that \nmay have unexpected and unwanted consequences. Even more important, \ngeneral recognition of the importance of those individual character \ntraits that are essential for military success, such as patriotism, \nselflessness, sacrifice, and heroism, is vital to maintaining these key \naspects of citizenship in the Armed Forces and even throughout the \npopulation at large.\n  The failure of our children to understand why a military is \nimportant, why our society continues to depend on it for ultimate \nsurvival, and why a successful military requires integrity and \nsacrifice, will have predictable consequences as these youngsters \nbecome of voting age. Even though military service is a responsibility \nthat is no longer shared by a large segment of the population, as it \nhas been in the past, knowledge of the contributions of those who have \nserved in the Armed Forces is as important as it has ever been. To the \nextent that many of us will not have the opportunity to serve our \ncountry in uniform, we must still remain cognizant of our \nresponsibility as citizens to fulfill the obligations we owe, both \ntangible and intangible, to those who do serve and who do sacrifice on \nour behalf.\n  The importance of this issue was brought home to me several years ago \nby Samuel I. Cashdollar, who was then a 13-year-old seventh grader at \nLewes Middle School in Lewes, Delaware. Samuel won the Delaware VFW's \nYouth Essay Contest that year with a powerful presentation titled ``How \nShould We Honor America's Veterans''? Samuel's essay pointed out that \nwe have Nurses' Week, Secretaries' Week, and Teachers' Week, to rightly \nemphasize the importance of these occupations, but the contributions of \nthose in uniform tend to be overlooked. We don't want our children \ngrowing up to think that Veterans Day has simply become a synonym for a \ndepartment store sale, and we don't want to become a nation where more \nhigh school seniors recognize the name Britney Spears than the name \nDwight Eisenhower.\n  National Veterans Awareness Week complements Veterans Day by focusing \non education as well as commemoration, on the contributions of the many \nin addition to the heroism and service of the individual. National \nVeterans Awareness Week also presents an opportunity to remind \nourselves of the contributions and sacrifices of those who have served \nin peacetime as well as in conflict; both groups work unending hours \nand spend long periods away from their families under conditions of \ngreat discomfort so that we all can live in a land of freedom and \nplenty.\n  Last year, my resolution designating National Veterans Awareness Week \nwas approved in the Senate by unanimous consent. Responding to that \nresolution, President Bush issued a proclamation urging our citizenry \nto observe National Veterans Awareness Week.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndesignating October 20, 2006, as ``National Mammography Day.'' I might \nnote that I have submitted a similar resolution each year since 1993, \nand on each occasion the Senate has shown its support for the fight \nagainst breast cancer by approving the resolution.\n  Each year, as I prepare to introduce this resolution, I review the \nlatest information from the American Cancer Society about breast \ncancer. For the year 2006, it is estimated that nearly 213,000 women \nwill be diagnosed with breast cancer and nearly 41,000 women will die \nof this disease.\n  In past years, I have often commented on how gloomy these statistics \nwere. But as I review how these numbers are changing over time, I have \ncome to the realization that it is really more appropriate to be \noptimistic. The trend over time is that the number of deaths from \nbreast cancer is actually stable or falling from year to year. Early \ndetection of breast cancer continues to result in extremely favorable \noutcomes: 97 percent of women with localized breast cancer will survive \n5 years or longer. New digital techniques make the process of \nmammography much more rapid and precise than before. Government \nprograms will provide free mammograms to those who can't afford them, \nas well as Medicaid eligibility for treatment if breast cancer is \ndiagnosed. Just last year, the headline on the front page of the \nWashington Post trumpeted a major improvement in survival of patients \nwith early breast cancer following use of modern treatment regimens \ninvolving chemotherapy and hormone therapy. This year, we learned that \nnewer anti-estrogen drugs are effective in preventing breast cancer in \nhigh-risk women. Information about treatment of breast cancer with \nsurgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy has exploded, reflecting \nenormous research advances in this disease. So I am feeling quite \npositive about our battle against breast cancer. A diagnosis of breast \ncancer is not a death sentence, and I encounter long-term survivors of \nbreast cancer nearly daily.\n  In recent times, the newspapers have been filled with discussion over \nwhether the scientific evidence actually supports the conclusion that \nperiodic screening mammography saves lives. It seems that much of this \ncontroversy relates to new interpretations of old studies, and the \nrelatively few recent studies of this matter have not clarified this \nissue. Most sources seem to agree that all of the existing scientific \nstudies have some weaknesses, but it is far from clear whether the very \nlarge and truly unambiguous study needed to settle this matter \ndefinitively can ever be done.\n  So what is a woman to do? I do not claim any expertise in this highly \ntechnical area, so I rely on the experts. The American Cancer Society, \nthe National Cancer Institute, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce all continue to recommend periodic screening mammography, and I \nendorse the statements of these distinguished bodies.\n  On the other hand, I recognize that some women who examine these \nresearch studies are unconvinced of the need for periodic screening \nmammography. However, even those scientists who do not support periodic \nmammography for all women believe that it is appropriate for some \ngroups of women with particular risk factors. In agreement with these \nexperts, I encourage all women who have doubts about the usefulness of \nscreening mammography in general to discuss with their individual \nphysicians whether this test is appropriate in their specific \nsituations.\n  So my message to women is: have a periodic mammogram, or at the very \nleast discuss this option with your own physician.\n  I know that some women don't have annual mammograms because of either \nfear or forgetfulness. It is only human nature for some women to avoid \nmammograms because they are afraid of what they will find. To those who \nare fearful, I would say that if you have periodic routine mammograms, \nand the latest one comes out positive, even before you have any \nsymptoms or have found a lump on self-examination, you have reason to \nbe optimistic, not pessimistic. Such early-detected breast cancers are \nhighly treatable.\n  Then there is forgetfulness. I certainly understand how difficult it \nis to remember to do something that only comes around once each year. I \nwould suggest that this is where National Mammography Day comes in. On \nthat day, let's make sure that each woman we know picks a specific date \non which to get a mammogram each year, a date that she won't forget: a \nchild's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day her taxes are \ndue. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: pick one of \nthese dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of your child, \nyour wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise yourself to \nget a mammogram on that date every year. Do it for yourself and for the \nothers that love you and want you to be part of their lives for as long \nas possible.\n  And to those women who are reluctant to have a mammogram, I say let \nNational Mammography Day serve as a reminder to discuss this question \neach year with your physician. New scientific studies that are \npublished and new mammography techniques that are developed may affect \nyour decision on this matter from one year to the next. I encourage you \nto keep an open mind and not to feel that a decision at one point in \ntime commits you irrevocably to a particular course of action for the \nindefinite future.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight \nagainst breast cancer by cosponsoring and voting for this resolution to \ndesignate October 20, 2006, as ``National Mammography Day.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5812-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5812-S5813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 509--DESIGNATING JUNE 21, 2006, AS ``NATIONAL \n   PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL CODER DAY'', IN HONOR OF THE DEDICATION AND \n     CONTINUED SERVICE OF PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL CODERS TO THE NATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Burr) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today, along with my \ncolleagues Senator Bob Bennett and Senator Richard Burr, the National \nProfessional Medical Coder Day resolution.\n  By passing this resolution, Congress will recognize June 21, 2006, as \nNational Professional Medical Coder Day, which will help to raise \nawareness about the important work that medical coders perform and \ntheir dedication to their profession.\n  There are about 80,000 professional medical coders employed in the \nUnited States, and that number is expected to continue to grow due to \nthe increasing number of medical tests, treatments and procedures, and \nthe consequent scrutiny to provide the best quality health care in a \nmarket driven economy. Medical coders are a diverse group of women and \nmen dedicated to ``running the numbers'' of health care. They translate \nthe information that a physician documents during a patient visit into \nnumerical codes that are used for both payment and statistical \npurposes.\n  Medical coders are sentries of our Nation's health. They communicate \nregularly with physicians and other health care professionals to \nclarify diagnoses or to obtain additional information in the assignment \nof alphanumeric codes. They are knowledgeable of medical terminology, \nanatomy, physiology, and the code sets necessary to serve effectively \nin their professional role within the health care community. They are \nteam players committed to ethical and sound medical documentation and \nreimbursement practices.\n  Medical coders work in a variety of health care environments. Nearly \n40 percent of all coding jobs are in hospitals. Others work in the \noffices of physicians, nursing care facilities, outpatient care \ncenters, and home health care services. Insurance firms that offer \nhealth plans employ coders to tabulate and analyze health information. \nMedical coders in public health departments supervise data collection \nfrom health care institutions and assist in research. The Department of \nDefense policy requires accurate and prompt documentation of and coding \nof medical encounters within the Military Health System to assist \nMilitary Treatment Facility operations. The compliance plan for third-\nparty payers of the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of \nthe Inspector General acknowledges the specialized training of medical \ncoders required due to the greater legal exposure related to coding \nmedical services. Coders also stand as the front line against the \npotential fraud and abuse of the Medicare and Medicaid Programs while \nassuring that the physicians, hospitals, and clinics receive accurate \ncompensation for the services provided.\n  The abilities coders possess to collect data about diagnoses and \nprocedures figure prominently within my own interests for quality \nhealth care. Medical coders also provide us with the data we need for \nmaking tough choices in health care.\n  This resolution stems from positive citizen actions. The quest for a \nnational day of recognition began as a grassroots campaign. Over the \npast 4 years, medical coders from around the country have gathered \nsupport through a national petition and State proclamations crediting \nthe work of their coders. The Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services Michael Leavitt made Utah the very first State to honor \ncoders when, as Governor, he signed on April 15, 2003, a proclamation \ndeclaring a day of honor for coders in Utah. Since then, 28 other \nStates have signed similar proclamations. The State of Florida was the \nmost recent addition to their campaign, and medical coders continue \ntheir efforts in achieving recognition at the State level. Let us now \nrecognize their efforts as a nation.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will help advance the recognition \nof professional medical coders; and, therefore, the attention given to \ntheir commendable work. It recognizes contributions to the national \nhealth care system and it reminds us of medical coders' dedication to \nthe value of hard work in the interest of a national priority--quality \nhealth care for everyone. I applaud that contribution and am hopeful \nthat the Senate will pass this resolution marking June 21, 2006, as \nNational Medical Coder Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/13/senate-section/article/S5813-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5813-S5814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 510--DESIGNATING THE PERIOD BEGINNING ON JUNE 28, \n 2006, AND ENDING ON JULY 5, 2006, AS ``NATIONAL CLEAN BEACHES WEEK'', \n   SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF THAT WEEK, AND RECOGNIZING THE \n  CONSIDERABLE VALUE AND ROLE OF BEACHES IN THE CULTURE OF THE UNITED \n                                 STATES\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Menendez, Mr. Lott, and Mrs. Dole) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that \nwill honor June 28, 2006 through July 5, 2006 as National Clean Beaches \nWeek.\n  I want to thank my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, for \nagreeing to cosponsor this resolution with me as well as Senators \nSnowe, Lott, Menendez, and Stabenow so we as a nation can recognize the \nincredible importance beaches and coastal areas have not only for our \neconomy but our Nation's recreational, aesthetic, and environmental \nwellbeing.\n  According to data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, 85 percent of tourism revenue generated in the U.S. \ncomes from coastal areas. The Environmental Protection Agency has also \nstated that a staggering 2 billion trips are made by Americans to \nbeaches and coastal areas to fish, swim, surf, sunbathe, recreate, and \nenjoy our Nation's beautiful scenery.\n  Every year roughly 80 million people visit the Sunshine State to \nenjoy its beautiful beaches, exciting amusement parks, and wonderfully \nabundant wildlife and natural splendor.
