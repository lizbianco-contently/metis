Mr. President, today we will again consider the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. Although no rollcall votes will occur \nduring today's session, we expect amendments will be considered over \nthe course of the day.\n  In a minute, I will call up a couple of amendments on behalf of other \nSenators so that we can continue to make headway on the bill. Senators \nshould be aware that we expect the Senate to return on Monday to the \nbill, and I hope we will have several votes Monday evening to advance \nthis bill. The bill has been pending for a week, and it is time for us \nto work towards completing action on this very important bill that \naddresses funding for our troops overseas.\n  I had appealed to the body to defer and postpone most of the \nimmigration amendments--again, this is a broad category of amendments--\nbut I have not been successful in convincing colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to postpone those to a time when we can in a comprehensive \nway address immigration, a hugely important issue to America, to our \npeople, and something we all hear about as we go back to our States and \ntalk with our constituents. It is an issue we absolutely must address. \nNow is not the time because this is an emergency bill, a supplemental \nbill, and there is a time to do it later.\n  In spite of that, there are several amendments that have been brought \nforward that are pending which we will address; and in a few moments, I \nwill be laying out how we might do that.\n  Before doing that, Mr. President, I wish to comment on a separate \nissue that has to do with Sudan and what is going on in that part of \nthe world now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3717-7", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3717-S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SUDAN AID WORKER\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I have a special \ninterest in Sudan. I have spent much time there on an annual basis for \nthe last several years participating in various types of work--mission \nwork, some medical work, as well as a Senator.\n  Three weeks ago, a USAID team member working in the Darfur region of \nSudan was shot and wounded. By now, most Americans know the Darfur \nregion is a huge region, about the size of France, in the western part \nof Sudan, a vast country in and of itself.\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\n  This USAID worker was traveling in a clearly marked four-vehicle \nconvoy on a road that was considered safe and secure. The convoy was \nambushed, and the 26-year-old aid worker was shot in the face. As a \nresult of that attack, she has lost vision in her right eye and has had \nand will continue to have to undergo facial reconstruction.\n  First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers go out to this \ncourageous and compassionate young woman and to her family whom we all \nknow must be in tremendous grief. What happened is a tragedy that \ndeeply troubles us all.\n  I am informed that the shooting was not random. The attackers \nintentionally targeted the humanitarian convoy in order to intimidate \nthe world. For 2 years, the jingaweit death squads have terrorized the \npeople. With the backing of the Government, these criminals have killed \nnearly 50,000 innocent Darfur Africans.\n  A British Parliamentary report issued last month says as many as \n300,000 Sudanese may have died since the Khartoum Government started \nthe fighting 2 years ago.\n  The exact numbers, as always, are difficult to confirm. Access to \nthese areas is very limited. Khartoum simply does not want the world to \nknow what those numbers are.\n\n  It was just last August that I made a trip to the region. I was \ndenied permission by Khartoum to travel to Darfur properly. \nNevertheless, I went and spent time just to the west, in the adjacent \ncountry of Chad, and went along that Chad-Darfur border. I wanted to \nsee with my own eyes so I could come back and report, which I did, my \nobservations in a part of the world where, to my interpretation, to our \ninterpretation, there is genocide occurring.\n  We visited refugee camps on that Chad-Sudan border. We met with \nsurvivors. They told us the heartrending stories of women and girls \nbeing abused, mass rapes, land destroyed, crops destroyed, villages \nburned, water supplies actively polluted. As a product of all that, \nthere is the forced displacement, moving out of villages, out of homes \nof over 1.2 million people.\n  It is clear, as I mentioned, that what is going on--the destruction, \nthe death, the killing--is genocide. This body has said that. The \njingaweit are killing the Darfur people because they are ethnically \ndifferent and because they do not support Khartoum.\n  Since October of last year, the State Department has formally \nrecognized the conditions in Darfur as genocide. Congress has also \nacted, placing sanctions on Sudan's Government and authorizing about \n$100 million in aid.\n  This week, at a special international donors conference for Sudan, \nthe United States pledged $1.7 billion in aid over the next 2 years, \nmore than any other country. As a condition of that aid, the Khartoum \nGovernment must demonstrate that it is taking action to stop, to end, \nto terminate this killing.\n  The United States, under President Bush's leadership, has led on this \nissue from the beginning. The United States has provided over 70 \npercent of the supplies going to the survivors now in Darfur and \neastern Chad, and the United States has been providing assistance to \nthe region, indeed, for years.\n  Robert Zoellick, our Deputy Secretary of State, is currently \ntraveling in the region to observe the situation on the ground. What he \nwill see when he is there and what he will report back, I am sure, when \nhe comes back to us, no doubt, will deeply disturb him, as it did me \nand others in this body who have traveled to that region.\n  In the last Congress, I worked with a number of our colleagues--\nSenators Brownback, Feingold, Biden, Lugar, and before that, former \nSenator Helms and many others--to enact a bill called the Sudan Peace \nAct. That bill provided the framework for the peace negotiations in \nSudan between the northern and southern regions.\n  In addition, last year, we in this body voted unanimously to urge the \nSecretary of State to take appropriate actions within the United \nNations to suspend Sudan's membership on the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission.\n  While I am heartened by the aid pledges made this week by the \ninternational community, a lot more work absolutely must be done. \nGlobal pressure must be brought to bear.\n  I urge the United Nations to formally recognize the reality of the \ncrisis in Darfur. What is happening there is genocide. The Khartoum \nGovernment will not stop this killing until it is faced with stiff \ninternational pressure.\n  Every day the world fails to act, Khartoum gets closer to its \ngenocidal goal, and every day the world fails to act, it compounds its \nshame. We must not let this happen. We cannot fail the Darfur people. \nThey are pleading for our help, and, indeed, they are pleading for \ntheir lives.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3718-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Again, I \nwant to reaffirm our commitment to address immigration in the future. \nIt is a very important issue, but we will be having these three cloture \nvotes on the immigration issues I briefly outlined, and we have filed \ncloture on the underlying bill, which does allow us to stay on \namendments, germane amendments that were laid down to changing, \naltering, improving this bill as we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

INCREASED PERIOD OF CONTINUED TRICARE COVERAGE OF \n                   CHILDREN OF MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES \n                   WHO DIE WHILE SERVING ON ACTIVE DUTY FOR A \n                   PERIOD OF MORE THAN 30 DAYS.\n\n       (a) Period of Eligibility.--Section 1079(g) of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(g)''; and\n       (2) by striking the second sentence and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(2) In addition to any continuation of eligibility for \n     benefits under paragraph (1), when a member dies while on \n     active duty for a period of more than 30 days, the member's \n     dependents who are receiving benefits under a plan covered by \n     subsection (a) shall continue to be eligible for such \n     benefits during the three-year period beginning on the date \n     of the member's death, except that, in the case of such a \n     dependent who is a child of the deceased, the period of \n     continued eligibility shall be the longer of the following \n     periods beginning on such date:\n       ``(A) Three years.\n       ``(B) The period ending on the date on which the child \n     attains 21 years of age.\n       ``(C) In the case of a child of the deceased who, at 21 \n     years of age, is enrolled in a full-time course of study in a \n     secondary school or in a full-time course of study in an \n     institution of higher education approved by the administering \n     Secretary and was, at the time of the member's death, in fact \n     dependent on the member for over one-half of the child's \n     support, the period ending on the earlier of the following \n     dates:\n       ``(i) The date on which the child ceases to pursue such a \n     course of study, as determined by the administering \n     Secretary.\n       ``(ii) The date on which the child attains 23 years of age.\n       ``(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(C), a child shall \n     be treated as being enrolled in a full-time course of study \n     in an institution of higher education during any reasonable \n     period of transition between the child's completion of a \n     full-time course of study in a secondary school and the \n     commencement of an enrollment in a full-time course of study \n     in an institution of higher education, as determined by the \n     administering Secretary.\n       ``(4) No charge may be imposed for any benefits coverage \n     under this chapter that is provided for a child for a period \n     of continued eligibility under paragraph (2), or for any \n     benefits provided to such child during such period under that \n     coverage.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as of October 1, 2001, and shall apply with \n     respect to deaths occurring on or after such date.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\nDurbin, Senator Coleman, Senator Dole, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nSalazar, and Senator Corzine. This amendment is designed to improve the \nhealth care access for those children who have lost a parent on active \nmilitary duty.\n  To understand the need for this amendment, we have to look at the \ncurrent status of the law, to understand the problem, to understand why \nwe need to change it. Currently, the dependent child--children of a \ndeceased service member--will receive medical benefits under the \nTRICARE prime, for 3 years after that service member has died, at no \ncost. But following that period, the dependent child may continue to \nreceive TRICARE prime at the retiree dependent premium rate available \nto children until the age of 21, or 23 if enrolled in school. But they \nhave to pay for it.\n  Also, if a dependent child's military parent dies, that child moves \ndown on the food chain, in terms of availability of services. What that \nmeans is that if, for example, there is a doctor's appointment opening, \nan Active-Duty dependent would get preference to schedule that \nappointment over the dependent child whose parent has died in service.\n  Let me state that again. Let me make sure my colleagues understand \nme. To take one example, if there is a doctor's appointment opening and \nyour parent is alive, you get preference over a child whose parent was \nkilled in Iraq or killed in Afghanistan.\n  That is simply not fair. That is not right. I don't think any Member \nof the Senate, who really understands that, would say that is right. \nOur amendment would change that. What our amendment will do is put the \nsurviving children of service members killed in service to our country \nin the same position as if their parent would have lived and continued \nto serve in the military. It puts them in no better position, but it \nputs them in the same position. That is all this amendment does. That \nis the right thing to do.\n  What our amendment would do simply is to extend TRICARE prime to \nevery dependent child of a deceased service member at no cost--the same \nthing as if the parent would have lived--until the dependent's age of \n21, or 23 if the dependent attends college. It is the same as if the \nservice member were still alive.\n  Maintaining this level of TRICARE coverage guarantees the surviving \ndependents will continue to have access to some of the best doctors \nthis country has to offer and would receive adequate health care and \ntreatment.\n  This is the right thing to do, it is fair, and it is just. I believe \nit is what the American people, if they understood the issue, if the \nissue was explained to them, would clearly want us to do. To do any \nless for the surviving children of our service members who have been \nkilled in service to our country is simply not right.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Reserve Officers Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: The Reserve Officers Association, \n     representing 75,000 Reserve Component members, supports your \n     amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriation, SR \n     109-052, to increase the period of continued TRICARE coverage \n     of children of members of the uniformed services who die \n     while serving on active duty for a period of more than 30 \n     days.\n       The Department of Defense (DoD) has relied heavily on the \n     Guard and Reserve to provide almost half of the troop support \n     for Iraq and Afghanistan and this does not even take into \n     consideration the number of members who have volunteered for \n     duty during this time. It has been announced that this level \n     of Reserve Component support has become the norm.\n       Your bill will provide a limited entitlement, in keeping \n     with business case principles, that allows a member to serve \n     their country knowing that their family will be taken care of \n     if they give the ultimate sacrifice--their life.\n       The Active and Reserve Components, are entering into a new \n     phase of protracted warfare and we need to update our \n     outdated personnel practices to reflect this new environment. \n     Congressional support for our nation's military men and women \n     in the Guard and Reserve is and always will be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Robert A. McIntosh,\n\n     Major General (Ret), USAFR, Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Military Family\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                                   April 10, 2005.\n     Senator Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC\n       Dear Senator DeWine: The National Military Family \n     Association (NMFA) is a national nonprofit membership \n     organization whose sole focus is the military family. NMFA's \n     mission is to serve the families of the seven uniformed \n     services through education, information, and advocacy. On \n     behalf of NMFA and the families it serves, I would like to \n     thank you for introducing important amendments in The \n     Emergency Supplemental Wartime Appropriations Act, to enhance \n     benefits for survivors of those servicemembers who have made \n     the supreme sacrifice for their Nation.\n       NMFA strongly believes that all servicemembers deaths \n     should be treated equally. Servicemembers are on duty 24 \n     hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Through their \n     oath, each servicemember's commitment is the same. The \n     survivor benefit package should not create inequities by \n     awarding different benefits to families who lose a \n     servicemember in a hostile zone versus those who lose their \n     loved one in a training mission preparing for service in a \n     hostile zone. To the family, there is no difference. Your \n     amendment would extend the death gratuity increase proposed \n     by the Administration to survivors of all active duty deaths, \n     not just those that are combat related.\n       NMFA also supports the amendment you propose to extend the \n     TRICARE Prime medical benefit to any dependent child of a \n     deceased servicemember at not cost until the age of 21 or 23 \n     if enrolled in school. This is a benefit that would have been \n     available to these children had their servicemember parent \n     lived and remained on active duty. The freedom from worrying \n     about copays and deductibles when a child needs to see a \n     doctor is very important for the surviving parent.\n       Thank your for your support and interest in military \n     families. If NMFA can be of any assistance to you in other \n     areas concerning military families, please feel free to \n     contact Kathy Moakler in the Government Relations Department \n     at 703.931.6632.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Candace A. Wheeler,\n                                 Chairman/Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, one letter is from the Reserve Officers \nAssociation and one is from the National Military Family Association.\n  I wish to share an excerpt from the letter from the ROA. Regarding \nhealth care benefits, it reads in part as follows:\n\n       Your bill will provide a limited entitlement in keeping \n     with business case principles that allows a member to serve \n     their country knowing that their family will be taken care of \n     if they give the ultimate sacrifice--their life.\n\n  We owe the families of those who have lost loved ones in active duty \nour gratitude and our support. It is time to do a better job of caring \nfor these families. It is time to ensure that this Congress does what \nis right. I ask my colleagues to stand with me and with my other \ncolleagues to support these families and do our part as they have done \ntheirs.\n  As I said, I am joined in this amendment by Senators Durbin, Coleman, \nDole, Kennedy, Salazar, and Corzine. We believe this is the equitable \nthing to do, it is the fair thing to do, and it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  Again, to repeat: All it does is put this child who has lost a parent \nin Iraq, who lost a parent in Afghanistan, who has lost a parent in \nservice to our country, in the same position that child would have been \nif that parent would have continued to serve in the military and would \nhave continued to live.\n  Today, without this amendment, that child is discriminated against. \nAfter 3 years, that child has to pay for his or her own premium, that \nfamily has to pay the premium and, not only that, even if they pay the \npremium, they are put in a different position than if the parent would \nhave lived. The child of a person in the military who lives is in a \nbetter position than a child of a person in the military who is \ndeceased, and that is wrong. This amendment corrects that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set aside for the \nmoment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 342\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I now ask that my amendment No. 342 be \ncalled up.\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself, and Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Corzine, \n     Mr. Chafee, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \n     Martinez, Mr. Smith, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Mr. Obama, proposes an amendment numbered \n     342.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Con. Res. 95 \n     (108th Congress).\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nBingaman, Coleman, Nelson, Corzine, Dole, Chafee, Dodd, Durbin, \nAlexander, Martinez, Smith, Specter, Kennedy, Lautenberg, and Obama. It \nwill provide additional emergency assistance to Haiti. Unfortunately, \nthe fact is that the bill before us now contains virtually no \nadditional economic assistance to Haiti, the poorest country in our \nhemisphere.\n  Haiti today is on the brink of collapse. Elections are scheduled in \nNovember, but there is grave social unrest and horrible poverty that is \nspinning Haiti back into its previous cycles of violence and \ninstability. Haiti is our neighbor to the south, about an hour and a \nhalf plane trip from Miami. Twice in the last decade, American marines, \nAmerican troops, have had to go to Haiti.\n  There is an interim government in Haiti, a government that was \nsupported and is supported and backed by the United States and by the \ninternational community, but the situation is very precarious. That \ninterim government is scheduled to give way to a permanent government \nafter elections that are now scheduled for November of this year. There \nis an international peacekeeping force in Haiti, but there is \nsignificant violence, and the government is, quite frankly, tottering.\n  Money is needed in this emergency supplemental for emergency reasons \nin Haiti. We cannot wait for the normal appropriations process. First \nof all, money is needed for the elections. The United States will have \nto contribute toward these elections. We will have to take the lead, \nand other countries, of course, will participate, if elections are \ngoing to be held.\n  Those elections were not scheduled when the last appropriations bill \nwent through this Congress. No one could have totally foreseen what the \nexact situation would have been in Haiti when the last appropriations \nbill was approved by this Congress. The violence has continued. The \ninternational peacekeeping force has not been as aggressive as some of \nus would have liked to have seen it, and therefore violence has \ncontinued. Some of the pro-Aristide forces are responsible for some of \nthe violence, and some of the old regime people dating back to Baby Doc \nare responsible for some of the violence. The situation is not good.\n  Some of this money, quite frankly, needs to be used for humanitarian \nassistance. Some of the money needs to be used to train the police. \nSome of the money needs to be used to deal with the unemployment \nsituation.\n  My colleagues and I--a long bipartisan list that I have read with \nseven Republicans have sponsored this amendment--are working with the \nchairman of the subcommittee and with the chairman of the full \ncommittee to see what funds might be available and what we might be \nable to work out with regard to this amendment.\n  If the United States does not stay engaged in Haiti, the day will not \nbe far off when there will be more chaos in Haiti than there already \nis, and the government may fall. American troops may be back in Haiti \nat great cost to us, potential lives as well as money, and we may once \nagain see more people flooding toward the United States. This will be \nmoney that is very well spent, and, quite frankly, I believe we have no \nchoice but to spend this money.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I wish to talk now about two other \namendments, one of which has already been offered and one which will be \noffered that I have cosponsored.\n  Haiti is not the only emergency need that cannot wait another 6 or 9 \nmonths for funding. I wish to first talk about an amendment that \nSenator Kohl and I sponsored and that Senator Cochran has been very \nhelpful in regard to.\n  Our amendment provides additional emergency money for food aid. The \nPresident in his budget requested $150 million in additional emergency \nfood aid in this bill. Quite frankly, we need to do more. Accounts have \nbeen drained, and over 17 million people are in need of emergency food \naid in the world. That is a very conservative estimate.\n  Last week, the United Nations World Food Program announced that it \nwould be forced to cut rations to Darfur to make their supplies last. \nAs Senator Frist so eloquently spoke just a few moments ago, the people \nin this part of the world suffered through genocide, and now they will \nstarve. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development has \nbeen forced to cut programs in Sudan and Angola, Nicaragua, Rwanda, \nGhana, Eritrea--all food programs.\n  We know, of course, about the high-profile food aid emergencies, such \nas the people affected by the tsunami in Southeast Asia and the people \nin Darfur, but what we really do not hear so much about is the need for \nfood as a result of the locust infestation that swept through Africa \nlast year, devastating crops, and what we do not hear about is the \ndevastating floods in Bangladesh that leave women and children without \nany means of survival. We cannot tell these 17 million starving people \nof the world to wait. We can't tell them to wait for the regular \nappropriations cycle because, frankly, by then, for them at least, it \nwill be too late.\n  When this amendment comes to the floor, the amendment sponsored by\n\n[[Page S3722]]\n\nSenator Kohl and me, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to \nprovide this emergency food. It is lifesaving. It will make a \ndifference. Lives are, in fact, saved.\n  Finally, I am cosponsoring an amendment offered by Senator Corzine, \ntogether with Senators Brownback and Durbin, that would provide $93.5 \nmillion to address the crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n  Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Frist, who has on many occasions \nbeen to Sudan and has personally done humanitarian work there, and who \nhas been so very active on the floor of the Senate as well. I thank him \nfor his eloquent words a few minutes ago and for his great leadership.\n  I also thank my other colleagues who have taken the lead in this area \nand for their comments on the floor about this particular amendment and \nthe dire situation in Darfur. They have been deeply committed to \nhelping this troubled region of our world, and I commend them for their \nwork.\n  The amendment would provide $52 million in assistance for the African \nUnion. The African Union is trying to stop the genocide, and we have a \nmoral obligation to support their mission.\n  This amendment also addresses the overwhelming humanitarian crisis in \nDarfur--providing $40.5 million for international disaster assistance. \nThe United Nations International Children's Fund estimates that they \nonly have access to 5 to 10 percent of Darfur and only can get into 5 \nor 10 percent, and they have access only to one-third of the millions \nof people living in the region. Children's lives depend on our vote on \nthis amendment.\n  This amendment is budget neutral.\n  I urge all of my colleagues who have raised their voices on the floor \nin opposition to the crimes being committed in Darfur to vote for this \namendment and to vote for the accompanying amendment containing the \nDarfur Accountability Act. The genocide in Darfur must end, and it must \nend now.\n  I understand that we cannot address every problem in the world in \nthis particular bill and that some things will have to wait for the \nregular appropriations cycle, but the things that I have come to the \nfloor to talk about this morning simply will not wait. Lives are at \nstake if we do not address them in this bill, and lives will, in fact, \nbe lost. Each one of the items that I have talked about is a matter of \ncrisis, a matter of emergency.\n  They need to be included in this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 451\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask unanimous consent that Senators Mikulski, Stabenow, Dodd, Boxer, \nDorgan, Lieberman, Clinton, and Akaka be added as cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Akaka, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 451.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To lower the burden of gasoline prices on the economy of the \n United States and circumvent the efforts of OPEC to reap windfall oil \n                                profits)\n\n       On page 231, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       Sec. 6047.(a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) the prices of gasoline and crude oil have a direct and \n     substantial impact on the financial well-being of families of \n     the United States, the potential for national economic \n     recovery, and the economic security of the United States;\n       (2) on April 12, 2005, crude oil prices closed at the \n     exceedingly high level of $51.86 per barrel and the price of \n     crude oil has remained above $50 per barrel since February \n     22, 2005;\n       (3) on April 11, 2005, the Energy Information \n     Administration announced that the national price of gasoline, \n     at $2.28 per gallon--\n       (A) had set a new record high for a 4th consecutive week;\n       (B) was $0.49 higher than last year; and\n       (C) could reach even higher levels in the near future;\n       (4) despite the severely high, sustained price of crude \n     oil--\n       (A) the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     (referred to in this section as ``OPEC'') has refused to \n     adequately increase production to calm global oil markets and \n     officially abandoned its $22-$28 price target; and\n       (B) officials of OPEC member nations have publicly \n     indicated support for maintaining oil prices of $40-$50 per \n     barrel;\n       (5) the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (referred to in this \n     section as ``SPR'') was created to enhance the physical and \n     economic security of the United States;\n       (6) the law allows the SPR to be used to provide relief \n     when oil and gasoline supply shortages cause economic \n     hardship;\n       (7) the proper management of the resources of the SPR could \n     provide gasoline price relief to families of the United \n     States and provide the United States with a tool to \n     counterbalance OPEC supply management policies;\n       (8) the Administration's current policy of filling the SPR \n     despite the fact that the SPR is more than 98 percent full \n     has exacerbated the rising price of crude oil and record high \n     retail price of gasoline;\n       (9) in order to combat high gasoline prices during the \n     summer and fall of 2000, President Clinton released \n     30,000,000 barrels of oil from the SPR, stabilizing the \n     retail price of gasoline;\n       (10) increasing vertical integration has allowed--\n       (A) the 5 largest oil companies in the United States to \n     control almost as much crude oil production as the Middle \n     Eastern members of OPEC, over of domestic refiner capacity, \n     and over 60 percent of the retail gasoline market; and\n       (B) the top 10 oil companies in the world to make more than \n     $100,000,000,000 in profit and in some instances to post \n     record-breaking fourth quarter earnings that were in some \n     cases more than 200 percent higher than the previous year;\n       (11) the Administration has failed to manage the SPR in a \n     manner that would provide gasoline price relief to working \n     families; and\n       (12) the Administration has failed to adequately demand \n     that OPEC immediately increase oil production in order to \n     lower crude oil prices and safeguard the world economy.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the President should--\n       (1) directly confront OPEC and challenge OPEC to \n     immediately increase oil production; and\n       (2) direct the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney \n     General to exercise vigorous oversight over the oil markets \n     to protect the people of the United States from price gouging \n     and unfair practices at the gasoline pump.\n       (c)(1) For the period beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act and ending on the date that is 30 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act--\n       (A) deliveries of oil to the SPR shall be suspended; and\n       (B) 1,000,000 barrels of oil per day shall be released from \n     the SPR.\n       (2) If necessary to lower the burden of gasoline prices on \n     the economy of the United States and to circumvent the \n     efforts of OPEC to reap windfall crude oil profits, 1,000,000 \n     barrels of oil per day shall be released from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve for an additional 30 days.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered will allow \nthe Federal Government to take long overdue action to curb the record \nhigh gasoline prices that are plaguing American consumers at the pump. \nAs my colleagues are aware, for weeks, oil and gasoline prices have \nbeen placing an immense burden on working families. They are burning a \nhole in every wallet and pocketbook in America, and they are \nthreatening our fragile recovery. The March numbers showed that \nconsumers are not spending on other things because of the high prices \nof gasoline and other petroleum products. It is time this body took \naction to protect our Nation's economic security from sky-high oil \nprices and the whims of the OPEC cartel.\n  This amendment would provide the American consumer with relief by \nhalting the diversion of oil from markets to the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, and by releasing an amount of oil from the reserve through a \nswap program in order to increase supply, quell the markets, and bring \ndown prices at the pump.\n  What we are faced with is the simple market economics of supply and \ndemand. If demand goes up, price goes up. If supply goes up, price goes \ndown. At a\n\n[[Page S3723]]\n\ntime when we are facing recordbreaking gasoline prices, it is \nunfathomable that the Federal Government would actually be taking oil \noff the market and exacerbating the high costs of working families.\n  The price of crude oil has remained at near record highs for the \nfirst half of 2005. Oil has been trading at over $50 a barrel since \nFebruary 22. The prices have already burdened Americans, particularly \nin my home State of New York and the Northeast where we rely on home \nheating oil to heat our homes, as people have done throughout the \nwinter.\n  I know a lot of these families were hoping for a quick spring so they \ncould enjoy relief from the high energy prices. Unfortunately, that has \nnot been the case, as the increased burden of oil costs has just moved \nfrom the home and now, as we approach spring, to the highway. As \nAmericans are beginning to plan for their summer vacations and road \ntrips, the price of gasoline has reached a record high for the fourth \nweek in a row.\n  The Energy Information Administration predicted that the current \nprice of $2.28 a gallon--that is 49 cents, just about half a dollar up \nfrom last year--could give way to even higher prices in the future.\n  We know who is being hurt by these oil prices, and we know who is \nbenefiting--OPEC. OPEC made over $300 billion in oil revenue last year. \nThey stand to gain much more if the price stays in the stratosphere. \nAnd they have a policy which they keep changing. Originally, they said \n$22 to $28 a barrel would be their policy. Now they say they are \ncomfortable at oil remaining at $40 to $50 permanently. I know who will \nnot be comfortable--American families who depend on affordable oil to \ncommute to work, heat their homes, and provide for their energy needs.\n  Some of my colleagues may be asking: Didn't OPEC agree to increase \nproduction by 500,000 barrels a day? The reality is that OPEC's pledge \nto increase production on paper has not reduced prices at the pump. \nOPEC cut a million barrels in the face of rising prices, and now they \nsay they are going to raise it 500,000 barrels. But we are not sure \nthis is happening because it may be a paper transaction. When it comes \nto the talk of increasing production by another 500,000 barrels, an \nincrease that might actually result in a production raise, it is no \nsurprise that OPEC members are balking. Venezuela, Nigeria, and Libya--\nall have indicated they would oppose such an increase. That is another \nreason we should use the SPR because there is a division in OPEC, and \nwe can strengthen the hands of those more responsible nations that want \nto increase production to meet the increasing demand in the world.\n  What has the administration done on this? It has continued its policy \nof taking oil off the market and placing it in the SPR. This policy, \nwhich further tightens the oil market by taking much-needed supplies \nout of commerce, is slated to take an average of 85,000 barrels a day \noff the market during the height of the driving season.\n  I understand some of my colleagues are convinced the SPR should not \nbe touched, even to safeguard our economic security. I would argue that \nthe concerns to this degree do not properly balance America's physical \nsecurity needs against our economic security needs. The SPR is now 98 \npercent full. We are not recommending a sale but, rather, a swap so the \noil would be replaced presumably at a lower price, and we would have \nthe full amount of oil in the SPR once again.\n  The administration has these tools, and yet we are letting OPEC \ncontrol the whole show. If we showed them we meant business, that we \nwere willing to mix in, they would be far more reticent, far more \nreluctant to raise the price at will in the light of increasing demand \nfrom China, India, our country, and other places.\n  It is about time we did this. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nprotecting the pocketbook of working families from OPEC's profiteering \nby supporting the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to make some remarks today on the \nDefense supplemental we have before us. It is critical we pass that \nlegislation. I have been exceedingly disappointed that critical \nlegislation to support our troops who are serving us in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and other areas around the world is being held up by what \nnow appears to be a prolonged and extensive debate on immigration. More \nthan that, we are being asked to vote on a very significant immigration \nlegislation. No. 1, the AgJOBS bill is 105 pages. As I read it, Mr. \nPresident, as I know you have, it is breathtakingly deficient. It will \nundermine our current immigration system, make it much worse. It is an \nabomination. Yet I understand at one point the sponsors, Senators Craig \nand Kennedy, said they had over 60 Senators prepared to vote for it. \nNow, they are peeling off right and left and we may certainly hope \nthere are not votes sufficient to pass this legislation we will be \nvoting on now on a defense bill.\n  I was in an Immigration Subcommittee hearing yesterday, chaired by \nSenator Cornyn who chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration. It \nwas a very informative and important hearing. He has been working on \nthis for many months now, trying to hammer out something that makes \nsense for America. Yet now we are rushing through to vote on this bill. \nI want to share some thoughts about it.\n  I want to strongly oppose the AgJOBS Act. I oppose it, not only \nbecause it has nothing to do with the money we need to support our \ntroops in Iraq and will no doubt, and already has, slow down the bill, \nbut because it undermines the rule of law by rewarding illegal aliens \nwith amnesty. It creates no mechanisms in the law that will help bring \nintegrity to a system that is failing badly. It is a huge step \nbackward. It would be a disaster, if you want to know the truth.\n  It contains a host of bad provisions that should not be law and, as a \nresult, has even lost the support of much of the agriculture community \nthe sponsors claim to be so much in need of it.\n  It will provide amnesty to 1 million illegal aliens and their \nfamilies in addition, illegal aliens who broke the immigration law to \ncome here illegally and then again broke the law by working here \nillegally. The AgJOBS bill will treat unfairly those people who come to \nthe United States legally to work in agriculture, and do their work and \ncomply with the rules dutifully. They do not benefit at all from this \namnesty. Only illegals can benefit from its passage. That is a \nfundamental principle a great nation ought to think about. This is not \nan itty-bitty matter. We are going to provide a benefit to somebody who \nviolates a law and deny it to somebody who complies with the law? What \nkind of policy can that be? How can one justify such a policy?\n  Under the AgJOBS bill, illegal aliens are granted not only the right \nto stay here and work here, but they are put on the road to \ncitizenship, a virtual guaranteed path to citizenship unless they get \narrested for a felony--not arrested, you have to be convicted of a \nfelony. Or if you are convicted of three misdemeanors, that can get you \nout--three or more.\n  As I noted, the legal farm workers under the current H-2A program \nwill get nothing. They are certainly not put on a road to citizenship. \nLegal workers will not become permanent resident workers and then \ncitizens under the AgJOBS bill. If the AgJOBS bill passes, we will \nstate to the world that America is in fact rewarding people who break \nthe law to the disadvantage of those who follow it.\n  The sponsors of the amendment say this is not amnesty, it is earned \nlegalization; it is adjustment of status; it is rehabilitation. Those \nare misnomers, to say the least. The AgJOBS bill is amnesty, plain and \nsimple. It will give illegal aliens the very thing they broke the law \nto get, the ability to live and work inside the United States without \nhaving to wait in line the same as everybody else to get it. The \namnesty contained in AgJOBS does not stop there. It goes even further \nand gives illegal aliens a direct path from their new legal status to \nU.S. citizenship.\n\n[[Page S3724]]\n\nGetting rewarded by being handed the exact thing you broke the law to \nget plus the ability to get citizenship is amnesty, I think, under any \ndefinition of it. It even goes far beyond the proposals President Bush \nhas made that some have called amnesty, and he says it is not.\n  I am somewhat dubious about some of the ideas he has proposed. But \nhis principles are clearly violated by this AgJOBS bill. Make no \nmistake about it, President Bush, for all his commitment to improving \nthe ability of people to come to America to work, has never announced \nprinciples as breathtakingly broad as this.\n  Let us remind ourselves that criminal laws are involved here. Title \n8, section 1325 of the United States Code says illegal entry into the \nUnited States is a misdemeanor on the first offense, a felony \nthereafter. Coming here illegally, regardless of why you came, is a \ncriminal offense. Oftentimes, false documents and papers are submitted \nand filed. That is a criminal offense also.\n  Not only does it provide amnesty to illegal aliens who are already \nworking here, it gives amnesty to the illegal alien's family, if their \nfamily is also illegally here. But if their family is still abroad and \nnot here, the AgJOBS amendment allows the illegal alien to send for \ntheir family and bring them here, cutting in line ahead of others who \nmade the mistake of trying to comply with our laws rather than break \nthem.\n  According to a Pew report, there are at least 840,000 illegal \nimmigrant workers who would be eligible for amnesty under this bill. \nAdding in one spouse and a minor child for each of those, the estimate \ncan easily increase to 3 million immigrants--3 million, all of whom are \ndefined only in the agricultural community, not in any other community \nin the country where it seems to me we would have a very difficult time \non principle defining why agriculture workers get such beneficial \ntreatment compared to any other worker who might be here.\n\n  Not only does AgJOBS give amnesty to the current people who are in \nour country illegally, but it extends that amnesty to illegal aliens \nwho once worked in America but have already gone home. It actually \nencourages them to come back to the United States and puts them on a \nroute that leads them to full citizenship. These are people who have \nreturned home to their country, and we are putting them ahead of lawful \nworkers who come here and may also want to be citizens one day.\n  The AgJOBS amendment will create a category of ``lawful, temporary \nresident status'' of agricultural workers who have worked at least 100 \ndays in the 18 months prior to December 31, 2004. These are supposed to \nbe workers who were here working, contributing to our economy, but they \nonly have to work 100 days.\n  You have to read these acts. You can't just believe what you hear \nabout them. I was trying to study it last night and things kept hitting \nme that almost take your breath away. One hundred workdays--do you know \nhow that is defined in the act? An individual who is employed 1 or more \nhours in agriculture per day, that is a workday. For literally as many \nor as few as 100 hours of agricultural work in 18 months you are put on \nthis track. That is not good policy. I don't know who wrote this bill. \nThe details of it are extremely troubling.\n  Because the bill now only applies to agricultural workers, it is true \nthe entire illegal population that is estimated to be in our country of \n8 to 10 million will not be legalized under the bill. However, we can \nbe quite sure the majority of those 1.2 million illegal agricultural \nworkers will apply for amnesty if this amendment is passed.\n  Again I ask, what real principle can we stand on to say we need to \ngive these people who are here illegally preference over people who \nmight be working in some other industry?\n  Under the AgJOBS bill, an illegal alien is not deportable as soon as \nhis paperwork is filed. No factfinding or adjudication on the \napplication is necessary. It kicks in a protection that he cannot be \ndeported. Maybe he has been charged with a felony, but the trial hasn't \ncome along yet. It seems to me the procedure is guaranteed to go \nforward and they will be able to be put on this track. After the \nillegal alien gets the first round of amnesty, being granted temporary \nlegal status under the AgJOBS bill, the bill gives them the opportunity \nto continue working in agriculture and apply for permanent resident \nstatus here in the United States. Thereafter that puts you in a \nposition to become a citizen--guaranteed, unless you get in some big \ntrouble.\n  There is no limit on the number of individuals who would be allowed \nto adjust to lawful permanent residence and eventually become citizens. \nIf the illegal alien who meets the bill criteria has already left the \nUnited States, the legislation actually would encourage them to come \nback through the border to become a lawful temporary worker. As I read \nthe legislation, they are allowed to do that by filing a petition. I \nbelieve it is called a preliminary petition. This petition is pretty \ninteresting. The petition fundamentally is filed at the border with an \nofficer, it says. And who is the officer? An officer is a member of a \nfarm workers organization or an employer group, both of which are not \nrepresenting the interests of the citizens of the United States but \nboth of which have a special interest in having the alien come into the \ncountry. That is how they make their money. And they have to accept it \nif he produces virtually any document at all that would say he or she \nhas worked in the country at sometime previously.\n  Later on my breath was taken away where it says in this act that the \ndocuments filed by the illegal alien are confidential. Read this:\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Secretary \n     [that's the Secretary of Homeland Security, who is supposed \n     to be supervising all of this, under his jurisdiction] nor \n     any official or employee of the Homeland Security or Bureau \n     or Agency thereof may use the information furnished by the \n     applicant pursuant to an application under this section. . . \n     .\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Files and records prepared for the purposes of this section \n     by qualified designated entities [these are these employer \n     groups. These are the farm worker organizations] are \n     confidential, and the Secretary shall not have access to such \n     files or records relating to the alien without the consent of \n     the alien, except as allowed by a court order issued pursuant \n     to paragraph 6.\n\n  Great Scott, you mean you file an application that is supposed to \njustify you to come into the country, and it is supposed to allow you \nto come in here, but the drafters of this legislation are so \ndistrustful of our Government and the Secretary of Homeland Security \nthat he is not even able to see the documents? I don't know how this \nbecame the policy of the United States.\n  The fundamental principle is that no nation is required to allow \nanyone to come into their country because they have sovereignty over \ntheir country. They set standards and try to adhere to them. Wise \ncountries such as ours are very generous about how many people are \nallowed to come in. Some are far more strict--most are, in fact, more \nstrict than are we. But no one has a right, automatically, to enter \nsomebody's country. You enter by permission of that country. I don't \nthink there would be anything wrong to ask the applicant to at least \nfile a petition so the designated governmental official in charge of \nthe operation can see it, instead of it being secret from them.\n  Frank Gaffney recently wrote a column entitled ``Stealth Amnesty.'' \nHe is the president of the Center for Security Policy. We do have some \nsecurity problems involving terrorism involved around our country. He \nsummarized the AgJOBS bill by saying this:\n\n       By the legislation's own terms, an illegal alien will be \n     turned into ``an alien lawfully admitted for temporary \n     residence'' . . .\n\n  Just by fiat.\n  Provided they had managed to work unlawfully in an agricultural job \nin the United States for a minimum of 100 hours; in other words, for \n2\\1/2\\ weeks during 18 months prior to August 31, 2003.\n  I will continue to talk about the bizarre nature of this application \nprocess. Someone who is even not in the country who wants to come back \ninto the country, as I understand it, who has worked in our country \nillegally for some period of time and have returned to their country, \nthey want to come back; they file an application, a preliminary \napplication, I believe the phrase is. They do not file it with the \nGovernment, they file it with a farm workers group or an employer \ngroup,\n\n[[Page S3725]]\n\nboth of which do not have a real interest in seeing that the laws of \nthe United States are enforced.\n  It goes on. It is difficult to understand. I read from page 24 of the \n205-page bill:\n\n     . . . the Secretary shall not have access to such files or \n     records relating to the alien without the consent of the \n     alien, except as allowed by a court order.\n\n  It goes on to say that ``neither the Secretary nor any official'' \nshall ``use the information furnished by the applicant pursuant to an \napplication filed under this section,'' provided they cannot use it \n``for any purpose other than to make a determination on the application \nor for enforcement.''\n  Then it goes on to state that ``nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to limit the use or release for immigration enforcement \npurposes or law enforcement purposes'' of information contained in \nfiles and records of the Department of Homeland Security but that does \nnot give them the ability to use the information contained in the \npaperwork filed with the employer group. Those papers the employer does \nnot give to the Department of Homeland Security are kept secret and not \navailable to law enforcement, the bill goes on to add that no \ninformation in the application can be used ``other than information \nfurnished by an applicant pursuant to the application or any other \ninformation derived from the application that is not available for any \nother source.''\n  I was a prosecutor. I know how hard it was to handle these things. \nThis bill will create a situation that makes these documents virtually \nunusable in making sure this system has integrity. Why do we want to do \nthat? What possible reason do we want to have in legislation of this \nkind that would say when you come here and you present documentation \ninto evidence that justifies coming here to do that--why shouldn't the \ninformation you present in your application be part of the files of the \nGovernment, be reviewable at any time by any agency of the Government, \nfor any purpose for which they want to use it? Everybody else has to do \nthat.\n  Before you can be a Senator, you have to disclose all your finances. \nThat does not take me long, but for some people it takes a long time. \nWe have to do that, but somebody who is not even a citizen, not even a \nresident of this country, can keep information secret even though they \nare asking to become legal permanent residents eligible for \ncitizenship.\n  Mr. President, I will quote from an article by Mr. Frank Gaffney. \nThis confirms what I have been saying, which is undisputable about the \nbill. We are not at a time in our history when we should be doing this. \nIt is exactly opposite of what we should be doing if we want to create \na new system of immigration that allows more people to come here \nlegally, to work as their schedules are fit, with employers who may \nneed them.\n  We can do that. We should do that. We can do better about that. We \ncan improve current law. But to just willy-nilly allow people who could \nvery well be very marginal part-time employees, who never worked much--\nto give them permanent resident status and citizenship for violating \nour laws is thunderously erroneous, in my view. It is just not good.\n  Mr. Gaffney goes on to say:\n  Once so transformed--What he means by that is once you have been \ntransformed from an illegal person to a legal person by filing an \napplication--they can stay in the U.S. indefinitely while applying for \npermanent resident status. From there, it is a matter of time before \nthey can become citizens, so long as they work in the agricultural \nsector for 675 hours over the next six years.\n  But you only have to work, really, 2,000 hours, or 1 year out of 6 \nyears, but you have to stay in the agricultural sector.\n  Some have called this creating indentured servants. Why isn't it a \nform of indentured servitude? You have to come here. You are required \nto work for 6 years in agriculture. You cannot take some other type \nemployment.\n  The Craig[-Kennedy] bill would confer this amnesty as an exchange for \nindentured servitude. The amnesty will be conferred--Mr. Gaffney goes \non to say--not only on farmworking illegal aliens who are in this \ncountry--estimates of those eligible run to more than 800,000. It would \nalso extend the opportunity to those who otherwise qualified but had \npreviously left the United States. No one knows how many would fall in \nthis category and want to return as legal workers. But, a safe bet is \nthat there are hundreds of thousands of them.\n  If any were needed, S. 1645 [the AgJOBS bill] offers a further \nincentive to the illegals: Your family can stay, as well. \nAlternatively, if they are not with you, [and you are in the United \nStates] you can bring them in, too--cutting in line ahead of others who \nmade the mistake of abiding by, rather than ignoring, our laws.\n  So the system would work this way. I do not think anyone would \ndispute this. Someone is here illegally. They are working in \nagricultural work. By the way, it defines, at the beginning of this \nlegislation, what an ``employer'' means in agricultural employment. And \nit says:\n  The term ``employer'' means any person or entity, including any farm \nlabor contractor and any agricultural association, that employs workers \nin agricultural employment.\n  So you have to work for an agricultural employer, but that does not \nindicate to me that you have to be working in agriculture. Maybe the \ncompany has some workers who are agricultural, and 90 percent of them \nare not. Maybe you could work for them the way this thing is written, \nregardless.\n  But the way this system would work is if they were here illegally \nover a period of 18 months--if they were here just 18 months--and had \nworked 100 hours in agricultural employment during that 18 months, the \nSecretary shall make them a lawful temporary resident--required to, \nunless they committed a serious crime or something.\n  Then, over the next 6 years, if they were to work in agriculture for \nup to 2,060 hours--that is about 1 year's work--over 6 years in \nagriculture, they become a legal permanent resident. Then if you just \nhang along there for 5 years, you can become a citizen.\n  Now, I do not see where this can be supported by somebody saying they \nearned their citizenship. Citizenship should not be bought and paid for \nin labor. Why? Well, they worked for compensation, they wanted to work \nfor compensation, this is not something we forced them to come here and \ndo, they were paid like every other American is paid. You earn your pay \nfor the work you perform. I do not know that you should earn additional \nbenefits because you work. All the while, of course, the lawful H-2A \nworkers are still required to go home when their time is up. They only \nreceive pay for working, why should we give illegal workers more than \nthat.\n  The AgJOBS amendment goes so far as to provide free legal counsel to \nillegal aliens who want to receive this amnesty. All Americans don't \nget free legal counsel. There is no notice in this bill that suggests \nthey have to have any low-income level or have no assets to get the \nlegal services this bill gives to illegal alien workers. It provides \nthat the Legal Services Corporation can expend their funds and shall \nnot be prevented from providing legal assistance directly related to an \napplication for adjustment of status under this section.\n  Again, we are now giving them free legal status, free legal services, \nand we are allowing them to go to these groups, these farmworker \norganizations or employer groups, to help them with that. The AgJOBS \namendment provides all that in that fashion.\n  Let me talk about another item in this amendment an item that \nrestricts the rights of employers. I don't know how every State does \nit. I think probably a substantial number of States, like my State of \nAlabama, have laws that provide for employment at will; that is, unless \nan employee has a contract, they work for the company and they can \nleave the company whenever they want and the company can terminate them \nwhenever they want. That is Alabama law. I am rather certain of that. \nBut if you come in under this act, you get an enhanced protection over \nAmerican citizens. Prohibition: No alien granted temporary resident \nstatus under subsection (a) may be terminated from employment by any \nemployer during the period of temporary resident status except for just \ncause. And they set up an administrative law process, an arbitration \nproceeding to have all these trials. The burden of\n\n[[Page S3726]]\n\nproof is on the employer to demonstrate just cause for termination, and \nhe has the burden to prove it by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  Once again, we are entering into a complex legal deal here we need to \navoid, providing legal rights and protections to noncitizens who have \nviolated the law that are not available to American citizens.\n  Presumably, there are two farmworkers on this farm somewhere. One of \nthem is an American citizen--in Alabama, let us say--and the boss wants \nto fire one of them. If he fires the temporary resident alien, he has \nto go through arbitration and hire a lawyer and defend himself and be \nsued. As a matter of fact, it goes on to say that doesn't end it. That \nis one additional remedy the worker can have. He can still sue the \nemployer for any kind of fraud, abuse or harassment or any other thing \nthat some trial lawyer may pursue. So it doesn't end it. The evidence \napparently can be utilized from that trial into a next trial.\n  I am concerned about that. I believe it is an unnecessary litigation \nthat is going to impact our country adversely. That is why you will see \nthat agricultural groups are not supporting this AgJOBS bill.\n  What we really should do is follow the recommendations made to us \nover the years by immigration commissions of Congress that have been \ncreated for the specific purpose of providing advice and counsel to us \non how to effect immigration reform. In 1992, 6 years after the last \nillegal alien agricultural worker amnesty passed in 1986 as part of the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act, the IRCA, the Commission on \nAgricultural Workers issued a report to Congress that studied the \neffects of the 1986 agricultural amnesty called the Special \nAgricultural Worker Program.\n  One of the first things the Commission acknowledged was the number of \nworkers given amnesty under the bill had been severely underestimated. \nThe Commission reported the SAW Program legalized many more farmworkers \nthan expected:\n\n       It appears that the number of undocumented workers who had \n     worked in seasonal agricultural services prior to the IRCA \n     was generally underestimated.\n\n  What else did the Commission find? Did it suggest that this solved \nthe problem of workers in America in agricultural industry? Did it fix \nthe problem that they tried to fix in 1986?\n  They say this:\n\n       Six years after the IRCA was signed into law, the problems \n     within the system of agricultural labor continued to exist. \n     In most areas, an increasing number of newly arriving \n     unauthorized workers compete for available jobs, reducing the \n     number of workers available to all harvest workers--\n\n  That is, those who were given amnesty and those who are citizens--\n\n     and contributing to lower annual earnings.\n\n  Did the Commission recommend we pass a second legalization program \nsuch as AgJOBS? What did they say that might help us on that? They said \nthis:\n\n       A worker specific and/or industry specific legalization \n     program, as contained in the IRCA, should not be the basis of \n     future immigration policy.\n\n  This was 6 years after we did the last one. They had a commission \nstudy it. This is what they concluded. What do they suggest we ought to \ndo? What did the Commission recommend? They said the only way to have \nstructure and a stable agricultural market was to increase enforcement \nof our immigration laws, including employer sanctions, and reduce \nillegal immigration:\n\n       Illegal immigration must be curtailed. This should be \n     accomplished with more effective border controls, better \n     internal apprehension mechanisms, and enhanced enforcement of \n     employer sanctions. The U.S. Government should also develop \n     better employment eligibility and identification systems, \n     including fraud-proof work authorization documents for all \n     persons legally authorized to work in the United States so \n     that employer sanctions can more effectively deter the \n     employment of unauthorized workers.\n\n  That is what they recommended. That is what we haven't done. In fact, \nwe are in an uproar over this rather minor Sensenbrenner language the \nHouse put on their bill that deals with national security and a way to \nmake ID secure and other matters consistent with recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission. So it appears that the Senate does not want to do that \nbut what we want to do is continue to pass these amnesty bills. This \nshould not be happening.\n  Restoring our ability and commitment to successfully enforce our \nimmigration laws is the only long-term solution. A real solution will \nnot reward illegal behavior by handing out amnesty to people here \nillegally, but instead will require effective control of our borders, \nactive policing in the interior, and participation among all levels of \nlaw enforcement. Of course, it includes improving the laws that we have \nto allow, where needed, more people to come legally in a system that \nactually works. But to have any system at all, of course, that must be \ncreated with an enforcement mechanism that works. We have never created \nsuch a mechanism and now it is time to do so.\n  I introduced a bill last Congress--and will introduce, again--that \nwould strengthen the United States' ability to enforce our immigration \nlaws. The Homeland Security Enhancement Act would clarify for law \nenforcement officers of a State, county, and city that they do have \nauthority to enforce immigration violations while carrying out their \nroutine duties.\n  They don't have authority to deport or try, but they have a \nresponsibility, in most instances, to detain people they identify as \nbeing here in violation of the law and contact Federal officials to \nprocess that individual after that. They have been told, and been \nconfused about, what their authority is. I have written a law review \narticle on it, aided by my assistant here, my counsel, Cindy Hayden. We \nresearched the law and came to that conclusion.\n  The law provides the authority, in virtually every instance, but \nlawyers have confused cities and counties and police and sheriffs, and \nthey are not participating in anything the way they would like. We are \nnot talking about forcing them to do anything. We are trying to make \nsure we pass legislation that clarifies existing law and makes it clear \nthey have the ability to serve and assist our country. It would \nincrease the amount of information regarding deportable illegal aliens \nentered into the FBI National Crime Information Center database, making \nthe information more readily available to local officials.\n  This is a big, big deal. In the hearing Senator Cornyn chaired \nyesterday, we had a person from the Department of Homeland Security who \nis in charge of detention and removal, and what we learned was that \nover 80 percent of the people who are detained, processed and found to \nbe here illegally are released on bail while the government arranges \nfor their deportation. It is not surprising they don't show up to be \ndeported. Even after they are given a hearing and found to be here in \nviolation of the law, they are consistently released on bail, and 80 \npercent of those don't show up to be deported. Then, we now have some \n400,000 absconders. Now, Mr. President, if a Senator gets a DUI in \nKansas or someplace and you don't show up for court, they put your name \nin the database, and if you get stopped for speeding somewhere in some \nother State, they will pick it up. So they are a fugitive, but their \ninformation is not being put into the NCIC.\n  I know police officers. I was a prosecutor for over 15 years. I asked \nthem about this. They tell me they do not even bother to call the \nFederal Immigration officials if they apprehend someone that is \nillegally here because they won't come and get them. So they have just \ngiven up. They are prepared to help. What a great asset that would be. \nBut, no, we have not seen fit to do that.\n  But more importantly, the 400,000 absconders are not in the National \nCrime Information Center computer. So when a State officer apprehends \nsomeone, and they have a name and they want to run it through the \nwanted persons database they would use for an American citizen, they \nrun the birth date, the driver's license, or other identifying \ncharacteristics, and it tells them whether there is a warrant out for \ntheir arrest.\n  That is how most people are caught today who violate the law and who \nare fugitives. Most of them are caught in simple traffic stops. Don't \ntell them because they will quit speeding. But that is how we catch \nthem--when they get in a fight somewhere and the police runs their name \nand there is a warrant out in Texas for them for assault or something.\n\n[[Page S3727]]\n\n  We raised Cain last year about that and asked the tough questions of \na number of the Department officials. They said they would try. So out \nof 400,000, we learned there are about 40,000 of those names they found \ntime to put in the NCI Center computer system that is available at \ncity, county, and police offices out in the country. That indicates to \nme how confused we are about how to make this system work.\n  I want to say this. I absolutely believe that we have one big problem \non our minds; that is, we think it cannot be done. We think we cannot \nenforce immigration laws, that we might as well just quit. Well, under \nour present way of doing so, that is correct. However, if we create a \nmore generous way for people to come here legally that is simple and \nunderstandable, and if we enhance our enforcement abilities and if we \nquit rewarding those who come illegally, you will begin to see the \nnumbers change. As a matter of fact, there is a tipping point out there \nI am absolutely convinced exists.\n  If we enhance the enforcement of those who come illegally, we quit \nproviding those who are here illegally with benefits, we increase \nborder enforcement, and we enhance the way for people to come here \nlegally to work, and we make that easier and will get more support from \ncountries from which these people come, we can tip this thing. As the \nnumber that come into the country illegally goes down, and as our \nenforcement effort and officers are increased, you will have a \ntremendous change in the number of enforcement officers per illegal. \nThat is when you make progress. That is what happened in crime.\n  The crime rate has been dropping for the last 20 years. As it drops, \nwe don't fire policemen. We have gotten more policemen per crime, so \nthey have more time to work on crime. They are doing a better job of \napprehending repeat offenders and putting them in jail. The crime rate \nhas broken. Instead of going up, as it did in the 1960s and 1970s, it \nhas been going down for over 20 years. We can do that here. It will \naffirm America's commitment to the rule of law. To do that, we are \ngoing to need additional bedspace for detention, and we cannot continue \nto release people who have been apprehended on the street so they just \ndisappear again. We have to require the Federal Government to receive \nand process people who have been apprehended by local law enforcement. \nWe need to make sure the system provides them a fair hearing, but it \nalso needs to be a prompt hearing. If someone is in violation of the \nlaw, the system should work rapidly and not with great expense. Those \nare some of the things I am concerned about in the bill I have offered. \nBut there are many other problems of a similar nature that need to be \ndealt with.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. America openly welcomes legal \nimmigrants and new citizens who have the character, integrity, the \ndecency, and the work ethic that have made this country great. But they \nare concerned, rightly, about the politicians in Washington who talk as \nthough they hear them when they cry out for a system that works, and we \nsay we are working on it. What do we do? We came up with an AgJOBS bill \nthat absolutely goes in the wrong direction. The same people who are \nsupporting that bill, for the most part--although not Senator Larry \nCraig--are opposing my bill, for example, that would enhance law \nenforcement authority for local officers, and they wonder if we have \nany commitment at all here to enforce the law. They have every right to \ndo so because I will tell you, from my experience in talking with \npolice officers in my State, nothing is being done. Until we put our \nminds to it, nothing will be done.\n  How do we go from here? What should we do? In my view, we need to \npass this emergency supplemental to support our troops. We need to \nreject all immigration amendments on it. We need to follow President \nBush's lead and have a serious debate and discussion on this issue.\n  We need to agree on certain principles about how it will be \nconducted. We are going to have a legal system that works. We are going \nto be humane in how we treat people who come here. We are going to \nconsider American needs. It is not going to be an unlimited number. And \nwe are going to create a legal system that works.\n  We can do that, and we should do that. A lot of work is going on \ntoward that end right now. Senator Kyl and Senator Chambliss have a \nmajor bill to deal with some of these issues. Senator Cornyn, a former \njustice of the Texas Supreme Court, a former attorney general of Texas, \nis doing a real good job in managing the Immigration Subcommittee of \nthe Judiciary Committee and is considering all these issues. Then \nsometime later this year, I think, we might as well get serious, bring \nsomething up and try to make some progress. Who knows, maybe even the \nPresident should appoint an independent commission of people who \nunderstand this issue--we have had commissions before--and make some \nspecific recommendations about how we ought to proceed. That could \nwork, in my view.\n  Right now the American people lack confidence in us, and they have \nevery right to lack confidence in us because we have created a system \nthat is flawed, it is not working. It is an abomination, really.\n  I want to share this information with my colleagues. Farmers who are \nsupposed to be benefiting from this act, the agriculture workers \namnesty legislation, do not want it. Maybe some farm groups in \nWashington or lobbyists are for it. Maybe some big agricultural \nentities want it. But I have in my hands an open letter from the \nSoutheastern Farmers Coalition. It is signed by a list of organizations \nand individual H-2A program participants, people who utilize farm \nworkers from out of the country who are ``the overwhelming majority of \nH-2A program users in the country.''\n  The list of signatories to this letter is expansive, including the \nNorth Carolina Growers Association, the Mid-Atlantic Solutions, the \nGeorgia Peach Council, AgWorks, the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable \nAssociation, the Virginia Agricultural Growers Association, the Vidalia \nOnion Business Council--I am sure that is a sweet group--and the \nKentucky-Tennessee Growers Association.\n  The letter states:\n\n       Farmers in the Southeastern United States are opposed to \n     Senate bill S. 1645 introduced by Ted Kennedy and Larry \n     Craig. It is an amnesty for illegal farm-workers. It does not \n     reform the H-2A program. Please oppose this legislation.\n\n  The text of the letter, which asks me to oppose the bill, says:\n\n       [AgJOBS] is nothing more than a veiled amnesty. While \n     everyone, it seems, agrees that the H-2A program desperately \n     needs reform, this legislation does not fix the two most \n     onerous problems with the program: the adverse effect wage \n     rate and the overwhelming litigation brought by Legal \n     Services groups against farmers using the H-2A program.\n\n  In fact, it explicitly provides for more such litigation. The letter \ngoes on to say:\n\n       The Craig-Kennedy-Berman reform package provides a private \n     right of action provision that goes far beyond legitimate \n     worker protections and expands Legal Services' attorneys \n     ability to sue growers in several critical areas. These \n     lawyers, who have harassed program users with meritless \n     lawsuits for years, will continue to attack small family \n     farmers under the new statute.\n\n  Supporters of Craig-Kennedy-Berman have endorsed this alleged reform \nbelieving in a misguided fashion that it will bring stability to the \nagricultural labor market. It will not. It will create greater \ninstability. As illegal farm workers earn amnesty, they will abandon \ntheir farm jobs for work in other industries.\n  Continuing this letter:\n\n       Many of the attached signatories have been actively \n     involved in negotiations surrounding this legislation. The \n     following groups have broken ranks with the American Farm \n     Bureau.\n\n  As a matter of fact, I think the Farm Bureau has now switched sides \non this bill, and they are no longer endorsing it. They are not \nsupporting it now. They have changed their position.\n  They continue:\n\n       You are likely to hear that the majority of agriculture \n     supports this bill. The industry, in fact, is split.\n\n  But, in fact, the trend has been the other way against it.\n  They go on:\n\n       History has demonstrated that the amnesty granted under the \n     Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was a dismal \n     failure for agriculture employers. Farm workers abandoned \n     agricultural employment\n\n[[Page S3728]]\n\n     shortly after gaining amnesty and secured jobs in other \n     industries.\n\n  I also received a letter last week from two growers in Alabama who \nfavor improving the ability to utilize foreign workers. They strongly \nsupport that. But still they asked me to oppose the AgJOBS legislation.\n  Tom Bentley of Bentley Farms, which grows, packs, and ships peaches \nfrom Thorsby, AL, and Henry Williams, head of the Alabama Growers \nAssociation, write:\n\n       In the coming days, you may be asked to vote on legislation \n     offered by Senator Larry Craig and Senator Edward Kennedy \n     that purports to significantly reform the present H-2A \n     agricultural worker program by providing an earned amnesty to \n     hundreds of thousands of undocumented farm workers now \n     present in the United States.\n       Despite claims that this bill is bipartisan and represents \n     the interests of all agricultural employers, growers in the \n     Southeastern United States do not support the passage of this \n     legislation.\n       This bill is not H-2A reform as touted, it is simply an \n     amnesty bill for a selected group of workers.\n\n  If farmers who make up a majority of H-2A employers are opposed to \nAgJOBS because it is amnesty for illegal workers and it does not reform \nthe H-2A program, why should we pass it? Who supports this amendment? I \nbelieve the supporters who are advocating it are really not in touch \nwith the desires of the American people and the desires of the farmers \nthey claim to represent. In fact, I am not sure the authors understand \njust how far this bill goes and just how many serious problems exist \nwithin it.\n\n  I do not think that I am out of touch with the American people. I \ncertainly believe the principles I have advocated are consistent with \nthe rule of law that I cherish in our country, and I am troubled to see \nit eroded in this fashion. I believe reform is necessary. I believe we \ncan achieve reform. I believe we need to spend some time on it. I do \nnot think it can be done piecemeal. I originally thought it had to be \ndone comprehensively. Then somebody convinced me we could break it up. \nBut the more I look at it, the more I see the nature of it. Why would \nwe want to spend all this time on one group of workers, agricultural \nworkers? There are other workers who are facing the same challenge. Why \nnot fix this problem in a generous way for foreign workers to come and \nwork, a generous way to achieve citizenship, a focus on the real needs \nof America, not just laboring immigrants. We need people who have \nPh.D.s, brain power, scientific people who may cure cancer one day. We \nneed more of those kinds of people, too.\n  We need to look at it comprehensively. Draw up a system that works. \nBut one that allows us to honor the heritage we have been given as \nAmericans, the heritage that draws so many people--our heritage of the \nrule of law--is being eroded terribly today.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an amendment that is pending. The \ndistinguished majority leader will make the decision as to what votes \nare going to occur on Monday evening. I want to get my debate out of \nthe way, hoping this amendment, which is probably germane postcloture--\nmaybe we could do it at that time and get it over with.\n  Over this past recess I had the good fortune to travel to the Middle \nEast. I visited Nevada troops in Kuwait before they went to Iraq. It \nwas a great trip for me, one I will never forget. But I saw firsthand \nwhat has been accomplished in the face of very difficult and dangerous \nconditions in Iraq. I was also able to see that every American should \nbe very proud of the unheralded service these courageous service men \nand women perform each day.\n  The 1864th Transportation Unit from Nevada hauls the goods from \nKuwait to Iraq. This is where we hear about some vehicles needing more \narmor. These vehicles need more armor, but when they get an order they \nget in the truck and off they go, men and women.\n  I also received briefings on the status of our efforts to secure and \nrebuild Iraq. During a helicopter flight over Baghdad, it was very \nclear that big city one time was in shambles. The process of rebuilding \nIraq has started, thanks to generous assistance of the U.S. taxpayers, \nbut a lot of it doesn't show.\n  The amendment I offer today seeks to honor the sacrifices of our \ntroops and taxpayers on behalf of the Iraqi people and ensures that \nother nations of the world keep their commitment in this worthwhile \neffort.\n  I want to spend a few minutes discussing the details of what we and \nother nations around the world are doing to secure and rebuild Iraq.\n  Presently, there are more than 150,000 Coalition troops in Iraq. More \nthan 130,000 of them are Americans, such as the 1864th I saw in Kuwait \nthat drives on a continual basis into the middle of Iraq.\n  Since the beginning of this war, more than half a million U.S. \nmilitary personnel have served in Iraq. The story is remarkable. It is \nremarkable because it is similar to the international effort to rebuild \nIraq.\n  While this Nation has appropriated more than $20 billion in direct \nassistance for Iraqi reconstruction, the rest of the world combined has \nproduced about half of that. When I say ``produced,'' it is only in \ntalk. Even more startling is the fact that the vast majority of the \ncommitments made by these other countries have been in the form of \nloans and credits rather than hard cash such as we have provided. In \nshort, this Nation has done more than its fair share to secure and \nrebuild Iraq.\n  As I noted at the outset, it was clear from my recent trip that a \ngreat deal more needs to be done in construction, and that is an \nunderstatement. We are not as far along as the administration promised \nwe would be at this point of the conflict; and the cost to the U.S. \ntaxpayers of our country for operations in Iraq has far exceeded the \nestimates the administration provided us prior to the start of this \nwar.\n  The failure of the international community to keep its commitment is \none reason why reconstruction developments in Iraq have not proceeded \nas they should. According to the State Department's sixth quarterly \nreport, the international community has actually delivered only $1 \nbillion of the $13.5 billion promised.\n  As for the cost to the U.S. taxpayers of the Iraq reconstruction, \nadministration officials declared that Iraq itself could cover a \nsubstantial portion of these costs. Shortly after the war started, \nDeputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz told the House Budget Committee, \n``There's lots of money to pay for this. It doesn't have to be U.S. \ntaxpayer money. We are dealing with a country that can easily finance \nits own reconstruction, and relatively soon.'' U.S. AID Director Andrew \nNatsios was even more explicit in his statement nearly a month later:\n\n       The rest of the rebuilding of Iraq will be done by other \n     countries who have already made pledges, Britain, Germany, \n     Norway, Japan, Canada, and Iraqi oil revenues, eventually in \n     several years, when it's up and running and there's a new \n     government that's been democratically elected, will finish \n     the job with their own revenues. They're going to get in $20 \n     billion a year in oil revenues. But the American part of this \n     will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on \n     funding for this.\n\n  I think it's fair for the American people to ask why the Iraq \nreconstruction has not proceeded as promised by this administration? \nWhy, when the United States military and our taxpayers have done so \nmuch, the international community has done so little, failing to keep \neven its relatively modest reconstruction commitment? Any why have the \nadministration's statements that the people of Iraq and other nations \nwould cover the bulk of that country's reconstruction costs proven to \nbe so wrong?\n  I think it is time we restored some equity, fairness, and shared \nsacrifice with other nations on the reconstruction efforts.\n  I haven't talked about the deaths of our soldiers, the sacrifices \nthey have made being wounded. I am talking today only about money. The \ncommitment other countries have made has been very small in actual \npersonnel, very large in talk and very short in dollars. and our \ntaxpayers have more than lived up to their commitment to the people of \nIraq. It's long past time that the rest of the world do the same. \nThat's what my amendment seeks to do.\n\n  My amendment is quite straightforward. This amendment does not affect \nroughly $17 billion of the $20 billion that Congress has appropriated \nfor Iraq reconstruction assistance. the administration is free to do \nwith that\n\n[[Page S3729]]\n\namount as they see fit and when they see fit.\n  And it gives the President two clear options that he could take to \ngain access to the remaining $3 billion.\n  First, the President can easily gain unfettered access to the \nremaining funds by merely certifying that other nations who have made \nfinancial commitments to help Iraq at the Madrid Donor's Conference and \nin other donor meetings since 2003 have fulfilled those commitments.\n  Second, if the President is unable to make that certification, this \namendment provides him with yet another way to gain access to and spend \nthe remaining funds we have appropriated. he can simply certify to the \nCongress that: No. 1, his representatives have made a good faith effort \nto persuade other nations to follow through on their previous financial \ncommitments to Iraq; No. 2, the sale of Iraqi oil or other Iraqi \nsources of revenue should not be used to reimburse the United States \nGovernment for our reconstruction assistance; and No. 3, despite the \nfailure of these other nations to live up to their financial promises \nand the inability of Iraq to reimburse us for a significant portion of \nour reconstruction costs, continued American spending on Iraqi \nreconstruction is in the national security interests of the United \nStates.\n  These are very simple, clear and straightforward certifications. The \namendment does not require others to pay for U.S. military operations, \nnor does it seek to shut down the reconstruction process.\n  I recall what the military commanders on the ground have said about \nthe importance of delivering reconstruction aid as a means of putting a \ndent into the insurgency. As the former Commander of the First Calvary \nin Baghdad often talked about, where reconstruction efforts were \nsuccessful and where the citizens had power, clean water and basic \nservices, the attacks against American forces went down.\n  Let us be clear. I am not arguing against continuing to help the \nIraqi people with the reconstruction of their country. I am not \nin favor of putting insurmountable hurdles in front of the President as \nhe seeks to carry out these efforts.\n\n  Rather, I am simply saying that in light of all that America's troops \nand taxpayers have done for the people of Iraq and the world, it seems \nonly reasonable to expect that other nations will live up to their \ncommitments and that this administration would want to hold them \naccountable.\n  We should be looking for ways to strengthen the President's \nnegotiating hand when dealing with these other countries, and that's \nwhat this amendment does.\n  Passing this amendment gives the President greater leverage in \ngetting other nations to follow through on their previous commitments. \nThe President can cite this Congressional action, highlight the fact \nthat the Congress is closely monitoring the international contributions \ncoming into Iraq, and let them know that there is growing concern in \nthe Congress about their inability to live up to their past promises.\n  For those who argue that passing this amendment will slow down the \nreconstruction, nothing could be further from the truth. As I've \nalready stated, the State Department and AID cannot spend the money \nthey already have.\n  Through six quarterly reports, the U.S. has spent only $4.209 billion \nin Iraq, an average of $701.5 million per quarter. At this rate, it \nwill take over 5 years for all the money to be spent.\n  In other words, at the current pace, the Bush administration would be \nover before we would spend their reconstruction money that we have \nalready provided last year.\n  If this amendment passes, the reconstruction money will flow \nunaffected for many years, perhaps through the end of President Bush's \nterm. At that point, he or a future President merely needs to issue a \ncertification to ensure the continued flow of the money.\n  Iraq needs to become the world's concern, not strictly our concern. \nWe owe that to our soldiers and to the American taxpayers who have been \nboth patient and generous and have borne an unusually high burden. If \nyou want to support the troops, our taxpayers, and give the \nadministration the leverage to get the rest of the world to live up to \ntheir commitments, this amendment should be supported.\n\n\n                                highways\n\n  Briefly, we need to a highway bill. We have received all kinds of \nletters from different entities saying we must do a highway bill. \nAccording to a report by the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation officials, the uncertainty caused by the short-term \nextensions to the surface transportation program has cost billions of \ndollars in project delays and thousand and thousands of jobs. This is \nan alarm.\n  I have letters from over 20 groups ranging from state and local \ngovernments to major trade associations, all urging immediate \nconsideration of this important bill. When we finish the supplemental, \nI urge the majority leader to move forward on the highway bill.\n  Yesterday, Senators Baucus, Inouye, Jeffords, Sarbanes, and I sent a \nletter to the majority leader requesting that he bring the surface \ntransportation reauthorization bill to the floor for consideration \nprior to the completion of this April work period. I hope we can do \nthat. It is so important.\n  Senator Baucus and Senator Bond, the people leading that \nsubcommittee, have done a wonderful job. We have a bill ready to go. I \nhope we can do that soon.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from 18 trade associations be \nprinted in the Record in addition to a letter from virtually all State \nand local government organizations, the National Governors Association, \nand the letter I previously mentioned from the Democratic leaders.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 13, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Reid: With the 109th Congress well \n     underway, we urge you to schedule Senate floor consideration \n     of legislation to reauthorize the federal highway and transit \n     programs for this month. The Transportation Equity Act for \n     the 21st Century (TEA-21) expired September 30, 2003, and the \n     programs continue to operate under a series of extensions. \n     The Senate has repeatedly expressed its will about the \n     importance of addressing the nation's transportation \n     challenges and there is no substantive reason to delay \n     consideration of this bill.\n       TEA-21 reauthorization may be one of the few measures the \n     Senate will consider this year that will pass with \n     overwhelming bipartisan support. This board support, combined \n     with the May 31 expiration of the latest short-term extension \n     of the highway and transit program, presents a compelling \n     case for Senate action so that conference negotiations may \n     begin with the House of Representatives, which approved its \n     multi-year reauthorization bill March 10.\n       The nation's surface transportation infrastructure needs \n     and safety concerns continue to grow, yet lack of a long-term \n     funding commitment by the Federal government is impeding \n     states' ability to plan and let transportation improvement \n     projects that will help create American jobs, ease pollution \n     creating traffic congestion and address highway safety. With \n     substantial groundwork completed on TEA-21 reauthorization \n     over the last two years, the authorizing committees with \n     jurisdiction over the legislation are well prepared for \n     Senate consideration of a reauthorization bill.\n       We urge you to schedule TEA-21 reauthorization legislation \n     for Senate floor action as soon as possible and allow the \n     Senate to again work its will on this critical matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Road & Transportation Builders Association, \n           Associated General Contractors of America, U.S. Chamber \n           of Commerce, American Association of State Highway & \n           Transportation Officials, Associated Equipment \n           Distributors, Association of Equipment Manufacturers, \n           International Union of Operating Engineers, National \n           Ready Mixed Concrete Association, American Public \n           Transportation Association, American Concrete Pipe \n           Association, American Concrete Pavement Association, \n           National Utility Contractors Association, Portland \n           Cement Association, National Asphalt Pavement \n           Association, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and \n           Joiners of America, American Society of Civil \n           Engineers, National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association, \n           Laborers-Employers Cooperation and Education Trust.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 12, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Office of the Senate Majority Leader, Capitol Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist: On behalf of the nation's state \n     and local governments, we\n\n[[Page S3730]]\n\n     want to take this opportunity to urge you to schedule \n     consideration of SAFETEA, the Senate version of the \n     reauthorization of the highway and transit programs, at the \n     earliest possible date. This legislation needs to be passed \n     by the Senate and sent to a conference committee as soon as \n     possible. As you know, TEA-21 expired on September 30, 2003 \n     and the current extension expires on May 31, 2005. In order \n     to plan for, maintain, and build our nation's transportation \n     infrastructure, state and local governments need a multi-year \n     reauthorization passed in the very near term.\n       Thank you for your consideration to this matter.\n           Respectfully,\n     Raymond C.

Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Reid: On behalf of the \n     nation's governors, we write to urge the Senate to complete \n     action on the surface transportation reauthorization bill and \n     begin conference before the current extension expires on May \n     31, 2005. Congress' series of successive short-term \n     extensions of TEA-21 have burdened State transportation \n     planning and programming, and can only be addressed by \n     passing a long-term bill.\n       We encourage the Senate to consider and expeditiously \n     complete its work on S. 732 so that the Senate and House \n     bills may be conferenced and a law enacted.\n       Additional information and specifics regarding the \n     governors' position on surface transportation reauthorization \n     can be found in the attached NGA Policy which was revised and \n     reaffirmed on March 1, 2005 at the NGA Winter Meeting.\n           Sincerely.\n     Mark R. Warner,\n                                             Governor of Virginia.\n     Mike Huckabee,\n     Governor of Arkansas.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Majority Leader: We write to request floor \n     consideration of the surface transportation reauthorization \n     bill prior to the completion of this April work period.\n       As you know, a well-maintained surface transportation \n     system is critical to our nation's economy. Long-term \n     transportation planning is essential to the continued \n     maintenance and improvement of the system. Unfortunately, for \n     the past 18 months, the Federal surface transportation \n     program has operated under a series of short-term extensions \n     denying states the ability to make and to execute long-term \n     transportation plans.\n       Because of this continuing uncertainty, many states have \n     had to slow or to stop entirely progress on many important \n     transportation projects. Further extensions will only \n     exacerbate these delays costing billions of dollars in \n     project delays and thousands of jobs.\n       The current program extension expires on May 31, 2005. In \n     order to complete work on this important legislation before \n     this deadline, the full Senate must consider the measure \n     prior to the end of the April work period. Recognizing this \n     urgency, each of the committees of jurisdiction will be ready \n     for Senate floor debate in the near future.\n       We are ready and committed to moving this process forward \n     in the bipartisan spirit this bill has traditionally enjoyed. \n     We look forward to an open and vigorous debate of the surface \n     transportation reauthorization before the end of this April \n     work period.\n           Sincerely,\n     Harry Reid,\n     Max Baucus,\n     Daniel Inouye,\n     Jim Jeffords,\n     Paul Sarbanes.\n\n  As we all know, the current Federal surface transportation program \nexpired 18 months ago, and the program has operated under a series of \nshort term extensions since then, with the latest set to expire on May \n31 of this year. While these extensions have helped the Federal program \nlimp along, they have denied States the ability to make long-term \ntransportation planning decisions essential to the continued \nmaintenance and improvement of the system. In addition, the lack of a \npermanent reauthorization bill has caused many States to slow or stop \nentirely progress on many important transportation projects.\n  According to a report by the American Association of State Highway \nand Transportation Officials, the uncertainty caused by the short term \nextensions has cost billions of dollars in project delays and thousands \nof jobs.\n  Mr. President, I stand ready and committed to moving this process \nforward in the bipartisan spirit that this bill has always enjoyed. I \nurge the majority leader to bring the surface transportation \nreauthorization bill up for floor consideration before the end of the \nApril work period for the good of the country and the workers that so \ndesperately depend upon its future.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, earlier this week I was proud to submit \ninto the Record several e-mails from the more than 2,000 I had received \nfrom military families around the country. These e-mails detailed the \nproud service that America's military families make every day. The e-\nmails are full of their pride and understanding of service. And I know \nmy colleagues join me in expressing our thanks to them for all they do.\n  I submitted these e-mails because they put a human face on the \nsacrifices we speak about so often. I have come to learn that one of \nthe stories relayed to me about a Home Depot employee does not reflect \nHome Depot's policies. In fact, Home Depot is a strong supporter of its \nmobilized employees. The company was recognized last year by the \nDepartment of Defense for its support to service members, including a \nprogram to give hiring preferences to injured service members who want \nto work for the company. Its ``Project Home Front'' contributed tools \nand volunteers to help military spouses make home repairs while their \nloved ones were deployed. And, as a model for others to emulate, Home \nDepot makes up any salary lost by mobilized employees. I am happy to \nset the record straight on the contributions Home Depot makes to the \nbrave Americans who work for it and serve in the National Guard and \nReserves. I regret the unfortunate oversight and thank Home Depot for \ntheir support of America's military.\n  The stories we received are snapshots of what service means to \nfamilies across this great land. America's military families are \npartners in the defense of this country and we have to listen to them. \nTaking care of their needs is not sentimentalism it's a practical \ninvestment in our national security. Given the millions spent to \nrecruit and train the men and women of the United States military, our \nmodest investment in military families is a smart way to retain the \nforce.\n  I thank my colleagues for their continued interest and support on \nthese issues, and I thank Home Depot for its support of America's \nheroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3730-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3730-S3731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent there now be a period of \nmorning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Ibrahim Parlak\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President: I would like to bring my colleagues' \nattention to a situation facing one of my constituents, Ibrahim Parlak, \nwho, up until a year ago, was living the American dream. After moving \nto this country in 1991, through hard work and dedication, he worked \nhis way up from being a busboy to owning his own restaurant, Cafe; \nGulistan, in Harbert, MI. Mr. Parlak has spent over a decade of hard, \nhonest work and has led an upstanding life with his family and \ncommunity. However, now, he may be deported.\n  Ibrahim Parlak, a Kurd born in southern Turkey, came to the United \nStates seeking asylum in 1991. In his asylum application, Mr. Parlak \ndisclosed that he had been associated with the Kurdistan Worker's Party \n(PKK) in\n\n[[Page S3731]]\n\nthe 1980s, that he was involved in an armed skirmish at the Turkish \nborder in 1988, and that he had been imprisoned in Turkey as a result \nof these facts. In 1992, Mr. Parlak was granted asylum due to the \npersecution and torture that he suffered at the hands of the Turkish \ngovernment. The Immigration and Naturalization Service believed that \nMr. Parlak had a credible fear of returning to Turkey.\n  In 1993, Mr. Parlak wanted to take the next step and become a United \nStates citizen. However, when he filled out his application to become a \nlawful permanent resident, he did not check a box stating that he had \nbeen ``arrested, cited, charged, indicted, fined or imprisoned for \nviolating any law or ordinance, excluding traffic violations,'' in or \noutside of the United States. Mr. Parlak has stated that due to his \nlimited English skills, he misunderstood the form, and believed that \nthe question related only to his activities since he entered the United \nStates. Again, Mr. Parlak had already given the Government the \ninformation surrounding his 1988 arrest and conviction in his earlier \nasylum application. He had also provided documents at the time of his \nasylum, in Turkish, that described the Turkish government's view of his \nassociation with the PKK.\n  Last July, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detained Mr. \nParlak and DHS is now moving to deport Mr. Parlak, claiming a \ndeliberate misrepresentation of facts. Further, the Department of \nHomeland Security states that Mr. Parlak has been convicted of an \naggravated felony after admission to the United States because, in \n2004, the now-disbanded Turkish Security Court reopened his case from \n1990 and re-sentenced him for the crime of Kurdish separatism. The \n``new'' sentence imposed by the Security Court required less jail time \nthan Mr. Parlak had already served, and the Security Court closed its \nfile on Mr. Parlak. Turkey does not seek his extradition and has, in \nfact, no interest in his return and will not issue a special passport \nfor that purpose.\n  Despite his strong ties to his community and the lack of evidence \nthat he is a flight risk, Mr. Parlak continues to be held in prison \nwithout bond. The Department of Homeland Security says that Mr. Parlak \nis a ``terrorist,'' and therefore cannot be released. This \n``terrorist'' designation is based solely on Mr. Parlak's association \nwith the PKK in the 1980s. However, not only did Mr. Parlak outline his \ninvolvement with the PKK in his asylum application, at the time Mr. \nParlak was associated with the PKK, it was not designated as a \nterrorist organization. The State Department did not add the PKK to its \nlist of terrorist organizations until 1996.\n  I am concerned with the fact that the government continues to detain \nand is attempting to deport this model immigrant over activities he \ndisclosed in his application for asylum, an application which, again, \nwas granted. While it may be disputed why the box was not checked \naccurately, it is incongruous to conclude that he was intentionally \nhiding those facts from the Department of Justice in 1993, when he \ndetailed them explicitly to the Department of Justice in 1991.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Parlak is a good man and should be given the \nchance to remain in the United States and continue the life that he has \nbuilt for his community, his daughter and himself all these years. Our \nhistory is built upon the courage and hard work of immigrants who \nopposed brutal oppression and fled to our country seeking a new life. \nIbrahim Parlak is one of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3731-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3731-S3732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DRU'S LAW\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I rise today to describe S. 792, a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation called ``Dru's Law,'' which I introduced in the Senate \nyesterday.\n  This bill seeks to fill some gaping holes in our criminal justice \nsystem, made tragically evident by a recent tragedy in North Dakota.\n  In November 2003, Dru Sjodin, a student at the University of North \nDakota, was abducted in the parking lot of a Grand Forks shopping mall. \nShe was found in a ditch in Minnesota some 6 months later.\n  A suspect was eventually arrested and is awaiting trial. There is \nabundant evidence that he was responsible for Dru's abduction. The \nalleged assailant, Alfonso Rodriguez, Jr., had been released from \nprison only 6 months earlier, having served a 23-year sentence for rape \nin Minnesota. And what's more, Minnesota authorities had known that he \nwas at high risk of committing another sexual assault if released.\n  The Minnesota Department of Corrections had rated Rodriguez as a \n``type 3'' offender--meaning that he was at the highest risk for \nreoffending. In an evaluation conducted in January 2003, a prison \npsychiatrist wrote that Rodriguez had demonstrated ``a willingness to \nuse substantial force, including the use of a weapon, in order to gain \ncompliance from his victims.''\n  Despite this determination, the Minnesota Department of Corrections \nreleased Rodriguez in May 2003, and essentially washed its hands of the \ncase. Since Rodriguez had served the full term of his sentence, the \nDepartment of Corrections imposed no further supervision on him at all.\n  The Minnesota Department of Corrections could have recommended that \nthe State Attorney General seek what is known as a ``civil \ncommitment.'' Under this procedure, a State court would have required \nRodriguez to be confined as long as he posed a sufficient threat to the \npublic, even if he had served his original sentence. But the State \nAttorney General was never notified that Rodriguez was getting out, and \nthere was no chance for the Minnesota courts to consider the case.\n  So upon his release, Mr. Rodriguez went to live in Crookston, MN, \ncompletely unsupervised, a short distance from the Grand Forks shopping \nmall where Dru Sjodin was abducted.\n  To make matters worse, while Mr. Rodriguez registered as a sex \noffender in Minnesota, there was no indication of his release for \nnearby North Dakota communities. I suspect that most Americans would be \nsurprised to learn that there is currently no national sex offender \nregistry available to the public. So sex offender registries currently \nstop at State lines. Each State has its own sex offender registry, \nwhich tracks only its own residents.\n  For all intents and purposes, Rodriguez was free to prey on nearby \ncommunities in North Dakota, without fear of recognition.\n  This situation is simply unacceptable. We must do better. A recent \nstudy found that 72 percent of ``highest risk'' sexual offenders \nreoffend within 6 years of being released. And the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics has determined that sex offenders released from prison are \nover ten times more likely to be arrested for a sexual crime than \nindividuals who have no record of sexual assault. We cannot just \nrelease such individuals with no supervision whatsoever, and let them \nprey upon an unsuspecting public.\n  Today, I am reintroducing legislation that will hopefully help to \nprevent such breakdowns in our criminal justice system, and that will \ngive our citizens the tools to better protect themselves from sexual \noffenders.\n  This bill is cosponsored by Senator Specter, the new chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. It also has a growing list of bipartisan \ncosponsors, which currently includes Senators Conrad, Dayton, Coleman, \nLugar, Johnson, and Durbin.\n  The bill does the following three things:\n  First, it requires the Justice Department to create a national sex \noffender database accessible to the public through the Internet--with \ndata drawn from the FBI's existing National Sex Offender Registry. This \npublic website would allow users to specify a search radius across \nState lines, providing much more complete information on nearby sex \noffenders.\n  Second, it requires State prisons to notify States attorneys whenever \n``high risk'' offenders are about to be released, so that States \nattorneys can consider petitioning the courts for continued confinement \nof the offender. The ``civil commitment'' option is available under the \nlaw in many States, if an individual is deemed a continuing threat to \nthe public safety. In the Dru Sjodin case, prison officials did not \nalert the States attorney of Rodriguez' impending release. If they had \ndone so, this tragedy might have been avoided.\n  Third, it requires states to monitor ``high-risk'' offenders who are \nreleased after serving their full sentence--and\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\nare otherwise not subject to probation or other supervision--for a \nperiod of no less than 1 year.\n  The cost of these steps would be shared by the Federal Government and \nthe States. The Federal Government would bear the cost of maintaining \nthe national sex offender registry, and the States would bear the cost \nof supervising high risk offenders upon their release from prison.\n  To ensure compliance with these measures, the legislation would \nreduce Federal funding for prison construction by 25 percent for those \nStates that did not comply, and would reallocate such funds to States \nthat do comply with those provisions. This will be the ``stick'' that \nsome States may need to ensure that they comply with these important \nprotections.\n  I should note that this identical legislation was passed in the \nSenate toward the conclusion of the 108th Congress. It passed by \nunanimous consent, with the support of Senator Hatch, who was then the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee, and also with the support of \nSenator Leahy, who was--and remains--the ranking member of the \ncommittee.\n  Regrettably, the House of Representatives did not act on Dru's Law \nbefore adjourning in the last Congress, and so we must start the \nlegislative process on this bill again in the 109th Congress. But I am \ncommitted to getting this done, and I expect that the House will pass \nDru's Law in this Congress.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go to Dru Sjodin's family. I cannot \nguarantee that that passage of the legislation we are introducing today \nwill prevent such tragedies from ever occurring again. But I believe \nthat it will be a significant step toward making our neighborhoods \nsafer for our loved ones.\n  In recent weeks, we have had some very sad reminders of the need for \nsuch legislation. In February, 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford was abducted \nand murdered in Florida by a previously convicted sexual offender. The \noffender fled across State lines to Georgia, where he was apprehended. \nHe has now confessed to this brutal crime. Had he not been arrested, he \nmight well have offended again. This was, again, a reminder that while \nsex offender registries currently stop at State lines, sex offenders do \nnot.\n  Mark Lunsford, Jessica's father, has written in strong support of \nthis bill.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, \nto secure passage of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 792\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Mount \nVernon. Sergeant Lee, 26 years old, died on April 6 in a military \nhelicopter crash near Ghazni city, 80 miles southwest of Kabul. With \nhis entire life before him, Jimmy Shawn risked everything to fight for \nthe values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around \nthe world.\n  A 1997 graduate of Mount Vernon High School, Jimmy Shawn had served \nin the Marines for 8 years. Friends and family describe him as a man \nwho grew up longing to serve God and country. Jimmy was a devout \nChristian who aspired to travel the world as a missionary. His half-\nsister, Destiny Dowden, recounted that Jimmy Shawn was ``the most \nhonest, loving, giving and fun-loving person I ever met.'' His mother \nshared her pride in Jimmy Shawn's accomplishments, calling him ``our \nfamily's hero.''\n  Jimmy Shawn was killed while serving his country in Operation \nEnduring Freedom. This brave young soldier leaves behind his mother, \nBecky Blanchard and his half-sister, Destiny Dowden.\n  Today, I join Jimmy Shawn's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Jimmy Shawn, a memory that will burn \nbrightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\n  Jimmy Shawn was known for his deep faith, his dedication to his \nfamily and his love of country. Today and always, Jimmy Shawn will be \nremembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jimmy Shawn's \nsacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed \nthe families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot \ndedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave \nmen, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far \nabove our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor \nlong remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did \nhere.'' This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years \nago, as I am certain that the impact of Jimmy Shawn's actions will live \non far longer than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Sergeant James Shawn Lee in \nthe official record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Jimmy Shawn's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Jimmy Shawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3733-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECTING HONEST TAXPAYERS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today when so many Americans have to dig \ndeep to pay the taxes owed to Uncle Sam, it is particularly appropriate \nthat we focus on the hundreds of billions of dollars the U.S. Treasury \nis shortchanged each year by those who abuse the tax system. Because \nit's not just the Treasury that is shortchanged; it's honest taxpayers \nthroughout this country who end up picking up the tab.\n  Tax cheats are an insult to the men and women who serve in our \nmilitary, the children who attend our schools, and the millions who \nrely on Social Security. Tax cheats make it harder to maintain our \nhighways, protect our borders, advance medical research, and inspect \nour food. Not only do they drain money from the Treasury, they help \ndeepen the deficit ditch that threatens the economic well-being of our \nchildren and grandchildren. They also shift a huge burden onto the \nbacks of the honest taxpayers in this country.\n  It is also particularly appropriate to focus on the need to crack \ndown on tax cheats during this time of year when Congressional \nappropriators decide how to direct the Nation's resources. Just last \nmonth, the IRS updated its estimate of the Nation's ``tax gap''--the \ndifference between the amount of taxes owed by taxpayers and the amount \ncollected. The total tax gap in 2001 is now estimated to have been \nbetween $312 billion and $353 billion, and some experts believe it's \neven higher. $350 billion is more than the government spent on all of \nMedicare last year. It is three-quarters of the size of the Federal \ndeficit.\n  In fact, the tax gap is so huge that each individual U.S. taxpayer is \nnow forced to pay more than $2,000 in taxes annually to make up for the \ntaxpayers cheating Uncle Sam. The plain truth is that tax evaders are \nhurting honest Americans--not only by shrinking available resources for \nessential government services, but also by literally sticking honest \nAmericans with the tax bill they've dodged.\n  One of the greatest dodges is abusive tax shelters. For more than 2 \nyears, as ranking member of the U.S. Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, I've been investigating the abusive tax shelters being \ndeveloped and sold by professional firms such as accounting firms, law \nfirms and banks. Our investigation found tax shelter promoters \nknowingly selling dubious tax shelters to hundreds of U.S. taxpayers, \nin part, because they knew the IRS lacked the resources to stop them.\n  One of the tax shelters examined by the subcommittee, called \n``BLIPS,'' was sold to people facing large tax bills by accounting \ngiant KPMG. The IRS is now tracking down the hundreds of individuals \nwho bought BLIPS or a similar tax dodge. This abusive tax shelter was \nincluded in the $3.2 billion settlement announced by the IRS just last \nmonth. This successful settlement shows how huge the tax shelter \nproblem is, and how much can be done when the IRS enforces the law. It \nalso shows how critical it is for Congress to provide the IRS with \nadequate enforcement dollars to crack down on abusive tax shelters, the \npromoters who push them, and the taxpayers who evade their tax \nobligations.\n  The IRS also needs significant resources to track tax dodgers who \nhide their income in tax havens. An estimated 1 to 2 million \nindividuals dodge U.S. taxes by depositing funds in offshore bank \naccounts in tax havens with secrecy laws that impede IRS review. A \nrecent study found that, in 2003, U.S. multinational corporations \nshifted $75 billion in domestic profits to tax havens, leading to an \nestimated tax revenue loss of $10 to $20 billion. In addition, the \nGovernment Accountability Office has found that 59 of the top 100 \nFederal contractors owned tax haven subsidiaries, raising tax questions \nthat the IRS simply doesn't have the resources to unravel. U.S. tax \ndollars hidden in a tax haven leaves more honest taxpayers to make up \nthe difference.\n  Despite these and other growing tax shelter and tax haven abuses, the \nresources made available to the IRS for tax enforcement have been \nreduced over the past decade. Since fiscal year 1996, for example, the \nnumber of IRS enforcement personnel has declined by 20 percent. The IRS \naudit rate for businesses has dropped to just two audits for every \n1,000 businesses in 2003, a decline of 62 percent in 6 years. In \naddition to fewer audits, there have been fewer penalties, fewer tax \nevasion prosecutions, and virtually no effort to prosecute corporate \ntax crimes. Corporations used to pay 35 percent of our nation's tax \nbill, but now they pay less than 10 percent. In a 2004 study that \nSenator Dorgan and I requested, the Government Accountability Office \nfound that 94 percent of corporations who filed income tax returns with \nthe IRS from 1996 to 2000 paid taxes of less than 5 percent of their \nincome, and 60 percent didn't pay any Federal corporate income tax at \nall.\n  Last year, the IRS obtained sufficient funds for a slight increase in \nits enforcement efforts. The result was a $43.1 billion increase in \nenforcement revenue a jump of 15 percent over the previous year. The \nlesson here, which is consistent with years of data, is that a \nrelatively small increase in tax enforcement resources pays for itself \nmany times over by increasing the amount of revenue collected. In fact, \nfor every dollar invested in IRS' budget, the service yields more than \n$4 dollars in enforcement revenue. Beyond the additional revenues \ncollected, increased IRS enforcement deters those who might otherwise \nhave dodged their tax obligations and reassures honest taxpayers that \ncompliance with the law is not a chump's game. I can't think of many \nbetter investments to build respect for the law and respect for the \nhonest Americans who play by the rules and meet their tax obligations.\n  President Bush has apparently come around to a similar conclusion. In \na budget otherwise full of cutbacks, President Bush has advocated \nallocating $6.9 billion to tax enforcement efforts in FY 2006, with an \nemphasis on high-income individuals and corporations. This reflects an \nincrease of nearly 8 percent over last year's budget. Congress should \nsupport this request and provide the funds needed to stop tax evasion \nand ensure tax fairness. Otherwise honest taxpayers will continue to \nshoulder more and more of the tax burden left by abusive tax shelters \nand tax haven gamesmanship. It is time to take action against the tax \ncheats who not only undermine the integrity of the Federal tax system, \nbut also hike the tax bills for honest taxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3733-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3734-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3734]]\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3734-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1134) ``To \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the proper tax \ntreatment of certain disaster mitigation payments.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3734-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1745.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nhonor Abraham Lincoln with a commemorative coin and provide funds to \nthe Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, which has been charged by \nCongress with planning the celebration of Lincoln's bicentennial in \n2009.\n  The bill authorizes the Treasury to mint 500,000 one dollar silver \ncoins. The design, which will represent the life and legacy of Abraham \nLincoln, will be selected by the Secretary after consultation with the \nCommission of Fine Arts and the ALBC and reviewed by the Citizens \nCoinage Advisory Committee.\n  The coins will be sold for face value plus a $10 surcharge and the \ncost of designing and issuing them. All funds collected by the \nsurcharge will be provided to the ALBC to further its work.\n  Abraham Lincoln was one of our greatest leaders, demonstrating \nenormous courage and strength of character during the Civil War, \nperhaps the greatest crisis in our Nation's history. Lincoln was born \nin Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, \nand led the Nation in Washington, D.C. He rose to the Presidency \nthrough a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and \ncommitment to the United States.\n  Adhering to the belief that all men are created equal, Lincoln led \nthe effort to free all slaves in the United States. Despite the great \npassions aroused by the Civil War, Lincoln had a generous heart and \nacted with malice toward none and with charity for all. Lincoln made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an \nassassin's bullet on April 15, 1865. All Americans could benefit from \nstudying the life of Abraham Lincoln, As we near the bicentennial of \nLincoln's birth, we should recognize his great achievement in ensuring \nthat the United States remained one Nation, united and inseparable.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 812. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a \nflat tax only on Individual taxable earned income and business taxable \nincome, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this week, American taxpayers face \nanother Federal income tax deadline. The date of April 15 stabs fear, \nanxiety, and unease into the hearts of millions of Americans. Every \nyear during ``tax season,'' millions of Americans spend their evenings \nporing over page after page of IRS instructions, going through their \nrecords looking for information and struggling to find and fill out all \nthe appropriate forms on the Federal tax returns. Americans are \nintimidated by the sheer number of different tax forms and their \ninstructions, many of which they may be unsure whether they need to \nfile. Given the approximately 325 possible forms, not to mention the \ninstructions that accompany them, simply trying to determine which form \nto file can in itself be a daunting and overwhelming task. According to \na 2002 study conducted by the Tax Foundation, American taxpayers, \nincluding businesses, spend more than 5.8 billion hours and $194 \nbillion each year in complying with tax laws. That works out to more \nthan $2,400 per U.S. household. Much of this time is spent burrowing \nthrough IRS laws and regulations which fill 17,000 pages and have grown \nfrom 744,000 words in 1955 to over 6.9 million words in 2000. By \ncontrast, the Pledge of Allegiance has only 31 words, the Gettysburg \nAddress has 267 words, the Declaration of Independence has about 1,300 \nwords, and the Bible has only about 1,773,000 words.\n  The majority of taxpayers still face filing tax forms that are far \ntoo complicated and take far too long to complete. According to the \nestimated preparation time listed on the forms by the IRS, the 2004 \nForm 1040 is estimated to take 13 hours and 35 minutes to complete. \nMoreover this does not include the estimated time to complete the \naccompanying schedules, such as Schedule A, for itemized deductions, \nwhich carries an estimated preparation time of 5 hours, 37 minutes, or \nSchedule D, for reporting capital gains and losses, shows an estimated \npreparation time of 6 hours, 10 minutes. Moreover, this complexity is \ngetting worse each year. Just from 2000 to 2004 the estimated time to \nprepare Form 1040 jumped 34 minutes.\n  It is no wonder that well over half of all taxpayers, 56 percent \naccording to a recent survey, now hire an outside professional to \nprepare their tax returns for them. However, the fact that only about \n30 percent of individuals itemize their deductions shows that a \nsignificant percentage of our taxpaying population believes that the \ntax system is too complex for them to deal with. We all understand that \npaying taxes will never be something we enjoy, but neither should it be \ncruel and unusual punishment. Further, the pace of change to the \nInternal Revenue Code is brisk--Congress made about 9,500 tax code \nchanges in the past thirteen years. And we are far from being finished. \nYear after year, we continue to ask the same question--isn't there a \nbetter way?\n  My flat tax legislation would make filing a tax return a manageable \nchore, not a seemingly endless nightmare, for most taxpayers. My flat \ntax legislation will fundamentally revise the present tax code, with \nits myriad rates, deductions, and instructions. This legislation would \ninstitute a simple, flat 20 percent tax rate for all individuals and \nbusinesses. This proposal is not cast in stone, but is intended to move \nthe debate forward by focusing attention on three key principles which \nare critical to an effective and equitable taxation system: simplicity, \nfairness and economic growth.\n  My flat tax plan would eliminate the kinds of frustrations I have \noutlined above for millions of taxpayers. This flat tax would enable us \nto scrap the great majority of the IRS rules, regulations and \ninstructions and delete most of the 6.9 million words in the Internal \nRevenue Code. Instead of billions of hours of non-productive time spent \nin compliance with, or avoidance of, the tax code, taxpayers would \nspend only the small amount of time necessary to fill out a postcard-\nsized form. Both business and individual taxpayers would thus find \nvaluable hours freed up to engage in productive business activity, or \nfor more time with their families, instead of poring over tax tables, \nschedules and regulations.\n\n  My flat tax proposal is dramatic, but so are its advantages: a \ntaxation system that is simple, fair and designed to maximize \nprosperity for all Americans. A summary of the key advantages are:\n  Simplicity: A 10-line postcard filing would replace the myriad forms \nand attachments currently required, thus saving Americans up to 5.8 \nbillion hours they currently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  Cuts Government: The flat tax would eliminate the lion's share of IRS \nrules, regulations and requirements, which have grown from 744,000 \nwords in 1955 to 6.9 million words and 17,000 pages currently. It would \nalso allow us to slash the mammoth IRS bureaucracy of approximately \n117,000 employees, creating opportunities to put their expertise to use \nelsewhere in the government or in private industry.\n  Promotes Economic Growth: Economists estimate a growth due to a flat \ntax of over $2 trillion in national wealth over seven years, \nrepresenting an increase of approximately $7,500 in personal wealth for \nevery man, woman and child in America. This growth would also lead to \nthe creation of 6 million new jobs.\n  Increases Efficiency: Investment decisions would be made on the basis \nof productivity rather than simply for tax\n\n[[Page S3737]]\n\navoidance, thus leading to even greater economic expansion.\n  Reduces Interest Rates: Economic forecasts indicate that interest \nrates would fall substantially, by as much as two points, as the flat \ntax removes many of the current disincentives to savings.\n  Lowers compliance costs: Americans would be able to save or invert up \nto $194 billion they currently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  Decreases fraud: As tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is \nsimplified, there will be far less opportunity for tax avoidance and \nfraud, which now amounts to over $120 billion in uncollected revenue \nannually.\n  Reduces IRS costs: Simplification of the tax code will allow us to \nsave significantly on the $10 billion annual budget currently allocated \nto the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The most dramatic way to illustrate the flat tax is to consider that \nthe income tax form for the flat tax is printed on a postcard--it will \nallow all taxpayers to file their April 15 tax returns on a simple 10-\nline postcard. This postcard will take 15 minutes to fill out.\n  At my town hall meetings across Pennsylvania, there is considerable \npublic support for fundamental tax reform.\n  This is a win-win situation for America because it lowers the tax \nburden on the taxpayers in the lower brackets. For example in the 2004 \ntax year, the standard deduction is $4,850 for a single taxpayer, \n$7,150 for a head of household and $9,700 for a married couple filing \njointly, while the personal exemption for individuals and dependents is \n$3,100. Thus, under the current tax code, a family of four which does \nnot itemize deductions would pay taxes on all income over $22,100--that \nis personal exemptions of$12,400 and a standard deduction of $9,700. By \ncontrast, under my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a \npersonal exemption of $30,000, and would pay tax on only income over \nthat amount.\n  The tax loopholes enable write-offs of some $393 billion a year. What \nis eliminated under the flat tax are the loopholes, the deductions in \nthis complicated code which can be deciphered, interpreted, and found \nreally only by the $500-an-hour lawyers. That money is lost to the \ntaxpayers. $120 billion would be saved by the elimination of fraud \nbecause of the simplicity of the Tax Code, the taxpayer being able to \nfind out exactly what they owe.\n\n  This bill is modeled after a proposal organized and written by two \nvery distinguished professors of law from Stanford University, \nProfessor Hall and Professor Rabushka. Their model was first introduced \nin the Congress in the fall of 1994 by Majority Leader Richard Armey. I \nintroduced the flat tax bill--the first one in the Senate--on March 2, \n1995, Senate bill 488. On October 27, 1995, I introduced a Sense of the \nSenate Resolution calling on my colleagues to expedite Congressional \nadoption of a flat tax. The Resolution, which was introduced as an \namendment to pending legislation, was not adopted. I reintroduced my \nlegislation in the 105th Congress with slight modifications to reflect \ninflation-adjusted increases in the personal allowances and dependent \nallowances. I re-reintroduced the bill on April 15, 1999--income tax \nday--in a bill denominated as S. 822. I then introduced my flat tax \nlegislation as an amendment to S. 1429, the Tax Reconciliation bill; \nthe amendment was not adopted. During the 108th Congress, I introduced \nmy flat tax legislation once again on April 11, 2003. On May 14, 2003, \nI offered an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation legislation urging the \nSenate to hold hearings and consider legislation providing for a flat \ntax; this amendment passed by a vote of 70 to 30 on May 15, 2003. I \nthen testified on this issue at a subsequent hearing held by the Joint \nEconomic Committee on November 5, 2003.\n  Over the years and prior to my legislative efforts on behalf of flat \ntax reform, I have devoted considerable time and attention to analyzing \nour nation's tax code and the policies which underlie it. I began the \nstudy of the complexities of the tax code over 40 years ago as a law \nstudent at Yale University. I included some tax law as part of my \npractice in my early years as an attorney in Philadelphia. In the \nspring of 1962, I published a law review article in the Villanova Law \nReview, ``Pension and Profit Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operation for \nClosely Held Corporations and Professional Associations,'' 7 Villanova \nL. Rev. 335, which in part focused on the inequity in making tax-exempt \nretirement benefits available to some kinds of businesses but not \nothers. It was apparent then, as it is now, that the very complexities \nof the Internal Revenue Code could be used to give unfair advantage to \nsome. Einstein himself is quoted as saying ``the hardest thing in the \nworld to understand is the income tax.''\n  The Hall-Rabushka model envisioned a flat tax with no deductions \nwhatever. After considerable reflection, I decided to include in the \nlegislation limited deductions for home mortgage interest for up to \n$100,000 in borrowing and charitable contributions up to $2,500. While \nthese modifications undercut the pure principle of the flat tax by \ncontinuing the use of tax policy to promote home buying and charitable \ncontributions, I believe that those two deductions are so deeply \ningrained in the financial planning of American families that they \nshould be retained as a matter of fairness and public policy--and also \npolitical practicality. With those two deductions maintained, passage \nof a modified flat tax will be difficult, but without them, probably \nimpossible.\n  In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment of a \nmodified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall advised that \nthe revenue neutrality ofthe Hall-Rabushka proposal, which uses a 19 \npercent rate, is based on a well-documented model founded on reliable \ngovernmental statistics. My legislation raises that rate from 19 \npercent to 20 percent to accommodate retaining limited home mortgage \ninterest and charitable deductions.\n  This proposal taxes business revenues fully at their source, so that \nthere is no personal taxation on interest, dividends, capital gains, \ngifts or estates. Restructured in this way, the tax code can become a \npowerful incentive for savings and investment--which translates into \neconomic growth and expansion, more and better jobs, and raising the \nstandard of living for all Americans.\n  The key advantages of this flat tax plan are threefold: First, it \nwill dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. Second, it will remove \nmuch of the IRS regulatory morass now imposed on individual and \ncorporate taxpayers, and allow those taxpayers to devote more of their \nenergies to productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which \nrewards savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic growth \nin all sectors of the economy as more money flows into investments and \nsavings accounts.\n  Professors Hall and Rabushka have projected that within seven years \nof enactment, this type of a flat tax would produce a 6 percent \nincrease in output from increased total work in the U.S. economy and \nincreased capital formation. The economic growth would mean a $7,500 \nincrease in the personal income of all Americans. No one likes to pay \ntaxes. But Americans will be much more willing to pay their taxes under \na system that they believe is fair, a system that they can understand, \nand a system that they recognize promotes rather than prevents growth \nand prosperity. My flat tax legislation will afford Americans such a \ntax system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my flat tax postcard, a \nvariety of specific cases that illustrate the fairness and simplicity \nof this flat tax, and an example flat tax table be printed in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS15AP05.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS15AP05.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS15AP05.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S3741]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS15AP05.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 812\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part D of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nnegotiate for lower prices for medicare prescription drugs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Prescription Drug and Health Improvement Act of 2005 to \nreduce the high prices of prescription drugs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I introduced a similar version of this bill in the 108th \nCongress, S. 2766. To increase the likelihood that this bill may become \nlaw this bill does not include a costly provision which would have \nclosed the gap in prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Americans, specifically senior citizens, pay the highest prices in \nthe world for brand-name prescription drugs. With 45 million uninsured \nAmericans and many more senior citizens without an adequate \nprescription drug benefit, filling a doctor's prescription is \nunaffordable for many people in this country. The United States has the \ngreatest health care system in the world; however, too many seniors are \nforced to make difficult choices between life-sustaining prescription \ndrugs and daily necessities.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that in 2004 \nper capita spending on prescription drugs rose approximately 12 \npercent, with a similar rate of growth expected for this year. Much of \nthe increase in drug spending is due to higher utilization and the \nshift from older, lower cost drugs to newer, higher cost drugs. \nHowever, rapidly increasing drug prices are a critical component.\n  High drug prices, combined with the surging older population, are \nalso taking a toll on State budgets and private sector health insurance \nbenefits. Medicaid spending on prescription drugs increased at an \naverage annual rate of nearly 19 percent between 1998 and 2002. Until \nlower priced drugs are available, pressures will continue to squeeze \npublic programs at both the State and Federal level.\n  To address these problems, my legislation would reduce the high \nprices of prescription drugs to seniors by repealing the prohibition \nagainst interference by the Secretary of HHS with negotiations between \ndrug manufacturers, pharmacies, and prescription drug plan sponsors and \ninstead authorize the Secretary to negotiate contracts with \nmanufacturers of covered prescription drugs. It will allow the \nSecretary of HHS to use Medicare's large beneficiary population to \nleverage bargaining power to obtain lower prescription drug prices for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Price negotiations between the Secretary of HHS and prescription drug \nmanufacturers would be analogous to the ability of the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to negotiate prescription drug prices with \nmanufacturers. This bargaining power enables veterans to receive \nprescription drugs at a significant cost savings. According to the \nNational Association of Chain Drug Stores, the average ``cash cost'' of \na prescription in 2001 was $40.22. The average cost in the Veterans \nAffairs (VA) health care system in fiscal year 2001 was $22.87.\n  In the 108th Congress, in my capacity as chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I introduced the Veterans Prescription Drugs \nAssistance Act, S. 1153, which was reported out of committee, but was \nnot considered before the full Senate. In the 109th Congress, I have \nagain introduced the Veterans Prescription Drugs Assistance Act, S. \n614.\n  This legislation will broaden the ability of veterans to access the \nVeterans Affairs' Prescription Drug Program. Under my bill, all \nMedicare-eligible veterans will be able to purchase medications at a \ntremendous price reduction through the Veterans Affairs' Prescription \nDrug Program. In many cases, this will save veterans who are Medicare \nbeneficiaries up to 50 percent on the cost of prescribed medications, a \nsignificant savings for veterans. Similar savings may be available to \nAmerica's seniors from the savings achieved using the HHS bargaining \npower, like the Veterans Affairs bargaining power for the benefit of \nveterans. These savings may provide America's seniors with fiscal \nrelief from the increasing costs of prescription drugs.\n  I believe this bill can provide desperately needed access to \ninexpensive, effective prescription drugs for America's seniors. The \ntime has come for concerted action in this arena. I urge my colleagues \nto move this legislation forward promptly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 813\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \n15-year applicable recovery period for depreciation of certain electric \ntransmission property; to the Commission on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to \nencourage the construction of electric transmission lines. One of the \nbiggest energy problems our country faces is a lack of electric \ntransmission capacity. Recently, my home State of Wyoming joined forces \nwith Utah, Nevada, and California in a partnership to create a new \ntransmission line--the Frontier Line--to send coal-generated \nelectricity to the West Coast.\n  Demand for electricity in the West has grown by 60 percent in the \nlast two decades, while transmission capacity has grown by only 20 \npercent. But ours is certainly not the only region affected. Energy \nproduction and distribution is a serious issue affecting all Americans. \nFrom our dependence on foreign oil and natural gas, to limited refining \ncapacity and distribution ability, never mind development of non-\ntraditional fuels, we need to get our energy house in order. I have \nlong-favored a comprehensive energy policy and will continue to \nchampion that cause because it is badly needed and the right thing to \ndo.\n  One piece of any energy policy needs to be providing for electric \ntransmission capacity. If we're producing a surplus in one area of the \ncountry but can't convey it to other areas that need it, it doesn't do \nanyone any good. The bill I introduce today will help alleviate the \nproblem by making it less expensive to invest in electric transmission \nlines that we badly need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 815\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

At this time?\n  We have an Executive Branch that is organized in such a way as to \nmake prosecution of unfair trade cases unlikely at best. When you \ncouple this with the fact that our government has sat idle as our \ndomestic manufacturing base has eroded due to unfair trade practices, \nit becomes very clear that we have put our manufacturers in an \nimpossible situation.\n  Under the current structure of the office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, we are asking our Trade Representative to do too much. \nQuite simply, the office is not able to deliver.\n  The current structure demands that they negotiate trade agreements \nwith foreign nations and simultaneously enforce other agreements with \nthose same countries--all without damaging the U.S.'s ability to \nnegotiate the next trade deal.\n  It's not working. And, while significant portions of our trade \nimbalances are not caused by lax enforcement, much of it is.\n  In February, the Department of Commerce reported that the merchandise \ntrade deficit reached a record level of $666.2 billion in the 2004, a \n21.7 percent increase since 2003.\n  If we can address any portion of this deficit we must do it. This \nbill represents a straight-forward, common-sense solution.\n  There are many U.S. industries facing unfair trade practices and this \nbill represents an institutional change that will allow the U.S. to \nthoroughly and vigorously investigate and prosecute these cases.\n  For instance, China is a textbook case of how a foreign government \nhas used a network of illegal subsidies and government interventions in \norder to destroy foreign competition, both in the United States as well \nas in many other countries.\n  According to the U.S. China Economic and Security Commission, these \nactions have gone virtually unchallenged by the U.S. government, \ndespite the fact that China's actions are in clear violations of both \nU.S. trade law and WTO rules.\n  These ``anti-competitive actions by China's government include \ncurrency manipulation (estimated to provide as much as a 40 percent \nsubsidy for Chinese exporters), illegal direct government subsidies of \nits money losing state-owned textile and apparel sectors, illegal \nexport tax rebates (13 percent) and the deliberate extension of\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\nbillions of dollars in non-performing (``free money'') loans by China's \ncentral banks in order to award a competitive advantage against foreign \ncompetition.''\n  The Commission goes on to say that ``in the case of China, the \ndramatic increase in subsidies has caused Chinese prices to drop by an \naverage of 58 percent over the past two years in those product areas \nwhere quotas have been removed. As a result, China has gained a near \nmonopoly share in these products over the last 24 months, taking 60 \npercent of the market.''\n  However, the U.S. government has failed to file any complaints at the \nWTO, despite the Chinese government's repeated and widespread \nviolations of WTO rules.\n  Our government's inaction is costing us millions of American jobs, \ncrippling our manufacturing sector, distorting trade and investment \npatterns globally, and leaving hundreds of millions of Chinese workers \nvulnerable and mistreated.\n  Let me give you a concrete example of the violations that are \noccurring.\n  Counterfeit automotive products are a big problem in my home State of \nMichigan. Not only does it kill American jobs, but it has the potential \nto kill Americans as cheap shoddy automotive products replace \nlegitimate ones of higher-quality.\n  The American automotive parts and components industry looses an \nestimated $12 billion in sales on a global basis to counterfeiting.\n  And, we don't even keep statistics on the potential loss of life.\n  As many have said, we should understand that, if left unchecked, \npenetration by counterfeit automotive products, as well as other \nmanufactured goods, has the potential to undermine the public's \nconfidence and trust in what they are buying. We can't let that happen.\n  In Michigan, we lost 51,000 manufacturing jobs between 1989 and 2003 \ndue to China's unfair trade practices, according to the Economic Policy \nInstitute.\n  Unfortunately, the plant closings continue in Michigan and around the \nNation. Over the past three months we see example after example of the \ndamage a ``wait and see'' attitude has on workers in this country.\n  We should not be shirking our responsibilities to enforce trade \nrules. This Bill helps us reverse the course upon which we find \nourselves--it helps us save American jobs.\n  I believe in trade and the benefits it can have for our \nmanufacturers, farmers, and other industries. But, we need to have fair \ntrade first and foremost.\n  A Special Trade Prosecutor would have the power to stand up for our \nmanufacturers and farmers and make sure that other countries are \nholding up their end of their trade agreements.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 817\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CREATION OF SPECIAL TRADE PROSECUTOR.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Position.--Section 141(b)(2) of the \n     Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2171(b)(2)) is amended to read \n     as follows:\n       ``(2) There shall be in the Office 3 Deputy United States \n     Trade Representatives, 1 Chief Agricultural Negotiator, and 1 \n     Special Trade Prosecutor. The 3 Deputy United States Trade \n     Representatives, the Chief Agricultural Negotiator, and the \n     Special Trade Prosecutor shall be appointed by the President, \n     by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. As an \n     exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, any \n     nomination of a Deputy United States Trade Representative, \n     the Chief Agricultural Negotiator, or the Special Trade \n     Prosecutor submitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent, and referred to a committee, shall be referred to \n     the Committee on Finance.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nreallocate costs of the Pactola Dam and Reservoir, South Dakota, to \nreflect increased demands for municipal, industrial, and fish and \nwildlife purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat codifies an agreement between the City of Rapid City, SD and the \nRapid Valley Water Conservancy District for a water service contract. \nThe renegotiated agreement reallocates the costs of the Pactola Dam to \nbetter reflect the City's growing need for municipal water supply and \nthe Rapid Valley District's decreasing demand for irrigation.\n  The legislation implements an agreement to improve upon the current \nmunicipal, industrial, irrigation, recreation, and wildlife \nrequirements of Rapid City and the Rapid Valley District. It is my hope \nthat this legislation can be quickly approved to facilitate the \ncompletion of this contract.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Pactola Reservoir \nReallocation Authorization Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 819\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pactola Reservoir \n     Reallocation Authorization Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is appropriate to reallocate the costs of the \n     Pactola Dam and Reservoir, South Dakota, to reflect increased \n     demands for municipal, industrial, and fish and wildlife \n     purposes; and\n       (2) section 302 of the Department of Energy Organization \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7152) prohibits such a reallocation of costs \n     without congressional approval.\n\n     SEC. 3. REALLOCATION OF COSTS OF PACTOLA DAM AND RESERVOIR, \n                   SOUTH DAKOTA.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior may, as provided in the \n     contract of August 2001 entered into between Rapid City, \n     South Dakota, and the Rapid Valley Conservancy District, \n     reallocate, in a manner consistent with Federal reclamation \n     law (the Act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 388, chapter 1093), \n     and Acts supplemental to and amendatory of that Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 371 et seq.)), the construction costs of Pactola Dam \n     and Reservoir, Rapid Valley Unit, Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin \n     Program, South Dakota, from irrigation purposes to municipal, \n     industrial, and fish and wildlife purposes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 820. A bill to promote the development of health care cooperatives \nthat will help businesses to pool the health care purchasing power of \nemployers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, I am introducing legislation to help businesses \nform group-purchasing cooperatives to obtain enhanced benefits, to \nreduce health care rates, and to improve quality for their employees' \nhealth care.\n  High health care costs are burdening businesses and employees across \nthe Nation. These costs are digging into profits and preventing access \nto affordable health care. Too many patients feel trapped by the \nsystem, with decisions about their health dictated by costs rather than \nby what they need.\n  Nationally, the annual average cost to an employer for an employee's \nhealth care is $6,348. In my home State of Wisconsin it is even \nhigher--the average cost there is $7,618. We must curb these rapidly \nincreasing health care costs. I strongly support initiatives to ensure \nthat everyone has access to health care. It is crucial that we support \nsuccessful local initiatives to reduce health care premiums and to \nimprove the quality of employees' health care.\n  By using group purchasing to obtain rate discounts, some employers \nhave been able to reduce the cost of health\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\ncare premiums for their employees. According to the National Business \nCoalition on Health, there are nearly 80 employer-led coalitions across \nthe United States that collectively purchase health care. Through these \npools, businesses are able to proactively challenge high costs and \ninefficient delivery of health care and share information on quality. \nThese coalitions represent over 10,000 employers nationwide.\n  Improving the quality of health care will also lower the cost of \ncare. By investing in the delivery of quality health care, we will be \nable to lower long term health care costs. Effective care, such as \nquality preventive services, can reduce overall health care \nexpenditures. Health purchasing coalitions help promote these services \nand act as an employer forum for networking and education on health \ncare cost containment strategies. They can help foster a dialogue with \nhealth care providers, insurers, and local HMOs.\n  Health care markets are local. Problems with cost, quality, and \naccess to health care are felt most intensely in the local markets. \nHealth care coalitions can function best when they are formed and \nimplemented locally. Local employers of large and small businesses have \nformed health care coalitions to track health care trends, create a \ndemand for quality and safety, and encourage group purchasing.\n  In Wisconsin, there have been various successful initiatives that \nhave formed health care purchasing cooperatives to improve quality of \ncare and to reduce cost. For example, the Employer Health Care Alliance \nCooperative, an employer-owned and employer-directed not-for-profit \ncooperative, has developed a network of health care providers in Dane \nCounty and 12 surrounding counties on behalf of its 160 member \nemployers. Through this pooling effort, employers are able to obtain \naffordable, high-quality health care for their 87,500 employees and \ndependents.\n  This legislation seeks to build on successful local initiatives, such \nas the Alliance, that help businesses to join together to increase \naccess to affordable and high-quality health care.\n  The Promoting Health Care Purchasing Cooperatives Act would authorize \ngrants to a group of businesses so that they could form group-\npurchasing cooperatives to obtain enhanced benefits, reduce health care \nrates, and improve quality.\n  This legislation offers two separate grant programs to help different \ntypes of businesses pool their resources and bargaining power. Both \nprograms would aid businesses to form cooperatives. The first program \nwould help large businesses that sponsor their own health plans, while \nthe second program would help small businesses that purchase their \nhealth insurance.\n  My bill would enable larger businesses to form cost-effective \ncooperatives that could offer quality health care through several ways. \nFirst, they could obtain health services through pooled purchasing from \nphysicians, hospitals, home health agencies, and others. By pooling \ntheir experience and interests, employers involved in a coalition could \nbetter address essential issues, such as rising health insurance rates \nand the lack of comparable health care quality data. They would be able \nto share information regarding the quality of these services and to \npartner with these health care providers to meet the needs of their \nemployees.\n  For smaller businesses that purchase their health insurance, the \nformation of cooperatives would allow them to buy health insurance at \nlower prices through pooled purchasing. Also, the communication within \nthese cooperatives would provide employees of small businesses with \nbetter information about the health care options that are available to \nthem. Finally, coalitions would serve to promote quality improvements \nby facilitating partnerships between their group and the health care \nproviders.\n  By working together, the group could develop better quality insurance \nplans and negotiate better rates.\n  This legislation also tries to alleviate the burden that our Nation's \nfarmers face when trying to purchase health care for themselves, their \nfamilies, and their employees. Because the health insurance industry \nlooks upon farming as a high-risk profession, many farmers are priced \nout of, or simply not offered, health insurance. By helping farmers \njoin cooperatives to purchase health insurance, we will help increase \ntheir health insurance options.\n  Past health purchasing pool initiatives have focused only on cost and \nhave tried to be all things for all people. My legislation creates an \nincentive to join the pools by giving grants to a group of similar \nbusinesses to form group-purchasing cooperatives. The pools are also \ngiven flexibility to find innovative ways to lower costs, such as \nenhancing benefits, for example, more preventive care, and improving \nquality. Finally, the cooperative structure is a proven model, which \ncreates an incentive for businesses to remain in the pool because they \nwill be invested in the organization.\n  I am pleased that this bill is supported by the National Business \nCoalition on Health, an organization that already understands that \nallowing businesses to come together to increase their health care \npurchasing power can lead to an increase in health care quality, and a \ndecrease in health care costs.\n  We must reform health care in America and give employers and \nemployees more options. This legislation, by providing for the \nformation of cost-effective coalitions that will also improve the \nquality of care, contributes to this essential reform process. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this proposal to improve the \nquality and costs of health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 820\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Health Care \n     Purchasing Cooperatives Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care spending in the United States has reached \n     15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United \n     States, yet 45,000,000 people, or 15.6 percent of the \n     population, remains uninsured.\n       (2) After nearly a decade of manageable increases in \n     commercial insurance premiums, many employers are now faced \n     with consecutive years of double digit premium increases.\n       (3) Purchasing cooperatives owned by participating \n     businesses are a proven method of achieving the bargaining \n     power necessary to manage the cost and quality of employer-\n     sponsored health plans and other employee benefits.\n       (4) The Employer Health Care Alliance Cooperative has \n     provided its members with health care purchasing power \n     through provider contracting, data collection, activities to \n     enhance quality improvements in the health care community, \n     and activities to promote employee health care consumerism.\n       (5) According to the National Business Coalition on Health, \n     there are nearly 80 employer-led coalitions across the United \n     States that collectively purchase health care, proactively \n     challenge high costs and the inefficient delivery of health \n     care, and share information on quality. These coalitions \n     represent more than 10,000 employers.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to build off of \n     successful local employer-led health insurance initiatives by \n     improving the value of their employees' health care.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to prevent the retroactive application of changes to \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline Quality Bank valuation methodologies; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and fellow \nAlaska Senator Ted Stevens to introduce legislation concerning a \ncomplex issue, the Quality Bank that is used to facilitate payments \nbetween shippers using the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline System to reflect \nvariations in the value of different crude oil streams that are \ninjected into the pipeline.\n  Since its opening in June 1977, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, \nTAPS, has carried crude oil from Alaska's North Slope to Valdez where \nthe oil is shipped to market. The pipeline carries crude oil from \nvarious sources and of varying quality--the oil injected into the line \nbefore the pipeline's Pump Station One near Deadhorse, AK, and \ncommingled as the blended stream of oil travels south to Valdez. The \nTAPS Quality Bank was established to compensate producers of higher \nquality crude oil for the difference in the value of the crude injected \nat the North Slope and that of the lower-quality commingled stream \nreceived in Valdez, since each shipper receives a quantity of the \nblended stream equivalent to the amount it injected into the line.\n  Companies injecting low-quality crude oil pay into the Quality Bank, \nwhile companies injecting high quality crude receive a payment from the \nQuality Bank. In addition, between the North Slope and Valdez, two \nrefineries, Flint Hills and Petro Star, withdraw a portion of the \ncommon stream from TAPS, partially refine the crude oil into products \nsuch as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and reinject into TAPS the other \ncomponents of crude left over after their refinery processes. Each fuel \nextracted from the crude is called a ``cut.'' To compensate producers \nfor the loss in value of the crude oil because of what is removed by \nthese refineries, refiners also pay into the Quality Bank. The \nobjective of the Quality Bank is to make monetary adjustments so that \neach shipper is in the same economic position it would enjoy if it \nreceived the same oil in Valdez that it delivered to TAPS on the \nstate's North Slope.\n  The methodology used to determine Quality Bank payments has been a \nsubject of controversy since the Quality Bank's creation. The problem \narises because there is no independent market for the crude injected on \nthe North Slope and thus no way to objectively determine its value. The \nmethodology is set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Since \nthe early 1980s, FERC-approved methodologies have been challenged in \ncourt and revised multiple times. In 1993, the majority of North Slope \nshippers proposed and FERC approved a settlement calling for the use of \na ``distillation'' methodology, which would value crude oil based on \nthe market price of various cuts created when the components are \nseparated based on different boiling points--the distillation process. \nThis methodology replaced the former ``gravity'' methodology where oil \nwas valued based on its relative gravity.\n  Since 1993, disputes have focused largely on the valuation of cuts at \nthe highest boiling points--the ``Heavy Distillate'' cut that \nevaporates at temperatures between 350 and 650 degrees F. and the \nResid, residual, cut, which includes the portion remaining after \ndistillation of all other cuts at boiling points up to 1050 degrees F. \nTwo additional cuts are also at issue, the VGO and Naptha cuts.\n  In 1997, responding to a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, FERC \napproved a settlement with a revised valuation methodology for \nDistillate and Resid. Under the FERC order, the new valuation \nmethodologies were to be applied on a prospective basis only. Later, \nthe D.C. Circuit in 1999 told FERC to revise some particular details of \nthe Resid valuation and also held that FERC had ``failed to provide an \nadequate explanation'' as to why the new methodology should not be made \nretroactive to 1993.\n  Responding to the ruling, the Administrative Law Judge, who in 1997 \nhad decided that all changes should only apply prospectively, reversed \nhis position and released a decision in August 2004 calling for changes \nin the Resid and Heavy Distillate cuts to be applied retroactively, in \nthe case of Resid to as far back as 1993. In addition, the \nadministrative law judge decided to apply new valuations for VGO and \nNaptha, prospectively. Currently, the judge's decision is awaiting a \nfinal decision by the FERC on whether to impose the Initial Decision or \nalter it.\n  There are clearly major public policy implications resulting from \nthis Quality Bank issue. While the bank is a ``zero sum'' game as far \nas money paid in and out of the bank is concerned, the impacts on the \nparties and thus on the citizens of Alaska are anything but equal.\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\n  For decades Alaskans suffered under the impacts of having to import \nall refined fuel products into the State from West Coast refineries. \nBesides higher prices caused by transportation, that left the State \nwholly dependent on fuel supplies that needed to travel at least 2,000 \nmiles on average to reach Alaska consumers--sometimes through bad \nweather and difficult sea conditions. With the construction of in-State \nrefineries, Alaskans finally saw greater security of supply, less \ndependence upon weather for shipment arrivals, and the possibility of \nlower fuel prices because of potentially reduced transportation costs. \nThe greater dependability of fuel supplies improved aviation freight \nshipments at the Anchorage and Fairbanks international airports, \nhelping create jobs in air freight and related industries.\n  But the decision of the Administrative Law Judge to apply new Quality \nBank methodology assessments retroactively, places the economics of in-\nState refineries at risk. That in turn not only impacts the job \nsecurity for the roughly 400 Alaskans who work at the refineries, but \nalso threatens the State's energy and economic security.\n  The problem is that both of the refineries must make long- and short-\nterm business decisions based on crude costs when they process crude \noil into product. Refineries optimize their production slates based on \ncurrent market realities. It is difficult for them to operate, given \nlow profit margins, if oil values can change years later as a result of \nQuality Bank decisions. They simply have no way to make rational \nbusiness decisions when the value of their products can be determined \nretroactively long after they can protect themselves for perceived \nmistakes in FERC-approved valuation methodologies. This certainly \nthreatens the ability of the refineries to attract capital, money \nneeded for them to modernize and meet new ultra-low sulfur diesel \n``clean fuel'' requirements soon to go into effect.\n\n  The State's Congressional Delegation last fall in report language \nadded to the Federal budget expressed its concern with the equity of \nlong retroactive Quality Bank valuation adjustments. Last autumn we \nurged FERC to look carefully at the justice of the Initial Decision of \nthe Administrative Law Judge in this case and we encouraged all of the \neight parties that includes the State of Alaska, to reach an out-of-\ncourt settlement of the 1993 case to bring finality to this complex \ncase before it harms instate refinery capabilities. At the time we \navoided a legislative solution to this purely Alaskan case. We are \nrenewing our pleas for action in a letter sent to FERC on Thursday.\n  In the intervening six months, while one mediation session has \noccurred, the parties report little or no progress toward reaching a \nmutually agreeable settlement. While opinions may differ on whether \nCongress should intervene to settle the on-going case, there is little \ndoubt that Congress should step forward to prevent such an arcane \ndispute from ever again threatening Alaska's energy industry.\n  For that reason prior to the next mediation session, today we \nintroduce legislation to limit the ability of FERC in the future to \nmake retroactive the impacts of future Quality Bank valuation \nmethodology changes. By this legislation, after December 31, 2005, FERC \nstill will be able to change the methodology for determining the value \nof oil flowing through the pipeline but will not be permitted to apply \nchanges to Quality Bank valuation methodologies on anything other than \na prospective basis.\n  We have proposed this provision to prevent this legal nightmare from \nhappening again. This provision will first eliminate the perverse \ncurrent incentive for all sides to promote further litigation regarding \nQuality Bank valuations based on the expectation of a retroactive \napplication of changes that would result in a large economic windfall. \nThe retroactive application of valuation methodology changes encourages \nthe sides in a dispute to sue in hopes of gaining a larger benefit in \nthe future. This is a ``lottery,'' however, that Alaskans are \nguaranteed to lose.\n  By setting December 31, 2005, as the date that FERC can no longer \napply Quality Bank valuation methodologies on a retroactive basis, the \nlegislation will put the FERC and the litigants on record that the \ncurrent dispute must be resolved by the end of this year.\n  Requiring FERC to apply valuation methodology changes in connection \nwith any future disputes on a prospective basis only will eliminate the \nrisk and uncertainty associated with the prospect of nearly unlimited \nretroactive application of Quality Bank payment methodology changes. \nThat will allow all Quality Bank participants to be able to conduct \nbusiness with the certainty of knowing that prices received and paid \nfor oil today cannot be altered years down the road. In addition, this \nwill eliminate the strong incentive that currently exists for some \nparties to engage in endless litigation, in hopes of gaining windfall \nbenefits from retroactive application changes.\n  While we continue to call on all sides in the current dispute to \ncompromise and settle this case now, this bill will discourage if not \neliminate this type of dispute in the future--a benefit for all \nAlaskans.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Lisa \nMurkowski, in introducing legislation pertaining to the Trans Alaska \nPipeline System (TAPS) and the Quality Bank.\n  The Quality Bank was created to balance accounts among oil producers \non Alaska's North Slope who produce crude oil of different quality and \nvalue from different oil fields. When the oil is delivered at Pump \nStation No. 1, it is commingled and transported by TAPS to Valdez, \nAlaska, where it is shipped by tanker to the lower 48 States.\n  This Quality Bank accounting concept also applies to oil refineries \nin my State who receive needed crude oil from TAPS, refine various \npetroleum products and return the balance of the crude oil to the \npipeline. The methodology used to determine these payments has been the \nsubject of dispute since the Bank's inception, creating uncertainty in \nthe market and a chilling effect on business investment in Alaska.\n  In 1989, a legal proceeding was initiated at the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission (FERC) that in 1993 changed the methodology under \nwhich ``Quality Banks'' in Alaska were operated. After 15 long and \nprotracted years of legal proceedings before FERC, an Administrative \nLaw Judge issued an Initial Decision proposing to replace the Quality \nBank methodology that the parties assumed they were operating under \nsince 1993. It proposes instead a new complex set of valuations that \nthe parties could not have predicted and that have very large financial \nimpacts, especially on refiners. Significantly, this decision also \nproposes to apply the most significant of these new valuations \nretroactively, all the way back to 1993.\n  The Administrative Law Judge's decision to apply this new methodology \nretroactively puts Alaska's in-State refineries at risk at a time when \nthe United States can ill afford to lose its limited refining capacity.\n  Given the Potential impact should FERC decide to adopt the ALJ's \ndecision, Congress included legislative language in the Fiscal Year \n2005 Consolidated Appropriations conference report expressing its \nconcern over this issue. Congress urged FERC to carefully Consider the \nspecific equities of this case to prevent special hardship, inequity, \nor an unfair distribution of burdens to any party, to assess the equity \nof assigning retroactivity, and to resolve this matter in a fair and \nequitable manner.\n  In addition, the State's Congressional Delegation urged the parties \nto reach a settlement to end over 15 years of litigation and bring \nfinality to this issue. Despite repeated calls for settlement, the \nparties appear to have made little or no progress towards this end.\n  The issue of retroactivity and its application in the aforementioned \ncase is problematic given the lack of clear Congressional action on the \nsubject. Congress' silence on the subject has given the parties \nincentive to prolong litigation and pursue appeals until they receive a \nruling which is beneficial to them.\n  To remedy this situation and prevent similar disputes in the future, \nwe are introducing this legislation to limit FERC's ability to assign \nretroactivity in matters pertaining to the Quality Bank. This \nlegislation is necessary to limit business uncertainty associated with \nthe use of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, and to ensure continued\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\n domestic refinery activity in order to protect national fuel supplies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3753-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                              S.

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 112\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated ``National \n     Child Abuse Prevention Month'' as an annual tradition that \n     was initiated in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the most recent National Child Abuse and Neglect \n     Data System (NCANDS) figures show that almost 900,000 \n     children were victims of abuse and neglect in the United \n     States in 2002, causing unspeakable pain and suffering to our \n     most vulnerable citizens;\n       Whereas among the children who are victims of abuse and \n     neglect, nearly 4 children die each day in this country;\n       Whereas children age 1 and younger accounted for 41.2 \n     percent of child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2002, and \n     children age 4 and younger accounted for 76.1 percent of all \n     child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2002;\n       Whereas abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome, is recognized as the leading cause of \n     death of physically abused children;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome is a totally preventable form \n     of child abuse, caused by a caregiver losing control and \n     shaking a baby that is usually less than 1 year in age;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas a 2003 report in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association estimates that, in the United States, an \n     average of 300 children will die each year, and 600 to 1,200 \n     more will be injured, of whom \\2/3\\ will be babies or infants \n     under 1 year in age, as a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome, \n     with many cases resulting in severe and permanent \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas medical professionals believe that thousands of \n     additional cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome are being \n     misdiagnosed or not detected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent, \n     irreparable brain damage or death to an infant and may result \n     in more than $1,000,000 in medical costs to care for a \n     single, disabled child in just the first few years of life;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for ending Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome is to prevent such abuse, and it is clear that the \n     minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     prevent enormous medical and disability costs and untold \n     grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have demonstrated that \n     educating new parents about the danger of shaking young \n     children and how they can help protect their child from \n     injury can bring about a significant reduction in the number \n     of cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas education programs have been shown to raise \n     awareness and provide critically important information about \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome to parents, caregivers, daycare workers, \n     child protection employees, law enforcement personnel, health \n     care professionals, and legal representatives;\n       Whereas efforts to prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome are \n     supported by advocacy groups across the United States that \n     were formed by parents and relatives of children who have \n     been killed or injured by shaking, such as the National \n     Shaken Baby Coalition, the Shaken Baby Association, the \n     SKIPPER (Shaking Kills: Instead Parents Please Educate and \n     Remember) Initiative, the Shaken Baby Alliance, Shaken Baby \n     Prevention, Inc., A Voice for Gabbi, Don't Shake Jake, and \n     the Kierra Harrison Foundation, whose mission is to educate \n     the general public and professionals about Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome and to increase support for victims and victim's \n     families in the health care and criminal justice systems;\n       Whereas child abuse prevention programs and ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' are supported by the \n     National Shaken Baby Coalition, the National Center on Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome, the Children's Defense Fund, the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics, the Child Welfare League of America, \n     Prevent Child Abuse America, the National Child Abuse \n     Coalition, the National Exchange Club Foundation, the \n     American Humane Association, the

Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \nDodd, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Akaka, \nMr. Durbin, and Mrs. Feinstein) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. \n1268, making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2005, to establish and rapidly implement \nregulations for State driver's license and identification document \nsecurity standards, to prevent terrorists from abusing the asylum laws \nof the United States, to unify terrorism-related grounds for \ninadmissibility and removal, to ensure expeditious construction of the \nSan Diego border fence, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 231, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       Sec. 6047.(a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) the prices of gasoline and crude oil have a direct and \n     substantial impact on the financial well-being of families of \n     the United States, the potential for national economic \n     recovery, and the economic security of the United States;\n       (2) on April 12, 2005, crude oil prices closed at the \n     exceedingly high level of $51.86 per barrel and the price of \n     crude oil has remained above $50 per barrel since February \n     22, 2005;\n       (3) on April 11, 2005, the Energy Information \n     Administration announced that the national price of gasoline, \n     at $2.28 per gallon--\n       (A) had set a new record high for a 4th consecutive week;\n       (B) was $0.49 higher than last year; and\n       (C) could reach even higher levels in the near future;\n       (4) despite the severely high, sustained price of crude \n     oil--\n       (A) the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     (referred to in this section as ``OPEC'') has refused to \n     adequately increase production to calm global oil markets and \n     officially abandoned its $22-$28 price target; and\n       (B) officials of OPEC member nations have publicly \n     indicated support for maintaining oil prices of $40-$50 per \n     barrel;\n       (5) the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (referred to in this \n     section as ``SPR'') was created to enhance the physical and \n     economic security of the United States;\n       (6) the law allows the SPR to be used to provide relief \n     when oil and gasoline supply shortages cause economic \n     hardship;\n       (7) the proper management of the resources of the SPR could \n     provide gasoline price relief to families of the United \n     States and provide the United States with a tool to \n     counterbalance OPEC supply management policies;\n       (8) the Administration's current policy of filling the SPR \n     despite the fact that the SPR\n\n[[Page S3755]]\n\n     is more than 98 percent full has exacerbated the rising price \n     of crude oil and record high retail price of gasoline;\n       (9) in order to combat high gasoline prices during the \n     summer and fall of 2000, President Clinton released \n     30,000,000 barrels of oil from the SPR, stabilizing the \n     retail price of gasoline;\n       (10) increasing vertical integration has allowed--\n       (A) the 5 largest oil companies in the United States to \n     control almost as much crude oil production as the Middle \n     Eastern members of OPEC, over of domestic refiner capacity, \n     and over 60 percent of the retail gasoline market; and\n       (B) the top 10 oil companies in the world to make more than \n     $100,000,000,000 in profit and in some instances to post \n     record-breaking fourth quarter earnings that were in some \n     cases more than 200 percent higher than the previous year;\n       (11) the Administration has failed to manage the SPR in a \n     manner that would provide gasoline price relief to working \n     families; and\n       (12) the Administration has failed to adequately demand \n     that OPEC immediately increase oil production in order to \n     lower crude oil prices and safeguard the world economy.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the President should--\n       (1) directly confront OPEC and challenge OPEC to \n     immediately increase oil production; and\n       (2) direct the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney \n     General to exercise vigorous oversight over the oil markets \n     to protect the people of the United States from price gouging \n     and unfair practices at the gasoline pump.\n       (c)(1) For the period beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act and ending on the date that is 30 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act--\n       (A) deliveries of oil to the SPR shall be suspended; and\n       (B) 1,000,000 barrels of oil per day shall be released from \n     the SPR.\n       (2) If necessary to lower the burden of gasoline prices on \n     the economy of the United States and to circumvent the \n     efforts of OPEC to reap windfall crude oil profits, 1,000,000 \n     barrels of oil per day shall be released from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve for an additional 30 days.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 452.

Bush for fiscal year 2001;\n       (C) funds for operations in Bosnia, beginning in budget \n     request of President Clinton for fiscal year 1997;\n       (D) funds for operations in Southwest Asia, beginning in \n     the budget request of President Clinton for fiscal year 1997;\n       (E) funds for operations in Vietnam, beginning in the \n     budget request of President Johnson for fiscal year 1966; and\n       (F) funds for World War II, beginning in the budget request \n     of President Roosevelt for fiscal year 1943.\n       (4) The Senate has included in its version of the fiscal \n     year 2006 budget resolution, which was adopted by the Senate \n     on March 17, 2005, a reserve fund of $50,000,000,000 for \n     overseas contingency operations, but the determination of \n     that amount could not take into account any Administration \n     estimate on the projected cost of such operations in fiscal \n     year 2006.\n       (5) In February 2005, the Congressional Budget Office \n     estimated that fiscal year 2006 costs for ongoing military \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan could total \n     $65,000,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any request for funds for a fiscal year after fiscal \n     year 2006 for an ongoing military operation overseas, \n     including operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, should be \n     included in the annual budget of the President for such \n     fiscal year as submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of \n     title 31, United States Code;\n       (2) the President should submit to Congress, not later than \n     September 1, 2005, an amendment to the budget of the \n     President for fiscal year 2006 that was submitted to Congress \n     under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, \n     setting forth detailed cost estimates for ongoing military \n     operations overseas during such fiscal year; and\n       (3) any funds provided for a fiscal year for ongoing \n     military operations overseas should be provided in \n     appropriations Acts for such fiscal year through \n     appropriations to specific accounts set forth in such \n     appropriations Acts.\n       (c) Additional Requirements for Certain Reports.--(1) Each \n     semiannual report to Congress required under a provision of \n     law referred to in paragraph (2) shall include, in addition \n     to the matters specified in the applicable provision of law, \n     the following:\n       (A) A statement of the cumulative total of all amounts \n     obligated, and of all amounts expended, as of the date of \n     such report for Operation Enduring Freedom.\n       (B) A statement of the cumulative total of all amounts \n     obligated, and of all amounts expended, as of the date of \n     such report for Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       (C) An estimate of the reasonably foreseeable costs for \n     ongoing military operations to be incurred during the 12-\n     month period beginning on the date of such report.\n       (2) The provisions of law referred to in this paragraph are \n     as follows:\n       (A) Section 1120 of the Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of \n     Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 (Public Law 108-106; 117 Stat. \n     1219; 10 U.S.C. 113 note).\n       (B) Section 9010 of the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-287; 118 Stat. 1008; \n     10 U.S.C. 113 note).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 465.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 111 which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 111) urging the United States to \n     increase its efforts to ensure democratic reform in the \n     Kurdish Republic.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, this resolution urges the United States to \nincrease its efforts to ensure democratic reform in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic.\n  The Kyrgyz Republic has held two rounds of parliamentary elections, \nthe first on February 27 the second on March 13. While both election \nrounds showed progress toward the goal of a free, fair, and transparent \nelection process, the elections fell short of the Kyrgyz Republic's \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's OSCE and \ninternational commitments to fully meet the accepted criteria for \ndemocratic elections.\n  Violations included instances of vote buying, questionable \ndisqualification of candidates and interference with the media.\n  Inspired by the recent revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia, the people \nof the Kyrgyz Republic rose against their corrupt government to demand \nrespect for their democratic rights. Nationwide demonstrations sparked \nby the flawed parliamentary elections led to the departure of President \nAskar Akayev on March 22. The opposition moved quickly to consolidate \ncontrol and established an interim government. On April 4, President \nAkayev officially resigned. But the situation remains fluid. The \noutcome in the Kyrgyz Republic is critically important for its future, \nand for people living in the Central Asia region, who hope for a \ndemocratic future.\n  The United States and the Kyrgyz Republic have formed a close \nrelationship since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in \n1991. The United States has provided humanitarian assistance, nonlethal \nmilitary assistance, and assistance to support economic and political \nreforms. The Kyrgyz Republic also hosts a U.S. military base that \nprovides crucial support to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.\n  However, while the Kyrgyz Republic has advanced quickly in the area \nof democratic reform since 1991, it has experienced setbacks in recent \nyears. I urge the United States in my resolution to continue its strong \nsupport for democratic reform in the Kyrgyz Republic, including respect \nfor the rule of law and human rights.\n  I also call upon the interim government in the Kyrgyz Republic to \nmove swiftly toward democratic government ratified by the Kyrgyz people \nby holding free, fair, and transparent presidential elections on July \n10, and by ensuring that the new parliament represents the choice of \nthe Kyrgyz people. The United States must provide strong leadership in \ncountries where democracy is still taking root.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 111) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 111\n\n       Whereas on August 31, 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic declared \n     independence from the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas the Kyrgyz Republic was ruled by President Askar \n     Akayev from October 1991 to April 2005;\n       Whereas the Kyrgyz Republic held a first round of \n     parliamentary elections on February 27, 2005;\n       Whereas the United States Government recognized several \n     areas of improvement in the parliamentary elections in the \n     Kyrgyz Republic, including competitive elections and the \n     active participation of civil society, but it noted the \n     elections fell short of the commitments of the Kyrgyz \n     Republic to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE) and other international entities to fully meet \n     the accepted criteria for democratic elections;\n       Whereas nation-wide demonstrations sparked by the flawed \n     parliamentary elections in the Kyrgyz Republic led to the \n     departure of President Akayev and the collapse of his \n     government on March 22, 2005;\n       Whereas Askar Akayev officially resigned as President of \n     the Kyrgyz Republic on April 4, 2005;\n       Whereas the Kyrgyz people, through their actions, have \n     created an opportunity for a democratic and stable future for \n     the Kyrgyz Republic;\n       Whereas the interim government in the Kyrgyz Republic can \n     earn the confidence of the Kyrgyz people and the \n     international community by abiding by its commitment to hold \n     free and fair presidential elections on July 10, 2005, and by \n     ensuring that the members of the new parliament in the Kyrgyz \n     Republic represent the choice of the Kyrgyz people;\n       Whereas the interim government in the Kyrgyz Republic can \n     move towards resolving the political crisis in the Kyrgyz \n     Republic in a way that confirms the will of the Kyrgyz people \n     by working closely with its immediate neighbors and with the \n     OSCE;\n       Whereas the United States strongly supports efforts by the \n     OSCE to work with the\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\n     Kyrgyz people to strengthen democratic institutions in the \n     Kyrgyz Republic, which will provide the foundation for \n     political stability in the Kyrgyz Republic;\n       Whereas the United States and the Kyrgyz Republic value a \n     good relationship;\n       Whereas the United States provides humanitarian assistance, \n     nonlethal military assistance, and assistance to support \n     economic and political reforms as part of the democratic \n     transition process in the Kyrgyz Republic; and\n       Whereas security in the Kyrgyz Republic remains a top \n     concern of the United States due to its strong support of the \n     United States in the global war on terrorism: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes the official resignation of Askar Akayev as \n     President of the Kyrgyz Republic;\n       (2) acknowledges and welcomes the close relationship formed \n     between the United States and the Kyrgyz Republic since it \n     declared independence from the Soviet Union on August 31, \n     1991;\n       (3) supports the sovereignty, independence, and territorial \n     integrity of the Kyrgyz Republic;\n       (4) urges the continuation of strong support for democratic \n     reform, including respect for the rule of law and human \n     rights, in the Kyrgyz Republic;\n       (5) urges the interim government in the Kyrgyz Republic to \n     move swiftly toward the democratic government ratified by the \n     Kyrgyz people by holding free, fair, and transparent \n     presidential elections on July 10, 2005, and by ensuring that \n     the new parliament in the Kyrgyz Republic represents the \n     choice of the Kyrgyz people; and\n       (6) urges the people of the Kyrgyz Republic to take \n     advantage of the readiness of the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to expand its assistance in \n     preparing for free and fair presidential elections in the \n     Kyrgyz Republic as the foundation of political legitimacy and \n     stability in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3760-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3760-S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 112, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 112) designating the third week of \n     the April, 2005, as National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness \n     Week.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD: Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nSenator Alexander, in support of the resolution the Senate has passed \nto proclaim the third week of April of 2005 as Shaken Baby Syndrome \nAwareness Week. I would like to recognize the many groups, particularly \nthe National Shaken Baby Coalition and the SKIPPER Initiative, who \nsupport this effort to increase awareness of one of the most \ndevastating forms of child abuse, one that results in the death or \nlifelong disability of too many children each year.\n  We must recognize child abuse and neglect as the public health \nproblem it is, one that is linked with a host of other problems facing \nour country and one that needs the comprehensive approach of our entire \npublic health system to solve. The month of April has been designated \nNational Child Abuse Prevention Month as an annual tradition that was \ninitiated in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter. In 2005, April will \nagain be National Child Abuse Prevention Month.\n  The tragedy of child abuse is well documented. According to the \nNational Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, NCANDS, almost 900,000 \nchildren were victims of abuse and neglect in the United States in \n2002, causing unspeakable pain and suffering to our most vulnerable \ncitizens. Each day, nearly four of these children die as a result of \nthis abuse. Most experts are certain that cases of child abuse and \nneglect are in fact underreported.\n  Very young children are particularly vulnerable to the pain of child \nabuse and neglect. In 2002, children age 1 and younger accounted for \n41.2 percent of child abuse and neglect deaths in 2002, and children \nage 4 and younger accounted for 76.1 percent of all child abuse and \nneglect deaths.\n  Abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as shaken baby \nsyndrome, is recognized as the leading cause of death of physically \nabused children, especially young children. Shaken baby syndrome is a \ntotally preventable form of child abuse that results from a caregiver \nlosing control and shaking a baby, usually an infant who is less than 1 \nyear old. This severe shaking can kill the baby, or it can cause loss \nof vision, brain damage, paralysis, and seizures, resulting in lifelong \ndisabilities and causing untold grief for many families. If a child \nsurvives shaken baby syndrome, the resulting medical costs to care for \na single, disabled child in just the first few years of life may exceed \n$1,000,000.\n  Too many families have experienced the pain of shaken baby syndrome. \nA 2003 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association \nestimates that, in the United States, an average of 300 children will \ndie each year, and 600 to 1,200 more will be injured, of whom \\2/3\\ \nwill be babies or infants under 1 year in age, as a result of shaken \nbaby syndrome. Medical professionals believe that thousands more cases \nof shaken baby syndrome are being misdiagnosed or not detected.\n  Families should be spared the needless tragedy of shaken baby \nsyndrome. The most effective solution to ending Shaken Baby Syndrome is \nto prevent such abuse, and it is clear that the minimal costs of \neducational and prevention programs may help to protect our young \nchildren and stop this tragedy from occurring. In 1995, the U.S. \nAdvisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect recommended a universal \napproach to the prevention of child fatalities that would reach out to \nall families through the implementation of several key strategies. Such \nefforts began by providing services such as home visitation by trained \nprofessionals or paraprofessionals, hospital-linked outreach to parents \nof infants and toddlers, community-based programs designed for the \nspecific needs of neighborhoods, and effective public education \ncampaigns.\n  Pevention programs like the ones recommended by the U.S. Advisory \nBoard on Child Abuse and Neglect have demonstrated that educating new \nparents about the danger of shaking young children and how they can \nhelp protect their child from injury can bring about a significant \nreduction in the number of cases of shaken baby syndrome. In 1998, Dr. \nMark Dias started the Upstate New York SBS Prevention Project at \nChildren's Hospital of Buffalo. It uses a simple 11-minute video to \neducate new parents before they leave the hospital. Since that time, \nthe number of shaken baby incidents in the Buffalo area has dropped by \nnearly 50 percent: none of the perpetrators have been identified as \nparticipants in the hospital education program. Hospitals around the \ncountry, including several in my own State of Connecticut, have adopted \nprograms similar to these to educate new parents about the dangers of \nshaking young children.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution designating the third week \nof April of 2005 and 2006 as National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness \nWeek, and to take part in the many local and national activities and \nevents recognizing the month of April as National Child Abuse \nPrevention Month.\n  The prevention of shaken baby syndrome is supported by advocacy \ngroups across the United States that were formed by parents and \nrelatives of children who have been killed or injured by shaking. I ask \nunanimous consent that a list of groups supporting this resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nahe Record, as follows:\n\n\n   Groups Supporting ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week''\n\n       The National Shaken Baby Coalition\n       The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome\n       The Children's Defense Fund\n       The American Academy of Pediatrics\n       The Child Welfare League of America Prevent Child Abuse \n     America\n       The National Child Abuse Coalition\n       The National Exchange Club Foundation\n       The American Humane Association\n       The American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children\n       The Arc of the United States\n       The Association of University Centers on Disabilities\n       Children's Healthcare is a Legal Duty\n       Family Partnership\n       Family Voices\n       National Alliance of Children's Trust and Prevention Funds\n       United Cerebral Palsy\n       The National Association of Children's Hospitals and \n     Related Institutions\n       Never Shake a Baby Arizona/Prevent Child Abuse Arizona\n       The Center for Child Protection and Family Support\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

\n     irreparable brain damage or death to an infant and may result \n     in more than $1,000,000 in medical costs to care for a \n     single, disabled child in just the first few years of life;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for ending Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome is to prevent such abuse, and it is clear that the \n     minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     prevent enormous medical and disability costs and untold \n     grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have demonstrated that \n     educating new parents about the danger of shaking young \n     children and how they can help protect their child from \n     injury can bring about a significant reduction in the number \n     of cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas education programs have been shown to raise \n     awareness and provide critically important information about \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome to parents, caregivers, daycare workers, \n     child protection employees, law enforcement personnel, health \n     care professionals, and legal representatives;\n       Whereas efforts to prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome are \n     supported by advocacy groups across the United States that \n     were formed by parents and relatives of children who have \n     been killed or injured by shaking, such as the National \n     Shaken Baby Coalition, the Shaken Baby Association, the \n     SKIPPER (Shaking Kills: Instead Parents Please Educate and \n     Remember) Initiative, the Shaken Baby Alliance, Shaken Baby \n     Prevention, Inc., A Voice for Gabbi, Don't Shake Jake, and \n     the Kierra Harrison Foundation, whose mission is to educate \n     the general public and professionals about Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome and to increase support for victims and victim's \n     families in the health care and criminal justice systems;\n       Whereas child abuse prevention programs and ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome

Mr. President, I would like to address two issues that \nare related. The first issue is the so-called nuclear option. I think \nmany people have read about it and heard about it. I would like to \nexplain, from my point of view, the merits of that issue. Then I would \nlike to address an article which appeared this morning on the front \npage of the New York Times relative to a meeting which will take place \non April 24, sponsored by the Family Research Council, a meeting at \nwhich the majority leader of the Senate, Senator Bill Frist, is \nreported to be scheduled to speak. I would like to address both of \nthose issues and try to make this as direct and concise as I can.\n  First, let me say there is one thing that binds every Member of the \nSenate, Republican or Democrat or Independent. There is one thing that \nbrings us together in this Chamber. It is an oath of office. That oath \nof office, where we stand solemnly before the Nation, before our \ncolleagues, is an oath where we swear to uphold and defend the \nConstitution of the United States, this tiny little publication which \nhas guided our Nation and our values for over two centuries.\n  Though we may disagree on almost everything else, we swear to uphold \nthis document. We swear that at the end of the day we will be loyal to \nthis Constitution of the United States. That, I think, is where this \ndebate should begin, because this Constitution makes it very clear that \nwhen it comes to the rules of the Senate, it is the responsibility and \nauthority of the Senate itself to make its rules. I refer specifically \nto article I, section 5. I quote from the Constitution:\n\n       Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings. . . \n     .\n\n  Because of that, most courts take a hands-off attitude. It is their \nbelief that we decide how we conduct business in this Chamber, as the \nHouse of Representatives will decide about theirs. That is our \nconstitutional right.\n  When this Constitution was written, there was a question about \nwhether we could bring together 13 different colonies and they would \nagree to have one Federal Government. The first suggestion was that we \ncreate a House of Representatives with one Congressman for each \nAmerican person who will be counted. There was, of course, a different \nsystem for counting those of color. But when the smaller States took a \nlook at the House of Representatives, they were concerned. They \nunderstood in the House of Representatives the larger States would be a \ndominant voice because they had more people, more Congressmen. The \nGreat Compromise said let us resolve this by creating a Senate which \nwill give to every State, large and small, the same number of \nSenators--two Senators from each State. So today the State of Rhode \nIsland has the same number of Senators as the State of New York; the \nState of South Dakota, the same number of Senators as the State of \nCalifornia--the Great Compromise, so the Senate would observe the \nrights of the minority, the smaller populated States, and give them an \nequal voice on the floor of the Senate.\n  The Senate rules were written to reflect that unique and peculiar \ninstitutional decision. We said within the Senate, following this same \nvalue and principle, that our rules would be written so the minority \nwithin the Senate would always be respected. We created something \ncalled a filibuster, a filibuster which is unique to the Senate but is \nconsistent with the reason for its creation.\n  Some of you may remember the filibuster if you saw the movie ``Mr. \nSmith Goes to Washington.'' Jimmy Stewart, a brand new Senator, full of \nidealism, comes to the floor of the Senate and runs smack dab into this \nestablishment of power in the Senate. He decides it is worth a fight \nand he stands at his Senate desk and starts to speak, and he continues \nto speak hour after hour until clearly he is about to collapse. But he \nholds the Senate floor because it was his right to do it as a Senator. \nAs long as his throat would hold up, and other bodily functions, he \ncontinued.\n\n  We all remember that movie. It spoke to the idealism of the Senate \nand it spoke to its core values--the filibuster. That is because it was \npart of checks and balances. It said we are saying to the legislative \nbranch of Government: You are independent, you have your own power, and \nwithin that legislative branch you make your own rules. You define who \nyou will be and how you will conduct your business.\n  We said to the executive branch: We respect you, but you are \nseparate. You don't make our rules; the legislature makes its own \nrules. The Senate makes its own rules. The House makes its own rules. \nIt is because of that difference, because each branch--the executive \nwith the President, the congressional branch of Government and the \njudicial branch of Government--is separate and coequal, that we have \nthis great Nation we have today.\n  It was an amazing stroke of genius that in this tiny publication \nthese Founding Fathers understood how to create a government that would \nendure.\n  Think of all the governments in the world that have come and gone \nsince those men sat down in Philadelphia and wrote these words. We have \nendured. Each and every one of us comes to this floor before we can \ncast our first vote and we swear to uphold and defend this document and \nwhat it contains.\n  The reason I tell you this is because at this moment there are those \nwho are planning what I consider to be an assault on the very \nprinciples of this Constitution. There are those who wish to change the \nrules of the Senate and in changing the rules of the Senate, defy \ntradition, change the rules in the middle of the game, and have a full \nfrontal assault on the unique nature of this institution. That, I \nthink, is an abuse of power. I think it goes way too far. It ignores \nour Founding Fathers. This nuclear option ignores the Constitution. It \nignores the rules of the Senate. For what? So the President of the \nUnited States can have every single judicial nominee approved by the \nSenate.\n  What is the scorecard? How has President Bush done in sending \njudicial nominees to the Senate? I can tell you the score as of this \nmoment. Since he was elected President, he has had 215 nominees on the \nfloor for a vote in the Senate and 205 have been approved. That is 205 \nto 10; over 95 percent of President Bush's judicial nominees have come \nto the floor and been approved. Only 10 have not been approved. They \nhave been subject to a filibuster, part of the Senate rules.\n  But this White House and majority party in the Senate have decided 95 \npercent is not enough. They want it all. They want every nominee. \nSadly,\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\nthey are about to assault this Constitution and the rules of the Senate \nto try to achieve that goal.\n  This so-called nuclear option is a power grab. It is an attempt to \nchange the rules of the Senate. It is an assault on the principle and \nvalue of checks and balances. It is an attempt by the majority party in \nthe Senate to ram through nominees who will not pledge to protect the \nmost important rights of the American people. It is an attempt to say \nwe cannot demand of the President's nominees that each person be \nbalanced and moderate and committed to the goals of ordinary Americans. \nThe fact that the President has had 205 nominees approved and only 10 \nrejected is not good enough. He wants them all.\n  This is not the first President in history who has decided in his \nsecond term to take on the courts of our country, to say he wanted to \nput into that court system men and women who agreed with him \npolitically at any cost. The first was one of our greatest Americans, \nThomas Jefferson. Full of victory in his second term, he decided to \nattempt to impeach a Supreme Court Justice who disagreed with him \npolitically, to show he had the political power, having just been re-\nelected. His efforts were rejected. They were rejected by his own \nparty, his own party in the Senate, who said: Mr. President, we may be \npart of your party, but we disagree with this power grab.\n  We are going to protect the constitutional rights and power of our \ninstitution of the Senate.\n  More recently, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt--one of the \ngreatest in our history--as his second term began, became so frustrated \nby a Supreme Court that would not agree with him, that he sent to the \nSenate a proposal to change the composition of the Court to make \ncertain that we filled the bench across the street in the Supreme Court \nwith people who were sympathetic to his political agenda. He sent that \nlegislative proposal to a Congress dominated by his political party, by \nhis Democratic Party. What was their response? They rejected it. They \nsaid we stood by you in the election, we will stand by your policies, \nbut we will not allow you to abuse this Constitution. We will not allow \nyou to change the rules so you can have more power over our judges. \nThat was the principle at issue. Frankly, Roosevelt lost the debate \nwhen men and women of his own party stood up and opposed him in the \nCongress.\n  Thomas Jefferson lost the same debate.\n  Here we go, again. For the third time in our Nation's history, a \nPresident, as he begins his second term, is attempting to change the \nrules of the Senate to defy the Constitution and to give the Office of \nthe President more power to push through judges, to defy the checks and \nbalances in our Constitution.\n  I don't believe I was elected to the Senate to be a rubber stamp. I \nbelieve I was elected and took the oath of office to uphold this \nConstitution, to stand up for the precedents and values of Congress and \nour Nation. We need to have, in our judiciary, independence and \nfairness. We need to have men and women on the bench who will work to \nprotect our individual rights, despite the intimidation of special \ninterest groups, despite the intimidation of Members of Congress. They \nneed to have the courage to stand up for what they believe, in good \nconscience, to be the rights and freedoms of Americans.\n  I speak, as a Senator on the Democratic side, and tell you that our \n45 Members will not be intimidated. We will stand together. We \nunderstand these lifetime appointments to the bench should be subject \nto close scrutiny, to evaluation, and to a decision as to why they are \nprepared to serve and serve in a way to protect the rights and \naspirations of ordinary Americans.\n  The filibuster, which requires that 60 Senators come together to \nresolve the most controversial issues, that rule in the Senate, forces \ncompromise. It forces the Republicans to reach across the aisle and \nbring in some Democrats when they have very controversial legislation \nor controversial nominees. It forces bipartisanship--something that \ntells us, at the end of the day, we will have more moderate men and \nwomen who will serve us in the judiciary. Those who would attack and \ndestroy the institution of the filibuster are attacking the very force \nwithin the Senate that creates compromise and bipartisanship.\n  Those who are forcing this nuclear option on the Senate are not just \nbreaking the rules to win, but they want to break the rules to win \nevery time.\n  Despite the fact that President Clinton had over 60 judicial nominees \nwho never received a hearing and vote when the Republicans were in \ncontrol of the Senate, this President has only been denied 10 nominees \nout of 215. We have one of the lowest vacancy rates in the Federal \ncourt in modern memory. Yet, they are prepared to push through this \nunconstitutional and unreasonable change in the Senate rules. It is the \nfirst time in the history of the Senate, it is the first time in the \nhistory of the United States, that a majority party is breaking the \nrules of the Senate, to change the rules of the Senate in the middle of \nthe game. I think that is truly unfortunate.\n  I only hope that some Republican Senators, who value their oath of \noffice and who value this institution, will have the same courage the \nDemocratic Party had when it said to President Franklin Roosevelt: You \nhave gone too far. We cannot allow you to impose your political will on \nthe Supreme Court. They stood up to their President and said our first \nobligation is to the Constitution, our first obligation is to the \nSenate.\n  We will be Democrats after that, but first we must stand behind the \nConstitution.\n  I am only hoping that six Republican Senators will stand up, as \nThomas Jefferson's party stood up and told him--one of our Founding \nFathers--that he was wrong in trying to impose his political will on \nthe Supreme Court and the Federal courts of the land. They had the \ncourage to do it to their President.\n  How many Republican Senators will stand up to this Constitution and \nfor the values and traditions of this great Senate?\n  I have a document which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   History of Filibusters and Judges\n\n       Prior to the start of the George W. Bush administration in \n     2001, the following 11 judicial nominations needed 60 (or \n     more) votes--cloture--in order to end a filibuster:\n       1881: Stanley Matthews to be a Supreme Court Justice.\n       1968: Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \n     (cloture required \\2/3\\ of those voting).\n       1971: William Rehnquist to be a Supreme Court Justice \n     (cloture required \\2/3\\ of those voting).\n       1980: Stephen Breyer to be a Judge on the First Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       1984: J. Harvie Wilkinson to be a Judge on the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       1986: Sidney Fitzwater to be a Judge for the Northern \n     District of Texas.\n       1986: William Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the Supreme \n     Court.\n       1992: Edward Earl Carnes, Jr., to be a Judge on the \n     Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       1994: H. Lee Sarokin to be a Judge on the Third Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       1999: Brian Theadore Stewart to be a Judge for the District \n     of Utah.\n       2000: Richard Paez, to be a Judge on the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       2000: Marsha Berzon to be a Judge on the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       Because of a filibuster, cloture was filed on the following \n     two judicial nominations, but was later withdrawn:\n       1986: Daniel Manion to be a Judge on the Seventh Circuit \n     Court of Appeals Senator Biden told then Majority Leader Bob \n     Dole that ``he was ready to call off an expected filibuster \n     and vote immediately on Manion's nomination.''--Congressional \n     Quarterly Almanac, 1986.\n       1994: Rosemary Barkett to be a Judge on the Eleventh \n     Circuit Court of Appeals ``... lacking the votes to sustain a \n     filibuster, Republicans agreed to proceed to a confirmation \n     vote after Democrats agreed to a daylong debate on the \n     nomination.''--Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1994.\n       Following are comments by Republicans during the filibuster \n     on the Paez and Berzon nominations in 2000, confirming that \n     there was, in fact, a filibuster:\n       ``. . . It is no secret that I have been the person who has \n     filibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge \n     Paez.''--Senator Bob Smith, March 9, 2000.\n       ``So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that \n     we don't have the right to filibuster judges on the floor of \n     the Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional \n     role.''--Senator Bob Smith, March 7, 2000.\n       ``Indeed, I must confess to being some what baffled that, \n     after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could \n     still delay final vote on the nomination.''--Senator Orrin \n     Hatch, March 9, 2000, when a Senator offered a motion to \n     indefinitely postpone the Paez nomination after cloture has \n     been invoked.\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\n       In 2000, during consideration of the Paez nomination, the \n     following Senator was among those who voted to continue the \n     filibuster:\n       Senator Bill Frist --Vote #37, 106th Congress, Second \n     Session, March 8, 2000.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, to give credit to the authorship, my \ncolleague, Senator Boxer of California, put her staff to work. She \nasked them to research how many times, in the history of the Senate, a \nfilibuster had been used to slow down or deny a Federal judgeship. You \nsee Senator Frist and others have stood before the press and said it \nhas never been done. These Democrats have dreamed up something that has \nnever been done. Using a filibuster to stop the judicial nominee has \nnever occurred. I have seen those quotes. Unfortunately, they are \nwrong.\n  Prior to the start of President Bush's administration in 2001, at \nleast 12 judicial nominations needed 60 votes for cloture to end a \nfilibuster: the first, 1881, Stanley Matthews to be a Supreme Court \nJustice; 1968, Abe Fortas to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court; \nand the list goes on. Twelve different judicial nominees that have been \nsubject to filibuster, and they are not all in the distant past.\n  The most recent occurred during the Clinton administration. Two \nnominees that he sent, Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, were filibustered by the same Republican \nSenate side that now argues this has never happened.\n  We have seen this happen because of the filibuster--cloture--which is \nthe way to close down the debate, close down the filibuster. Cloture \nmotions were filed on two judicial nominations. It was done in 1986, \nDaniel Manion; in 1994, Rosemary Barkett.\n  Some of the comments made by Republican Senators in the last few \nyears about the filibusters on Clinton judicial nominees tell the \nstory.\n  Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, in March of 2000, said, as \nfollows, on the floor of the Senate in the official Record, the \nCongressional Record of the Senate. Here is what he said:\n\n     . . . it is no secret that I have been the person who has \n     filibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge \n     Paez.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that we \n     don't have the right to filibuster judges on the floor of the \n     Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional role.\n\n  I hear Senators now saying, on the Republican side, it has never been \ndone, no one has ever considered it. In fact, it has happened--and \nrepeatedly--in our history.\n  In fact, in the year 2000, during consideration of the Paez \nnomination, there was one Senator who voted to continue the filibuster \nagainst Judge Paez. Who was that Senator? Senator Bill Frist, the \nmajority leader of U.S. Senate. His own action speaks volumes. He \nunderstood then there was a filibuster on a Democratic nominee, and he \njoined them in filibustering it. It is a matter of record, vote number \n37, 106th Congress, second session, March 8, the year 2000. This is all \nin the Congressional Record.\n  So there is no question we have used the filibuster on judicial \nnominees. It is not an extraordinary thing in terms of our rules. It is \nextraordinary in terms of the number of occurrences. But I think it \ntells us, if you look at the history and precedent of the Senate and \nthe use of this Constitution, that the right of the filibuster on a \njudicial nominee is protected by this Constitution.\n  So now comes the Republican majority. They say they are going to \nbreak the rules of the Senate to eliminate this filibuster of judicial \nnominees; to change the rules in the middle of the game; to stop the \nchecks and balances which are an integral part of our legacy in this \ndemocratic form of government.\n  It is bad enough that this constitutional assault is being planned \nand discussed. But this morning a new element was introduced into it \nwhich is very troubling.\n  On the front page of the New York Times this morning is an article by \nDavid Kirkpatrick entitled, ``Frist Set to Use Religious Stage on \nJudicial Issue.''\n  This article, which I will read from, says as follows:\n\n       As the Senate heads toward a showdown over the rules \n     governing judicial confirmations, Senator Bill Frist, the \n     majority leader, has agreed to join a handful of prominent \n     Christian conservatives in a telecast portraying Democrats as \n     ``against people of faith,'' for blocking President Bush's \n     nominees.\n       Fliers for the telecast organized by the Family Research \n     Council and scheduled to originate at a Kentucky megachurch \n     the evening of April 24, call the day ``Justice Sunday'' and \n     depict a young man holding a Bible in one hand and a gavel in \n     the other. The flier does not name participants, but under \n     the heading ``the filibuster against people of faith,'' it \n     reads: ``The filibuster was once abused to protect racial \n     bias, and it is now being used against people of faith.''\n\n  Mr. President, this is a delicate issue--the role of religion in \nAmerica in a democratic society. It is one our Nation has struggled \nwith--not as much as the issue of race and slavery, but close to it \nsince our founding.\n  The men who wrote this Constitution said that we should be guided by \nthree rules when it comes to religion in America. The three rules were \nembodied in the first article of the Bill of Rights. It says each of us \nshall have freedom of religious belief. What does that mean? We can \nrely on our own conscience to make decisions when it comes to religion. \nWe can decide whether we will believe or not believe, whether we will \ngo to church or not go to church, whether we will be a member of one \nreligion or another. It is our individual conscience that will make \nthat decision.\n  In addition to that, of course, the Bill of Rights says that this \nGovernment shall not establish any church; there will not be an \nofficial church of America. There is a church of England. There may be \nreligions of other countries, but there will not be a church of \nAmerica--not a Christian church, not a Jewish synagogue, not a Muslim \nmosque. There will not be a church of America, according to the \nConstitution.\n  The third thing it says, and this is especially important in this \naspect of the debate, and this is article VI of the Constitution, is \nthat no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any \noffice or public trust under the United States. It couldn't be clearer. \nWe cannot legally or constitutionally even ask a person aspiring to a \njudicial nomination to what religion they belong. They can volunteer \nit, they may give us some evidence to suggest what their religious \naffiliation might be, but we cannot ask it of them, nor can we use it \nas a test to whether they qualify for office. That is not my decision; \nit is a decision which I respect in this Constitution, and I have sworn \nto uphold it.\n  Now come these judicial nominees, some of whom are controversial, 10 \nof whom have been subject to a filibuster. They hold a variety of \ndifferent positions on a variety of different issues. Some of them are \npurely governmental issues and secular issues, but some are issues \nwhich transcend--they are issues of government which are also issues of \nvalues and religion.\n  A person's position on the death penalty is an important question to \nask. It is an important part of our criminal justice system. It is also \na question of religious belief. Some feel it is permissible in their \nreligion; others do not. So when you ask a nominee for a judgeship, for \nexample, What is your position on the death penalty, you are asking \nabout a provision of our law, but you are also asking a question that \nmay reach a religious conclusion, too. The lines blur.\n  It isn't just a matter of the issue of abortion. It relates to family \nplanning, to medical research, to the issue of divorce--all sorts of \nissues cross those lines between government and religion.\n  I have been on the Committee on the Judiciary for several years. We \nhave tried to be careful never to cross that line to ask a question of \nreligious belief, knowing full well that most of the nominees sent to \nus had some religious convictions. Our Constitution tells us there is \nno religious test for public office in America, nor should there be if \nyou follow that Constitution.\n\n  So this event, April 24, in Kentucky, by the Family Research Council, \nsuggests the real motive for the filibuster against judicial nominees \nis because those engaged in the filibuster are against people of faith. \nThey could not be more mistaken. The leader on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle is Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. Senator Reid and I have been \nfriends and served together in Congress for over 20 years. I\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\nknow him. I know his wife Landra. I know the family he is so proud of. \nI told him I was going to come to the Senate to speak for a few minutes \nabout this issue. I said: Harry, do you mind if I talk about your \nreligious belief, since you are the Democratic leader? He said: I never \ntalk about religion. To me, it is a personal and private matter; have \nyou ever heard me bring up the issue of religion? And I said: Never, in \nany of the time I have known you. But, he said, you can say this: You \ncan say that Harry Reid said, I am a person of religious conviction. It \nguides my life.\n  So those on the side of the filibuster against 10 nominees out of \n215--many come to this debate on a personal basis with religious \nconviction and religious beliefs. We are not in the business of \ndiscriminating against anyone for their religious belief. I will fight \nfor a person to have their protection under our Bill of Rights to \nbelieve what they want to believe, that our Government will not impose \nreligious beliefs on anyone. That freedom, that right, is sacred and \nneeds to be protected. What we find, unfortunately, is that those who \nare staging this rally have decided to make the issue of the filibuster \na religious issue. It is not and never should be.\n  Americans value religious tolerance and respect. Those who would use \nreligion to stir up partisanship or political anger do a great \ndisservice to this country and to this Constitution. We need to be \nmindful of our responsibilities now more than ever.\n  Witness what has occurred in America in the last several weeks. The \ncontentious national debate over the tragic story of Terri Schiavo, a \nwoman who survived for 15 years, and after numerous court appeals \ninvolving statements by her husband as to her intentions, statements by \nher parents as to their beliefs and values, the courts ruled in Florida \nthat ultimately her decision to not have extraordinary means to prolong \nher life would be respected. There were those in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Tom DeLay of Texas and others, who would \nnot accept the decision of the Florida courts. They wanted special \nlegislation to give others, including those who were not members of her \nfamily, the right to go to court and to fight the family's wishes, to \nfight her husband's wishes, to fight the Florida court decisions.\n  That matter came to the Senate. What we did here was the more \nresponsible course of action. We said, yes, in this particular case \nthey may appeal the Florida court decisions on the Schiavo matter to \nthe Federal courts so long as the person who initiates the appeal is a \nperson in interest, a member of her family, someone who has her best \ninterests in mind, and ultimately the Federal court will decide whether \nit should be reviewed. That ultimately was enacted, and in a matter of \n7 days the Federal courts, from the lowest court to the highest court, \nsaid it has been decided; we are not going to intervene.\n  What happened after that with the Schiavo case? Congressman DeLay and \nmany others from organizations said: That's it, you cannot trust the \nFederal Judiciary. We have to impeach the judges who reach these \ndecisions. They have decided that the independence of the judiciary \nneeds to be attacked by our branch of government.\n  Is that new? Of course it is not. Many are unhappy with decisions \ninvolving Federal courts from time to time. But to call for the \nimpeachment of Federal judges--and some have suggested even worse--\ncrosses that line.\n  Those who are holding some of these rallies have suggested--and I am \nreading directly from the Family Research Council release of April \n15. Let me read the entire first paragraph, in fairness.\n\n  This is from the Family Research Council:\n\n       A day of decision is upon us. Whether it was the \n     legalization of abortion, the banning of school prayer, the \n     expulsion of the 10 Commandments from public spaces, or the \n     starvation of Terri Schiavo, decisions by the courts have not \n     only changed our nation's course, but even led to the taking \n     of human lives. As the liberal, anti-Christian dogma of the \n     left has been repudiated in almost every recent election, the \n     courts have become the last great bastion for liberalism.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       We must stop this unprecedented filibuster of people of \n     faith.\n\n  They call on people to join them on Sunday, April 24, for their so-\ncalled Justice Sunday. It is reported in newspapers today that the \nmajority leader of the Senate will be among those at their gathering. I \ndo not dispute Senator Frist's right to speak his mind. I will fight \nfor his right for free speech and for those who have written this \npublication. But I ask Americans to step back for a moment and ask, Is \nthis what you want? Do you want to have a Federal judiciary and a \nCongress that intervenes in the most private aspects of your life and \nthe life of your family? Do you believe, as most do in America, that we \nwant to be left alone when it comes to our Government, that we want to \nface these critical life-and-death decisions as a family, understanding \nthe wishes of the person involved, praying for the right way to go, but \nmaking the ultimate choice in that hospital room, not in a courtroom?\n  Make no mistake, these decisions are made time and time again every \nday, hundreds of times, maybe thousands of times. Doctors, family \nmembers, ministers, and others, gather in the quiet of a hospital \ncorridor and have to answer the most basic questions.\n  It has happened in my family. It has happened in most.\n  The first thing we ask is, What would my brother want? What would my \nmother want? It is a private, personal, and family decision. But some \nbelieve it should not be. They believe anyone should be able to go to \ncourt to overturn that family decision and to inject themselves into \nthe most intimate decisions of our personal lives. Sadly, that is what \npart of this debate has disintegrated to.\n  Let me close by saying this. I see my colleague and friend Senator \nByrd has come to the floor. I do not need to ask him, I can guarantee \nyou, without fear of contradiction, that in his suit pocket he carries \nthe U.S. Constitution. There is no Member of the Congress, certainly no \nMember of the Senate, who honors this document more every day that he \nserves. And it has been my privilege and high honor to serve with him.\n  I think he understands, as we do, that this nuclear option is a full-\nscale assault on our Constitution. It is an assault on the checks and \nbalances which make America different, the checks and balances in our \nGovernment which have led to the survival of this Nation for over two \ncenturies.\n  This nuclear option, sadly, is an attempt to break the rules of the \nSenate in order to change the rules of the Senate so this President and \nhis majority party can have any judicial nominee they want. And, sadly, \nif they prevail, it will make it easier for them to appoint judges to \nthe bench who are not in touch with the ordinary lives of the American \npeople, who are not moderate and balanced in their approach, but, \nsadly, go too far.\n  This is not an issue of religion. I cannot tell you the religious \nbeliefs of any of the 10 nominees we have filibustered. By the \nConstitution, and by law, we cannot even ask that question, nor would \nI. But it is fair to ask those men and women, as we have, whether they \nwill follow this Constitution, whether they will set out to make law or \nrespect law, whether they will honor the rights and freedoms of the \nAmerican people. In 10 cases out of 215, it has been the decision of at \nleast 41 Members of the Senate or more that the nominees did not meet \nthat test.\n  We need to work together to respect the rights of the American people \nand to respect the Constitution which we have sworn to uphold and \ndefend.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, today, I oppose the AgJOBS amnesty. I oppose \nit. I oppose it unequivocally. I oppose it absolutely.\n  The Senate has already heard a great number of euphemisms about the \nAgJOBS bill, but let's be clear from the start about what we are \ndiscussing. AgJOBS is an amnesty for 3 million illegal aliens. It is \namnesty for aliens employed unlawfully in the agricultural sector, and \nit is amnesty for the businesses that hire and exploit them as cheap \nlabor.\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\n  AgJOBS is legislation that embodies the darkest and most disturbing \nelements of our immigration system; namely, illegal aliens being \nsmuggled across our borders; unscrupulous employers taking advantage of \nundocumented workers; uncontrolled migration, black markets, and \nfraudulent documents used by terrorists to circumvent our border \nsecurity.\n  The AgJOBS bill tarnishes the magnanimous promise of a better life \nenshrined on the base of the Statue of Liberty. It cheapens the \nstruggle of those immigrants who arrived on Ellis Island 100 years ago, \nand all of those who have come to this country and followed the rules \nto earn citizenship in this great Republic.\n  Amnesties beget more illegal immigration--hurtful, destructive, \nillegal immigration. Look at the statistics. After President Ronald \nReagan signed his amnesty into law in 1986, 2.5 million illegal \nimmigrants flooded into this country. Since the 1986 amnesty, the \nCongress has passed 6 additional amnesties, resulting in an explosion \nin the illegal immigrant population, with an estimated 900,000 new \nillegal aliens settling in the United States each year, hoping to be \nsimilarly rewarded. The last thing we need is another amnesty \nmasquerading as immigration reform. Amnesties cheat--amnesties cheat--\nimmigrants and U.S. citizens alike.\n  Our immigration system is already plagued with funding and staffing \nproblems. It is overwhelmed on the borders, in the interior, and in its \nprocessing of immigration applications.\n  Senators need only go to the emergency rooms of the hospitals in this \ncity and in the environs of this city. Go, see for yourselves. The \ninfrastructure is already greatly overburdened. The infrastructure \ncannot handle the problems that are coming upon us.\n  I go to the emergency rooms. I have been to them many times, taking \nmy own wife of almost 68 years of marriage, taking her. I see the \nemergency rooms. I see how they are overcrowded. I see how there are \npeople waiting. I see how there are people out in the corridors, in the \nhalls, lying on cots awaiting attention. The schools are overburdened. \nHealth services, health facilities, just take a look at what is \nhappening. It is too much for the infrastructure.\n  Now we are going to increase the problem. If the AgJOBS amnesty is \nenacted into law, it is going to get worse. My forebears were \nimmigrants, too. They came to this country a long time ago. It is going \nto get worse for employers, worse for immigrants, worse for the \nsecurity of the American people.\n  Following the passage of the 1986 amnesty for 2.7 million illegal \naliens, the INS had to open temporary offices, hire new workers, divert \nresources from enforcement areas. The result was chaos that produced \nrampant fraud, with many aliens, almost 20 years later, still disputing \ntheir amnesty claims in the courts. Today's backlog of immigration \napplications is even larger, with the stack of pending applications at \n4 million and rising. The AgJOBS amnesty would dump countless more \napplications on an already overtasked immigration system. With \nresources so scarce, the process would literally break down, background \nchecks would be missed, document verification would be ignored, and \nbacklogs would grow, encouraging more and more fraud.\n  It only took 19 temporary visa holders to slip through the system to \nunleash the horror of the September 11 attacks. The AgJOBS proposal \nwould shove 3 million illegal aliens, many of whom have never gone \nthrough a background check, through our border security system, in \neffect flooding a bureaucracy that is already drowning. It is a recipe \nfor disaster.\n  It is not mere speculation to suggest that a terrorist would exploit \nan amnesty. It has already happened. Mahmud Abouhalima, a leader of the \n1993 World Trade Center bombing, was legalized--legalized, I say--under \nthe 1986 amnesty. Only after he was legalized was he able to travel \noutside of the country to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border where he \nreceived the terrorist training he used in the bombing.\n  A closer look at the details of the AgJOBS amnesty raises even more \nconcern. The only way to secure amnesty under the AgJOBS proposal is to \nseek U.S. employment. That puts U.S. citizens in direct competition \nwith illegal aliens. Even if U.S. workers are not displaced, illegal \nimmigration depresses wages. It depresses benefits for American jobs.\n  Under the AgJOBS amnesty, an illegal alien, once achieving temporary \nstatus, becomes eligible to apply for permanent residency or even \ncitizenship, which puts that alien ahead of every immigrant waiting to \nimmigrate legally to the United States. That is not fair. When amnesty \nadvocates evoke the image of Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, \nimagine those law-abiding immigrants being told to get back on the ship \nbecause an illegal alien had taken their spot. Is that right? Is that \nfair?\n  I hope Senators will take a close look at this proposal. I want to \naid hard-working immigrants, but this is amnesty for illegal aliens. It \nis amnesty for the unscrupulous employers who exploit them. It is \namnesty for potential terrorists seeking to circumvent our border \ndefenses.\n  The AgJOBS bill is a sweeping, extreme proposal that will undermine \nour immigration system. It has no place on this wartime supplemental \nappropriations bill, and the Senate ought to reject it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd for his thoughtful \nremarks. As I have been doing some research on this AgJOBS bill myself, \nand have become increasingly concerned with it, I came upon a report in \nthe early 1990s that reviewed the success of the 1986 amnesty, or lack \nof success. I wondered--the Senator was here during that time--whether \nthe same arguments were made in favor of the bill in 1986 that are \nbeing made today; and further, whether he would agree with the official \nCommission's report that the 1986 amnesty was a failure?\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I thank the distinguished Senator for his statement. \nI thank him for his attention to my remarks. I was here then. I am here \nnow. I am concerned about the amnesty we are talking about, the AgJOBS \namnesty. I have stated my feelings about it. I am going to leave it at \nthat. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/15/senate-section/article/S3766-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 18, 2005, at 1 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
