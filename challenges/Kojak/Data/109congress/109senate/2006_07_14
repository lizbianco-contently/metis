Mr. President, we will have a period for the transaction \nof morning business this morning. Senators are reminded that we will \nbegin the stem cell debate on Monday. Last night, we reached an \nagreement to allocate debate time in blocks, alternating back and forth \nbetween the majority and minority sides of the aisle. We will begin \nthat debate on Monday at 12:30 p.m. and continue through Tuesday \nafternoon. Then we will proceed to votes on those bills--as a reminder, \nwe have three bills and each of those three bills will have a 60-vote \nthreshold--beginning at 3:45 p.m. on Tuesday. Those will be the first \nvotes of the week.\n  The issue of stem cell research is one this body has debated in the \npast, but what I hope we have been able to structure, in consultation \nwith the Democratic side of the aisle, is a way to have a very good \ndebate on what is a very complicated issue, both from a science \nstandpoint and from an ethical and moral standpoint. It really does \ncause and force, in some ways, each of us as 100 Members of this body--\nbut equally the American people--to go back and address an issue which \nis the first major moral, ethical, and scientific dilemma, challenge \nbefore us in the 21st century. And it is a tough issue. It is \nsomething, as a physician, as a scientist, I have spent a lot of time \nwith, as a transplant surgeon when we are moving tissues around all the \ntime--a heart, a lung, which I routinely transplanted before coming \nhere.\n  It is a tough issue. It involves issues of life and death and \npromises of new cures for diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's. We have \nbeen prone, in this body and every legislative body, to overstatement, \noverpromising. I am very hopeful that the debate, the way we have it \nstructured and giving people\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\ntime to prepare for it, will help educate this body, help educate the \nAmerican people on an issue that is not going to go away--not just stem \ncells but as we look at the various challenges that are opened by the \nHuman Genome Project, a very successful project 15 years ago, finished \nabout 5 years ago on this floor--and opens up all concerns of ethical \ndebates.\n  No matter whether people like it, no matter how hard it is, it is \nvery important that this body become very comfortable in dealing with \nissues of advancing science and the great progress, the new \nopportunities we can make, whether it is addressing our 60 percent \ndependence on foreign sources of oil or looking at the great advances \nin health care and capturing the hopes and promise of new therapies. \nWhether it is genetic, biological stem cells, or the like means, we are \ngoing to have to do a good job in educating ourselves, developing that \nunderstanding, being comfortable talking about advances in science.\n  Science used to advance like this, then this, and in the 21st \ncentury, science is advancing like this. We, representing the American \npeople, have that responsibility to define that advancing science and \nwhere it crosses with ethics and morality.\n  It is going to be a challenging debate, a good debate. I think the \nAmerican people will pay attention, and I know our colleagues are \nworking very hard on that particular issue.\n  Last night in closing, I proposed a unanimous consent agreement on \nthe Water Resources Development Act, the so-called WRDA Act, a bill I \nfeel very strongly we do need to bring to the floor. Chairman Inhofe \nhas done a tremendous job in packaging the bill so that we can address \nthe various issues with, I believe, nine amendments in the unanimous \nconsent request. The Democratic leader has objected to that request, \nbut I am very hopeful we will be able to address that agreement later \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7546-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7546-S7547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me comment on one other issue before \nyielding the floor. It has to do with medicine again. It has to do with \nan issue which is very close to my heart, which I first saw in 1981 \nbefore I ever thought about getting into politics or public policy or \nrunning for the Senate. I first saw this particular issue in the early \n1980s. Nobody had seen it in this country until 1981. Nobody had seen \nit before 1981, which is not that long ago, 25 years ago, but since \nthat time, it killed 1 person, 3 people, 10 people, 1,000 people, 1 \nmillion people, 5 million people, 10 million people, 20 million \npeople--25 million people have died since I first saw it; that is, HIV/\nAIDS, a tiny virus. You can't see it, touch it, taste it. We didn't \nhave it in America. We didn't know what it was, and then it hit. Now 25 \nyears later, 25 million people around the globe have died from that \nlittle, tiny virus. We don't have a cure for it yet. We don't have a \nvaccine for it yet, but we have made huge medical progress over the \nlast 10 years.\n  Two days ago, the FDA announced that they had approved the world's \nfirst single-pill, once-a-day HIV/AIDS treatment. The bill combines \nthree FDA-approved drugs into a single dose. The impact on HIV/AIDS \npatients will be profound.\n  It wasn't that long ago that patients had to take 20 pills a day and \nthen 10 pills a day to control the virus, this little tiny virus, not \nto get rid of it totally but to keep it down so it doesn't have its \nravaging impact on the human body. Some pills you have to take with \nfood, some at 8 o'clock, some at 2 o'clock, some at 6 o'clock, some at \n10 o'clock. Some people say it is not that big a deal; it is \nlifesaving. It is a big deal. If you are a patient having to do it or a \nphysician taking care of a patient, it is impossible to comply with \nthat regimen long term. It is inconvenient, it disrupts life, and now \nit is combined into one pill.\n  By the end of next week, people will be able to control the virus \nwith one pill. Not everybody is going to switch to it, but it opens up \nhuge opportunities.\n  It is good news not just in that it simplifies the prescription \nregimen of HIV/AIDS patients, but to quote a fellow doctor who is the \ncurrent Acting Commissioner of the FDA, Andrew von Eschenbach:\n\n       Compliance with therapy is as important as the therapy \n     itself for a successful outcome.\n\n  To have a successful outcome, HIV/AIDS patients have to take at least \n95 percent of their pills or the treatment doesn't take. It isn't as if \nyou can take 2 or 3 of the 15 pills and it will work. You have to \nreally take just about all the pills. Only one pill a day increases the \nlikelihood of a patient meeting that threshold. That one pill will do \nthe trick. Not only does improved compliance keep HIV/AIDS patients \nhealthy, but it helps slow down that emergence and transmission of \nstrains of virus that have become drug-resistant. The drugs you take \nover a period of time--the virus is smart, it is cagey, it moves \naround, and it will develop resistance to those drugs as it comes in. \nAs it gets accustomed to the drugs, the virus will change.\n  Scientists hail this as a medical breakthrough for good reason. \nWednesday's announcement approving the new pill was timely. Yesterday, \nthe CSIS Task Force on HIV/AIDS hosted a conference to examine the \nsustainability of United States-led efforts in combating the virus. I \nhave cochaired the CSIS task force along with my colleague, Senator \nRuss Feingold. I had the opportunity, as did Senator Feingold, to \ndeliver opening remarks to that conference.\n  Looking back over the 25 years, as we did yesterday, I recalled the \nsame story I just told: 25 million people have died on our watch, over \nmy lifetime as a physician. As recently as 5 years ago, less than $1 \nbillion was spent by the world. If we put together all the world's \nresources, today it is more than eight times that--eight times that--in \njust 5 years.\n  Today about 40 million people worldwide, including a million people \nin this country--a million Americans--are HIV positive. That means they \nhave the virus in them, and it can be detected. Over half of all people \nliving with HIV/AIDS or HIV in the world live in a continent I go to \nevery year, and that is the continent of Africa.\n  Ten years ago, in 1996, I went to Sub-Saharan Africa to Tanzania, to \nKenya, in that whole central eastern region of Africa where I do \nmedical mission work. That became an annual trip after 1996. Nothing \nquite prepares you for walking through a village in an AIDS-afflicted \npart of Africa. You see older people, and then you see very young \npeople, but you don't see--there is like a big doughnut hole there--you \ndon't see middle-aged people walking around. Why? Because that virus \nhas ravaged traditionally the most productive part of society. They \ninclude teachers, police, law enforcement, wage earners, the people who \nare out moving, herding the animals, the people who are out growing the \ncrops, the people who make up the strongest and most productive fabric \nof society.\n  The deadly disease has left countless children as orphans. It has \ndisrupted the social framework of many communities. It has challenged \nthe infrastructure and stability of many nations in ways that are \ntotally unprecedented and we just haven't seen in history.\n  I outlined my vision at the conference yesterday for sustaining \nmomentum and winning this war on HIV/AIDS, and already, with the \nsuccessful development and approval of this single-pill therapy, we \nhave seen how one piece of the vision that I put out yesterday--unity--\nis reaching across differences and we can reshape our approach to HIV/\nAIDS.\n  The breakthrough this week was made possible because of \ncollaboration, partnership, a very unusual partnership, a collaborative \nventure by two drug companies that normally are competing. So that is a \nbreakthrough that may not be readily apparent, but those of us who \nfollow health, the pharmaceutical industry, and public health, this is \na huge breakthrough.\n  Two drug companies set aside their competition, they set aside their \nconcerns about the bottom line to work together and do what we need to \ndo throughout health care, which we don't do today. As we look to \nhealth care 20 years from now, we have to do it, and that is put the \npatient at the center, put the patient first. That is what these two \ndrug companies did yesterday.\n  I commend the makers of this single-pill therapy. I hope this does \nstart a\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\nnew trend.

They did this yesterday by \ndeveloping this pill, having the FDA to approve this particular pill. \nWe need to do that throughout our health care system. We do have a \nhealth care system that is chaotic, in terms of its organization. It is \nnot really even a system; it is more of a sector.\n  If we can go back to that principle of putting the patient first, \nputting the patient in the center, we can weed out the waste and weed \nout the inefficiency and lower the cost and make a very optimistic \nfuture for our health care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7547-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago I came to the floor of the \nSenate and announced I will do everything in my power to block \nconsideration of the major communications overhaul legislation until it \nincludes language that specifically ensures what is called Net \nneutrality.\n  Now, since this is a new concept, and certainly much of the country \nprobably has not heard these words before and Senators have been asking \nquestions about it, I am going to begin this morning, and intend on \nother instances to continue the discussion, to start talking about why \nNet neutrality is so important and why I will do everything in my power \nto block legislation, major communications legislation, unless it \nensures that Net neutrality is preserved.\n  The bottom line about this concept is pretty simple. It means there \nwill not be discrimination on the Internet. Today, after you pay your \naccess charge, your Internet access fee, you get to take your browser \nand you get to go where you want, when you want, and everybody is \ntreated the same: the mightiest person in the land, the most affluent, \nand somebody, say, in rural Georgia or rural Oregon who does not have a \nlot of power and does not have a lot of wealth.\n  The Internet has been a huge step forward, in my view, for democracy, \nfor the proposition our country is based on which is to give everybody \na fair shake, where everybody is treated equally. It has meant a real \nbonanza for our citizens in areas such as education, health, business--\na whole host of fields. There needs to be a clear policy preserving the \nneutrality of the Internet. And without tough sanctions against those \nwho would discriminate online, in my view, the Internet would be \nchanged forever, for the worse. I intend to do everything in my power \nto keep that from happening.\n  Since I came to the floor to announce that I will do everything I can \nto block this legislation in its current form, the phone companies and \nthe major communications lobbies in this country have launched an all-\nout advertising blitz. They are now spending millions of dollars trying \nto win passage of this legislation that does not include protection for \nNet neutrality. They are spending millions of dollars so they can make \nbillions of dollars when they implement a two-tiered system online.\n  They have been telling Wall Street about their plans for some time. \nThe Wall Street Journal, for example, outlined a pay-to-play plan that \nthe phone companies and the cable companies have been talking about in \na fairly open kind of fashion.\n  All this discussion suggests there is something of a looming shortage \nof bandwidth. Of course, bandwidth is the speed at which all the \ninformation on the Web travels to the user. But what has not been given \nenough attention thus far, and what I will talk about this morning and \nin the days ahead, is that the real Net neutrality fight is not \nprimarily over bandwidth but who is going to call the shots in this \ncountry about content on the Web. Content is all the information that \nis out there on the Web. It includes music, movies, e-mails, newspaper \narticles and Web sites.\n  Bandwidth speeds are getting faster and faster, allowing all this \ncontent to reach the users faster. But bandwidth without content is \nakin to a swimming pool without water. It is there, but you cannot do \nanything with it. So the real Net neutrality fight is going to be about \ncontent.\n  Now, those who control the pipes--the way you get to the Internet--\nalso want to control the content. The reason for that is because \ncontent is king. What good is one gigabyte Internet connection if you \ncannot get to the Web sites you want to visit? Legislation that does \nnot have strong Net neutrality protections will mean the American \npeople will face discrimination in content.\n  The Internet has thrived precisely because it is free of \ndiscrimination. It has thrived because consumers, and not some huge \ncable or phone company, get to choose what they want to see and how \nquickly they get to see it. I do not think there is anything odd about \nfighting against a bill that will take control of the Internet away \nfrom the American people.\n  What the cable and phone executives propose is that instead of \nproviding equal access for everyone to the same content, at the same \nprice, they are going to be in a position to cut sweetheart deals, to \ngive somebody they favor a better break than somebody whom they do not \nlook upon in the same way. Those who own the pipes do not want to be \ntold they cannot discriminate. They do not want to be told by the \nCongress, or anybody else, sweetheart deals are off limits.\n  What I have done is tried to look at the Senate Commerce Committee \nlegislation and compare it to the kinds of concerns I think the \nAmerican people are going to have with the legislation in its current \nform. So what I would like to do now is outline three examples of what \ncould happen in our country if communications legislation that allows \ndiscrimination on the Internet was allowed to go forward.\n  The first example involves what I am calling the Barns family. The \nBarns family owns a struggling electronics store. Sales have been \nhammered lately because a new ``big box'' electronics store opened up \ndown the road. George Barns' son Mike came up with an idea to save the \nstore. He said: We can reach new customers. We will start a Web\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\nsite to sell our products on the Net. In a world with Net neutrality, \nthe Barns family would pay to access the Internet, create a Web page, \nand they would be off to the races with their business and looking for \nopportunities.\n  Under the Commerce Committee bill, in order for the Barns family to \nlaunch their Web page in the fast lane so they could get priority \naccess to customers, they could have to pay an additional fee to \nhundreds, if not thousands, of Internet access providers across the \nland. Priority access fees are a drop in the bucket for that ``big \nbox'' store that is already hurting the sales of that small business \nrun by the Barns family. If the Barns family can't pay the extra fees, \nthey lose their business to the ``big box'' store, both offline and \nonline. You see how small businesses and people who are trying to make \na contribution to the economy compete in the free markets; you are \ngoing to see how they are going to have difficulty under this \nlegislation.\n  The second example involves somebody whom I am calling Joe Green. Joe \nwants to get Internet broadband in his new apartment. Local cable is \nthe only choice for Internet access, and it charges $32.99 for a 1.5-\nmegabyte-per-second connection. In a world with Net neutrality, when \nJoe buys his connection from local cable, he gets to visit any Web site \nhe wants, when he wants, how he wants. If he wants to download a song, \nsay, from iTunes for a buck, he can do that. If he wants to search the \nWeb using Google or buy a DVD player online, Joe can do that, too. But \nunder the legislation that came from the Commerce Committee, Joe may \nnot be able to do any of those things unless he pays a new priority \naccess charge on top of the $32.99 Internet access charge he is paying \nalready. Unless he pays the additional priority fee, a Web search at \nGoogle could take 5 minutes to load because Google is not paying the \nextra fee to local cable for priority access. Downloading a song--say \nthe download Joe wants to make at iTunes--could cost him more than the \nbuck he is paying because iTunes is passing on the cost of paying local \ncable the priority access fee that you could charge if the Commerce \nCommittee bill goes forward as written. Joe wants to switch to another \nbroadband provider but guess what. In a lot of communities, there is no \nchoice. Joe is stuck. This is example No. 2 of how the American people \nare going to get hammered if discrimination is allowed online under \nthis legislation.\n  Let me offer a third example I have developed as I looked at the \nCommerce Committee bill on overhauling our communications law. The \nthird example involves somebody I have been calling Sally Smith. She is \na young computer programmer. She has a great new algorithm for a Web \nbrowser that is going to help people access information on the Net \nfaster and in a more user-friendly way. In a world with Net neutrality, \nSally can get her idea all over the tech Web sites that exist across \nthe country, and people are going to be able to test it out. If all the \npeople out there in the tech world like Sally's idea, word of her \ninnovation would spread over the Web, across the land, and across the \nworld. Millions of people would be able to download her new Web \nbrowser. But under the legislation coming from the Commerce Committee, \nSally Smith could be stymied.\n  In addition to what she is already paying for Internet access, Sally \nis going to have to come up with yet more money to pay for priority \naccess to the Internet fast lane that she so desperately will want in \norder to test her idea. If she wants her browser to succeed, she is \ngoing to be forced to fork over new priority access fees because she \nknows no one is going to go looking in the slow lane for a good new Web \nbrowser.\n  I came to the floor--I have already announced my hold on this \nlegislation, and I will do everything to block this bill until it \nensures that the Net in the future will be free of discrimination--\nbecause I wanted to go beyond my original statement to talk about how, \nunder this bill, those who own the pipes to the Net, the phone and the \ncable people, could extend their reach under this legislation to put a \nstranglehold on Internet content. According to the business plans, \nplans that have been published in the Wall Street Journal, that is the \ndirection in which we are headed.\n  Without Net neutrality, the people in these examples I have \nhighlighted--a struggling entrepreneur, somebody getting started in \ntheir new home or apartment, a young computer programmer--are going to \nhave real problems getting access to the Web and being able to afford \nthe services that are now within their reach.\n  The big cable and phone lobbies want the public to think Net \nneutrality is what they call a lose-lose proposition. My view is, no \nNet neutrality will be the real loss for consumers. It will mean \ndouble-barrel discrimination, discrimination in Internet content, and \nhigher prices for the consumers. That is why scores of groups all \nacross the country, all across the political spectrum--groups and \npeople who, I dare say, disagree almost always--are united behind the \nproposition that the Internet should be free of discrimination.\n  We are going to hear a lot about this issue in the days ahead. We are \ngoing to be told constantly that the phone and cable people will not \nbuild out the network unless they can sock the consumer and the small \nbusinesses with higher access charges. The way the system works today, \nwhere there is a true free marketplace, where the mightiest is treated \nonline in the same way someone is treated who doesn't have a lot of \nmoney, doesn't have clout, that is the best way to grow the network, to \nexpand communications opportunities, preserve the free marketplace so \nthat people, after they pay that Internet access charge, can go where \nthey want, when they want.\n  Certainly a lot of our competitors around the world, people with whom \nwe will be competing in the marketplace, treat everybody the same \nonline. I can't figure out how we can expect to be competitive in the \nglobal marketplace if we start singling out, as I have described in the \nexamples, the small businesses and entrepreneurs for what amounts to \ntwo-tiered communications services. They are not going to be able to \ncompete. I want to make sure that somebody who is in a garage, say, in \nTexas, Oregon, or some other part of the country has the same \nopportunity to compete against people who are dreaming big in countries \naround the world.\n  As we discuss this communications issue, there will be a lot of talk \nabout how this is a battle between big communications lobbies--say, the \nVerizon company and Google. It is sometimes portrayed as a fight \nbetween these overdogs, people who have a lot of clout and want to \ndivide up the pie and get more for themselves. Verizon and Google can \ntake care of themselves. They have deep pockets. They have lots of \nclout. But what I am concerned about are the future Googles, the people \nwho are dreaming, the people with the startups, the people with \ninnovative, cutting-edge ideas who have been able to go online and, as \na result, have been successful. That is what the American dream is all \nabout. That is what has made the Internet so exciting. It has created \nopportunities for those people who are a long way from major financial \nmarkets and who don't have deep pockets.\n\n  I do not want to see the American people face double-barrel \ndiscrimination and higher prices on the Net. I don't want to see them \nnot have what they have today, which is a fair shake for all. Equal \ncontent gets equal treatment. I am going to stay at it with respect to \nthis legislation as one Senator until we get true Net neutrality \nprinciples in the communications bill, until we ensure that the Net is \nfree of discrimination.\n  The reason Net neutrality has become such a lightning rod in the \ndebate about communications is that the Internet is the ball game. The \n1996 telecommunications bill barely touched on the Net. In 2006, the \nNet neutrality debate on the Internet is the ball game because the \nInternet is how we are going to get all our communications in the \nfuture. It means we are going to look first to the Internet, and \nbecause it is so central to the future of communications, the Senate \nought to insist that the Net be kept free of discrimination. We have \ndone that in the area of taxation. I and other colleagues have said we \nare not going to allow multiple and discriminatory taxes on the \nInternet. We ought to make darn sure that it is done in this area as \nwell so that\n\n[[Page S7549]]\n\nconsumers don't get walloped with unnecessarily high prices and \ndeteriorating service.\n  I will continue the fight to hold up this legislation until, for all \ntime, the Net is free of discrimination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Mr. President, for a moment I wanted to address the \nsubject of immigration before we leave for the weekend.\n  About 2 months ago, I offered an amendment to the Senate immigration \nbill which at the time was referred to as a deal-breaker. I want to \nsuggest that it is now being referred to as a deal-maker. I wish to \noffer some suggestions constructively for the Senate to consider and \nothers who are involved in this debate.\n  I want to repeat, for the benefit of everyone, what the amendment I \noffered and the distinguished Presiding Officer supported, as well as \nmany other Members of the Senate--not enough but almost enough--simply \nsaid: That no program contained in the act that granted legal status to \nsomeone who was in America illegally could take effect until the \nSecretary of Homeland Security certified that all of the border \nsecurity measures proposed in the act in title I and section 233 of \ntitle II were in force, funded, and operational.\n  It has become known as a trigger because it said that any guest \nworker program or any other reform that took place could only take \nplace after we had done the job the American people suggested we should \ndo.\n  A lot of people said: We can't secure our border. If we can \ntransplant hearts and fly to the Moon, we can secure our border. What \nwe have needed is resolve. I have been pleased to see just this week \ncountless articles in countless newspapers where all of the players in \nthe debate, from the White House to the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, have now opened themselves to discuss a trigger in the \nimmigration reform bill to ensure that when we have immigration reform, \nit is truly comprehensive because I would suggest to them that in the \nabsence of border security, there can be no comprehensive reform.\n  Only when people know that the door is closed will they cooperate \nwith not only the spirit but the letter of the law and the reforms that \nwe make.\n  Just to remind us in the Senate, we were very specific in title I. \nThe specifics of title I said we will train the 6,000 Border Patrol \nagents and put them online. That takes 2 years to do. It said we will \nbuild the barriers where necessary geographically and the roads where \nessential. That is doable in 2 years. We will deploy the 27 UAVs, the \neyes in the sky, to surveil the entire 2,000-mile southwestern border. \nThat is doable, and it is doable within a year. We will build the \ndetention facilities to end the catch-and-release practice and to begin \nto have true enforcement on the border. And we will have a verification \nprogram for guest workers and immigrants that is verifiable and not \nforgeable. That takes 2 years. So as a practical matter, as people have \nbacked up from the original debate, they have looked forward. They now \nare seeing through the forest to look at the trees, and they say, yes, \nif we secure the border, it will take 2 years, but it is going to take \n2 years to implement whatever else we would do on worker reform as \nwell.\n  So folks are coming together. People are beginning to talk, and I am \npleased with that--pleased with that because I am the grandson of an \nimmigrant who came to this country, became a naturalized citizen, and I \nhonor our immigration process. I am glad to see that because we depend \non a workforce that is vibrant and dependable. And I am pleased to hear \nthat because I believe the American people consider our border an \nemergency. And now that all the players are beginning to talk, \nhopefully we can close the deal.\n  Mr. President, yesterday the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nSessions, offered two amendments to the Homeland Security bill. \nAlthough they failed, they laid the groundwork for what I think is an \nimportant step for us to take and that is to go ahead and move forward \nwith what all of us agree are the necessary steps for border security. \nThat is the foundation upon which we can reach the final agreements on \nguest worker, on green cards, on quotas, and on citizenship, but only \nafter the American people are convinced we have made the commitment to \nsecure our border will the American people want us to make any deal on \nreform of immigration.\n  We pass emergency supplementals for various things in this body. We \nhave done it in response to Katrina; we have done it in response to \nIraq. I submit the American people would tell you there is no greater \nemergency than securing our border. If the White House sent an \nemergency supplemental to this Senate for the money to fund the UAVs, \nthe 6,000 Border Patrol agents, and the rest of title I, I doubt we \nwould see maybe one or two dissenters because everybody knows it is an \nemergency, they know it needs to be done. And if it is, in fact, \ncorrect, that border security first is the trigger for comprehensive \nreform which is necessary, then let's declare it an emergency. Let's \nhave the proposal come to the floor, let's debate it, and let's fund \nit, so as the year progresses, as the hearings are done, as we come \nback in session in September, we in this Congress can deal with \ncomprehensive reform built on the foundation of comprehensive border \nsecurity first.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your cooperation and that of all the \ncolleagues in this body as we work dealing with a very difficult and \ncomplicated but a very doable reform of our immigration laws. I \nappreciate the commitment of those so far in border security first, and \nI think in the end all of us together--the executive and legislative \nbranches--can come together on comprehensive reform that is built on \nsecuring our border to ensure the reforms we make are lasting and \nagreed to.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I understand there was an inadvertent \nclerical error in Chairman Inhofe's statement in the Congressional \nRecord last night. I ask unanimous consent that the correct statement \nbe printed in the Congressional Record at this point and that the \npermanent Record reflect this correction.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. Inhofe. Mr. President, if the unanimous consent request \n     goes through, we will be able to move to the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 2006, WRDA. We have not done a WRDA since \n     the year 2000. As chairman of the Environment and Public \n     Works Committee, I have been working on this for 3 years. We \n     have had incredible cooperation, as everybody in the Chamber \n     knows. It is always difficult to get something like this \n     through, but it is necessary to keep this country moving.\n       All members of the Environment and Public Works Committee: \n     Senators Thune, DeMint, Vitter, Warner, Isakson, Chafee, \n     Murkowski, Senator Voinovich, Jeffords, Baucus, Lieberman, \n     Boxer, Carper, Clinton, Lautenberg, and Obama have been \n     particularly helpful. Senator Bond, who is chairman of the \n     subcommittee, has been very helpful, along with Senator \n     Voinovich who has a concern for maintaining our Nation's \n     infrastructure.\n       The big four in this case, of course, would be Senators \n     Bond, Baucus, Jeffords, and myself. We have worked closely \n     together to overcome some of the obstacles. Early on, there \n     were several holds on this bill because it is complicated. It \n     is one that almost is of the magnitude of the Transportation \n     reauthorization bill. But we had several people who had \n     concerns and we worked with them, including Senator Snowe, \n     who was nice enough to help us with some of the facets she \n     had objections to; Senator Sessions; Senator McCain. \n     Everybody was there working together. It was quite an \n     undertaking to get us to the point where we are today.\n       I will single out several others. Senator Gregg had some \n     concerns also. Probably one of the persons I was really \n     gratified to work with is Senator Feingold, the Senator from \n     Wisconsin. I thank him for his cooperation. He had a number \n     of amendments that I thought would be more than we could \n     really handle. We had to get the number down to a certain \n     number that is workable so we could have a time agreement to \n     get this bill passed. I thank Senator Feingold for his \n     cooperation and for agreeing to offer limited amendments \n     under short time agreements. If he wanted to be hard to get \n     along with, he could have had long agreements and this would \n     have gone into many nights. He didn't do that. He agreed to \n     short time agreements, which will make this possible to pass. \n     His willingness to work with us is very much appreciated by \n     me.\n       Over the past few months, he consistently has been helpful \n     and responsive in working on the WRDA bill. For anyone to \n     suggest that Senator Feingold has not been helpful in keeping \n     this process moving would be wrong. He has been a great \n     partner with me in moving things forward and I thank the \n     Senator from Wisconsin for his cooperation.\n       We have a lot that we need to authorize the Corps of \n     Engineers to do in navigation, flood control and \n     environmental restoration. This bill will allow us to do \n     that. I thank everybody for his or her cooperation. Let's go \n     forward.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, especially Chairman \nInhofe, for, as I mentioned this morning, doing an outstanding job in \nputting together a package, a mechanism by which we can develop this \nimportant water resources development bill. It is a very important bill \nwhich affects the United States, our economy, our infrastructure, in a \nvery dramatic way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7550-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2007 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. The Senate passed this measure \nyesterday unanimously and I voted in support of it.\n  I would like to begin by thanking the principal authors and managers \nof this legislation: Senator Gregg and Senator Byrd. It is no easy task \nto write a bill that provides for our domestic security needs. I \ncommend both of our colleagues and their staffs for the hard work they \nput into crafting this legislation.\n  The bill that passed the Senate funds our country's homeland security \nactivities at $32.8 billion for the upcoming fiscal year. These \nactivities include port security, rail security, truck security, \naviation security, emergency first responders, customs and border \npatrol, immigration, the Coast Guard, and counterterrorism research. \nTaken together, these initiatives form the foundation upon which our \ncountry depends for its internal security.\n  In an age when terrorism continues to be a growing threat to our \nNation, one would think that the Congress of the United States would be \ndoing everything it could to shore up that foundation--to make it as \nimpregnable as possible against those who wish us harm. Yet when we \nlook at the legislation passed by the Senate, I do not believe it does \nenough to protect our people from terrorism. We are simply not \ninvesting the resources that are required to make this Nation as safe \nas possible. Instead of filling in the gaps that continue to exist \nwithin our homeland security foundation, we are letting those gaps and \ncracks grow in several critical respects.\n  One does not have to look further than protecting our critical \ninfrastructure and funding our emergency first responders. These two \nareas arguably form the backbone of our efforts to prevent and \neffectively respond to terrorist attacks at home. They encompass \nprotecting our ports, our railroads, our transit systems and our \ncommercial vehicles. They encompass quickly and effectively responding \nto real or perceived threats in all parts of our country.\n  The bill that passed the Senate spends roughly $4 billion to protect \nour critical infrastructure, equip our first responders, an assist \nlocal governments in planning and coordinating their homeland security \nactivities. While this may seem like a large number to many Americans, \nit has been cited by numerous national security and public health \nexperts, along with first responders themselves, as being wholly \ninadequate to meet the homeland security demands of the 21st century. \nFurthermore, the number is actually less than what has been provided in \nthe past. While on par with what was provided last year, it is \napproximately $500 million less than what was provided 2 years ago and \napproximately $700 million less than 3 years ago. Clearly, we \nare heading in the wrong direction--doing less to protect our country \nadequately when we ought to be doing more.\n\n  As we have seen in Madrid 2 years ago, in London last year, in India \nearlier this week, and in Iraq almost every week, terrorists have \nbecome adept at exploiting weak points in critical infrastructure, \nparticularly transportation systems. I question what it will take for \nus to realize that we need to\n\n[[Page S7551]]\n\nbe investing more in our domestic critical infrastructure and in our \nfirst responders.\n  Although we have taken steps to boost our homeland security since the \nattacks on September 11, our critical infrastructure remains largely \nexposed and our emergency first responders are spread too thin. Our \nport authorities have identified $8.4 billion for meeting Federal \nsecurity requirements; transit agencies have identified $6 billion for \nmaking trains and buses safer for passengers; and firefighters have \nidentified over $4 billion for performing their critical duties safely \nand efficiently.\n  As the Senate considered this legislation, I was offered an amendment \nthat increased resources to our Nation's firefighters by $25 million \nabove the bill's allocation of $655 million. This amendment was \ncosponsored by colleagues, Senators DeWine, Mikulski, and Snowe, and \nwas agreed to by unanimous consent.\n  I also offered an amendment that would have increased critical \ninfrastructure security and first responder funding by $16 billion to a \ntotal of $20 billion. My amendment would have codified a recommendation \nmade 3 years ago by a task force chaired by our former colleague, \nWarren Rudman, along with a distinguished panel of national security, \nintelligence, military and public health officials.\n  Regrettably, this measure--along with other measures I supported \nseeking to raise resources for critical infrastructure protection and \nfirst responders--were not adopted. Members who spoke in opposition to \nthese amendments argued that we could not afford the extra cost. \nIronically, many of the Members who opposed these amendments have \nsupported permanent tax cuts for the most affluent of Americans--tax \ncuts that have been projected to cost $1 trillion over the next 15 \nyears. If we can afford to give such a generous tax break to the few \nthousand wealthiest Americans, then why can we not afford adequately to \nsafeguard 281 million Americans from terrorist attacks at a mere \nfraction of that cost?\n  We are living in extraordinary times. Never before in our history has \nthere been a prolonged period of time when the threat of harm to \nAmericans on their own soil has been so high. While it has been almost \n5 years since terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, the more \nrecent attacks in Madrid, London, and Mumbai tell us that we must \nremain vigilant about our domestic security. They tell us that we must \nrenew and redouble our efforts to prevent and respond to terrorism here \nat home.\n  On balance, I voted for this legislation because the funding it \nappropriates does take important steps towards meeting our domestic \nsecurity needs. However, I look forward to working with my colleagues \nin the coming years to find and provide the necessary resources that \ncan make our Nation as safe and strong as it can possibly be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7551-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FEMA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, earlier this week, I voted with a \nbipartisan majority of Senators to strengthen FEMA while leaving it in \nthe Department of Homeland Security. In the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina and the woeful response of the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration, I was prepared to remove FEMA from the Department of \nHomeland Security. At the time, it was clear that FEMA had been \nstripped of necessary resources and leadership, and that, as a result \nof these choices, it had failed the citizens of the gulf coast.\n  I changed my mind and voted to strengthen FEMA for three important \nreasons. First, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee conducted extensive hearings and oversight into the problems \nthat led to the catastrophe of Katrina and how to fix this systemic \nfailure. They conducted a 7-month investigation, including 23 hearings, \nheard testimony from 85 witnesses, interviewed 325 individuals, and \nreviewed 838,000 documents. They obviously did their homework.\n  Second, as a result of this exhaustive research, they made \nsubstantive proposals to strengthen the role of FEMA within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. These changes will provide new \nstatutory protections to ensure that the Administrator had direct \naccess to the President, that it restores authorities to work directly \nwith State and local agencies, and that it strengthens regional \nauthorities by creating teams to foster cooperation and joint training \nfor local emergency managers and first responders.\n  The final, and most important, reason that I decided to vote to \nstrengthen FEMA as a component of the Department of Homeland Security \nis because of the position of local law enforcement and first \nresponders. The bottom line is that I have spent my career working with \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers \nCoalition, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters, the Major Cities Chief, and \nlocal first responders. I strongly value the opinions of these \nindividuals, and if they believe that this is the right approach to \nhelp them in their efforts to save lives, I am willing to give it a \nshot.\n  I hope that the changes voted for by the vast majority of Senators \nearlier this week will return FEMA to its vaunted status of the 1990s. \nThe American people deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7551-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7551-S7552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECENT ATTACKS ON ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to offer my full \nsupport of Israel's decision to defend itself. I also commend U.N. \nAmbassador John Bolton for vetoing the U.N. Security Council resolution \naddressing the situation in the Middle East, because of its unbalanced \napproach to the situation.\n  Unfortunately, due to the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers by Hamas and \nthe continued rocket attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah against Israeli \ntowns and villages, the Israeli Government was forced to defend itself.\n  There is no doubt that the Governments of Syria, Lebanon, and Iran \nare responsible for these attacks. These Governments provide the \nmilitary equipment, training, and financing for Hamas and Hezbollah to \nconduct their terror campaigns. Their continued support for these \nterrorist organizations has left the Israeli Government with no other \noption than to defend itself by pursuing terrorist safe havens in Gaza \nand southern Lebanon.\n  Israel continues to be one of America's closest allies, and in this \nperiod of terror against the Israeli people it is essential that we \nsupport Israel's decision to defend itself against these terrorist \nattacks. I ask that the world community join in solidarity with Israel \nas it takes necessary steps to provide security to its people and \ndismantle the terrorist infrastructure in the Palestinian areas and in \nsouthern Lebanon.\n  Israel was attacked for one reason--these terror organizations and \nsome governments in the region believe Israel does not have a right to \nexist as a country, much less live peacefully as a country. The \nunprovoked missile launches against Israel civilians, suicide bombings \nof women and children, and the kidnapping and torture of Israeli \nsoldiers is the result of Iran, Syria, and certain factions of the \nLebanese Government's inaction towards these terrorist organizations in \ntheir country.\n  The cycle of violence can only end if these countries dismantle these \nterrorist groups by cutting off funding and prohibiting terrorist \norganizations from participating in their governments. Otherwise, \nIsrael will be required to continue defending itself against terrorist \nstrongholds, and innocent civilians will suffer greatly--all of this \nbecause certain extreme elements remain bent on destruction rather than \nreconciliation.\n  Israel is a sovereign country that deserves to live in peace. Israel \ndeserves to live in peace, free from the attacks of those who prey upon \nits open and democratic society. Unfortunately, innocent civilians are \nones who pay the price on both sides of the conflict. Yet, until Israel \nis able to live free of missile attacks, kidnappings, and suicide \nbombers the unfortunate reality is that suffering will continue.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the United States should and must \nsupport Israel's right to defend itself. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in expressing their support for one of our closest allies.\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to express my outrage at the \nterrorist actions of Hezbollah that we have seen in recent days.\n  As my colleagues are aware, this terrorist group conducted raids \nacross Israel's border, kidnapping two Israeli soldiers, and also \nkilled eight other Israeli soldiers. The stability in the region has \nbeen significantly compromised because of these terrorist actions.\n  These attacks on the sovereign nation of Israel are reprehensible, \nthey are unacceptable, and they are not going unanswered. Israel has \nsaid it will not negotiate with terror organizations, and has demanded \nthe release of its soldiers.\n  The United States must stand by Israel as it defends itself against \nsuch cowardly attacks. Israel has not only the right, but the \nresponsibility to defend its citizens.\n  And there is certainly no doubt that Syria and Iran support the \nterrorist actions of Hezbollah. In fact, the latest State Department \nreport on terrorism identifies Iran and Syria as state sponsors of \nterrorism. We will continue to wage the global war on terror, to do our \nbest to rid the world of terrorists and those who support them.\n  But when acts of terrorism are perpetrated against sovereign nations, \nthe international community must recognize that such nations will \nprotect themselves and their citizens, as it is their right to do.\n  I extend my sympathy to the families of the Israeli soldiers who have \nbeen killed in these attacks and pray for the safe return of those \ncaptured.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7552-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TRIGGER LOCKS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, safe storage and child access prevention \nlaws are crucial steps in the effort to reduce the occurrence of \naccidental shootings and suicides involving guns. Such tragedies have \nclaimed the lives of thousands of young people and destroyed thousands \nof families, even though many of these occurrences could have been \nprevented by commonsense legislation.\n  A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association \nfound that the application of responsible gun storage measures can \nsignificantly reduce the risk of unintentional shooting or suicide by \nminors using a gun. According to the study, when ammunition in the home \nis locked up, the risk of such injuries is reduced by 61 percent. \nSimply storing ammunition separately from the gun reduces such \noccurrences by more than 50 percent.\n  According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, teenagers \nand children are involved in more than 10,000 accidental shootings in \nwhich nearly 800 people die each year. Reducing the number of \naccidental shootings involving children and teenagers requires that \ncommonsense gun storage measures be adopted.\n  In 2005, Congress passed a law, which the President signed, requiring \nthat all handguns sold by a dealer come with a child-safety lock. It \nwas a clear bipartisan effort to protect the youth of this country from \ngun violence. Unfortunately, last month the House of Representatives \nadopted legislation to repeal effective enforcement of this requirement \nas part of its Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act. The Senate has not yet considered its version of \nthe appropriations bill.\n  Sarah Brady, wife of Jim Brady, who was shot in the attempted \nassassination of President Reagan, responded to last month's vote by \nsaying:\n\n       In a nation where gun violence takes such an enormous toll, \n     this vote is disturbingly backwards. Every year more than \n     30,000 Americans are killed by guns, including more than \n     2,800 young people. Every day, we lose a classroom of \n     children to gun violence. So many health advocates, law \n     enforcement officials, and others have urged Americans to \n     more safely secure and store guns. But in the millions of \n     American homes where children and firearms are present, 40 \n     percent had at least one unlocked firearm.\n\n  While the problems of youth suicide and accidental shooting clearly \ncannot be completely legislated away, trigger locks and other sensible \ngun safety measures can help limit access to firearms by children, and \nthere can be no doubt that reducing access by our kids to firearms can \nsave many lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7552-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7552-S7553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REGULATING PAYROLL TAX DEPOSIT AGENTS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I have previously introduced a bill to \nregulate payroll tax deposit agents. This bill will help to protect \nsmall businesses from payroll tax fraud and provide them with greater \nconfidence when working with payroll service providers that are \nregistered with the Internal Revenue Service and bonded or audited.\n  In the fall of 2003, small businessman Roger Cyr, the owner of the \nLily Moon Cafe in Saco, ME, learned that he was the victim of payroll \ntax fraud and owed $52,000 in back taxes. He was one of a number of \nsmall business owners in Maine who were forced to pay their payroll \ntaxes twice after an unscrupulous payroll provider ran off with their \ntax deposits instead of making the required payments to the IRS.\n  Unfortunately, I know that this type of payroll fraud is not unique \nto Maine and has also occurred in Utah, Iowa, as well as elsewhere. \nWhen payroll tax fraud occurs, many small owners, mom-and-pop \ncompanies, and other businesses are forced to pay their payroll taxes \ntwice. This additional and unexpected expense can drive many of these \ncompanies out of business.\n  These payroll fraud cases obscure the fact that most small businesses \nuse payroll providers that are honest, meticulous, and trustworthy. The \nmajority of payroll tax agents pay their clients' taxes accurately and \non time, provide outstanding service, and help their clients with a \nrange of complicated tax and accounting issues. In order to protect \nsmall business owners from the few dishonest payroll providers, and to \nprotect the honest small payroll providers from the bad actors in their \nindustry, I have introduced the payroll tax deposit agent's bill.\n  My bill contains a number of provisions designed to guard small \nbusiness owners against fraud by increasing the IRS' oversight of the \npayroll service providers. The bill creates a separate section of the \nInternal Revenue Code that will govern the payroll industry, it defines \nthe responsibilities of payroll tax deposit agents, and requires all \nagents to register with the IRS or be penalized. The bill requires \npayroll agents to inform their clients of the clients' continued \nliability for all payroll taxes and the clients' need to periodically \nverify that their taxes are paid in full. The bill penalizes payroll \nproviders that collect but fail to make required payments by extending \nsection 6672 penalties to all payroll tax agents.\n  These provisions also provide some reasonable flexibility to small \npayroll service providers. It gives payroll providers a choice between \nobtaining a surety bond or submitting to a third party audit that \nverifies if a payroll company's books are solid and well managed.\n  Many small payroll service providers prefer audit option, which \nconfirms that the payroll agent is making their client's tax deposit \ncompletely and on time, over bonding--as surety bonds can be very \ndifficult for many small businesses to obtain. Additionally, small \npayroll agents argue that a third party audit actually provides their \nclients more protection against fraud than bonding because the audit \nverifies the payroll agent's sound financial practices while a surety \nbond only provides a limited reimbursement in cases of wrongdoing.\n  Many of these payroll tax agent provisions were already approved by \nthe Senate Finance Committee as part of the Good Government Act. The \nGood Government Act was approved by the Senate Finance Committee and \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent agreement in May of 2004. \nUnfortunately, the Good Governance Act never made it out of conference. \nNow, as I introduce this bill, I am hoping that we can help protect our \nsmall businesses by seeing that these necessary payroll protections \nbecome law.\n  I would like to encourage my colleagues to help protect our small \nbusinesses from devious payroll tax agents by increasing IRS oversight \nand protections as contained in this bill.\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7552-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7552-S7553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REGULATING PAYROLL TAX DEPOSIT AGENTS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, the Senate has passed an important \nbill, Chairman Grassley's Improving Outcomes for Children Affected by \n``Meth'' Act of 2006. This legislation will reauthorize the Safe and \nStable Families Program and target $40 million in new funding to \nprograms to help children affected by methamphetamine abuse and \naddiction.\n  West Virginia, like all too many States, is facing severe problems \nwith a methamphetamine epidemic. There is by all reports a rapid spread \nand growth of this pernicious addiction. SAMSHA reports that \nmethamphetamine abuse has increased more than 420 percent for persons \n12 years and older during the past decade. And according to a well-\ncited National Association of Counties survey, the epidemic is no \nlonger targeting rural States like my own. Much to my dismay we are \nfinding addicts in suburban high schools as well as urban areas. \nAddicts are white and blue collar workers and the unemployed who are in \ntheir twenties or thirties. Use is equally divided among males and \nfemales.\n  The legislation offered today is part of the reauthorization for the \nPromoting Safe and Stable Families Program. Our child welfare system \nrelies on the principles and services mandated by Safe and Stable \nFamilies Programs. I have wholeheartedly worked on this program since \nits inception in 1993. I have continued over the years to support \nmodifications that fit the changing needs of the children.\n  It is essential that our most vulnerable children remain safe and \nthat they find emergency placements and permanent homes. Programs such \nas Foster Care remain a foundational safeguard for children. Children \nfind refuge in foster homes when they are placed in harm's way due to \nneglect or abuse. Permanence of placement represents an enduring goal \nof Safe and Stable. This objective provides a child the hope of living \nconditions that support physical and psychological health. The Safe and \nStable Programs ultimately assist with decisions about family \nreunification and adoption.\n  Of course, there remains a lot more work to be done. Our foster care \nsystem is overburdened. There is all too often a lack of coordination \namong agencies and services that serve children and their families. And \ncurrently many programs are especially stressed by the expanding and \ninvasive problems brought on by the next generation of illicit drugs. \nRight now our children need more help.\n  The goals of Improving Outcomes for Children Affected by ``Meth'' Act \nare consistent with the spirit and design of the Promoting Safe and \nStable Families Programs. This act targets the growing problems caused \nby a cheaply made, easily available, lethal drug.\n  The facts are, to say the least, extremely disturbing. The National \nAssociation of Counties survey points to the rise of out-of-home \nplacements due to methamphetamine addiction by as much as 71 percent in \nCalifornia counties and 70 percent in responding Colorado counties. \nThis year in Montana, State officials reported at least 50 percent of \nchild abuse and neglect cases involved methamphetamine abuse. I know \nthat in southern West Virginia alone there have been over 100 \nlaboratory busts since October, 2005. And according to a survey by the \nRebecca Project, over 10,000 children in the U.S. were either present \nat a lab seizure or lived where the lab was seized between 2000 and \n2003. These labs produce 5 pounds of toxic waste as a result of \nproducing 1 pound of methamphetamine. There are too many children in \nharm's way.\n  This bill creates new competitive grants to support regional \npartnerships that provide services to children who are affected by \ntheir caretakers' methamphetamine abuses. The bill reserves $40 million \nto fund these grants.\n  I know that these grants are not a cure-all, but this legislation is \na firm step in the right direction in several ways. First, regional \ndemonstration projects can further identify intervention models that \nare showing some good results. We also are on the mark when we \nencourage community health care providers, law enforcement agencies, \njudges, and statewide child welfare agencies to form more coherent and \nefficient partnerships. These grants can target innovative prevention \nprograms that reach at-risk children before out-of-home placements are \nnecessary. Finally the grants are available for innovative family-based \nprograms, comprehensive long-term treatment services, and counseling \nfor the children. It is good that the Senate has passed this \nlegislation, and we need to work with the House to secure passage of a \nfinal bill that can be signed into law by the President this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7553-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PEER TO PEER: TEEN DATING VIOLENCE PREVENTION\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, a serious and, at times, deadly form of \nphysical and emotional interpersonal violence is alarmingly pervasive \nin our Nation today. It transcends race, socio-economic condition, and \ncommunity size. It is dating violence and it happens every day in teen \ndating relationships. Like domestic violence to which it is a \nprecursor, teen dating violence is something our society is finally \ntalking about openly. A major driver of this public conversation is \nvisual media, specifically, television.\n  I am proud to say that a high school in Eagle, ID on the leading edge \nof this awareness effort. Organizers of a teen dating violence \nawareness and prevention summit in Boise reached out to the Eagle High \nSchool media department asking for its participation in the summit. \nTaking up the challenge, media instructor Jim Seaney and his students \nproduced a series of public service announcements, PSA, dealing with \nthe crime of teen dating violence from the perspective of teens.\n  I featured one of the five segments on my monthly live townhall \nmeeting, Capitol Watch, and at a national press conference in February \nkicking off National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention \nWeek. Well-scripted, professionally produced, and riveting in their \ndirectness and simplicity, each PSA confronts the viewer with the \ntragedy of teen dating violence. The message is clear: teen dating \nviolence exists--and in relationships and places you would never \nsuspect.\n  Without any further acclaim, these productions stand as a tremendous \naccomplishment. But, I am pleased to say that they were recently \nselected as the winning entry to the 2005-2006 National Student \nTelevision Award for Excellence, Hubbard Family Public Affairs/\nCommunity Service/Public Service Category. I offer my heartfelt \ncongratulations to Jim Seaney and his students, Bethany Ross, Cody \nBolken, Robert O'Neal, Tommy Sauriol, Sabra Wiitanen, John Adkins, \nNatalie Volarich, Chase Gronowski, Vianey Conchas, Abby Sauriol, \nJeremiah Mitchell, and Jim's daughter Aubree who also acts in one of \nthe segments. I thank them for the time and effort they took to make \nthe crime of teen dating violence something that families, schools, \ncommunities and a nation, talk about. These conversations open the door \nto truth and healing now and healthy, respectful relationships for \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7553-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7553-S7554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       THE LIFE OF FRANK ZEIDLER\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join the city of Milwaukee and \nthe entire State of Wisconsin in mourning the loss of Mayor Frank \nZeidler. When he passed away on July 7, Wisconsin lost one of its most \nprincipled and progressive leaders.\n  Mayor Zeidler was born in 1912 in Milwaukee, WI, and lived there \nthroughout his life. He grew up in the Merrill Park neighborhood on the \ncity's west side and attended Marquette University and the University \nof Chicago. In addition to his long career in public service to the \ncity of Milwaukee, Zeidler read relentlessly, loved statistics, \ncollected fossils, and rewrote Shakespeare.\n  Mayor Zeidler served in public office for more than 20 years and is \nwidely known as Milwaukee's last socialist mayor. His career in public \nservice began in 1938 when he was first elected to public office as \ncounty surveyor, and he then went on to serve for 7 years on the \nMilwaukee School Board.\n  Then, in 1948, he was elected to serve as mayor of the city of \nMilwaukee, a position he would hold for over a decade. When he took \noffice, his goal was\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\nto act in ``the public welfare'' and he did so by presiding over \nMilwaukee during a period of growth and prosperity.\n  Under Mayor Zeidler's leadership, Milwaukee reached new heights, as \nhe improved city services and led Milwaukee in a time of strong \neconomic growth. During his 12 years in office, Mayor Zeidler presided \nover a period of great development and prosperity: Milwaukee factories \nwere booming, poverty and crime remained low, and the city's population \npeaked at over 740,000. He also revamped and expanded a wide array of \ncity services.\n  It has been said that Mayor Zeidler was the ``opposite of a \npolitician in it for the money.'' In 1953, when he earned $16,500 as \nthe mayor of Milwaukee, he gave $2,400 of it back to the city. By 1983, \nwhen he was 70 years old, it was reported that he received Social \nSecurity but did not take a pension. He also took the bus for most of \nhis life.\n  Zeidler was an expert on the history of Milwaukee and a man of \nunquestioned personal integrity. This is what made him one of \nMilwaukee's most respected political figures and local institutions. In \n1985, the Greater Milwaukee Conference on Religion and Urban Affairs \nbegan awarding a Frank Zeidler Award for contributions to social \nconcerns in the religious community. Then, in 1995, the Milwaukee \ngovernment office building immediately east of City Hall was named the \nFrank Zeidler Municipal Building.\n  Throughout his life, Mayor Zeidler remained an active and respected \nmember of the Milwaukee community. Wisconsin will always be grateful \nfor what he achieved, and for who he was--a man dedicated to principle, \nprogressive ideas, and public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7554-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7554-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7554-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 9.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to increase the \nmaximum amount for international trade loans, to direct the \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration to assign an \ninternational finance specialist, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the gulf coast has made good progress in \nrebuilding after last year's hurricanes. Our small businesses and \nentrepreneurs have led the way in this recovery. As all of my \ncolleagues know small businesses are the engines of our economy driving \ninnovation and growth.\n  Following Katrina and Rita, one problem for our business owners in \nthe gulf was that their customer bases were dispersed around the \ncountry by the storms and were slow to return. Without this revenue \nfrom their customers, many businesses struggled to make ends meet and \nrelied upon U.S. Small Business Administration, SBA, disaster loans, \ninsurance payouts, and in some cases, State-administered bridge loan \nfunding to keep going.\n  We also have businesses that export goods and services to foreign \ncountries. The 2,000 exporters in Louisiana, in addition to the other \nhelp available, were also able to rely on their international partners \nto stay in business. Their international customers showed great faith \nand commitment to our exporters by placing new orders after the storms.\n  I am introducing the Small Business International Trade Enhancements \nAct of 2006 to give all small businesses the opportunity to expand \ntheir operations into international markets. I am pleased to have \nSenator Kerry, the ranking member of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, as well as Senators Pryor and Bayh, as cosponsors.\n  As I mentioned we have 2,000 exporters in Louisiana. However, there \nare many other businesses who are exporters, but they do not even \nrealize it. They may have overseas Internet sales, or they focus \noperations on domestic sales, but have some international buyers as \nwell. In fact, the Small Business Administration has stated that over \n96 percent of all exporters of goods and services are small businesses.\n  Given the importance of these exporters to my State and to the rest \nof the gulf coast, I would like to improve their competitive edge in \nthe international market and give them every resource they need to \nsucceed. As they continue to recover, one of the main issues being \nfaced by our small business is accessing capital. Our exporters are no \ndifferent. They need help accessing export financing to cover export-\nrelated costs such as purchasing equipment, purchasing inventory, or \nfinancing production costs.\n  To help our small businesses access export financing, my legislation \nwill create a gulf coast international finance specialist within SBA \nlocated in New Orleans to focus on the needs of businesses affected by \nKatrina and Rita. New Orleans had a finance specialist from 1998 until \nmid-2003, when that individual retired from the agency. SBA left the \npost vacant due to lack of funding. I believe it is important to locate \nthis finance specialist in New Orleans because that is where the \nmajority of Louisiana's exporters and export financing institutions are \nlocated. In New Orleans, this finance specialist also is in a prime \nlocation, within easy travel distance to the gulf coast sections of \nMississippi and Alabama--where a majority of the exporters and export \nfinancing institutions in these States are located as well.\n  Fifteen SBA finance specialists operate out of 100 U.S. export \nassistance centers administered by the Department of Commerce around \nthe country. That is a record staffing low for this program, down from \na peak of 22 finance specialists in 2000. To ensure that all smaller \nexporters nationwide will continue to have access to export financing, \nthis bill establishes a floor of 16 international finance specialists. \nI believe this will send a signal to our exporters that, despite \ncurrent budget deficits, we are committed to our exporters and want to \nprovide them with the necessary resources to compete internationally.\n  Mr. President, I realize that the need for export financing is not \njust limited to the gulf coast. There are small businesses nationwide \nthat are looking to find markets overseas. One tool that they can use \nis the SBA's international trade loan, ITL, program. International \ntrade loans can help exporters develop and expand overseas markets; \nupgrade equipment or facilities; and assist exporters that are being \nhurt by import competition. Exporters can borrow up to $2 million, with \n$1,750,000 guaranteed by SBA.\n  However, as currently structured these loans are not user-friendly to \nlenders or borrowers and, as a result, are underutilized. Let me \nexplain what I mean. First, the $250,000 difference between the loan \ncap and the guarantee requires borrowers to take out a second SBA loan \nto take full advantage of the $2 million guarantee. ITLs can only be \nused to acquire fixed assets and not working capital, a common need for \nexporters. Furthermore, ITLs do not have the same collateral or \nrefinancing requirements as SBA 7(a) loans. Because of these issues, \nlenders do not use these loans.\n  My legislation will reduce the paperwork by increasing the maximum \nloan guarantee to $2,750,000 and the loan cap to $3,670,000 to bring it \nmore in line with the 7(a) program. This bill also creates a more \nflexible ITL by setting out that working capital is an eligible use for \nloan proceeds, in addition to making the ITL consistent with regular \n7(a) loans by allowing the same collateral and refinancing terms as \nwith 7(a).\n  The SBA international trade and export loans are valuable tools for \nexporters but they are useless if there is no one to assist borrowers \nwith identifying which loans are right for them. Local lending \ninstitutions that specialize in export financing can help but at a cost \nover less than $2 million per year, the current group of finance \nspecialists has obtained bank financing for more than $10 billion in \nU.S. exports since 1999. The $10 billion in export sales financed by \nthese specialists helped to create over 140,000 new, high-paying U.S. \njobs.\n  The Small Business International Trade Enhancements Act of 2006 is an\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\nimportant first step, not just for exporters in the gulf coast, but \nalso for small businesses nationwide who are looking to open markets \noverseas. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation since it \nwill help our exporters in the gulf coast recover and also give small \nbusinesses nationwide more options when they are seeking export \nfinancing.\n  I thank the Chair and ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill \nbe printed in the Record, along with the accompanying material.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3663\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To take advantage of increased demand for products \n     from the Gulf Coast, particularly Louisiana and Mississippi, \n     small businesses in the Gulf require access to export \n     financing through the Export-Import Bank, the U.S. Small \n     Business Administration (SBA), and in some cases, the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture.\n       The SBA employs International Finance Specialists which \n     work with borrowers and lenders to navigate the various \n     Federal government export financing programs.\n       Problem #1: Gulf Coast Export Financing Needs. Despite the \n     increased need for export financing in the Gulf Coast, there \n     is currently no International Finance Specialist located in \n     any of the hardest hit states of Mississippi, Alabama and \n     Louisiana. Instead there is one specialist in Texas with \n     responsibility for Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana \n     and one specialist in Georgia responsible for Georgia, \n     Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi. Due to the \n     extensive territories they cover and limited travel budgets \n     of the staff, these specialists must divide their time and \n     cannot focus on the needs of Gulf Coast small businesses.\n       It is essential to have a Finance Specialist located on the \n     Gulf Coast with a responsibility for the Gulf Coast.\n       Problem #2: Staff Reductions for SBA International Finance \n     Specialists. At a cost of less than $2 million per year, the \n     current group of Finance Specialists has obtained bank \n     financing for more than $10 billion in U.S. exports since \n     1999. The $10 billion in export sales financed by these \n     specialists helped to create over 140,000 new, high-paying \n     U.S. jobs. Despite these figures, this program is \n     experiencing record staffing lows.\n       In particular, there are over 100 U.S. Export Assistance \n     Centers nationwide, however as of July 10, 2006 there were \n     only 15 Finance Specialists nationwide. This figure is the \n     lowest staff levels ever for the program and is down from a \n     peak of 22 Finance Specialists in January 2000.\n       Problem #3: International Trade Loan Program. The SBA's \n     International Trade Loan (ITL) program is used by exporters \n     to expand or develop markets, upgrade equipment or facilities \n     to improve competitive position, or to assist exporters \n     currently hurt by import competition. As currently \n     structured, however, ITLs are not user friendly or relevant. \n     This is because, with a maximum guarantee amount of $1.75 \n     million and loan cap of $2 million, ITLs require the SBA to \n     make a second loan to the borrower to make use of the maximum \n     guarantee. These loans are also restricted for use for only \n     fixed assets and not working capital, which is a common need \n     for exporters.\n       The Landrieu Small Business International Trade \n     Enhancements Act of 2006 addresses these problems:\n       Gulf Coast International Finance Specialist: To help our \n     small businesses access export financing, this bill provides \n     for an International Finance Specialist in the New Orleans \n     who would be responsible for Louisiana, Mississippi, and \n     Alabama.\n       International Trade Loans: To make this loan program more \n     responsive, this bill increases the maximum loan guarantee \n     amount to $2.75 million and specifies that the loan cap for \n     ITLs is $3.67 million, as well as sets out that working \n     capital is an eligible use for loan proceeds.The bill also \n     makes ITLs consistent with regular SBA 7(a) loans in terms of \n     allowing the same collateral and refinancing terms as with \n     regular 7(a) loans.\n       Stop International Finance Specialist Downsizing: To ensure \n     that all smaller exporters nationwide will continue to have \n     access to export financing, this bill establishes a floor of \n     16 International Finance Specialists.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. \n        Pryor):\n  S. 3664. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to improve assistance \nafter a major disaster, to authorize emergency bridge loans, bridge \nloan guarantees, and recovery grants, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we all know, there was a tremendous \namount of criticism of the Federal Government's response to Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita last year. Things are better now and the region is \nslowly recovering. But we are in the second month of another hurricane \nseason and we must be sure that if we have another disaster, the \nFederal Government's response will be better this time around. Disaster \nresponse agencies have to be better organized, more efficient, and more \nresponsive in order to avoid the problems, the delays, mismanagement, \nand the seeming incompetence that occurred last year.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to improve the disaster response \nof one agency that had a great deal of problems last year, the Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA. While it did improve during the course of \nthe months after the storm, it became clear to me that SBA needs \nadditional tools for future disasters. SBA approached Katrina and the \nmassive floods after the storm, using the same tools that it uses for \nmuch smaller, much less damaging disasters. I do not blame all of the \npeople who work at this agency for the problems we saw in the gulf. \nThey found themselves in a system that was insufficient to address this \ndisaster.\n  My legislation, the Small Business Disaster Recovery Assistance \nImprovements Act of 2006, offers new tools to\n\n[[Page S7557]]\n\nenhance SBA's disaster assistance programs. In every disaster, the SBA \nDisaster Loan program is a lifeline for businesses and homeowners who \nwant to rebuild their lives after a catastrophe. When Katrina hit, our \nbusinesses and homeowners had to wait months for loan approvals. I do \nnot know how many businesses we lost because help did not come in time. \nBecause of the scale of this disaster, what these businesses needed was \nimmediate, short-term bridge loans to hold them over until SBA was \nready to process the tens of thousands of loan applications it \nreceived.\n  That is why this legislation provides the SBA Administrator with the \nability to make emergency bridge loans of up to $150,000 to affected \nsmall businesses in a declared disaster area. These bridge loans will \nallow businesses to make payroll, begin making repairs, and address \nother immediate needs while they are awaiting insurance payouts or \nregular SBA disaster loans. However, I realize that every disaster is \ndifferent and could range from a disaster on the scale of Hurricane \nKatrina or 9/11, to an ice storm or drought. My legislation gives the \nSBA additional options and flexibility in the kinds of relief they can \noffer a community. When a tornado destroys 20 businesses in a small \ntown in the Midwest, SBA can get the regular disaster program up and \nrunning fairly quickly. You may not need bridge loans in this instance. \nBut if you know that SBA's resources would be overwhelmed by a storm--\njust as they were initially with Katrina--bridge loans would be very \nhelpful.\n  My legislation also would expedite disaster loans for those \nbusinesses in a disaster area that have a good, solid track record with \nthe SBA or can provide vital recovery efforts. We had many businesses \nin the gulf coast that had paid off previous SBA loans, were major \nsources of employment in their communities, but had to wait months \nfor decisions on their disaster loan applications. I do not want to get \nrid of the SBA's current practice of reviewing applications on a first-\ncome-first-served basis, but there should be some mechanism in place \nfor major disasters to get expedited loans out the door to specific \nbusinesses that has a positive record with SBA or those that could \nserve a vital role in the recovery efforts. Expedited loans would jump-\nstart impacted economies, get vital capital out to businesses, and \nretain essential jobs following future disasters.\n\n  We had a lot of small business owners in the gulf coast who did not \nqualify for SBA disaster loans, or may not have had enough insurance to \ncover their losses. These people usually have to expend their personal \nfinances or seek out small grants from non-profits to keep going. My \nlegislation authorizes a small business disaster grant program to \nprovide small grants of up to $25,000 to businesses that are not able \nto get access to get other assistance. These grants will only go to \nbusiness owners that certify their intent to reopen in the disaster \narea and pursue technical assistance to continue their operations.\n  Following Katrina, it is clear that disaster loan amounts need to be \nupdated to reflect current business needs and the average cost of \nhousing today. The bill raises the cap on SBA disaster loans for \nbusinesses from $1.5 million to $2.25 million; the cap on SBA personal \nproperty loans from $40,000 to $50,000; and the cap on real property \nhomeowner loans from $200,000 to $250,000.\n  This bill also makes an important modification to the collateral \nrequirements for disaster loans. The SBA cannot disburse more than \n$10,000 for an approved loan without showing collateral. This is to \nlimit the loss to the SBA in the event that a loan defaults. However, \nthis disbursement amount has not been increased since 1998 and these \ndays, $10,000 is not enough to get a business up and running.\n  I was surprised to learn that the SBA did not have a full-time \ndisaster planner on board before Katrina, nor did it have a \ncomprehensive disaster response plan in place. While SBA is not a \nfirst-responder disaster agency like FEMA, they do hit the ground \nwithin days of a disaster strike. As the only Federal nonagricultural \ndisaster lender, SBA should have an analytical, proactive plan in place \nto respond to disasters.\n  I pushed to get language in the recent hurricane supplemental \nappropriations bill to require SBA to develop a disaster plan and \nreport to Congress on its contents by July 15, 2006. I look forward to \nthis report. But writing a plan and making it work are two different \nthings. SBA needs a full-time staff in place to ensure that this plan \nis implemented properly. My legislation directs the SBA to hire a full-\ntime disaster planner to maintain this disaster response plan and to \nassist the SBA with its overall disaster preparedness, including \ncoordination with other disaster response agencies like FEMA.\n  As we reflect next month on the 1-year anniversary of the worst \nnatural disaster to hit our nation, now is the time for action--not \nwords or empty promises. I want to be able to go back to my \nconstituents and reassure them that if, God forbid, another natural \ndisaster should hit my state or another part of the country, that the \nSmall Business Administration is better prepared and more responsive to \nthe needs of those impacted.\n  The Small Business Disaster Recovery Assistance Improvements Act will \nprovide essential tools to make the SBA more proactive, flexible, and \nmost important, more efficient during future disasters. In the coming \nweeks, I look forward to working with both Chairwoman Snowe and Ranking \nMember Kerry on the Senate Small Business Committee to ensure that the \nSBA has everything it needs to meet these goals.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined on this legislation by the \nranking member of the Small Business Committee, Senator Kerry, as well \nas my colleagues from the Small Business Committee, Senators Pryor and \nBayh. We urge our other colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  I thank the Chair and ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill \nbe printed in the Record, along with the accompanying materials.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3664\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

WAIVER OF GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS ON SBDC \n                   COUNSELORS.\n\n       Section 21(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648(b)) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Waiver of Geographic Restrictions on SBDC \n     Counselors.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Administrator shall authorize any \n     small business development center, regardless of location, to \n     provide advice, information, and assistance, as described in \n     subsection (c), to a small business concern located in an \n     area in which the President declared a major disaster (as \n     defined in section 102 of the Robert T.

The bridge loans and grants would allow businesses to \n     make payroll, begin making repairs, and address other \n     immediate needs while they are awaiting insurance payouts or \n     SBA disaster loans. As part of receiving these bridge loans \n     or grants, affected businesses would be required to seek \n     technical assistance.\n       State Bridge Loan Guarantee: This bill requires that the \n     SBA Administrator issue guidelines on an SBA-approved State \n     bridge loan program for future disasters. Once the guidelines \n     are issued, states may then submit their bridge loan programs \n     for approval to receive SBA guarantee assistance on bridge \n     loans in the event of a disaster. The program rewards states \n     that are prepared well-before future disasters strike and \n     could be in place before the end of the current Hurricane \n     season.\n       Expedited 7(a) Disaster Loans: Many affected businesses in \n     the Gulf Coast had repaid previous SBA loans yet despite \n     being in good standing with the SBA, were required to wait \n     months for disaster loan decisions. Other affected businesses \n     were major sources of employment in their areas or could \n     provide substantive assistance to recovery efforts but were \n     also made to wait months for SBA loans. This bill provides \n     expedited SBA disaster loans to businesses that are in good \n     standing with the SBA or those who can provide unique \n     assistance to recovery efforts. These expedited loans would \n     jump-start impacted economies, get vital capital to \n     businesses, and retain essential jobs following future \n     disasters.\n       Increased Caps on Disaster Loans: The bill would raise the \n     cap on business Disaster Loans from $1.5 million to $2.25 \n     million. It would also raise the cap on Personal Property \n     homeowner disaster loans from $40,000 to $50,000 and the cap \n     on Real Property homeowner disaster loans from $200,000 to \n     $250,000.\n       Lender Assistance for Loss Verification/Loan Processing: \n     The bill gives the Administrator permanent authority to enter \n     into agreements with local banks and other lenders to help \n     address the SBA loss verification and loan processing backlog \n     for future disasters.\n       Increased Collateral Requirements: Currently, the SBA \n     cannot disburse more than $10,000 on an approved loan before \n     requiring additional collateral. This is to limit the loss to \n     the SBA in the event that a loan defaults, but is an added \n     protection for the SBA because before loans are approved; the \n     SBA reviews the borrower's ability to repay the loan in \n     question. To help loan disbursement for future disasters, the \n     bill would increase this collateral requirement to $20,000 to \n     borrowers who have been approved for SBA disaster loans.\n       Increased Disaster Loan Caps for Catastrophic Regional or \n     National Disaster: The bill provides that, for a disaster \n     designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security as a \n     catastrophic regional or national disaster, that SBA \n     Administrator may increase the maximum Disaster Loan amount \n     to $10 million.\n       Additional Authority for SBA District Offices: Following \n     Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the SBA struggled to handle \n     increased loan volume created by the disasters. Months after \n     Katrina first hit, the SBA authorized District Offices to \n     process disaster loans, which greatly reduced the existing \n     loan backlog in the span of a month. For major future \n     disasters, the bill authorizes the Administrator to allow \n     District Offices to process all business disaster loans.\n       Small Business Development Center Assistance: The bill \n     addresses many problems experienced by Gulf Coast Small \n     Business Development Centers (SBDCs) following Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita. First, these SBDCs had to apply for \n     multiple portability grants and then had to wait months for \n     this funding. This bill allows the Administrator to waive the \n     $100,000 cap on SBDC portability grants following a disaster \n     which would allow SBA to quickly provide more funds to SBDCs, \n     rather than requiring them to apply for multiple portability \n     grants. The bill also allows other SBDCs to provide \n     assistance in declared disaster areas by allowing them to \n     travel beyond their traditional geographic boundaries. \n     Lastly, since many Gulf Coast SBDCs had trouble accessing \n     Federal Disaster Recovery Centers to provide business \n     counseling, which caused extended delays in business \n     counseling services, the bill directs the SBA Administrator \n     to permit SBDC staff into these recovery centers for future \n     disasters.\n       Improved SBA Accountability: The bill directs the SBA, for \n     future major disasters, to provide a monthly report to \n     Congress on the disaster loan program (loan volume, loan \n     averages, funding available, etc.) to prevent the SBA \n     Disaster Loan program from running out of money.\n       Loans to Non-Profits: Allows SBA to make loans to non-\n     profits that are located or operating in a disaster area.\n       Full-Time Disaster Planning Staff: The SBA had neither a \n     comprehensive disaster response plan nor full-time planning \n     staff in place for Hurricane Katrina. As a result, the SBA's \n     disaster response was plagued by mismanagement, delays, and a \n     lack of flexibility which left borrowers waiting between two \n     to four months for initial loss inspections and four to eight \n     months for decisions on their loan applications. As part of \n     the recent Hurricane Supplemental Appropriations bill, SBA \n     was tasked with drafting up a comprehensive disaster response \n     plan but they still do not have a full-time planner on board \n     to ensure that this plan is implemented or that it is updated \n     following future disasters. This bill directs the SBA to hire \n     a full-time disaster planner to maintain this disaster \n     response plan and to assist with SBA disaster preparedness \n     for future disasters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 3666. A bill to amend the Florida National Forest Land Management \nAct of 2003 to authorize the conveyance of an additional tract of \nNational Forest System land under that Act, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that helps the U.S. Forest Service protect sensitive and \nprecious forest by selling developed land in Leon County, FL, in order \nto purchase at-risk land in the heart of our national forests.\n  Specifically, this bill allows for the sale of tract W-1979, which is \n114 acres in Tallahassee, the proceeds of which are specifically \ndesignated to purchase private inholdings in the Apalachicola National \nForest. The Forest Service believes that W-1979 has lost its national \nforest character and is unmanageable. The land will be sold to Leon \nCounty, where it will help the continued advancement of Blueprint 2000, \na series of community initiatives to improve Tallahassee and Leon \nCounty. By selling this land on the outskirts of the Apalachicola \nNational Forest, the U.S. Forest Service can acquire precious land deep \nin the forest that could be lost to development.\n  This legislation also gives the U.S. Forest Service in Florida the \nsame flexibility to manage lands and capital that it has in many other \nstates. Previously, whenever National Forest land was sold, the funds \ncould only be used to purchase more land, while many important \ninfrastructure projects went undone. With passage of this bill, \nproceeds only from the sale of ``non-green'' lands can go towards \ncapital improvements, such as administrative facilities that help the \nForest Service manage the Ocala, Apalachicola and Osceola National \nForests. These non-green lands have already been developed with urban \nimprovements, and no longer align with the goals of the U.S. Forest \nService.\n  Congressmen Crenshaw and Boyd have introduced similar legislation in \nthe House of Representatives. I hope that we can quickly pass these \nbills and help Leon County and the Forest Service.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S7561]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote nuclear nonproliferation in North Korea; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, last week, on the fourth of July, a day \nwhen Americans across the Nation were outside barbecuing, watching \nfireworks, and celebrating the 230th anniversary of our independence, \nNorth Korea launched seven long- and medium-range missiles into the Sea \nof Japan.\n  One of the missiles, the Taepodong-2, has a potential range of \napproximately 9,000 miles--placing the United States well within reach \nof attack by North Korea.\n  Kim Jong II's regime took this dangerous and provocative action \ndespite repeated warnings not to do so from the United States, its \nclose neighbors and participants in the six-party talks, and many \nothers in the international community.\n  Last week's missile launches reminded us yet again of the threat \nposed by Kim Jong II's regime.\n  North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and its possession of long-\nrange missiles that could potentially strike our Nation is a grave \nthreat to the security of the American people--and to peace and \nstability in East Asia.\n  Since November 2005, North Korea has boycotted the six-party talks \naimed at ending the regime's illicit nuclear weapons program. The \ncombination of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles capable of \nthreatening the American people is a threat that the United States \nshould not tolerate.\n  For these reasons, I rise this morning to introduce the North Korea \nNonproliferation Act of 2006. This legislation will add North Korea to \nthe list of countries currently covered by the Iran and Syria \nNonproliferation Act.\n  Under this bill, the President would be required to submit a report \nto Congress every 6 months listing all foreign persons believed to have \ntransferred to or acquired from North Korea materials that could \ncontribute to the production of missiles, nuclear weapons, and other \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  This legislation also authorizes the President to impose sanctions on \nall foreign persons identified on this list.\n  These sanctions include prohibitions on U.S. Government procurement \nfrom such persons and on the issuance of U.S. Government export \nlicenses for exports to such persons.\n  Ultimately, the bill will lead to U.S. sanctions on foreign persons \nand foreign companies that transfer missile- and WMD-related items to \nNorth Korea, or that buy such items from North Korea.\n  The U.S. is already doing this with respect to transfers of these \nitems to and from Iran and Syria under the Iran and Syria \nNonproliferation Act. The time has come for us to treat transfers of \nthese items to North Korea no less seriously than we already treat \ntransfers of these same items to Iran and Syria.\n  We currently are working with our allies and partners at the U.N. \nSecurity Council to send a strong and unified message to the North \nKoreans that their latest provocations are unacceptable.\n  Japan has introduced a resolution that would prohibit the very same \ntransfers to North Korea that this bill would sanction.\n  However, some at the UN, particularly China, are opposing the \nJapanese resolution. In fact, China and Russia have introduced a \ncompeting resolution that does not prohibit the transfer to North Korea \nof sensitive items that could contribute to that country's weapons \nprograms--which is the critical element of the resolution that has been \noffered by Japan and supported by the U.S., the U.K., France, and \nothers.\n  This bill will reinforce the crucial elements of Japan's Security \nCouncil resolution if that resolution is adopted. It will also serve as \nan alternative to that resolution in the event that China vetoes or \notherwise sidetracks it.\n  The United States cannot allow Kim Jong II and the North Korean \nregime to obtain additional materials for its WMD and missile programs.\n  If the U.N. Security Council fails to act, the United States must \nfulfill its responsibility to protect the American homeland from the \nNorth Korean threat.\n  These items in the hands of Kim Jong II pose a direct threat to the \nAmerican people, the people of the region, and peace and security in \nEast Asia.\n  If we are in earnest about protecting the American homeland, then it \nis imperative that we prevent the North Korean regime from acquiring \nthese dangerous materials. I thank Chairman Lugar, as well as Senators \nInouye and Brownback, for cosponsoring this bill, and I urge the rest \nof my Senate colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3667\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``North Korea Nonproliferation \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       In view of North Korea's manifest determination to \n     proliferate missiles, nuclear weapons, and other weapons of \n     mass destruction in violation of international norms and \n     expectations, it should be the policy of the United States to \n     impose sanctions on persons who transfer such weapons, and \n     goods and technology related to such weapons, to and from \n     North Korea in the same manner as persons who transfer such \n     items to and from Iran and Syria currently are sanctioned \n     under United States law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.\n\n       Congress urges all governments concerned about the threat \n     of proliferation involving North Korea to impose measures on \n     persons involved in such proliferation that are similar to \n     those imposed by the United States Government pursuant to the \n     Iran, North\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\n     Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, as amended by this \n     Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7562-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 530--CALLING ON PRESIDENT GEORGE W.

Res. 530\n\n       Whereas the leaders of 6 major industrialized democracies \n     including France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United \n     Kingdom, and the United States, gathered in 1975 for a summit \n     meeting in Rambouillet, France and for annual meetings \n     thereafter under a rotating presidency known as the Group of \n     Six (G-6);\n       Whereas the G-6 was established based on the mutual \n     interest of its members in promoting economic stability, \n     global security, and democracy;\n       Whereas, in 1976, membership of the G-6 was expanded to \n     include Canada;\n       Whereas the members of the G-7 share a commitment to \n     promote security, economic stability, and democracy in their \n     respective nations and around the world;\n       Whereas Russia was integrated into the Group in 1998 at the \n     behest of President William Jefferson Clinton as a gesture of \n     appreciation to then-President of Russia Boris Yeltsin for \n     pursuing reforms and assuming a neutral position with respect \n     to the eastward expansion of North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas, in 2002, Russia was selected to hold the rotating \n     presidency of the G-8 and to host the Summit of the G-8 in \n     2006;\n       Whereas the official G-8 statement issued on June 26, 2002, \n     in Kananaskis, Canada regarding the selection of Russia as \n     host of the 2006 Summit stated that the decision reflected \n     ``the remarkable economic and democratic transformation that \n     has occurred in Russia in recent years and in particular \n     under the leadership of President Putin'';\n       Whereas in the intervening 4 years since Russia was \n     selected to host the 2006 G-8 Summit, the Government of the \n     Russian Federation has pursued policies that raise serious \n     concerns about the commitment of the Government of the \n     Russian Federation to upholding democratic values both at \n     home and abroad;\n       Whereas the United States Department of State 2005 Country \n     Report on Human Rights Practices noted that trends in Russia, \n     including the ``centralization of power in the executive \n     branch . . . continuing corruption and selectivity in \n     enforcement of the law, political pressure on the judiciary, \n     and harassment of some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) \n     [have] resulted in an erosion of the accountability of \n     government leaders to the people'' in Russia;\n       Whereas, in 2005, the independent non-governmental \n     organization Freedom House reclassified Russia from ``partly \n     free'' to ``not free'' in its global survey of political \n     rights and civil liberties;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has placed \n     onerous restrictions and monitoring requirements on non-\n     profit organizations operating in Russia that limit the \n     ability of both Russians and non-Russians to create a vibrant \n     civil society in the country;\n       Whereas the freedom of the media in Russia has been \n     seriously compromised due to the Government of the Russian \n     Federation's continuing control and censorship of major mass \n     media outlets and efforts to obstruct the reporting of \n     independent journalists;\n       Whereas regulators from the Ministry of Culture of the \n     Government of the Russian Federation have reportedly \n     threatened radio stations with revocation of their broadcast \n     licenses if they continue airing material from the Voice of \n     America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), \n     thereby precipitating the largest decrease in the number of \n     outlets for VOA and RFE/RL reporting since the end of the \n     Cold War;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has sought \n     to interfere in the electoral processes and democratic \n     governance of neighboring countries including Georgia and \n     Ukraine;\n       Whereas Russia was the only member of the G-8 to applaud \n     the outcome of fraudulent presidential elections in Belarus \n     that were characterized by the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe as evidencing ``a disregard for the \n     basic rights of freedom of assembly, association, and \n     expression'';\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom and other monitoring organizations have \n     reported increased evidence of racism, anti-Semitism, \n     nationalism, and xenophobia among segments of Russian \n     society;\n       Whereas, in late 2005, Gazprom, a company majority owned \n     and operated by the Government of the Russian Federation, \n     insisted on a more than four-fold increase in the price \n     charged for natural gas sold to Ukraine and subsequently shut \n     off gas supplies to Ukraine, causing cascading energy \n     shortages in many countries throughout Europe;\n       Whereas there have been interruptions in the supply by \n     Russia of energy to Georgia and Moldova;\n       Whereas the March 2006 report of the Independent Task Force \n     on Russia of the Council on Foreign Relations stated that \n     ``to protect the credibility of the G-8 at a time when many \n     are questioning Russia's chairmanship, the United States \n     should make clear that this role does not exempt Russian \n     policies and actions from critical scrutiny'';\n       Whereas the United States recognizes and applauds the proud \n     history of achievement, creativity, and sacrifice of the \n     people of Russia;\n       Whereas the United States seeks the development of Russia \n     as a strong, responsible, democratic partner in promoting \n     global peace and security; and\n       Whereas the United States believes that both the people of \n     Russia and the Government of the Russian Federation will be \n     shackled in their efforts to build a strong society \n     domestically and contribute to the work of the international \n     community so long as the Government of the Russian Federation \n     fails to fully embrace the values of democracy: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) in order to preserve the integrity of the G-8 as a \n     forum of the leading industrialized democracies of the world, \n     President George W.

Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 530) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 530\n\n       Whereas the leaders of 6 major industrialized democracies \n     including France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United \n     Kingdom, and the United States, gathered in 1975 for a summit \n     meeting in Rambouillet, France and for annual meetings \n     thereafter under a rotating presidency known as the Group of \n     Six (G-6);\n       Whereas the G-6 was established based on the mutual \n     interest of its members in promoting economic stability, \n     global security, and democracy;\n       Whereas, in 1976, membership of the G-6 was expanded to \n     include Canada;\n       Whereas the members of the G-7 share a commitment to \n     promote security, economic stability, and democracy in their \n     respective nations and around the world;\n       Whereas Russia was integrated into the Group in 1998 at the \n     behest of President William Jefferson Clinton as a gesture of \n     appreciation to then-President of Russia Boris Yeltsin for \n     pursuing reforms and assuming a neutral position with respect \n     to the eastward expansion of North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas, in 2002, Russia was selected to hold the rotating \n     presidency of the G-8 and to host the Summit of the G-8 in \n     2006;\n       Whereas the official G-8 statement issued on June 26, 2002, \n     in Kananaskis, Canada regarding the selection of Russia as \n     host of the 2006 Summit stated that the decision reflected \n     ``the remarkable economic and democratic transformation that \n     has occurred in Russia in recent years and in particular \n     under the leadership of President Putin'';\n       Whereas in the intervening 4 years since Russia was \n     selected to host the 2006 G-8 Summit, the Government of the \n     Russian Federation has pursued policies that raise serious \n     concerns about the commitment of the Government of the \n     Russian Federation to upholding democratic values both at \n     home and abroad;\n       Whereas the United States Department of State 2005 Country \n     Report on Human Rights Practices noted that trends in Russia, \n     including the ``centralization of power in the executive \n     branch . . . continuing corruption and selectivity in \n     enforcement of the law, political pressure on the judiciary, \n     and harassment of some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) \n     [have] resulted in an erosion of the accountability of \n     government leaders to the people'' in Russia;\n       Whereas, in 2005, the independent non-governmental \n     organization Freedom House reclassified Russia from ``partly \n     free'' to ``not free'' in its global survey of political \n     rights and civil liberties;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has placed \n     onerous restrictions and monitoring requirements on non-\n     profit organizations operating in Russia that limit the \n     ability of both Russians and non-Russians to create a vibrant \n     civil society in the country;\n       Whereas the freedom of the media in Russia has been \n     seriously compromised due to the Government of the Russian \n     Federation's continuing control and censorship of major mass \n     media outlets and efforts to obstruct the reporting of \n     independent journalists;\n       Whereas regulators from the Ministry of Culture of the \n     Government of the Russian Federation have reportedly \n     threatened radio stations with revocation of their broadcast \n     licenses if they continue airing material from the Voice of \n     America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), \n     thereby precipitating the largest decrease in the number of \n     outlets for VOA and RFE/RL reporting since the end of the \n     Cold War;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has sought \n     to interfere in the electoral processes and democratic \n     governance of neighboring countries including Georgia and \n     Ukraine;\n       Whereas Russia was the only member of the G-8 to applaud \n     the outcome of fraudulent presidential elections in Belarus \n     that were characterized by the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe as evidencing ``a disregard for the \n     basic rights of freedom of assembly, association, and \n     expression'';\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom and other monitoring organizations have \n     reported increased evidence of racism, anti-Semitism, \n     nationalism, and xenophobia among segments of Russian \n     society;\n       Whereas, in late 2005, Gazprom, a company majority owned \n     and operated by the Government of the Russian Federation, \n     insisted on a more than four-fold increase in the price \n     charged for natural gas sold to Ukraine and subsequently shut \n     off gas supplies to Ukraine, causing cascading energy \n     shortages in many countries throughout Europe;\n       Whereas there have been interruptions in the supply by \n     Russia of energy to Georgia and Moldova;\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\n       Whereas the March 2006 report from of the Independent Task \n     Force on Russia of the Council on Foreign Relations stated \n     that ``to protect the credibility of the G-8 at a time when \n     many are questioning Russia's chairmanship, the United States \n     should make clear that this role does not exempt Russian \n     policies and actions from critical scrutiny'';\n       Whereas the United States recognizes and applauds the proud \n     history of achievement, creativity, and sacrifice of the \n     people of Russia;\n       Whereas the United States seeks the development of Russia \n     as a strong, responsible, democratic partner in promoting \n     global peace and security; and\n       Whereas the United States believes that both the people of \n     Russia and the Government of the Russian Federation will be \n     shackled in their efforts to build a strong society \n     domestically and contribute to the work of the international \n     community so long as the Government of the Russian Federation \n     fails to fully embrace the values of democracy: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n         (1) in order to preserve the integrity of the G-8 as a \n     forum of the leading industrialized democracies of the world, \n     President George W. Bush and other heads of state attending \n     the G-8 Summit should explicitly, frankly, and honestly \n     engage Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin in a \n     dialogue about the anti-democratic behavior of the Government \n     of the Russian Federation;\n         (2) the United States and other democratic countries \n     should reaffirm their support for civic and non-governmental \n     organizations working to promote democracy and the rule of \n     law in Russia;\n         (3) the Government of the Russian Federation should take \n     action to ensure that it guarantees the full range of civil \n     and political rights to its citizens, as it is obligated to \n     do under the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights;\n         (4) consistent with its obligations under the \n     International Covenant, the Government of the Russian \n     Federation should take steps to cease its interference with \n     foreign news organizations, including the Voice of America \n     and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty;\n         (5) the Government of the Russian Federation should take \n     action to combat rising racism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia \n     in Russian society; and\n         (6) the United States and countries of the G-8 should \n     reaffirm their support for new democracies on the borders of \n     Russia and, where applicable, expedite their integration into \n     Euro-Atlantic institutions to provide a bulwark for democracy \n     in eastern Europe and the Caucuses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7564-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 500\n\n       Whereas the Russian Federation is a participating State of \n     the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     (OSCE) and has freely committed to fully respect the rights \n     of individuals, whether alone or in community with others, to \n     profess and practice religion or belief;\n       Whereas the 1989 Vienna Concluding Document calls on OSCE \n     participating States to ``take effective measures to prevent \n     and eliminate discrimination against individuals or \n     communities on the grounds of religion or belief'' and to \n     ``grant upon their request to communities of believers, \n     practicing or prepared to practice their faith within the \n     constitutional framework of their States, recognition of the \n     status provided for them in the respective countries'';\n       Whereas Article 28 of the Constitution of the Russian \n     Federation declares that ``everyone shall be guaranteed the \n     right to freedom of conscience, to freedom of religious \n     worship, including the right to profess, individually or \n     jointly with others, any religion'' and Article 8 of the 1997 \n     Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations \n     provides for registration for religious communities as \n     ``religious organizations,'' if they have at least 10 members \n     and have operated within the Russian Federation with legal \n     status for at least 15 years;\n       Whereas religious freedom has advanced significantly for \n     the vast majority of people in Russia since the collapse of \n     the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas many rights and privileges afforded to religious \n     communities in the Russian Federation remain contingent on \n     the ability of the communities to obtain government \n     registration;\n       Whereas some religious groups have not attempted to \n     register with government authorities due to theological \n     considerations, and other communities have been unjustly \n     denied registration or had their registration improperly \n     terminated by local authorities;\n       Whereas many of the unregistered communities in the Russian \n     Federation today were never registered under the Soviet \n     system because they refused to collaborate with that \n     government's anti-religious policies and they are now \n     experiencing renewed discrimination and repression by \n     authorities of the Russian Federation;\n       Whereas over the past 2 years there have been an estimated \n     10 arson attacks on unregistered Protestant churches, with \n     little or no effective response by law enforcement officials \n     to bring the perpetrators to justice;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation reacted \n     swiftly in response to the January 2006 attack on a Moscow \n     synagogue, but there have been numerous other anti-Semitic \n     attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions in the Russian \n     Federation, and there is increasing tolerance of anti-\n     Semitism in certain segments of society in that country;\n       Whereas there has been evidence of an increase in the \n     frequency and severity of oppressive actions by security \n     forces and federal and local officials against some Muslim \n     communities and their members;\n       Whereas there are many cases involving restitution for \n     religious property seized by the Soviet regime that remain \n     unresolved;\n       Whereas in some areas of the Russian Federation law \n     enforcement personnel have carried out acts of harassment and \n     oppression against members of religious communities \n     peacefully practicing their faith and local officials have \n     put overly burdensome restrictions on the ability of some \n     religious communities to engage in religious activity; and\n       Whereas the United States has sought to protect the \n     fundamental and inalienable right of individuals to profess \n     and practice their faith, alone or in community with others, \n     according to the dictates of their conscience, and in \n     accordance with international agreements committing nations \n     to respect individual freedom of thought, conscience, and \n     belief: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of Congress that the United \n     States Government should--\n       (1) urge the Government of the Russian Federation to ensure \n     full protection of freedoms for all religious communities \n     without distinction, whether registered or unregistered, and \n     end the harassment of unregistered religious groups by the \n     security apparatus and other government agencies, thereby \n     building upon the progress made over the past 15 years in \n     promoting religious freedom in the Russian Federation;\n       (2) urge the Government of the Russian Federation to ensure \n     that law enforcement officials vigorously investigate and \n     prosecute acts of violence, arson, and desecration \n     perpetrated against registered and unregistered religious \n     communities, as well as make certain that government \n     authorities are not complicit in such incidents;\n       (3) continue to raise concerns with the Government of the \n     Russian Federation over violations of religious freedom, \n     including those against unregistered religious communities, \n     especially indigenous denominations not well known in the \n     United States;\n       (4) ensure that United States Embassy officials engage \n     local officials throughout the Russian Federation, especially \n     when violations of freedom of religion occur, and undertake \n     outreach activities to educate local officials about the \n     rights of unregistered religious communities;\n       (5) urge the Government of the Russian Federation to invite \n     the three Personal Representatives of the OSCE Chair-in-\n     Office and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom \n     of Religion or Belief to visit the Russian Federation and \n     discuss with federal and local officials concerns about the \n     religious freedom of both registered and unregistered \n     religious communities;

Mr. President, we made real progress this week in passing \na very important bill, the Homeland Security appropriations bill, under \nthe leadership of Chairman Judd Gregg, who did a superb job on a very \nimportant bill which adds billions of dollars to issues we spend a lot \nof time talking about and debating but that puts real money, real \nresources where they are needed: over $14 billion for issues \nsurrounding tightening our borders, increasing the number of border \nsecurity agents by 1,000, increasing the number of detention beds by \nover 1,000, and well over $14 billion for border security and \nimmigration issues. It is a very important bill.\n\n  Over the course of this month I also intend to address other issues \nsurrounding securing our homeland, issues such as the Department of \nDefense authorization and our military construction bills, all of which \nfocus on getting money down to where it is needed, protecting our \nhomeland, supporting our troops here and overseas.\n  Also, it was an interesting week in that we had very positive \neconomic developments announced with not just the 5.4 million jobs that \nhave been created over the last 30 months or so, not just the low \nunemployment--4.6 percent, which is lower than the average of the \n1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s, but the fact that the deficit is coming \ndown much faster than anyone had anticipated. That is in large part--in \nmost part--because of the progrowth President-Bush-led policies of less \ntaxation which promotes that strong economic growth. Revenues are \ncoming into the Federal Government with lower tax rates, and the \nrevenues are coming in much faster than anticipated because of those \npolicies. And those increased revenues coming in, by definition, lower \nthat deficit. The deficit is projected this year to be 30 percent lower \nthan what we thought it was going to be just in February, earlier this \nyear.\n  The important thing to recognize, as we have this great, what we call \n``macro'' or large global prosperity, in the sense of our global or \nAmerican economy here, with 5.6 percent growth in GDP last quarter, the \nfastest it has been in years and years--at the same time we have the \nsqueeze that is on our average person, average taxpayer out there \ntoday. That is due in part to the high gasoline prices that we are \ngoing to see go up again--in part because of the international turmoil \nin the Middle East, the fact we are 60 percent dependent on the Middle \nEast. Our response on this floor should be and will be to address \nissues surrounding lowering that dependence on foreign sources of oil. \nI hope we can do that in the next several weeks.\n  We had a very positive bipartisan announcement about opening \nexploration in the Gulf of Mexico. It is bipartisan, so I am very \nhopeful about that.\n  Health care is another one of those issues that squeezes people so \nmuch because health care prices continue to go up two to three times \nfaster than wages. When that is the case, you get squeezed as an \nindividual. So in spite of the great macro numbers around the United \nStates of America, the individual feels squeezed with gasoline prices \nand health care. So small business health plans are something we should \ncome back to, something we need to come back to and address. Most \npeople today work for what we call small businesses. These small \nbusiness health reform plans allow small businesses and the individuals \nto have lower health care costs. They slow that growth of health care \ncosts over time and hit at one of the major reasons they feel the \npinch.\n  I mentioned energy. A lot of that focuses on the area called 181, in \nthe Gulf of Mexico. And I mentioned health care costs with the focus on \nthe small business health plans. We have the support of 56 Senators on \nthe floor, and I need 60 Senators to actually pass that bill. So I hope \na few more of our Senators will recognize, from a small business \nperspective, from the perspective of the individual employee, how \nimportant it is to allow small businesses to group together, to have \nthe purchasing power to get those lower costs, to get those lower \ncharges just like the big companies can get--the clout, the muscle you \ncan get by grouping small business together.\n  It is common sense. The American people scratch their heads and say: \nWhy can't you pass it? We have majority support.\n  We don't have 60 people yet supporting it. We need to work on that, \nand I think we have to do it sometime this year.\n  Let me just comment and then I am going to take a short break and I \nwill come back to the floor to make a final comment on stem cells. On \nMonday we will begin the debate on the three bills--one, a fetal \nfarming bill, a second bill that looks at alternative ways of \ndeveloping pluripotent cells or embryo-like cells--very exciting \nresearch--and a third, the House bill which increases Federal support \nfor embryonic stem cells that are derived from embryos that are \notherwise going to be discarded. Those are the exact words in that \nbill.\n  We will have very good debate. It will be on Monday and Tuesday of \nnext week. We will have those votes starting at 3:45 on Tuesday. Each \nof those votes will have 60 votes for passage. People ask why. We all \nagree to that because we can spend weeks and weeks on the floor of the \nSenate and with all the filibuster and cloture and the like, that is \nwhat you end up with, is you have to have a 60-vote threshold. That is \nwhy we have agreed with that.\n  Mr. President, I will close and will come back and within 10 minutes \nor so speak on stem cells for about 4 or 5 minutes, and at that time we \nwill formally close.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7565-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7565-S7566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will begin debate on \nthree important pieces of legislation under an agreement that was \nreached between both sides of the aisle several days ago. Those three \nbills are as follows:\n  The Alterative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, a \nbill sponsored by Senator Santorum and Senator Specter; second, the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which is the bill from the House, \nH.R. 810--the House--Castle and DeGette, Senate--Specter and Hatch \nbill; and, third, the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act of 2006--the \nSantorum and Brownback bill.\n  It was 5 years ago almost exactly--on July 18, 2001, before the \nadministration laid out its policy--that I laid out a comprehensive \nproposal to promote stem cell research within a strong ethical and \nmoral framework. I proposed at that time on the floor 10 specific \ninterdependent principles. I also laid out a proposal and told \npolicymakers and my colleagues I felt it was our responsibility to \nassess and to reassess, on a periodic basis, whatever we or the \nadministration does because of the rapidly advancing science that so \ncharacterizes this decade or the 21st century.\n  As this century progresses and as science advances--and it is \nskyrocketing in terms of the advances\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\nthat are being made--we are going to continually have to face our \nresponsibility to face the moral and ethical challenges and limits. It \nis our responsibility, as individuals, as part of this body politic, to \nreassess whatever constructs we come up with that frame and that govern \nbiomedical research.\n  It is uncomfortable, it is challenging, and it causes each of us to \ngo back and study the science which can be confusing for everyone, \nincluding scientists as well as nonscientists, and to look at the \nframework--both moral and ethical framework that individuals have and \nthat we have--in representing the people of our States, our \nconstituents.\n  I said 5 years ago, on July 18, 2001, and I believe now that we must \nalso do all we can to pursue promising alternative strategies that hold \nthe magnificent potential for developing these powerful pluripotent \ncell lines without damaging or destroying nascent human life.\n  That is why, in the package we will be looking at Monday, I have \nasked the Senate to consider legislation to enhance support for \nalternatives to embryonic stem cell research.\n  I have worked very closely with my distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia, who is occupying the chair, on this very issue. I have asked \nSenators Santorum and Specter to work together, and they have done a \ntremendous job in crafting the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell \nTherapies Enhancement Act, S. 2754, in this regard. Their bill is very \nsimilar to the legislation that Senator Isakson and I and a number of \nother colleagues introduced last year. And I encourage every Senator to \nlook very carefully at it because I believe every Senator should be \nable to support that bill.\n  There is no reason why that piece of legislation should not unite \nthis body and be something that everybody can support.\n  Third is the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act of 2006. People ask the \nquestion--and I have been asked over the course of today and the reason \nI wanted to come back to the floor and close and begin to frame the \ndebate--what is fetus farming? It is the implantation, growth or \ngestation of an embryo in a human or in an animal for the purpose of \naborting that growing fetus for research. Fetus farming is not \ncurrently employed. But it is forward thinking because it is a trend \nthat we could inadvertently move to in trying to advance science, and \nthat line should not be crossed. Therefore, Senators Brownback and \nSantorum have proposed legislation that would draw a clear line that \nshould not be crossed--a clear line that is not there today.\n  Again, 5 years ago on July 18, when I outlined the proposal on the \nfloor, it was covered in an article in the Wall Street Journal on that \nsame day. I outlined my principles. Shortly after--1 month later--the \nPresident laid out the administration's policy on embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  A lot of people do not pay attention to it today.\n  The President's legislation was the first Federal legislation to fund \nembryonic stem cell research. It did so within an ethical framework, a \nmoral and ethical framework. It showed respect for basic human life.\n  President Bush and I do not differ about the need for strong \nguidelines supporting embryonic stem cell research. His policy was \ngenerally consistent with the principles I set forth a month before his \nannouncement in 2001. However, what has now sort of changed, since that \npoint in time, is science has progressed over the last 5 years, and I \nfeel that the limit on cell lines available for federally funded \nresearch, those original limits--given what has happened in science \ntoday and what we have learned--are too restrictive.\n  Because people's views shift, let me refer back to the principle I \npresented 5 years ago. The fifth principle which I presented on the \nfloor 5 years ago, No. 5, and I quote:\n\n       Provide funding for embryonic stem cell research only from \n     blastocysts that would otherwise be discarded. We need to \n     allow Federal funding for research using only those embryonic \n     stem cells derived from blastocysts that are left over after \n     in vitro fertilization and would otherwise be discarded.\n\n  I quote that to point out that that was my stance 5 years ago, and \nindeed when people ask: Why, Senator Frist, or Dr. Frist, are you \nsupporting the House bill, you can see the consistency there.\n  This is very important. H.R. 810, despite its many shortcomings which \nI mentioned last week, is clearly consistent with that principle. And \nthe bill applies this restriction almost verbatim. The very words \n``would otherwise be discarded'' were from my remarks 5 years ago and \nis also in the House bill.\n  All three of the bills the Senate will address raise profound ethical \nquestions. They will require a lot of thought, a lot of study over the \ncourse of the next several days. They are challenging to us as a body \nand challenging to us as individuals. They merit serious debate. That \nis why I am pleased, on an issue of this magnitude, that Senators will \nhave an opportunity to have their ideas considered in an orderly, \nrespectful and dignified way and voted on separately and clearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/14/senate-section/article/S7566-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JULY 17, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
