Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 2863, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2863) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reed/Hagel amendment No. 1943, to transfer certain amounts \n     from the supplemental authorizations of appropriations for \n     Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Global War on Terrorism to amounts \n     for Operation and Maintenance, Army, Operation and \n     Maintenance, Marine Corps, Operation and Maintenance, \n     Defense- wide activities, and Military Personnel in order to \n     provide for increased personnel strengths for the Army and \n     the Marine Corps for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, is recognized until the hour of \n9:15.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as the majority leader stated a moment \nago, I also thank Senators Stevens and Inouye, who worked here very \nlate last night as we got to the end of the debate on the Defense bill. \nOf course, under the rules we have established, we could speak on that \nbill for up to 30 hours. Those 30 hours will be coming to an end at \n9:15 under the rules of cloture.\n  Throughout the 30 hours as we debate this very important bill which \nfunds our military men and women and continues their operations moving \nforward and helps to try to find a solution in Iraq and allocates \nresources to keep our military strong, we also have been talking a \ngreat deal about keeping strong right here at home, particularly \nkeeping strong in the areas that need strength and support right now. \nThat area, of course, is the gulf coast of our Nation, the great energy \ncoast, the great trade coast, the great commerce coast. There are so \nmany important parts of that coast, but the largest city, of course, in \nthe middle of that coast is New Orleans, my hometown.\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\n  We have spent a lot of time this week talking about how we can get \nthe help we have promised to this region, to all the people of this \nregion who have suffered. The poor have been crushed, the middle class \nare staggering, and even wealthy individuals with substantial \nbusinesses wake up every morning in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and \nAlabama thinking, How are we going to get through this day to keep our \nbusiness open, our employees employed, and take care of the community \nwe have served so proudly for so long?\n\n  It is very hard to describe the magnitude of the destruction. Nothing \nanyone has seen on television captures it. I have watched a lot of \ntelevision--not as much as I would like because we are busy doing other \nthings, but I have seen a lot of what has come over on the television \nfrom CNN, from FOX, from MSNBC, I have listened to NPR, and I have \ntried to listen to the television. I have been there so many times and \nseen so much myself, I keep thinking I wish there were some way I could \ntake a bigger camera or make a 4-hour movie to describe to this Nation \nthe depth of the destruction along the gulf coast. Unfortunately, in \nsituations such as this we cannot make a movie quickly. There will be \nmany movies made and many books written. We cannot make one, though, in \nthe next few days or weeks.\n  I was very fortunate to find the National Geographic special edition \nto describe our situation as my colleague, Senator Vitter, and I asked \nfor help, more direct help, more immediate help, real help that we need \nto begin this long, complicated, difficult, and challenging rebuilding \neffort. I was very fortunate to find this National Geographic issue. We \nhave sent copies to all of our colleagues. I thank the National \nGeographic again and mention that I just found out this morning that \nall of the proceeds from the sale of this special edition National \nGeographic entitled ``Katrina, Why It Became A Man-made Disaster, Where \nIt Can Happen Next,'' all the proceeds are going to the victims of \nKatrina--and Rita because that storm came after Katrina hit--and will \ngo to help the victims along the gulf coast from Texas, Louisiana, \nMississippi, to Alabama. We so appreciate that effort.\n  In searching for ways I could describe the depth of the destruction, \nthere are some pictures in National Geographic that give people some \nidea of what we are faced with. Again, these pictures cannot quite tell \nthe story. While this looks like blocks and blocks along the gulf \ncoast, this is probably the city of Waveland. It could be parts of \nBiloxi. It could be parts of Pass Christian. I am not exactly sure \nwhere, but it is somewhere along Mississippi. You can tell how pretty \ntheir beach is. We have a different kind of coastline in Louisiana.\n  The reason I have been spending so much time on this Defense bill \ntalking about this issue is this is our war. This is our Baghdad. This \nis a picture of parts of New Orleans with water as far as the eye can \nsee. There is another picture that shows the city in the background and \nthe depths of flood around it. This picture is a graveyard in New \nOrleans. Of course, we bury our dead above ground because there is so \nmuch water we cannot even dig a few feet down to bury them. This \npicture is one of our graveyards.\n  Looking through the National Geographic, when you see the pictures of \ndestruction, I don't know if the camera can see the depths of the \ndestruction, the industrial canal, the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans. \nThese pictures could be shown from the western side of our State to the \neastern side of our State, to New Orleans, to the gulf coast of \nMississippi, into some parts of Alabama, and into some parts of Texas. \nTwo million people have been displaced and are searching for high \nground, for stability, for housing, for jobs. From the cities they \nfled, from communities they fled, in boats a lot like this. They are \nsearching for housing, apartments, jobs, safety. Most important, what \nthey need is help, real help--not promises, not photo-ops, but real, \nserious help.\n  Let me show some other pictures of people who need help. This is a \ngentleman in Lafitte. I would say he needs a little help. He may be \ninterested in some tax breaks that people have offered around here. I \ndon't know at this exact moment what tax breaks might help him, but a \nfireman would be good or someone who could help drain out some of the \nwater--maybe one of his employees from Lafitte, which does not have a \ntax base, who is about ready to go out of business, maybe someone who \nworks for the little town of Lafitte that was created by Mayor Tim \nKerner's father, the father of Lafitte who helped create this town. I \nactually went to his funeral last week. He served with my father. When \nhe was mayor of Lafitte, my father was mayor of New Orleans. We went to \nhis funeral to pay respects to the family. His son now is mayor of \nLafitte. I don't know how long he will be mayor because Lafitte does \nnot have a tax base to stay in business. This man used to live in \nLafitte. If this town folds because we cannot get a loan to them, that \nis all they have. I don't know where he goes, but he is looking for \nhelp.\n  This is a woman--I am sorry I don't know her name, but there is a \npicture and description of her in the magazine. This woman looks pretty \nself-reliant to me. She obviously looks troubled and anxious. She is \ndoing what she can to carry her two children to safety. People all over \nthe gulf coast did this, basically by themselves, with limited support. \nA lot has been said about people not helping people, but David Johnson, \nwho was unable to work, is carried from his home in eastern New Orleans \nby Mickey Monceaux. The authorities say the water is leveling off as \nLake Pontchartrain empties in the gulf. We have had people helping each \nother during this time, being as self-reliant as possible.\n  Here is another picture. National guardsman Jon Eric Miletello \ncomforts his grandmother. This young man probably--because most of the \nNational Guard in Louisiana have pulled triple and double duty in \nIraq--probably just got back from Iraq. You can see how much he loves \nhis grandmother, the way he is looking at her to help her get out of \nthe floodwater.\n  I don't know what city she lives in, but I can promise you that \nNational Guard specialist would appreciate it if this Congress could \ntake a billion dollars of the $43 billion that is sitting in a bank \naccount going nowhere, doing nothing, and lend it to the cities and the \ntowns and communities on the gulf coast to help his grandmother figure \nout what she might do in the next few weeks and months and years. We \nare not certain about what his grandmother's future is, but we would \nlike some time to figure it out.\n  I know a lot of people have died in Iraq. I have had 42 soldiers die \nin Iraq. Our elected officials have gone to as many funerals as we can \npossibly go to. We have written as many letters to their families, and \ncalled them. We have had about 942 people die from this disaster.\n  Our challenge right here at home--and not to underestimate in any way \nthe lives that have been given to protect this country. We want to get \nour soldiers home and protect them. That is why we are passing this \nbill, and that is why I am not holding this bill. I can't hold this \nbill because we have 30 hours of debate, but I have taken time through \nthis 30 hours to talk about the war right here at home.\n  ``Here lies Vera. God help us.'' In New Orleans, as people were dying \nwith no place to go, the neighbors built makeshift coffins. This one \ncould still be there. It was there when a National Geographic \nphotographer took it maybe a week or two ago. It could still be there \nin a neighborhood in New Orleans. Many of the bodies that are yet \nunidentified are in the prison at St. Gabriel. That awesome and \ngruesome situation is being worked out as I speak.\n  In the midst of all of this tragedy and destruction of cities and \ntowns and high water and inadequate FEMA response, my colleague and I \ncame to the floor and have been working through the week in meetings \nand letter exchanges and telephone calls, working with Senators, trying \nto work with the House, trying to work with the administration to say: \nOK, we know things aren't working as well as they could. What can we do \nto try to fix it?\n  We came up with a suggestion. Let's take a billion dollars from the \n$43 billion that FEMA has sitting there that has already been allocated \nand move it to an already established loan program to give the cities \nand counties and sheriffs and law enforcement the help they need for 3 \nmonths, just 3 months,\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\nwhile we go on vacation again. Just give them 3 months. Lend them some \nmoney to keep their lights on, to keep their cities and their \ncommunities and the hospitals open until we can figure out a long-range \nplan.\n  We may have to refinance some debt. We may have to close areas down \npermanently. We hope not, but maybe we will have to. We are going to \nhave to do a lot of things we never thought we would have to--such as \nbuild a good levee system. We will have to do that. So we came to ask \nfor a loan under the program that has been established since 1972.\n  We have basically been told--even after working through the night, \nafter offering a variety of different compromises--I am sorry, to the \nLouisiana delegation; I am sorry, to the Mississippi delegation; I am \nsorry, to the Alabama and Texas delegation, but the only way that we \nwill lend you the money is if you pay it back under different terms \nthan anyone has before and that anyone will be asked to do in the \nfuture.\n  With 45 minutes left in the debate, still the only way that we can \nget 3 months of operating expenses, under a program that already \nexists, with money that we have already allocated that is sitting in a \nbank account doing nothing, is to agree to tight-fisted lending \npolicies that have never been applied to anyone else in America and, \naccording to the draft that I saw last night at 2 o'clock in the \nmorning, will not be applied to anyone in the future. But for \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas, the Gulf Coast States--and \nnot all of Alabama but just the regions hit by the storm--for those \ncounties, the only way you all on the gulf coast can get the money is \nunder a new, tight-fisted, basically what one could describe as higher \ninterest rate loans because there is no way under any circumstance, \naccording to the draft I have seen, no matter how dire your situation, \nthat you could ever be given any reprieve whatsoever to not have to pay \nthe whole thing back.\n  Some people have classified this latest offer from the Republican \nleadership as a compromise. A compromise is an effort to do the best \nyou can for people while preserving some important principle. This is \nno compromise; this is an agreement between the rightwing and the far \nrightwing, people who are holding the power and are not willing to use \nit on behalf of people who need help. The gulf coast of Louisiana has \nbeen hit by the worst hurricane in the history of our country. Then we \nwere hit by a disastrous break in a levee system that was not \nsupported, not built to standard, and not invested in by a nation, and \nin some measure by our own selves, but in large measure by a nation \nthat refused to recognize the importance of this levee system, not just \nfor the people of Louisiana and the southern part of Mississippi but a \nlevee system to continue to bring trade and commerce and jobs and \nwealth to a nation that needs and was actually built on the banks of \nthe mighty Mississippi River.\n  Despite decades of speeches from members of our delegation about the \nimportance of investing in levees and even agreeing to take some of our \nown revenues generated off of our coast to invest in hurricane \nprotection and levee protection, we were in large measure left to fend \nfor ourselves in a way that while the Federal Government contributed \nmoney, those moneys kept getting less and less relative to other \nspending and other priorities in Congress, until we were left with a \nsecond-rate levee system. Now we have a major disaster on our hands.\n  It is extremely important that the people of our country know that \nthere is a way that we can rebuild this region; that there is a way \nthat we can pull together to do it. When we make suggestions as simple \nas getting $1 billion to go through a loan program that is already \nestablished with money that has already been appropriated, when we are \ntold, that is too much to ask, we can't do that, we can't afford to do \nit because the people of the gulf coast just have to understand that \nyou have to take this on terms and conditions that no one has been \nasked to before and no one will be asked to after, is a hard thing for \nthis Senator to accept.\n  A historian once described New Orleans as an inevitable city in an \nimpossible location. That pretty much captures where we are today. We \nare having an inevitable debate that places the people of Louisiana and \nthe gulf coast in an impossible situation. We are asking for a 3-month \nloan to keep our cities and communities operating, for our sheriffs, \nfor police, for firefighters, for critical city workers, for some of \nour hospitals that, despite the worst storm in the world, stayed open, \nkept their lights on, kept serving people, and are sustaining a region \nof this country that is vital for the future of the Nation. We ask for \na loan, and we get nothing but empty promises and tight-fisted lending \npolicies when we need help.\n\n  We have been stuck by the worst natural disaster. We now have a \nthird-rate FEMA operating, a second-class levee system, and now, to \npour salt on the wound, a tight-fisted lending policy applied only to \nus. I am asked, basically: Senator, take it or leave it. That is a hard \nquestion to ask any Senator--take it or leave it. That is why I have \ntaken all of these 30 hours to consider what our options are, to try to \nbring our case to the American people, to ask the country: Is this \nfair? I don't believe it is, but life isn't fair.\n  Our job is to try to make it more fair. That is why I am here. I \ndon't know, I hope that is why everybody else is here. But that is why \nI am here. I would hope that my colleagues would think, particularly in \nthe Senate, Republicans and Democrats, that that is why we are here.\n  Talking about Senators, I thank the Senators who worked through the \nnight trying to come up with a real compromise, a compromise with \ndignity, a compromise with some hope, a compromise that would give our \ncities some hope that somebody in Washington is listening. The junior \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, who has no immediate interest other \nthan he was a former Governor, a former House Member, he spent time on \nmy and Senator Vitter's behalf on the House side trying to talk to the \nleaders of the Republican Appropriations Committee to say: Why are you \nasking for new terms for Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas \nwhen you have given these terms before to others?\n  We know we are asking for the cap to be raised. The cap has been \nraised before. There is a $5 million loan cap on a program where our \ncities, not only New Orleans, which is the largest, but the parishes of \nJefferson and St. Tammany and St. Bernard and Plaqueman--their monthly \noperating budget in the city of New Orleans is $20 million. So ask me \nwhat borrowing $5 million would help? A week? That is what we would be \nable to borrow, 1 week?\n  So we have asked for the loan cap to be raised so the cities can \nborrow some money, and the parishes and the sheriffs, which are not \nincluded specifically in the language of the ``compromise'' that has \nbeen offered, they are not specifically included. It has been inferred \nthat our sheriffs are included. But our sheriffs are elected. They are \ndifferent from the rest of the country. They perform a tremendous \nservice to our State and to our parishes. They were the ones who \ncarried people on their backs to safety. They were the ones who helped \nkeep law and order. They didn't do everything perfectly, but they did \nthe best they could under a very difficult circumstance. They are not \neven specifically in the compromise. If we can't keep law enforcement \noperating, if we can't keep our lights on, if we can't keep some \nrunning water in what pipes we have left, if we can't keep the mayors \nand the parish councils at work having meetings, turning on city hall, \ntrying to mop out their city halls, could anybody here tell me how we \nbegin to rebuild a region without basic, essential community services? \nI don't know.\n  I know the private sector can do a great deal. But you know what the \nprivate sector people coming into my office tell me, whether they are \nbig business or small: Senator, we need lights. We need water. And, \nSenator, please tell them to stop sending us bottled water; I need for \nthe water to go on in my business because my employees want to come \nback to work, but I can't bring them back to work without water. If we \nlay off the sewage and water board and the people who work to turn on \nthe water, how in the heck are we going to get water and electricity \non? If you are trying to give a\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\ntax credit to a small business or big business, I don't think it is \ngoing to work very well.\n  The Democratic leader, Senator Reid, worked through the night. The \njunior Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, worked through the night. \nSenator Barack Obama came down here at 1:30 in the morning and asked if \nthere was something he could do. Senator Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas, \nwho has been a great voice for us, although her State was not directly \nimpacted, has come to the floor many times this week to say the 75,000 \ncitizens who were evacuated to Arkansas would be well cared for and \nwell taken care of but has asked for some help with their health care \nsystem as Arkansas struggles to provide health care services to these \nindividuals, and they have been turned down time after time.\n  I have a word for the people of Louisiana. The men and women I \nmentioned are your true friends as Senator Vitter, my colleague from \nLouisiana, and I have worked together to try to forge the best possible \narrangement we could make for the people of our State. Without a bit of \nself-interest, they have fought for you. They have searched throughout \nthe night for a true compromise.\n  I am proud to serve with these colleagues of mine because they do not \nbelieve the people of Louisiana should have to trade their dignity for \ncash. But that is basically what we are being asked to do, in the \nopinion of this Senator. In other words, Senator, you can have the loan \nfor the people of your State, but you are going to take it under a \ntightfisted policy that has never been applied before to anyone and, by \nthe way, according to the script that we are going to give you, it \nwon't be applied to anyone in the future, but only for you--for \nLouisiana, for Mississippi, for Alabama, for the poor, for the middle \nincome, and for the rich. Only for you all in the South is this going \nto be applied. Take it or leave it.\n  I hope the people of Louisiana, whom I have proudly represented for \nso long, can understand why I spent the evening here and why I am going \nto continue to stay at this desk as often as I can in between trips \nhome visiting with local elected leaders trying to help organize \nmeetings, supporting all the local officials--Democrats and \nRepublicans, Black and White, urban and suburban, rich and poor \ncitizens to try to help us rebuild a State that is not only a State we \nlove, but a region that the country needs, even though the country \nrefuses to understand how valuable we are to them.\n  I think people can understand why the situation is as critical as \nsome of us are trying to show. The devastation is enormous. It is \nunprecedented. Our options are limited. FEMA is not working. The Red \nCross is getting very mixed reviews, and I say that with the greatest \nrespect for a very great organization. But we are getting very mixed \nreviews about the Red Cross. We have 50,000 people in shelters with \nnowhere to go, no housing available even if you presented vouchers. I \nam not saying we do not need them, but it is not an option that is \nworking well because our cities are so full of people who have left the \nsouth of our State to find shelter, to find jobs, to find stability, \nand to find their families because the old voucher program is not \nworking very well.\n  We have people in hotels. That causes problems with the business \ncommunity because when they have conferences or visitors, they cannot \nget their own executives into the hotels to do business in the city.\n  I have talked a lot about New Orleans. I have talked a lot about \nLafitte, Grand Isle, Plackman, St. Tammany, and Calcasieu, but let me, \nfor a minute, talk about Baton Rouge, our capital city, and Lafayette, \nthe heart of the Cajun culture in our State, and Monroe, the home of my \nhusband and our home for 6 years, and Shreveport. These are our other \nmajor cities that sit to the north in our State. These cities were \nstruggling to pay their bills to make things work for their \ncommunities, some of them growing quite fast and doing quite well but, \nas we know, when counties and parishes grow, their school systems are \nstrained and their transportation systems are strained.\n  They were managing just like we all manage and do the best we can. \nAnd then overnight, the city of Baton Rouge, under the great leadership \nof Kip Holden and a great council, ended up getting 150,000 new \ncitizens in 1 week--150,000 new citizens in a city of 350,000. They \nmight need to borrow a little money. When you try to move in Baton \nRouge from one part of the city to the next, the traffic is back to \nback. Lafayette is the same way.\n  So I do not want the people of my State to think I am not aware that \nthere are not impacts everywhere. Again, this is a program that has \nexisted for the benefit of everybody in this country, and we have asked \nto take $1 billion from FEMA and move it--not new money, but money that \nis sitting in FEMA's bank account that they cannot spend, and give it \nin loans under the same terms and conditions as other States to which \nit has been given, and we are told ``no.''\n  From the authorization of this loan program in 1974 through December \n31, the Federal Government disbursed nearly $100 million in 42 loans. \nOf that amount, millions have been repaid, some of it has been \ncanceled, 7 were fully canceled, 3 were partially canceled, and 29 \nremain outstanding, of which one has been partially canceled.\n  This is a program that has worked for everybody in every disaster--\nearthquakes, hurricanes--but when the people of the gulf coast ask for \nit under the leadership of the tightfisted House of Representatives, \nthe only way we can get the loans is under new terms at basically a \nhigher interest rate. The higher interest rate is reflected in the fact \nthat there will be no forgiveness, under any terms, whatsoever written \ninto the law.\n  It is not available to sheriffs, and it is not available to \nhospitals--not explicitly available to law enforcement. You might \ninterpret it, someone could make the argument, but we have read the \nproposed language, and it is not in the bill.\n  Some people have said this is a way to help law enforcement. They are \nnot in the draft I have seen. We tried to put them in and that was \nrejected.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Not at this minute, but I will in just a second. I will \nbe happy to yield in a moment.\n  So we have worked through the night, Mr. President, trying to come up \nwith some available options for the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Texas as they seek to work through a very complicated and \ndifficult situation to try to pull efforts together to make loans \navailable for 3 months.\n  I have shown this picture throughout the week. That is why, as I \nclose over the next few minutes, I would like to show it again. You can \nfind this picture in the National Geographic, ``A World Upside Down.'' \nThis is Long Beach, MS, a week after Katrina hit. This is Mrs. Leona \nWatts. The National Geographic says that her home ``rests amid the \nbones of the home where she has lived for 61 years.''\n  The National Geographic goes on to say:\n\n       Many Mississippians felt abandoned in the days after the \n     storm as national attention--and relief efforts--seemed \n     locked on New Orleans.\n\n  I have asked throughout the week if the city of Long Beach or the \ncities in Louisiana can get some infusion of cash to help them go \nthrough. I don't know what kind of tax credits and other possibilities \ncould help here, at least not in the next few weeks or few months. I am \nconfident that targeted strategic tax cuts can help to rebuild this \ncity.\n  I am almost certain that in Mississippi--I am not completely \ncertain--that the State could actually borrow money to help this \nsituation. But I do know one thing because I was State treasurer of \nLouisiana for 8 years: Our State is prohibited from borrowing money for \noperating expenses because our constitution states that it is fiscally \nirresponsible because, under normal circumstances, it is irresponsible \nto borrow money for operating expenses if you are a State. You should \nborrow money to invest in ports, roads, and infrastructure, not to \nmaintain a lifestyle. Every family knows that. So in Louisiana we have \nnot allowed it for quite some time.\n  So if I have stood on the floor a little longer for some people and \ntempers have gotten a little short, I have to stand here to try to \nexplain that while\n\n[[Page S11251]]\n\nour State might be in a position to borrow money, although they got a \nreport last week that they are $1 billion short in their own revenue, \nbut even if they were not $1 billion short, the Constitution of \nLouisiana does not allow the State to borrow money.\n  The State's largest city is laying off thousands of workers by the \nday. In the city that we keep saying we are going to stand up for, \npeople are being laid off, the city that people still visit for photo \nops to say, We are with you, we are not abandoning you, we are there.\n  My colleague and I come here to ask for $1 billion out of $43 billion \nto give a loan for 3 months for police, fire, law enforcement, to get \nthe lights on and to get the water through the faucets. And we are \ntold: Sorry, the only way that we will give you that money, the only \nway we will lend you that money is under new policies designed \nespecially for you that no one in the past and no one in the future has \nto accept. But you, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, have to take \nit or leave it.\n  So through the night, we offered one compromise after another--a real \ncompromise.\n  Again, the Senator from Michigan is in the Chamber. He helped through \nthe night. Senator Reid was particularly supportive, and I have said \nthank you to Senator Stevens who is not now on the floor but will be \nhere. He was quite patient through a difficult night. This is a \ndifficult bill.\n  We have had to take some time, as we have gotten it at the end of the \ndebate on defense, to talk about this. It was our only option. We said \njust lend us the $1 billion under the same old and good and steady and \ntraditional programs. That was not accepted.\n  We have said if the Senate would come together and act, my colleague \nand I have made it clear that we want the money to be for sheriffs, for \nseveral of our hospitals that are in a desperate situation, to allow \nthe cities and parishes to borrow money, and we would be willing, or I \nwould be willing, to send two bills over to the House with Senator \nVitter and Senator Frist's name on both of those bills so the Senate \ncould go on record saying we are ready to act. And if the House wants \nto pass either one of these, they can pass one and send it to the \nPresident's desk and then they can decide whether we should be treated \nthe same or treated differently. And I would live with that. I have \nmade my point clear, I believe, and I have made myself clear in \nrepresenting the State. We should be treated the same way. But if the \nHouse of Representatives decides that we should be treated a different \nway, if the President of the United States wants to explain why we \nshould be treated differently, I would be happy to send two bills over \nand let the House of Representatives, under the control of the \nRepublican leadership, decide what they want to do. But that was not \nacceptable.\n  So I have stayed here through the night working on as many \nsuggestions as Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, and my \ncolleagues for whom I have a great deal of respect, suggested, and yet \nat this hour, a few minutes before the 9:15 vote, the only \n``compromise'' we have is for the people of the gulf coast to take it \nor leave it--under different terms than have ever been asked by anybody \nbefore and will not be asked of anybody in the future.\n  Last night when I pressed this issue of whether we would be treated \nthe same way, we were told that we could be and we would be. But when \nwe read the bill, the text, it says in added language on page 2--it is \na very short bill, so I want to read it for the Record. This is the new \nprovision that has been offered to us:\n\n       Provided further, notwithstanding section 417(c)(1) of the \n     Stafford Act, such loans may not be canceled.\n        . . . notwithstanding section 417(c)(1) of the Stafford \n     Act, such loans may not be canceled.\n\n  That language has never been in any act, and before anybody tries to \nsay, well, we are lifting the cap, the cap has been lifted before. \nLoans have been extended. Never has this language been put in. But this \nis the Republican leader's tight-fisted money policy that says ``such \nloans may not be canceled.''\n  So the people of my State are in a pretty tough situation--and the \npeople of the gulf coast. We have had a category 5 storm, the breaking \nof a levy system, everything people have worked for, hoped for, dreamed \nof--destroyed.\n  The Federal Government sent us a third-rate FEMA, offered a second-\nrate levee system, and now a tight-fisted lending policy, and then \ncriticized us for not being more self-reliant.\n  This woman lived in this house for 61 years. The reason I like to \nkeep showing this picture is she looks a lot like my grandma. And \nbecause I know, because I know how self-reliant my grandmother was, I \nam just going to assume that she was a lot like my grandmother, Loretta \nLandrieu. My grandmother never graduated from eighth grade. She worked \nher whole life three jobs. She raised 2 boys and 19 grandchildren. She \nnever asked the Government for any money. When she died, she had \n$19,000 in the bank. She gave each one of her grandchildren $1,000, and \nshe bought us a little camp for $15,000 on Lake Pontchartrain. In 42 \nyears, the 8 of us raised 37 children in that little camp, with no air-\nconditioning, and we had a great time. Then as we grew and the family \ngrew and we got a little more prosperous, we put in air-conditioning \nand we expanded it.\n  But this is what my grandmother, if she were still alive, this is \nprobably what she would be looking at right now. And I have to listen \nto people in Washington, the power in Washington, the Republican power \nfrom the White House, to this Senate, to the House, tell me that people \nin the gulf coast area need to be more self-reliant. This woman has \nlived in this house for 61 years. She has probably paid the mortgage. \nShe has probably raised children, worked in her church, never been late \nfor her taxes, just like my grandmother was--every Sunday morning of \nher life in church. The Catholic Church that she went to doesn't exist \nanymore. It was washed away in the 29 feet of water that came over \nSlidell, LA. And I have to listen to the Republican leadership tell me: \nJust rely on faith-based institutions and private sector involvement.\n\n  Our faith-based institutions have done great work. I am so grateful \nfor the many missionaries and churches and synagogues that have come to \nhelp. The church in this neighborhood is gone. Maybe another church \nfrom Ohio will come down, or Michigan, but this lady's church is gone. \nOur churches are gone. Our synagogues are gone. And our businesses that \nare always there to help, that have been helping, that have been \nkeeping people on their payrolls when they had no money coming in the \nfront door, keeping their employees on the payroll, putting up \ntrailers, putting up tents so their employees could come and sleep in \nthe parking lots so they could work in the offices, we are not self-\nreliant enough.\n  So this Senator comes to ask for $1 billion to lend to the \ncommunities such as this, and I am told: Sorry, Senator, we can't loan \nyou the money the way we have lent it to everyone for the last 30 \nyears. And by the way, when we do it again in the future, we are going \nto lend it to everybody under the old program, but just for you we have \na special deal. Just for you all we have a special deal.\n  Here is another man who needs help, and for him we have a special \ndeal--the Republican leadership. We lent money to everybody in America \nsince 1974 under certain terms, but for you, you get a special deal. \nFor this lady walking out of the Superdome--I think this is the Hyatt \nin New Orleans; I think this is where this is--she is doing the best \nshe can. Obviously, she only has two arms and she has two babies and \nshe is carrying them both--with one blanket, a bottle, and a bottle of \nwater for two babies. No store open, and she comes here to ask for \nhelp, and I am told by the Republican leadership in power: Sorry, we \nare going to lend you the money but under different circumstances.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  How much time do I have remaining, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ALLARD). The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  This is the National Guard, Jon Eric Miletello. He has probably \npulled double duty in Iraq because our National Guard has been there, \ntrying to stand up Iraq, standing up water systems in Iraq, putting \ndown sewer systems in Iraq, so he comes home and this is what he finds: \nhis grandmother in 5 feet of water. And when we come here to ask for a \nloan for this town to help\n\n[[Page S11252]]\n\nthem out just for 3 months, we have to get a different deal.\n  So in the last 3 minutes I am going to ask the Senate, since they \nsaid that they would do this, they want to help, to send this over to \nthe House. Let the House make the decision. Let the House leadership \nmake the decision whether they want to lend us the money under the \ntraditional program or give us yet a special deal for people of the \ngulf coast.\n  So I am prepared to ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of S. 1855, and for that bill to be read \nand passed. This bill would allow the Stafford Act money to be given \nunder the same terms and conditions as it was to everyone else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nwould send the bill over to the House to say that such loans may only \nbe canceled with the approval of the Office of Management and Budget, \nso that they could be canceled but only Management and Budget could \nmake that decision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard by the Chair.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, those are the best ideas we have had. \nThey are obviously not enough. I thank my colleagues for their \npatience. I understand it has been a difficult time, but this is a \ndifficult situation, and I know that we have held everybody here a day \nlonger than they thought they would be here. We thought we would get \nout of here about 10 o'clock last night, or 11. I thank Senator Stevens \nfor his patience. He has been very patient, and Senator Inouye, as they \nhave managed this bill. I thank Senator Frist for the hours of \ndiscussions that he has had, but I will say in closing that when you \nhave power, Mr. President, I believe that we should use it in the \nwisest and best way. I don't think the work we are doing here is the \nwisest and the best. It may be the best we can do, but this Senator \ndoes not think it is what we should do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Before the vote, let me quickly explain the two objections \nand then I will have a unanimous consent request of my own.\n  Basically, the language of both of the bills that have been put \nforward has not been reviewed by anybody except maybe two or three \npeople on the floor of the Senate. Second, we do have legislation, the \nVitter bill, that has been vetted with the administration. We talked to \nthe Republican leadership in the House. I believe strongly we can pass \nthis bill over the course of the day.\n  Having said that, I now ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed \nto the Vitter bill which has been at the desk since yesterday. For the \ninformation of all Senators, this bill is the same language we have \ncleared and have been working on for the past 48 hours.\n  I further ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. FRIST. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object. May I ask a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order has been called for. The Senator \nmust----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n             overseas humanitarian, disaster, and civic aid\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in fiscal year 2002, Congress provided $5 \nmillion in the Department of Defense appropriations bill to transport \nand distribute wheelchairs to the victims of overseas conflicts, \nlandmines, and crippling illnesses if matched by private funds. These \nfunds were allocated from amounts provided to the Defense Security \nCooperation Agency, DSCA. Since that time, the DSCA has worked with a \nnonprofit organization called the WheelChair Foundation to deliver over \n120,000 wheelchairs to nearly 100 countries, including 5,810 to \nAfghanistan; 2,400 to Iraq; and over 3,900 to Jordan.\n  I believe it is vital that we plan and invest not only to win the \nwars we fight, but also to win the peace. In that regard, this program \nhas been an unqualified success. The hope and chance for a new life \nthat a wheelchair can provide to someone who could never afford one has \nvalue beyond measure. Additionally, this program gives us the \nopportunity to leverage Federal support with the efforts of the \nnonprofit sector to accomplish more than we could do alone.\n  The funding specifically earmarked for this initiative in fiscal year \n2002 will likely be exhausted within the year. The legislation we are \nnow considering would provide the full amount of the President's \nrequest for Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid of $61 \nmillion. It is our hope that funding will be available for this \nactivity in the coming fiscal year if appropriate humanitarian needs \nare identified.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from the \nchairman, and commend his leadership on this issue. I am familiar with \nthe successes that this program has enjoyed. Providing wheelchairs to \nthe victims of overseas conflicts is an important program, and I \nencourage our Federal agencies to support this program.\n\n\n                         war related illnesses\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the fiscal year \n2006 Department of Defense appropriations bill, H.R. 2863. This \nlegislation makes a valuable contribution to our Nation's efforts to \nenhance the quality of life for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nmarines as well as their families, while continuing to transform our \nmilitary forces to ensure that they are capable of meeting the threats \nto America's security now and in the future.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The committee bill seeks to improve pay and benefits for \nour military personnel and makes considerable improvements in medical \ncare that our men and women in uniform and their families receive. In \naddition, funding has been included to fund a Peer Reviewed Medical \nResearch Program that addresses a wide array of important medical \nprograms.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the Senator from Hawaii about the \nsignificant efforts made by the committee bill to address the well-\nbeing of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. Of particular \ninterest to me is peer-reviewed medical research that examines gulf war \nillnesses and their relationship to chronic multisymptom illnesses. I \nbelieve this research could provide valuable insights into diagnosed \npost-deployment illnesses.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. My friend from Iowa is correct. For the past several \nyears, the Center for Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research has conducted \nresearch on the internal mechanisms and most effective treatment of \ngulf war illnesses and other undiagnosed post-deployment illnesses. \nThis research has been funded by Congress and overseen by the U.S. Army \nMedical Research and Materiel Command and its peer-review process. \nContinued funding for this program will enable the continuation of \nresearch into a variety of illnesses reported by personnel upon \nreturning from the gulf war.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would agree with my friend from South Dakota. The \nCenter for Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research at the University of \nMichigan is the national leader in the research of chronic multisymptom \nillnesses. Their recent research has used advanced functional brain \nimaging technology to demonstrate the similarity in dysfunctional pain \nprocessing between a group of veterans suffering from gulf war \nillnesses and a group of civilians diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The \ncenter's work has taken on added importance because of our Nation's \ncurrent military deployments and deserves the continued support of \nCongress and the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As the Senators from Michigan and South Dakota have noted, \nmany soldiers returned from the gulf war with a variety of symptoms \nthat have no discernible cause. Although environmental exposure in the \ngulf war cannot be ruled out as a cause, many believe that stress is a \nfactor that may have contributed to these illnesses. I hope that \nefforts will be made\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\nto ensure that this bill provides adequate funding to ensure the \ncontinuation of this important research.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand the concerns that my colleagues have \nregarding poorly understood illnesses that have affected military \npersonnel in nearly every conflict since the Civil War, and most \nrecently in Iraq and Afghanistan. As chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I want to lend my support to this \nimportant research.\n\n\n                  AM2 and coatings removal technology\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman for his \ncontinued efforts to ensure a strong national defense. I am well aware \nof the tight budget structures the subcommittee faced when marking up \nthe bill. I would like to draw attention to two important programs for \nfuture consideration that may have great benefit to our military.\n  The refurbishment of aircraft fuselages and engines, ships, and jet \nengine turbine blades requires the removal of paint and other coatings, \nbut can be extremely costly if, while removing the coating, the \nunderlying surface is damaged. I am told that laser technology is able \nto detect, in real time, when coatings have been removed, thus avoiding \ndamage to the item being serviced. Further, I am told the Air Force \nResearch Laboratory has expressed interest in spectroscopy-based \ntechnology as it may assist them in developing robotic systems for \ncoatings removal of large off-aircraft components, as well as \ndeveloping systems in the future for de-coating large on-aircraft \ncomponents.\n  Providing for a lightweight replacement for Air Field Matting, AM2, \nis among the Top Ten mission critical technology needs of the \nDepartment of Defense. AM2 is an outdated 40-year old system currently \nused by the Air Force, Marine Corps and Army to establish temporary \nairport systems in the field. I have learned it may be too heavy to \ndeploy easily and unsuitable for missions where mobility and speed are \nnecessary. Lattice Block Structures may be an option to serve as a \nstronger, lighter and more portable replacement to the antiquated AM2 \nmatting. Fiscal year 2006 funding for Lattice Block Structures could \nenable DOD to more rapidly establish temporary airfields in support of \ncritical military missions.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to the distinguished Senator from Montana that I \nappreciate him bringing these important programs to my attention and to \nthe attention of the Senate. I look forward to working with him on \nthese and other important matters that affect our military and national \ndefense in the days and weeks to come.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the pending measure, H.R. 2863, the \nDefense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2006, will provide our men \nand women in uniform with the equipment, benefits, and programs they \nneed to carry out their critical missions at home and overseas. Having \nsaid that, I must again voice my dismay at the Senate's inability to \nauthorize these appropriations. Critical programs and benefits have not \nbeen authorized. The authorizers layout the priorities, and the \nappropriators fund. Unfortunately, this time honored practice is not \nbeing upheld.\n  As I look over the bill, I see that, as reported in the Senate, it \ntrims $7 billion from the administration request, leaving that amount \navailable for nondefense appropriations. I am pleased that the cuts are \nreductions for programs that were underexecuted in the last fiscal \nyear. Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, the bill also includes a \nlarge number of unauthorized and unrequested provisions. I hope that \nthe sponsors will carefully reconsider these damaging provisions as the \nbill works its way through the legislative process. While I appreciate \nthe hard work and the laudable intentions of the members of the \nCommittee, we must all be alarmed at these appropriations earmarks. \nThey limit the ability of our Defense Department to expend needed \nresources according to its funding priorities.\n  I have already spoken at length during debate on this bill, so I will \nnot take up much more of the Senate's time again. I am pleased that the \nSenate recognizes the importance of America's greatest strength, the \nacknowledgment that we are different and better than our enemies. We \nare Americans, and we hold ourselves to humane standards of treatment \nof people no matter how evil or terrible they may be. To do otherwise \nwould undermine both our security and our greatness as a Nation. The \nSenate spoke with a strong voice this week, and I urge the conferees to \ninclude the detention-related amendment in the conference report that \nwill be sent to the President.\n  With Americans deployed across the globe fighting terror, deployed at \nhome in recovery of Hurricane Katrina, and with looming budget \ndeficits, the Senate faces some tough choices. We must maintain our \nfiscal responsibility while providing for our military needs. The cost \nof the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq demand a new fiscal sanity in \nour appropriations bills. A half-a-trillion dollar budget deficit means \nwe simply cannot afford business as usual. We simply cannot continue \nthe binge of pork barrel spending that consumes an ever growing \nproportion of our federal budget. While the cost of an individual \nproject may get lost in the fine print of lengthy bills, together, they \nall do real damage. Collectively, these earmarks represent a \nsignificant burden to American taxpayers.\n  Some of the more egregious examples of earmarks, either in the bill \nor in the accompanying report, include:\n  The bill includes language to provide $10 million for the Joint \nInteragency Training Center-East and the affiliated Center for National \nResponse at the Memorial Tunnel in West Virginia.\n  The bill includes language to provide $3.5 million above the \nPresident's budget request to procure aircraft and aviation equipment \nfor the Civil Air Patrol.\n  The bill includes language to provide $19,000 above the President's \nbudget request to procure vehicles for the Civil Air Patrol.\n  The bill includes language to provide $3 million to support the \nNational Museum of the United States Army at Fort Belvoir, VA.\n  The bill includes language to provide $2 million for the \ninstallation, repair, and maintenance of an on-base and adjacent off-\nbase wastewater/treatment facility at Naval Computer Telecommunications \nArea Master Station, NCTAMS, in Hawaii.\n  The bill includes language to prohibit the procurement of foreign \nball and roller bearings. This ``Buy America'' restriction with regard \nto the procurement of ball and roller bearings may cost the taxpayers \nmore than purchasing ball and roller bearings from a foreign source.\n  The bill includes language to direct the Secretary of the Army to \nfully plan, budget, program finance the Non-Line of Sight Future Force \ncannon and re-supply vehicle program, NLOS-C, in order to field this \nsystem in fiscal year 2010. Furthermore, the bill language directs that \nif the plan to field the Future Combat System, FCS, in fiscal year 2010 \nis delayed then it directs the Secretary of the Army to develop the \nNLOS-C independent of the broader FCS development timeline to achieve \nfielding by fiscal year 2010. Moreover, the bill directs the Army to \ndeliver 8 combat operational pre-production NLOS-C systems by the end \nof calendar year 2008, in addition to those systems necessary for \ndevelopmental and operational testing. Section 8103 to H.R. 2853 \nSeparating the Non-line-of-sight cannon, NLOS-C, program from the \nFuture Combat System, FCS, will increase costs and program risk because \nit invalidates one of the key underpinnings of the FCS program which is \nto have a family of systems based on equipment commonality. The \noriginal concept for the development of the manned ground vehicle was \nto design and produce a common chassis for all manned ground vehicles. \nSeparating NLOS-C from FCS fundamentally changes this principle and \nfurther complicates the development of this already complex and yet \ncritical Army weapons system. Furthermore, bisecting FCS will increase \ndevelopment and sustainment costs and negatively impact systems \ninteroperability. The AirLand Subcommittee on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee is the appropriate subcommittee of jurisdiction in this \nmatter. Although we had hearings on FCS in the subcommittee this year, \nwe did not hear expert testimony in support of this specific provision. \nAs a result, I intend to offer legislation to repeal this provision in \nthe Defense Authorization bill at the appropriate time.\n\n[[Page S11254]]\n\n  The bill includes language that authorizes the Secretary of the Air \nForce to spend $32 million to make upgrades, repairs, and build \nadditions to buildings and other types of infrastructure associated \nwith military ranges in Alaska.\n  The bill includes language to provide $12.9 million in grant money \nand directs the Secretary of Defense to spend the money for the \nfollowing: $850,000 to the Fort Des Moines Memorial Park and Education \nCenter; $2 million to the American Civil War Center at Historic \nTredegar; $3 million to the Museum of Flight, American Heroes \nCollection; $1 million to the National Guard Youth Foundation; $3 \nmillion to the United Services Organization; $2 million to the Dwight \nD. Eisenhower Memorial Commission; and $1 million to the Iraq Cultural \nHeritage Assistance Project.\n  Section 8062 of the General Provisions. The text states that, ``each \ncontract awarded by the Department of Defense during the current fiscal \nyear for construction or service performed in whole or in part in a \nState which is not contiguous with another State and has an \nunemployment rate in excess of the national average rate of \nunemployment as determined by the Secretary of Labor, shall include a \nprovision requiring the contractor to employ, for the purpose of \nperforming that portion of the contract in such State that is not \ncontiguous with another State, individuals who are residents of such \nState and who, in the case of any craft or trade, possess or would be \nable to acquire promptly the necessary skills.'' I am not making this \ntext up. Let's call a spade a spade. This provision directly protects \nthe jobs of only Hawaiians and Alaskans.\n  And 2.2 million for the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial celebration. You \ndon't need to have the exploration skills of Lewis and Clark to see \nthat this is a path to higher deficits.\n  And $65 million for the Additional Procurement of F-15s. The Air \nForce has decided to procure the F-22 to replace the F-15. Yet this \nearmark keeps the F-15 production line open, so I question the \nnecessity of the F-22 procurement in the numbers of aircraft and at the \nfunding levels requested by the Air Force. Apparently we just decided \nto pay for both.\n  And $2 million for the Air Battle Captain Program at the University \nof North Dakota. This provision sends students from West Point to North \nDakota for their flight lessons. Instead of letting flight schools \ncompete for the ability to train these cadets, we have earmarked their \ntraining to North Dakota. We are putting parochial interests over the \nnecessity to provide the best training possible for the best price to \nour Army cadets.\n  And $8 million for repairs to a specific building at Rock Island \nArsenal. I can think of 8 million reasons why the military, not the \nSenate should allocate funds to fix their priorities.\n  And $10 million for repairs to utility tunnels at Fort Wainright. The \ntunnels aren't broken, mind you, but the owners would like new doors \nput on them. This appropriation looks to me like an open door to fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  The damage these earmarks do is deadly serious. They pull money away \nfrom legitimate funding priorities and they waste taxpayer dollars. \nEach year, many of the same earmarks appear in appropriations \nlegislation, and each year I come to the floor and point them out to my \ncolleagues. Some of the appropriators' favorite projects include:\n  The $25 million for the Hawaii Federal Health Care Network. I \nremember only 2 years ago when this particular project was given $23 \nmillion dollars. Some things never change.\n  And $2 million for the brown tree snakes. Once again, the brown tree \nsnake has slithered its way into our defense appropriation bill. This \nfunding does not belong in the Defense Appropriations Act.\n  There are many earmarks that funnel dollars to worthy medical \nresearch programs, such as breast cancer research, but there is no \ncompelling national defense reason for these items to be in this piece \nof legislation. This type of critical research should be funded through \nthe Labor/HHS Appropriations bill. Our soldiers and sailors need to be \nprovided with the best equipment, housing, and support possible. Scarce \ndefense dollars should be used for these defense purposes, not others.\n  I could go on and on--and on and on and on--listing all of the \nexamples of pork in this legislation. We simply need to reassess our \npriorities.\n  This year's bill also includes a number of ``Buy America'' \nprovisions. For example, it prevents the foreign purchase of welded \nshipboard anchor and mooring chain four inches in diameter and under. \nAnother provision ensures that all carbon, alloy or steel plates are \nproduced in the United States. Whew. I know we'll sleep better at night \nknowing that all of our carbon plates are manufactured in the U.S. Yet \nanother section prohibits the Department of Defense from purchasing \nsupercomputers from a foreign source.\n  I continue to be very concerned about the potential impact on \nreadiness of our restrictive trade policies with our allies. Every \nyear, Buy America restrictions cost the Department of Defense and the \nAmerican taxpayers $5.5 billion. From a philosophical point of view, I \noppose these types of protectionist policies, and from an economic \npoint of view they are ludicrous. Free trade is both an important \nelement in improving relations among nations and essential to economic \ngrowth. From a practical standpoint, ``Buy America'' restrictions could \nseriously impair our ability to compete freely in international markets \nand also could result in the loss of existing business from long-\nstanding trade partners.\n  Some legislative enactments over the past several years have had the \neffect of establishing a monopoly for a domestic supplier in certain \nproduct lines. This not only adds to the pressure for our allies to \n``Buy European'' but it also raises the costs of procurement for DOD, \nand cuts off access to potential state-of-the-art technologies. In \norder to maintain our troop strength and force readiness, the DOD must \nbe able to be equipped with the best technologies available, regardless \nof country of origin. This would ensure both price and product \ncompetition.\n  Defense exports improve interoperability with friendly forces--\nincreasingly necessary as we operate in coalition warfare and \npeacekeeping missions. Exports lower the unit costs of systems to the \nU.S. military, and provide the same economic benefits to the U.S. as \nall other exports--well paying jobs, improved balance of trade, and \nincreased tax revenue. These are really issues of acquisition policy, \nnot appropriations matters. There is no justification for including \nthese provisions in the Appropriations Act.\n  This bill spends money on Lewis and Clark and funnels cash into \nmilitary museums. It protects the mooring chain industry and ensures \nthat we only buy American ball bearings. There is enough pork in this \nbill to feed an army--if only that we used our defense appropriations \nto do that. I suppose it is more important to appease local \nconstituencies and special interests.\n  I wish it were not necessary for me to come to the Senate with every \nappropriations bill to criticize the amount of unrequested spending in \nthe legislation. I do so because I believe it is critical for American \ntaxpayers to understand where the money in their pockets is really \ngoing. I urge my colleagues to stop ``porking up'' our appropriations \nbills. In a time of huge spending deficits and scarce dollars, it is \nlong past time to stop feeding at the trough.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was pleased to join with the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Stevens, in offering an amendment that has been accepted as \npart of the managers' package in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  Specifically, this amendment would require the Office of Management \nand Budget, along with the Department of Defense and Department of \nHomeland Security, to conduct a study on ``improving the response of \nthe Federal Government to disasters.''\n  I believe this study is essential as it is clear to me that there \nwere breakdowns at every level in our response to Hurricane Katrina.\n  Moreover, it is critical that the Federal Government improve its \nresponse to future disasters.\n  The study required by this amendment would: review the Federal \nGovernment's ability to coordinate and expedite its response efforts; \nevaluate the role of our military in responding to disasters; consider \nestablishing criteria for ``automatically triggering'' the\n\n[[Page S11255]]\n\nmilitary's participation in emergency response efforts; and look at \nincreasing the role of the U.S. Geological Survey in preparing and \nresponding to future disasters.\n  In addition, the amendment requires that the Office of Management and \nBudget prepare a report based on the study that includes: \nrecommendations for improving the Federal Government's response in \nfuture disasters with a focus on the military; and proposals for \nlegislation or regulations to implement these recommendations.\n  Lastly, I would like to express my disappointment that the amendment \ndoes not direct the study to analyze the role of the National Guard in \nresponding to disasters.\n  While I wholly join those colleagues of mine who have commended the \nuntiring and dedicated work of the National Guard in responding to the \nrecent hurricanes, I believe that including an assessment of the \nNational Guard's capabilities is critical to understanding the broader \nimplications of our government's emergency response mechanisms.\n  As the principal resource available to States to assist in disaster \nresponse efforts, it would seem vital to consider the Guard's \ncapabilities under both State and Federal control, and the mechanisms \ncurrently established for mobilizing out-of-State Guard units to assist \nin any response.\n  Part of such a review would certainly have included a proper \nevaluation of whether the National Guard currently has the necessary \nresources and equipment to respond adequately to disasters.\n  The study required by this amendment is not about placing blame or \npointing fingers; there is plenty of fault to go around. Rather, it is \nabout assessing our capabilities to respond to future disasters, and \naddressing our weaknesses.\n  As I have said in the past, we need to ensure that we have a system \nin place that allows the Federal Government to come in immediately with \nthe full force of its resources and assume primary responsibility for \nresponse and relief.\n  Now is the time to prepare for future disasters.\n  The study and report required by this amendment will provide us a \nroadmap for enacting the necessary reforms within our Government to \nmake sure we never again have to observe the failures like we \nexperienced during Hurricane Katrina.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, although I support passage of this \nyear's Department of Defense appropriations bill, I am deeply \ndisappointed that the Senate has not been allowed a full debate on the \nDefense authorization bill. It is unconscionable that the Defense \nauthorization bill that is so critical to our men and women in uniform \nhas been allowed to languish for over 5 months. The appropriations bill \nincludes funds for many important items I strongly support, including \nvital equipment for those in uniform facing daily dangers in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. However, vital defense policies are contained in the \nauthorization bill, including policies with a direct impact on military \nfamilies, such as pay and benefits. The Senate's strong bipartisan \nefforts to make TRICARE available for the Guard Reserve are also a part \nof the Defense authorization bill. I therefore urge the majority leader \nto bring the Defense authorization bill back to the floor so that the \nSenate can fulfill its obligation to our troops and to the American \npeople.\n  I am also frustrated that the administration continues to rely on \nemergency supplemental funding for ongoing operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and continues to delay even those funding requests. The \nadministration did not even request the $50 billion ``bridge fund'' \nincluded in this bill by the Appropriations Committee even though the \nPentagon will soon run out of money for the war effort. This week, \nSenator Byrd eloquently explained, once again, why the administration \nshould include the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the \nregular budget. Congress cannot budget responsibly or perform its \noversight duties adequately if we continue to rely on supplemental \nspending bills, which essentially put the costs of war on our national \ntab. The Senate has insisted on three separate occasions that the \nadministration include war costs in its budget submissions and the \nadministration has ignored the Senate three times. I was proud to \ncosponsor Senator Byrd's amendment demanding accountability for the \nfourth time and was gratified that the Senate adopted it.\n  I am proud that the Senate sent such a strong message to the \nadministration about the treatment of detainees. The lack of a clear \npolicy regarding the treatment of detainees has been confusing and \ncounterproductive. It has left our men and women in uniform in the \nlurch with no clear direction about what is and is not permissible. \nThis failure on the part of the administration has sullied our \nreputation as a nation, and hurt our efforts to promote democracy and \nhuman rights in the Arab and Muslim world. I was proud to vote for \nSenator McCain's amendment on interrogation policy because it should \nhelp to bring back some accountability to the process and restore our \ngreat Nation's reputation as the world's leading advocate for human \nrights.\n\n  I am also pleased that the bill coins a modified version of Senator \nGraham's amendment, requiring that the administration report to \nCongress about the procedures used by the tribunals at Guantanamo Bay \nto determine whether individuals held there are enemy combatants. The \nmodified amendment also makes a very important clarification, ensuring \nthat the tribunals may not consider statements obtained with undue \ncoercion.\n  This bill also contains a provision I authored establishing the \nCivilian Linguist Reserve Corps, CLRC, pilot project. It became \nabundantly clear after the attacks of September 11, 2001, that the U.S. \nGovernment had a dearth of critical language skills. The 9/11 \nCommission report documented the disastrous consequences of this \ndeficiency that, unfortunately, we still have not made enough progress \nin addressing 4 years after the 9/11 tragedy.\n  CLRC is designed to address the Government's critical language \nshortfall by creating a pool of people with advanced language skills \nthat the Federal Government could call on to assist when needed. The \nNational Security Education Program completed a feasibility study of \nCLRC and concluded that the concept was sound and ``an important step \nin addressing both short- and long-term shortfalls related to language \nassets in the national security community.'' It also recommended that a \n3-year pilot project be conducted to work out any potential problems. \nMy amendment establishes this pilot project. I want to thank the \nmanagers of the bill for working with me to include this important \nmeasure and thank Senator Coleman for cosponsoring my amendment.\n  I also want to thank the chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee for continuing to work with me in assisting the families \nof injured service members. I was pleased that Congress included my \namendment on travel benefits for the family of injured service members \nin the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the \nGlobal War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief of 2005, P.L. 109-13. My \namendment corrected a flaw in the law that unintentionally restricted \nthe number of families of injured service members that qualify for \ntravel assistance. Too many families were being denied help in visiting \ntheir injured loved ones because the Army had not officially listed \nthem as ``seriously injured,'' even though these men and women have \nbeen evacuated out of the combat zone to the United State for \ntreatment. The change in the law now ensures that families of injured \nservice members evacuated to a U.S. hospital get at least one trip paid \nfor so the families can quickly reunite and begin recovering from the \ntrauma they have experienced.\n  The family travel provision in P.L. 109-13 was sunset at the end of \nthe 2005 fiscal year, H.J. Res. 68 continues to make this travel \nprovision available until November 18 of this year. I was concerned \nthat Congress may not pass the necessary legislation to make this \ntravel benefit permanent before November 18. However, the distinguished \nChairman assured me that he would continue working to extend this \nbenefit in fiscal year 2006 until it becomes permanent through the \nDefense authorization process.\n  There are provisions in this bill with which I disagree, and the \nSenate rejected a number of amendments that\n\n[[Page S11256]]\n\nwould have made this bill better. We continue to waste billions on \nCold-War-era weapons systems designed to counter the Soviet Union while \nnot fully funding the needs of the military personnel fighting our \ncurrent wars. However, on balance, this legislation contains many good \nprovisions for our men and women in uniform and their families, and \nthat is why I support it.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Defense Appropriations \nCommittee bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Camporees at the United States \n     Military Academy for Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts provide \n     similar training opportunities on a smaller scale.\n       (2) Support.--Section 2554 of title 10, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide at least \n     the same level of support under this section for a national \n     or world Boy Scout Jamboree as was provided under this \n     section for the preceding national or world Boy Scout \n     Jamboree.\n       ``(2) The Secretary of Defense may waive paragraph (1), if \n     the Secretary--\n       ``(A) determines that providing the support subject to \n     paragraph (1) would be detrimental to the national security \n     of the United States; and\n       ``(B) reports such a determination to the Congress in a \n     timely manner, and before such support is not provided.''.\n       (d) Equal Access for Youth Organizations.--Section 109 of \n     the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     5309) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence of subsection (b) by inserting \n     ``or (e)'' after ``subsection (a)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Equal Access.--\n       ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `youth \n     organization' means any organization described under part B \n     of subtitle II of title 36, United States Code, that is \n     intended to serve individuals under the age of 21 years.\n       ``(2) In general.--No State or unit of general local \n     government that has a designated open forum, limited public \n     forum, or nonpublic forum and that is a recipient of \n     assistance under this chapter shall deny equal access or a \n     fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any \n     youth organization, including the Boy Scouts of America or \n     any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of \n     America, that wishes to conduct a meeting or otherwise \n     participate in that designated open forum, limited public \n     forum, or nonpublic forum.''.\n       Sec. 8174.

Amounts appropriated or otherwise made available \n     in this title are designated as making appropriations for \n     contingency operations related to the global war on terrorism \n     pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 2006''.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If I may have a moment, I thank our staff for their \ndedication and hard work putting this bill together. I point out to the \nSenate the people I am going to name are our staff. They work with both \nSenator Inouye and me.

This is Mazie's final Defense bill. We are \nextremely grateful to her for her sincere loyalty and tireless efforts \nand very gracious support she provided to each and every one of us on \nboth sides of the aisle on our subcommittee. She will be greatly \nmissed. We wish her family and her husband, Bill, all the best. We \nthank you very much, Mazie. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 2360, the Homeland Security appropriations bill. I further ask \nconsent that there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided, and \nfollowing the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on adoption of the conference report, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2360) ``making appropriations for the Department of Homeland \n     Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and \n     for other purposes,'' having met, have agreed that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree \n     to the same, signed by a majority of conferees on the part of \n     both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 20, 2005.)\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of colleagues, we \nexpect this vote to be a voice vote. There will be no more rollcall \nvotes today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in the Senate this year, we have considered \nthis homeland security bill during two very different times of crisis. \nWhen the bill was on the floor of the Senate in July, the reprehensible \ntrain bombings in London had just occurred and there was a desire to \nincrease funding for rail security. Now, we consider this conference \nreport during the immediate aftershock of two damaging hurricanes in \nthe gulf coast, which demolished entire cities and towns. And there has \nbeen a call and an urgency to provide Federal financial help. We have \nmet that call through significant--very significant--supplemental \nemergency funds. While these funds need to be monitored to make sure \nthey are spent wisely and prudently, it is appropriate to help get the \npeople in these areas back on their feet. And it is important to \nremember that this is an emergency, and emergency needs are being \naddressed through tens of billions of dollars that have been approved.\n  The conference report we are considering today addresses the \nDepartment of Homeland Security as a whole. It is an amalgamation of 22 \nFederal agencies and it encompasses the broad spectrum of homeland \nsecurity needs. But first and foremost, the Department must be focused \non the national security of our country.\n  The conference report before us builds on that. It is threat-based \nand provides total appropriations of $31.9 billion for the Department \nof Homeland Security, directly focusing on two of the most vulnerable \nareas of our homeland security: weapons of mass destruction and border \nsecurity.\n  As a country, we pride ourselves on being an open and democratic \nsociety that affords tremendous freedoms to its citizens. \nUnfortunately, there are terrorists who wish to prey on that trust and \nopenness and to harm and kill massive numbers of innocent civilians to \nattack our way of life. There is absolutely no question that if a \nterrorist gets control of a weapon of mass destruction, be it \nbiological, nuclear, or radiological, it will be used against us and \nagainst the fundamentals of Western civilization. This conference \nreport provides over $2.4 billion for WMD and terrorism prevention and \npreparedness, including funds to assist State and local jurisdictions.\n  Similarly, because we seek to participate in an open and vibrant \nworld, our borders are incredibly porous and access into this country \nis easy. Regrettably, that openness is now a threat to us. We do not \nhave a handle on who and what crosses into our country everyday. This \nconference report provides $9 billion, which funds 1,000 new border \npatrol agents, 250 new investigators, 460 new detention personnel, and \nthe necessary infrastructure and training capacity to support a vast \nimprovement in our border security.\n  I want to particularly single out the coast guard for the outstanding \njob they have done in the gulf coast States. They exemplify a working \nagency--one that does its job without fanfare and complaint, and which \nproduces tremendous results in the number of lives that were saved \nrescuing over 33,520 people--as many as they have over the past 8 \nyears--stranded by Hurricane Katrina. Their superior work day in and \nday out is well recognized. This conference report provides a total of \n$7.86 billion for the Coast Guard for fiscal year 2006.\n  As clearly as we saw the top performance of the Coast Guard during \nKatrina, the problems in FEMA continue to be highlighted. And this \nCommittee intends to conduct an in depth analysis of the Department and \nthis agency. At this time, putting more money in this bill, on top of \nthe $60 billion in emergency funds already provided and the funds that \nwill soon be coming in the next supplemental, is not the solution.\n  I continue to also be concerned about the vast amount of unspent \nfunds in the Department, particularly the $6.2 billion in unspent funds \nfor State and local grants. For that reason, this bill limits funding \nin those areas. As a part of the National Preparedness Goal, State and \nlocal jurisdictions are undertaking a review of their essential \ncapabilities, to determine what has been accomplished with the funds \nprovided so far. The results of this analysis will be used to inform \nfuture funding decisions.\n  Interoperable communications remains a significant priority. One of \nthe hurdles facing communities attempting to achieve this goal is that \nnot all of the technical standards, known as Project 25, are finished. \nSome standards continue under development.\n  Overall, this conference report represents a responsible and targeted \napproach to homeland security funding. Were we able to fully meet every \nneed? No, given fiscal constraints, we focused our limited resources on \neliminating the most serious and detrimental vulnerabilities of our \nhomeland security. And we have made a significant accomplishment in \nbeginning to address the major threats facing our national security as \na whole. This conference report demonstrates our strong commitment to \nshoring up our national security, making the Department of Homeland \nSecurity a better agency with a more coordinated and cohesive approach, \nand ensuring we are focused on the emerging threats of today rather \nthan on yesterday's problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the conference report?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I thank Chairman Judd Gregg, the House Chairman Harold \nRogers, Representatives Martin Sabo, Representative Dave Obey, and all \nof the House and Senate conferees for their hard work on the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations conference report.\n  I also commend the thousands of men and women who are on the front \nlines of Homeland Security. God bless them. I thank them. While I \nremain very concerned that we are not giving these men and women the \ntools they need to do their job, that in no way detracts from their \ncommitment to serve the Nation.\n\n  The conference agreement that is before the Senate sends a strong \nsignal to the Department that it needs to move in a new direction. The \nDepartment needs to be nimble and responsive, not bureaucratic and \nslow. It needs to target limited resources on future threats, not \nsimply the threats posed by the attacks of September 11.\n  The conference agreement includes numerous improvements to the \nPresident's budget, particularly with regard to border security, air \ncargo security, improved screening of airline passengers for \nexplosives, funds to hire firefighters, as well as funding to protect \nthe all-hazards Emergency Management Performance Grant Program.\n  The conference agreement builds on the bipartisan border security \ninitiatives I offered along with the very able Senator, Mr. Craig, with \nChairman Gregg's support to the 2005 emergency supplemental bill. \nBetween the supplemental enacted in May and this bill, Congress will \nhave increased the number of Border Patrol agents by 1,500; Congress \nwill have increased the number of immigration investigators, agents, \nand detention officers by over 750; and Congress will have increased \nthe number of detention beds by at least 1,800.\n  I commend all of the conferees and in particular the inimitable \nchairman, Judd Gregg, for that action. The inimitable chairman. Do you \nhear that? The inimitable chairman, Judd Gregg. He is not here, but he \nwill hear about it.\n  In addition, the agreement contains an important protection for the \nprivacy rights of Americans. The agreement would prohibit the use of \ncommercial databases in the implementation of Secure Flight, the \nDepartment's proposed new airline passenger profiling system. Such \ncommercial databases are unreliable and potentially could be used to \ninvade people's privacy.\n  The conference agreement provides $30.8 billion for discretionary \nprograms, an increase of just 4.6 percent. This is a very lean bill. \nThe committee was put into a difficult position as a result of the \nadministration's proposal to\n\n[[Page S11277]]\n\nhave the Appropriations Committee increase the fees paid by airline \npassengers by $1.68 billion. How about that?\n  The Appropriations Committee does not have jurisdiction--what is the \nmatter with the White House?--the Appropriations Committee does not \nhave jurisdiction over airline fees. The White House knows that. The \nBudget Office knows that. So as a result of what the White House did, \nthe committee was forced to reduce spending on critical homeland \nsecurity programs--your programs, your people's programs, your \nconstituents' programs.\n  This ill-considered administration proposal--hear it--this ill-\nconsidered White House proposal resulted in real cuts--real cuts--in \nfirefighter grants, first responder grants, Coast Guard operations, and \nin the number of airport screeners.\n  Now listen. Listen. It is regrettable that the administration's \napparent lack of understanding of the legislative process--when will \nthey learn?--their apparent lack of understanding of the legislative \nprocess will have such a direct impact on programs that are important \nelements of our homeland security strategy. How about that? Time and \ntime again--time and time again--this administration has talked a good \ngame on homeland security, but it has not followed through with a \nsustained commitment of resources and ideas. I fear that the \nadministration believes that it fulfilled its commitment to securing \nthe homeland by creating the Department of Homeland Security, which I \nvoted against. And I am glad I voted against it. Well, America is not \nmade safer by simply reorganizing boxes on an organizational chart.\n  Repeatedly, the energy, the initiative, the resources, and the \nleadership for homeland security have come from the Congress--the \nCongress. From border security to transit, rail, and port security, to \nair cargo security and explosives detection, the initiative--hear me--\nthe initiative to fund these efforts came from--where?--the Congress, \nyou, this body, the other body, the people's branch, the Congress. This \nconference agreement continues in that tradition, and I commend \nChairman Gregg and former Chairman Cochran. I commend them for their \nexcellent leadership.\n  However, following the terrorist attacks on 9/11, the Madrid and \nLondon train bombings, many other bombings such as those in Bali just a \nfew days ago, and Hurricane Katrina, Congress should be approving a \nmore robust homeland security bill. If there is one lesson we should \nall learn from Hurricane Katrina, it is that when you starve our \nNation's infrastructure and allow our emergency response capacity to \nwither on the vine, there are consequences. There are consequences. \nThere will be consequences.\n  In conference, I joined with Representatives Obey and Sabo in \noffering an amendment to provide $1.7 billion of targeted investments \nfor emergency disaster planning, predisaster mitigation, grants to \nhire, equip, and train firefighters, and grants for transit, port, and \nchemical security. The amendment would also have helped the Coast Guard \nmaintain the ships, the planes, the helicopters that they have used so \neffectively in evacuating over 33,000 people following Hurricane \nKatrina and Hurricane Rita.\n  The entire bill that is before us, the budget for the entire \nDepartment, is only $30.8 billion. Now, I understand the need to live \nwithin limits, but sometimes those limits simply do not correspond to \nthe reality that confronts us. Why not limit somewhere else? Why not \nlimit somewhere else? How much are we giving to Iraq? How many \nquestions do we ask, then, when we give there? We build infrastructure \nin Iraq. How about building it here in our country? Charity begins at \nhome.\n  In the past month, we appropriated $60 billion as an emergency for \none agency that is funded by this bill, FEMA. One agency received a \nsupplemental that is double the annual budget of the entire Department, \nand yet in this bill we fail to make the investments to help us avoid \nfuture $60 billion supplemental bills.\n  We should be increasing predisaster mitigation efforts. What if \nsomething happens here in Washington? What if something hits \nWashington? There will be millions of people from Washington, Virginia, \nand Maryland heading--where?--heading westward, heading toward West \nVirginia, heading toward parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. \nThen what? Yes, what about that? We have seen the problems created by \nKatrina. What if the terrorists were to hit here, and then we have this \nmassive, massive flow of people Westward? That is what we are talking \nabout when we talk about predisaster mitigation efforts.\n  My Governor, the Governor of West Virginia, the most handsome \nGovernor in the country, Governor Joe Manchin, has proposed that there \nbe more money--more money, that we need to prepare ahead of time, that \nwe need to pre-position medical supplies, pre-position gasoline, pre-\nposition other items that will be needed when and if that disaster hits \nhere. That is what we should be increasing: predisaster mitigation \nefforts--not cutting them.\n  We should be doing the disaster planning now so that if there is a \nterrorist attack in a major city such as Washington, DC, that produces \na mass evacuation, there will be pre-positioned food, water, fuel, and \ncommunications equipment to help the millions of affected citizens \nevacuate safely.\n  When less than 25 percent of eligible applications for firefighting \ngrants were approved last year, should we be cutting firefighting funds \nby $105 million? Why, that is sheer madness--madness. That is sheer \nmadness. May I say to one of my favorite Senators of all time, the \nSenator from Vermont, Jim Jeffords--one of my favorite Senators--that \nis sheer madness.\n  When the Madrid and London train bombings proved that there is a real \nthreat to our transit systems--hear me, New York City--when there is a \nreal threat to our transit systems, should Congress be providing just \n$150 million, when the estimated need is $6 billion--$6 billion.\n  When two Russian airplanes were simultaneously blown out of the sky \nby terrorists 1 year ago, should we be satisfied that only 18--only \n18--out of the 448 commercial airports in the United States have \nreceived new checkpoint technologies to screen passengers for \nexplosives?\n  Hear me. We better act in time.\n  I believe Chairman Gregg--the inimitable chairman, I say; he is a \nRepublican, but he is a great chairman; I am proud of him--has put \ntogether a bill that makes significant improvements to the President's \nbudget. I commend Chairman Gregg for those choices. However, as we move \nforward on a Katrina supplemental bill, I hope we will reconsider the \ninvestments contained in the amendment that was defeated--hear me--\ndefeated in conference.\n  Sometimes I say, yes, sometimes you have to spend money to save money \nand to save lives. Let me say that again. Sometimes--sometimes, \nSenators; sometimes, Mr. President; sometimes, I say to the White \nHouse--you have to spend money to save money and to save lives. And you \ndo have to spend it here in America, in this country, to save American \nlives.\n  I commend the staff--our wonderful staff, our great staff, our \ndedicated staff--for their contributions to this important legislation. \nIn particular, I thank Chairman Gregg's staff: Rebecca Davies, James \nHayes, Carol Cribbs, Kimberly Nelson, Shannon O'Keefe, and Avery \nForbes.\n  And do you think I would forget my own staff? No. My own staff, I \ncommend them: Charles Kieffer--man, he is it, he is the man, Charles \nKieffer--Chip Walgren, Scott Nance, Drenan Dudley, and our Coast Guard \ndetailee, Sean MacKenzie. What a staff.\n  Finally, on a personal note, I mark the recent passing of Robert M. \nSempsey this past Saturday. Bob Sempsey worked for the Congressional \nBudget Office for nearly 25 years. He was the principal analyst for the \nHomeland Security and Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bills. He was \na good friend. He was a fine teacher for many of our Senate staff. To \nhis wife and three children, I extend my hand in your time of grief. \nBob was a fine public servant. He will be sorely missed.\n  With regard to the Homeland Security conference report, I again \ncompliment the inimitable Chairman Judd Gregg.\n  I urge its adoption, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with regret that I oppose this \nconference report.\n  I am a strong advocate of the need for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and its work. And as the ranking\n\n[[Page S11278]]\n\nmember of the Department's lead authorizing committee, I do not lightly \noppose this appropriations bill for the Department's vital work. But I \nfeel I have no choice but to protest what I consider to be dangerous \nand misguided cuts in the vital programs that help America's first \nresponders.\n  Just weeks ago, we watched with horror as our fellow citizens in \nLouisiana and Mississippi suffered the ravages of Hurricane Katrina. It \nwas inevitable that a hurricane of that size and intensity would cause \nhardship. But we know that the pain was far greater and the recovery \nfar more daunting than it needed to have been if our Government had \ndone all it could to prepare for and respond to the catastrophe. We \nknow that preparedness planning was inadequate; that first responders \nlacked the equipment and communications they needed to respond; and \nthat first responders and officials did not have the training and \ncommand structures they needed to work effectively together to help the \nmany victims depending on them. And this for a catastrophic hurricane \nthat had been predicted in advance. We can only speculate what \npreparedness and response to an unforeseen catastrophic terror attack \nmight look like.\n  We know, in short, that we have very far to go before we are as ready \nas we must be for the threats ahead. So why are we now are asked to \napprove dramatic cuts in the very programs that could help strengthen \nthese essential capabilities?\n  This conference report would cut the three core first responder \nprograms--the State Homeland Security Grant Program, SHSGP, the Urban \nArea Security Initiative, UASI, and the Law Enforcement Terrorism \nPrevention Program, LETPP--by 28 percent--nearly a third. The State \nhomeland grants, which make up the backbone of most prevention and \npreparedness efforts, would be cut in half from fiscal year 2005 \nlevels. And this comes on top of several years of cuts to these \naccounts. I know these cuts will leave unacceptable gaps in homeland \nsecurity efforts in my own state of Connecticut, and I assume other \nStates will also be unable to achieve their preparedness and response \ngoals without more help from the Federal Government.\n  By contrast, the Senate voted in support of S. 21, a bill sponsored \nby Senator Collins and me, to authorize a significant increase in \nfunding for these core first responder programs. The Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee has also endorsed legislation to \ncreate a new dedicated grant program to help first responders obtain \ninteroperable communications equipment. This vital need--so painfully \napparent on 9/11 and again during Katrina and its aftermath--alone is \nestimated to cost billions of dollars. Currently, first responders must \npurchase interoperable communications systems with these general \nhomeland security grants, making the pending cuts all the more \ndistressing.\n  I recognize that appropriators struggled with constraints imposed by \nthe administration's budget and had to make difficult choices between \nmany important homeland security needs. I appreciate that conferees \nfought to include dedicated money for rail, transit and port security \ngrants, as well as for the Coast Guard's Deepwater program. But I \nreject the premise that we must accept this as the best we can do for \nour first responders. It is not the best we can do. It must not be the \nbest we can do. We know that the threats--natural or manmade--are real, \nand that we are not yet ready to meet them. Katrina has just \nunderscored that lesson. Two years ago, a distinguished task force \nchaired by our former colleague Warren Rudman told us that our first \nresponders were ``drastically underfunded, dangerously unprepared'' and \nthat we would need close to $100 billion over 5 years to meet critical \npreparedness and response needs. Yet in the time since, we have only \nwhittled away at these critical programs rather than strengthening \nthem. As I have said before, we have the best military in the world \nbecause we are willing to pay for it. We should not do less for our \ndefenses here at home.\n  I wish to go on record opposing this conference report because I \nbelieve we must find a way to do more for our first responders and the \ncommunities they serve.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the fiscal \nyear 2006 Homeland Security appropriations bill. I oppose this \nconference report for three main reasons. First, the funding levels for \nfirst responder grants has been slashed to the lowest levels in the \npost-9/11 era despite the evident need for resources. Second, the bill \nadopts a formula for the distribution of first responder grants that is \nunpredictable, lacking in basic fiscal safeguards and will leave many \nparts of this country vulnerable. Third, this conference report \nunderfunds mass transit security.\n  This conference report cuts the funding allocation for State and \nlocal first responder grants from $1.1 billion enacted in fiscal year \n2005 to only $550 million for fiscal year 2006, an unacceptable and \nunwise reduction. Moreover, the level contained in the conference \nreport is a full $270 million less than the amount requested in the \nadministration's budget request. Unfortunately, these reductions \ncontinue a downward trend. The overall amount of homeland security \nfunding for first responders and state and local needs has declined by \n$1.2 billion in just the past 2 years.\n  This is not the time to slash funding levels of these critical \npreparedness grants. These Draconian cuts are particularly remarkable \ngiven the recent failures in the response to Hurricane Katrina. That \ndisaster clearly indicated that this Nation is not as prepared as it \nmust be and that Federal, State, and local first responders and \nemergency managers are lacking critical equipment, especially \ncommunications gear and training resources. This is not the time to be \ncutting the resources available for these vital preparedness programs.\n  The second reason I voted against the conference report was because \nit adopts a formula to distribute these funds that is unbalanced, \nunpredictable and lacks accountability measures that are needed to \nensure funds are spent wisely. Indeed, this conference report \nunderscores the need for the bill Senator Lieberman and I have \ndeveloped, and the Senate overwhelmingly endorsed, to ensure a stable \nlevel of funding for all States. The approach taken in our bill would \nestablish a formula that provides a predictable level of funding--\nscaled to reflect the different needs of states--that will allow all \nStates to achieve essential preparedness and prevention capabilities.\n  We don't know where the next terrorist attack will take place. There \nis no way to predict where the next hurricane, tornado, or outbreak of \npandemic influenza will occur. Therefore, we must raise the \npreparedness of all States to a minimum level of preparedness.\n  Unfortunately, the approach taken by the conference report does not \nprovide an adequate base level to help States and localities establish \nminimum levels of preparedness. Nor does it recognize, as our bill \ndoes, that some States, because of larger or more dense populations, \nneed more funding than others to establish essential preparedness \ncapabilities.\n  Additionally, under the ad hoc approach taken in this conference \nreport, States cannot count on a predictable stream of funding, which \nmakes it impossible to implement the long-range plans the DHS requires \nof them. We need a fair formula, in statute, that does not jump from \nyear to year as is currently the case.\n  Additionally, accountability measures--like independent audits, \nrobust reporting requirements, and tying spending to standards--are \nsimply not in place. We need to adopt authorizing legislation to ensure \nthis funding is being properly spent.\n  It is disappointing that the appropriators largely adopted the House \nposition on how to distribute this funding. This is particularly the \ncase given that the bill Senator Lieberman and I put together received \nthe support of more than 70 Senators just this past July.\n  Finally, this conference report is flawed because it shortchanges \nvulnerable areas, in particular, transit security. The Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs recently held hearings on \nthis important topic which revealed vulnerabilities in our transit \nsystems. The attacks in Madrid and London demonstrate that terrorists \nare willing and able to attack transit systems; it is unconscionable \nthat we are not doing more to secure our domestic transit systems.\n  Our Nation must make more progress in improving its ability to \nrespond to\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\ncatastrophic disasters, whether natural or from a terrorist attack. \nCongress owes it to our constituents and to our first responders to be \nmore thoughtful in how we provide the resources necessary to improve \nour ability to deter, detect, and respond to threats facing our Nation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill conference report. The bill \nprovides $30.8 billion in discretionary spending for the Department of \nHomeland Security. While it is important that the Senate acted to pass \nthis legislation, I am concerned about the funding levels provided for \ncritical programs in this conference report. Specifically, the bill \ncuts funding for vital first-responders grants, and fails to improve \nour Nation's transit and aviation security.\n  I fear that we have failed to learn from the terrorist attacks in \nMadrid and London about the vulnerability of our transit system. \nYesterday's terrorist threat against the New York City transit system \nfurther illustrates the need to increase our efforts in this area. Yet \nthe conference report that we passed today includes only $150 million \nfor transit security grants. In June, Senators Shelby and Sarbanes and \nI sponsored an amendment to raise funding for transit security to more \nthan $1 billion. Unfortunately, the amendment failed. But it is this \nlevel of funding, not $150 million, that is necessary to keep the \nNation safe.\n  Every workday, 14 million Americans take a train or a bus. We know \nthat transit systems and their riders are by their very nature prime \nterrorist targets. Subways, light rail, buses, and ferries are designed \nfor easy access and to move large numbers of people efficiently.\n  These are the facts: Numerous attacks on transit; 6,000 transit \nsystems in the U.S.; and 14 million riders every workday. I don't think \nanyone can say transit is not a target for terrorists and should not be \namong our highest homeland security priorities. Yet the Federal \nGovernment's response to these facts has been underwhelming. Indeed, \nthe Federal Government has invested $9 in aviation security \nimprovements per passenger, but only $0.006 in public transportation \nsecurity per passenger. Now, are aviation and transit the same and can \nwe achieve the same level of security in the open access environment of \ntransit? No, but I doubt that the 14 million Americans who use transit \nevery workday think that less than one cent is the appropriate amount \nto invest in transit security\n  Second, I am concerned about the cuts that the bill provides to \naviation screening. The bill would cut funding for the aviation \nsecurity screener workforce by $125 million from the budget request. \nThis cut will result in 2,000 fewer airport screeners nationwide, \nincluding cuts in the number of screeners in Rhode Island. Rather than \ncutting the number of screeners, we need to increase the nationwide \nnumber to 53,000 screeners in order to keep wait times at the current \naverage of about 10 minutes. Yesterday, President Bush in an attempt to \nrally public support for the war in Iraq stated that the Government \ndisrupted 10 serious terrorist plots since September 11, 2001. Three of \nthese plots involved hijacking airplanes for suicide attacks. Yet, \ntoday, the Republican Congress cut the number of screeners serving our \nairports.\n  Finally, the bill cuts funding for first-responder grants for States \nand local governments by about 17 percent, $680 billion less than last \nyear, and failed to include a formula to help ensure all states would \nreceive adequate funding and protection.\n  This conference report does not do enough to protect Americans from \nterrorism threats or natural disasters. This is a continuation of the \nadministration's, and the leadership of this Congress, pattern of \nfailure to learn from past lessons and invest in the essential \ninfrastructure necessary to make our country safe. Is this the type of \nbelt-tightening the administration is willing to accept in order to \ncontinue to pay for irresponsible tax cuts?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President. I rise today to express my displeasure with \nthe Homeland Security appropriations conference report. More \nspecifically, the conferees' neglect of formula based funding for \nState's first responders could produce dire results for small rural \nStates such as Arkansas.\n  The conferees' decision to cut this funding, by more than half, will \nmake it harder for smaller States to prevent, and more importantly, \nrespond to emergency situations either manmade or natural. The events \nof the last 2 months alone go to show that first responders need to be \nprepared regardless of where they are located geographically.\n  The conferees' decision to cut first responder funding is even more \nfrustrating seeing that the U.S. Senate a few months ago overwhelmingly \npassed a Homeland Security appropriations bill that went to great \nlengths to maintain a minimum base of first responder funding for all \nStates. The formula which was created by Senators Susan Collins and \nJoseph Lieberman was fair and would have provided stability to our \nHomeland Security appropriations process. I commend these Senators for \ntheir hard work and regret that their formula was ignored by conferees.\n  The conferees' actions will not only do great disservice to small \nStates' first responders this year, but they have guaranteed that we \nwill yet again spend precious time next year working out a funding \nformula to allocate Homeland Security grant money. There are many other \nissues that we must tackle but an inability to reach an understanding \non this important issue will keep us stuck in the mud and that, Mr. \nPresident, is a disservice to all States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a lot of activity on the \nfloor over the last 24 hours. It has been focused on how best to help \nthe people along the gulf coast who have been devastated by twin \nnatural disasters, Katrina and Rita. There has been an ongoing debate \nthat took up the night here in trying to determine how best to provide \nthe funding that the cities and parishes in Louisiana and in \nMississippi and Alabama and Texas need in order to begin to deal with \ntheir pressing, urgent needs.\n  I rise because I well remember the feelings that I had on this floor \nin the aftermath of the attacks we suffered on September 11, 2001. It \nwas an uncertain and tragic time in our country. We were attacked and \nwe lost nearly 3,000 people. Eighteen acres were destroyed in the heart \nof the financial capital of the world. Hundreds of thousands of people \nlost their jobs. Businesses were shuttered, and there was great doubt \nas to how we were going to obtain the resources to begin the recovery \nprocess.\n  I am grateful that in New York's hour of need, we had strong support \nin this Chamber. I am looking at my dear friend, the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, who came to our aid immediately. In fact, he said \nhe would be the third Senator from New York.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I have never forgotten that. I am so grateful because \nhe helped to shepherd through the Congress the money that New York \nneeded immediately to meet its needs.\n  I am someone who believes that in a time of natural or manmade \ndisaster, Americans rally around each other. We\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\ntake care of each other. We provided funds from all over the country to \nhelp New York rebuild, just as we did after the Northridge earthquake \nin California, just as we did after hurricanes in Florida, just as we \ndid after forest fires in the West, just as we did after the great \nfloods in the Middle West.\n  There has never been a disaster of the dimension of what we are \nfacing along the gulf coast. I believe I have a small bit of \nunderstanding and empathy because of what we went through in New York \nfor what my colleagues, Senator Vitter and Senator Landrieu, are \nfacing. But what is becoming clear to me is that there is an effort \nunderway to make the recovery along the gulf coast much more difficult \nthan it needs to be.\n  I have been stunned at some of the demands that I hear coming from \nsome of those in the Congress about what is expected from the people \nalong the gulf coast and what kinds of funds can be made available to \nthem. Like many people, I have been touched, moved, and impressed by \nthe passion and eloquence of my friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. She has valiantly fought for the \npeople who placed their trust in her to come to this Capitol and \nrepresent them in good times and bad. We are in a bad time. The people \nin Louisiana and along the gulf coast need champions. But no matter how \neloquent a single Senator is or two Senators might be from a single \nState, they need support on both sides of the aisle and on both ends of \nthe Capitol.\n  We are about to be presented with legislation that for the life of me \nI cannot understand. This legislation in law discriminates against the \ngulf coast. It says, for the first time ever, we will put conditions on \nthe Federal money that goes through FEMA to the people and businesses \nof the gulf coast.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame. Shame.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. We will require that the money be repaid. As Senator \nLandrieu has said in this Chamber: It is a little bit of a catch-22, \nisn't it? You say to hard-pressed sheriffs offices in parishes, to \nmunicipal governments in towns and in New Orleans and along the gulf \ncoast, you say to them: You must repay this money. So before you borrow \nit to keep your police and your fire departments up and going, before \nyou borrow it to have your public utility departments begin to do the \nwork they need to to get the reimbursement they require, you must have \na plan in place to repay it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am bewildered. I don't understand why we are turning \nthe people of the gulf coast into second-class citizens.\n  After 9/11, in addition to the normal disaster relief funds provided \nin the wake of that tragedy, the Federal Government designated $20 \nbillion to assist the New York City area. This was the first time FEMA \nreceived authority of this type to reimburse the city and the State for \nassociated costs that could not otherwise have received money under the \nStafford Act. This was an unusual action taken at an unusual time. We \nhad the strong support of then-chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Senator Jeffords, because 9/11 happened in that window \nwhen the Democrats were in the majority in the Senate. Chairman \nJeffords stood with us to make sure we got what we needed without \ndiscriminating against New York City, without telling New Yorkers: You \nare just going to have to figure out how you are going to repay it, \nwhen you are not even sure there is another attack coming or what is \ngoing to be occurring in the future.\n  Mr. President, we are again facing an unusual time. Hurricane \nKatrina, and then, of course, Hurricane Rita, devastated New Orleans \nand the surrounding areas. The people of this region deserve our full \nsupport. Instead of providing that support and helping these \ncommunities meet their needs, the proposal before us actually restricts \ntheir access to funds by preventing them from using principal \nforgiveness authorities that are part of current law.\n  I know this has been presented apparently by the leadership in the \nHouse as a take-it-or-leave-it deal. I know what a difficult position \nthat puts our two Senators from Louisiana in because they are basically \nbeing told you can leave here with $750 million with discriminatory \nconditions on it that make your people second-class citizens compared \nto everybody else, or you can leave with nothing. Well, that is a \nHobson's choice if there ever was one.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Bring nothing home or bring something that is not going \nto help your hospitals, is not available to many communities because \nthey are not going to be able to borrow it in the first place because \nthey cannot repay it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I came from a meeting where a number of business \nexecutives along the gulf coast are desperately trying to figure out \nwhat they are going to do. Entergy in New Orleans has just taken \nbankruptcy. They said if they have to put the costs they are accruing \ninto the rate base--which they have to do under these circumstances--\nrates are going to rise 200 percent.\n  What are people with no jobs and no businesses--and we will not even \ngive them an unemployment compensation extension, we will not pass the \nMedicaid emergency application process which we used in New York--going \nto do? We had a one-page Medicaid eligibility program that got people \nback into a position where they could get their health needs met. We \nare not doing any of that for people along the gulf.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I have the deepest sympathy for my \ncolleagues from Louisiana. They are between a rock and a hard place.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Go home with nothing or go home with a bad deal.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. And a deal that has never been inflicted on any other \ncity, State, or region in our country.\n  Mr. BYRD. What a shame.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Finally, Mr. President, this is all being done in the \nname of the deficit. I know, I read the papers. We have a lot of people \nwho have discovered the deficit up here.\n  Mr. BYRD. Cut the funds for Iraq.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. There are a lot of other alternatives than imposing \ndiscriminatory conditions on the American people--the American people \nalong the gulf coast.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, together we can do better than this. A \nstrong America begins at home.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. And we should owe our highest allegiance to the people \nwho are in this country. And before we extend 100 billion more dollars \nin tax cuts, and before we continue to run up this deficit by funding \nthe war and all of the other associated expenses, let's get some \nresponsibility back here and let's treat the people of the gulf coast \nwith the respect and dignity they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, let the Record be spread with my admiration \nfor the senior Senator from the State of Louisiana for her tireless \nwork on behalf of the people of Louisiana. I think most all of us would \nagree that this bill is imperfect, and that is an understatement. But I \nso appreciate the enthusiasm, the diligence, the hard work of my friend \nfrom the State of Louisiana, Senator Landrieu.\n  Also, once this bill passes--and it will pass--I think the focus then \nmoves to the other side of the Capitol. I hope those people who are \nlistening to this who have connections with the administration would \nassist us in getting the House to do the right thing: not only pass \nwhat we have done here, but hopefully take out this provision which I\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\nthink is different than the people of the State of Louisiana thought \nthey would get.\n  I hope that by the time the House closes business today, we have a \nbetter product than what we have here. I also think it is important for \nme, having expressed my appreciation to the Senator from Louisiana--I \nacknowledged the senior Senator, but I acknowledge the work of the \njunior Senator from Louisiana. They have worked together. I understand \nthat. It is a difficult situation in which we find ourselves based on \nthat storm none of us anticipated, at least I did not.\n  We are going to have to continue to work our way through this. Even \nthough the devastation of the storm has left the mind's eye of most \npeople momentarily--and it is only momentarily--it is so easy to \nconjure up in our minds the images we saw--we simply need to help those \npeople who have been forced to leave their homes and take their \nchildren to other places.\n  It is a terrible situation, and we need to help. This is a first step \nin helping, even though, as the Senator from New York so clearly \nopined, this is not the best solution. It is a solution.\n  I again want the Record to be spread with the fact that I appreciate \nthe work of the Senators from Louisiana, especially my friend, Ms. \nLandrieu.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to explain an amendment which I am going to ask the majority \nleader to accept as part of this unanimous consent request, and that I \nbe allowed to proceed for 4 minutes to explain what this amendment \ndoes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have all gotten up on this floor and \ntalked about the urgent necessity of helping the people of Louisiana, \nAlabama, Mississippi, and Texas. We have all been on this floor talking \nabout the uniqueness of the disaster which is called Katrina. Every one \nof us goes back home. We received into our homes, our churches, our \nsynagogues people who have been displaced by Katrina. Our people have \nresponded magnificently to this disaster, to this catastrophe back \nhome.\n  Now the question is whether we in the Congress are going to be \nhelpful to the victims in a way which we have been helpful in so many \nother disasters of a smaller magnitude by providing a loan so that \noperations can continue, or whether we are going to incorporate a \nprovision in this loan which has never been incorporated before in any \nloan ever made to a community that obtained a loan under this law.\n  We have never imposed this restriction that is in this bill on any \ncommunity in this country. We have lent money to Ricksburg, ID; we have \nlent money to Johnstown, PA; we have lent money to Clifton, AZ; we have \nlent money to Albian Borough, PA; we have lent money to Vassar, MI, in \nmy home State.\n  There are occasions when those loans have been forgiven, and in the \nones I just listed--and I want the majority leader to understand the \ndepth of the feeling on this issue because it can happen to any of us--\nthe loans I just listed, including one to my home State, have been \nforgiven when they met the conditions of the Stafford Act for forgiving \nloans.\n  But now we are telling the victims of the worst disaster we have had \nin this country that the Stafford Act provisions, which, under certain \ncircumstances, could permit the forgiveness of a loan, will not be \navailable to them. My amendment does not turn this loan into a grant.\n\n  If my amendment is accepted, it would provide that the same terms and \nconditions under which this loan is made will be the terms and \nconditions that have been applied to other loans.\n  To discriminate against these people who have been so victimized, to \nme, is unthinkable--that we would single them out for discriminatory \nlanguage. I don't believe we can operate this way, and I don't believe \nthe House would reject our language if my amendment is accepted.\n  The Senator from Delaware and I went over to the House last night. We \ntalked with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and he \nindicated that the language which I am going to suggest would be \nacceptable to him. He didn't speak for the whole House, obviously, and \nif the Senator from Delaware chooses to comment on this, I think he \nwill restate what I just stated as being accurate.\n  My request, my plea, is that we adopt language which strikes the \ndiscriminatory provision which allows the Stafford Act forgiveness to \nbe considered with these loans the way it has been considered with all \nother loans. That is my plea. And my plea is incorporated in an \namendment.\n  My amendment, which I ask the majority leader to consider, would \nstrike the word ``not'' in the bill where it says:\n\n        . . . that loans may not be canceled.\n\n  Strike the word ``not'' and substitute the words ``may be canceled \npursuant to the Stafford Act,'' and with an additional requirement, \n``with the approval of the Congress.''\n  I suggest we add an additional safeguard, the safeguard of the \nStafford Act, which has been applied to all other loans, but in \naddition to that, add a requirement that if there is forgiveness, it \ncould only happen with the approval of the Congress. That is a double \nsafeguard. That still would single them out as no others have been \nsingled out, but at least it would keep the possibility explicit in the \nbill that under the circumstances that are provided for every other \nloan, that these loans might be forgiven should Congress so choose.\n  I have been told we can always do that; we always have that power, \nand we do. It is implicit. But I think we should make it explicit to \ngive people the assurance that in addition--it is bad enough to be \nvictims of this hurricane; it is doubly bad to be victims of \ndiscriminatory language. And we are not going to walk down that road. \nWe are going to hold our hand out to you and not insult or offend at \nthe same time.\n  I ask the leader whether he would amend his unanimous consent \nproposal to strike the word ``not'' on page 2, line 10, and substitute \nthe words ``only with the approval of the Congress''?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I object to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \noriginal consent request?\n  Mr. CARPER. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order being called for, the Senator \nfrom Delaware must object or not object.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from Delaware or any other Senator not \nhave the right to reserve the right to object?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not a right to reserve the right to \nobject; it is an indulgence of the Chair.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest by the majority leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1858) was read three times and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1858\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Disaster Loan Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISASTER LOANS.\n\n       (a) Essential Services.--Of the amounts provided in Public \n     Law 109-62 for ``Disaster Relief'', up to $750,000,000 may be \n     transferred to the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program \n     for the cost of direct loans as authorized under section 417 \n     of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5184) to be used to assist local \n     governments in providing essential services: Provided, That \n     such transfer may be made to subsidize gross obligations for \n     the principal amount of direct loans not to exceed \n     $1,000,000,000 under section 417 of the Stafford Act: \n     Provided further, That notwithstanding section 417(b) of the \n     Stafford Act, the amount of any such loan issued pursuant to \n     this section may exceed $5,000,000: Provided further, That \n     notwithstanding section 417(c)(1) of the Stafford Act, such \n     loans may not be canceled: Provided further, That the cost of \n     modifying such loans shall be as defined in section 502 of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 661a).\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\n       (b) Administrative Expenses.--Of the amounts provided in \n     Public Law 109-62 for ``Disaster Relief'', up to $1,000,000 \n     may be transferred to the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan \n     Program for administrative expenses to carry out the direct \n     loan program, as authorized by section 417 of the Stafford \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the last 24 hours, we have dealt with \nan issue that centers around the Vitter bill and the proposal to \nappropriately be able to modify, increase the amounts of loans and loan \nprograms. We have struggled to come to the point we have today, which \nmaximizes our likelihood, having just passed the Vitter bill, to get \nlanguage to the House of Representatives before they leave today so \nthat we can respond to the very real needs of the local communities in \nNew Orleans.\n  We have been working actually for about 10 days on the specific issue \nof being able to support local government, law enforcement, and \nhospitals. The step we just took in passing the Vitter bill maximizes \nour chance today of getting a bill to the House, which we will do, of \nhaving the House address it in the next few hours, and having this \nrelief being made available to the people of New Orleans.\n  There have been a lot of suggestions in terms of language and changes \nin words, all of which is fine, and some of the language is even very \nreasonable in terms of the language itself, but after discussions with \nRepublican leadership, the administration having fully vetted the \nlanguage that is in the Vitter bill, I strongly believe that this gives \nus the best chance to respond to the very real needs of the people of \nNew Orleans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the last 24 hours has been a frustrating \nand disappointing time for me, quite frankly--frustrating because as we \nface an unprecedented crisis along the gulf coast, some elements of the \nSenate have acted as they often do by giving speeches and \nfilibustering.\n  When I ran for the Senate last year, that is what I heard the most \nfrom real people in real life in real towns and cities across \nLouisiana. They did not get that disconnect. There were real issues on \nthe ground they had dealt with every day in their lives, and yet so \noften the response of some in the Senate was to give speeches, to \nobstruct, and to filibuster. So I have to say particularly in these \ncircumstances, when my State and the gulf coast face unprecedented \nobstacles and hurdles, it has been frustrating to get that response \nfrom the other side in the Senate. But we have moved through that, and \nI am glad.\n  Just a few minutes ago, we sent over to the House a significant \nmeasure to try to get some immediate relief to local governmental \nentities so that they can sustain essential services, police and fire \nand hospitals and the like. That is vitally important.\n  When others have been filibustering, making speeches, and delaying, \nparticularly in the last 24 hours, I tried to do something \nconstructive. What I did is what I have done for the last 10 days--\nworking on this vital issue, trying to get something meaningful, \nimportant, and positive done. When others gave speeches about what the \nperfect language would be, I actually talked to other folks who were \nclearly going to be involved in the process at the White House, at OMB, \nand in the House of Representatives to understand what the best \nlanguage would be that we could hopefully pass this week. I continued \nthat work last night, again as others were giving speeches and holding \nup action. I continued that work talking to dozens of people to try to \nget something important and significant done. Across the board, that \nincluded Members here, members of the administration, and Members of \nthe House.\n\n  Senator Levin, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, mentioned one \nconversation with the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. I \nfollowed up with the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. I \ntalked to him after that conversation, and it was crystal clear to me \nfrom my conversation with him that significant elements of the House of \nRepresentatives needed to see that at least at the front end, this was \na loan program. We can talk later about what we will do at the back \nend, how things proceed, what the financial picture looks like in the \nfuture, but at least in the front end, it is very clear that they want \nto frame it as a loan program. That is the only reason I accepted that \nlanguage, because I actually want to do something. I actually want to \nget needed help today, not in 2 weeks when it will be too late for so \nmany of those communities and local jurisdictions of government that \nneed to preserve their police, fire, and hospital services. That is the \nonly reason I have focused on this particular version of the bill and \nthat particular language.\n  Several speakers on the other side called it discriminatory. Let me \nexplain a few other ways in which it is discriminatory because it is \ndiscriminatory in at least three other ways, and I am pretty darn proud \nof being able to negotiate those three other discriminatory provisions. \nNo. 1, for the first time ever that I am aware of, ever in history, we \nare moving emergency Stafford Act funds that have already been \nappropriated by the Congress into this community disaster loan program \nunder homeland security so it can be used for ongoing expenses, ongoing \nsalaries, and other expenses of local government. That has never \nhappened before. That is discriminatory, and I am proud of that \ndiscriminatory provision.\n  Secondly, we are lifting the cap on this program that ordinarily \nlimits these funds to $5 million per entity of local government. We are \nblowing well past that, and there are significant numbers of local \ngovernment entities, such as the city of New Orleans, that will be able \nto get loans way in excess of that, perhaps 10, 11, 12 times in excess \nof that in the case of the city of New Orleans. That is discriminatory \nbecause it has never happened before. It is discriminatory in our favor \nbecause we needed it.\n  So there are many provisions in this version of the bill that were \ndiscriminatory in our favor because these are unusual circumstances and \ncall for absolutely dramatic action. So I am proud of being able to \nnegotiate those. I accept this other provision because, again, what is \nimportant to real people in the real world in the real devastated area \nis that we get real help to them today--not give a speech, not \nfilibuster, but get real help to them today and not simply pass it off \nfor 2 weeks or a month. I am hopeful that is what this bill which we \nhave just passed through the Senate will do.\n  It has not yet cleared the House, and immediately from this floor, I \nwill go to the House and continue my discussions which were begun over \na week ago with House leaders, House Members, to try to ensure that \nthis type of strong, effective action actually happens today.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence. It certainly was not my plan or \nmy actions which caused this 24 hours of obstruction, filibuster, and \nfrustration. I share that frustration, and I thank everyone who has \nworked constructively on trying to get something done, everyone here, \neveryone in the U.S. House, everyone in the administration, and OMB, \nwhose help put that together.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today first to pay tribute to the \nsenior Senator from Louisiana for her courage, her strength, and her \nresolve. I have been so amazed and impressed at the way she has been \nwilling to continue to be on this floor, regardless of how tired she \nbecame, in order to fight for the people of Louisiana. I hope everyone \nin Louisiana understands what she is doing on their behalf and on \nbehalf of all of those in the entire gulf region.\n  What is so disappointing for me is to see that this has not been a \nbipartisan effort. It seemed reasonable to me. I represent Michigan, \nand fortunately we have not been in a situation like my colleagues from \nNew York or the gulf or California. So far--knock on wood--we have not \nhad to face that kind of a catastrophe. But I found what the Senator \nfrom Louisiana was asking for very reasonable.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we have appropriated $61 billion to be used \nthrough FEMA. We assumed it would be already being used for the things \nthe Senator\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\ntalked about. I was shocked to learn that those funds had not been \nreleased to help local communities, as we have been told, and that the \nprocess was not moving as it should when people are so desperately in \nneed of support, whether it be the small businesses, the families, the \nseniors, the cities.\n  When the Senator from Louisiana asked us for a very modest request of \nallowing $1 billion of $61 billion to be used directly and immediately \nto help those who have been so devastated, we do not have bipartisan \nsupport for that. I was very disappointed that both Senators from \nLouisiana were not standing together for that, very surprised that \ninstead what we see is an alternative that comes back that is not only \nless than what is needed but has restrictions that have not been put on \nother States and other communities. The caps being talked about being \nraised in terms of loans have been done before, but it is my \nunderstanding that no community has been asked before to guarantee a \nrepayment on those loans. I do not know why anyone would support that \nkind of an effort for their State or their communities to be treated \ndifferently than other States or other communities.\n\n  If I were in that position, I would not want to say to my folks: I \ntrust you less than I trust the folks in New York; I voted for a \ndifferent set of rules for what happened in New York, what happened in \nrelation to Washington, DC, and the Pentagon. I certainly would not \nwant to be in a situation of saying that I would vote for rules that \nwere penalizing my own people or saying we do not trust you as much as \nwe trust people in other places. So I am surprised and disappointed, \nand I know the senior Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, is as \nconcerned, surprised, and deeply disappointed, certainly, as I am and \nmore than I am because she is working on this every single day.\n  I just want to indicate that we could have done better, and I believe \nworking together America can do better. I believe we can do better for \nthe people of Louisiana and the gulf coast than what has been offered \nand passed here today. I know the senior Senator from Louisiana has \nworked very hard in order to put forward proposals that are better and \nthat would do better than what has been achieved today.\n  I commend her once again and thank her on behalf of all of us who at \nany moment could find ourselves in the same situation, could find \nourselves fighting for our people because of a devastating attack or \nnatural disaster. I hope I would have the courage of conviction, the \ncompassion, and the strength that the Senator from Louisiana has shown \nand I know will continue to show.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, folks who might be watching this debate \nacross the country may be wondering what this is all about. Let me try \nto simplify it as best I can.\n  Over the last month or so, the Congress has appropriated some $61 \nbillion to be used to assist in the reconstruction, the aid, and the \nhousing of a lot of people whose lives have been disrupted and in some \ncases destroyed. There are a number of cities, towns, and jurisdictions \nwithin that region where their revenue base--the ability to raise taxes \nand to provide essential services--is gone. Of that $61 billion, FEMA \nis not authorized to extend or lend that money to those cities or towns \nor jurisdictions without our authorization.\n  The legislation that is before us today would authorize the movement \nof about $750 million from FEMA to be able to lend that money to some \nof these cities, towns, parishes, and jurisdictions so that hospitals \ncan be helped and police, fire services, and other services can be \nextended even though the revenue base has dried up under all of this \nwater.\n  Historically, when FEMA has been given the authority to extend this \nmoney, to lend money to other communities, other cities, other States, \nthe loans have in some cases been forgiven. It did not require an act \nof Congress to do that. It did not require any particular action by OMB \nor certification by OMB to do that. It occurred under the law. The \nloans were forgiven.\n  Senator Levin mentioned earlier that a number of jurisdictions, a \nnumber of local government borrowers borrowed money extended through \nFEMA to help these communities in their most tough times, in Idaho, in \nWest Virginia, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Arizona, and others. They did not \nhave to come and ask for an act of Congress to get that forgiveness. \nThey didn't have to go to OMB and say please forgive this loan. The \nloans were forgiven.\n  Senator Clinton spoke a bit earlier as well and talked about the \ngenerous assistance that the taxpayers of this country provided to New \nYork City on the heels of 9/11. Mr. President, $20 billion was the \namount of money, almost a direct infusion. I thought it was loan. For \nall these years I thought it was a loan that was forgiven. I was wrong. \nIt was a grant--just a gift to the people of New York as they struggled \nto recover from their tragedy.\n  The tragedy that has fallen on the folks along the gulf coast is \nevery bit as bad for a lot of them as what happened in New York on 9/\n11. Yet we are not prepared to provide a grant to those communities, \nthose cities, so they can provide essential services. Frankly, none of \nus are calling for doing that.\n  FEMA has all this money we provided them. Absent some legislation \ntoday, they are not able to extend any of that money to help these \ncommunities and cities. The legislation is designed to say we are going \nto allow FEMA to extend those loans.\n  But unlike the way we treated New York, which got a grant, not a \nloan, and unlike the loans that were extended to all the communities \nlisted on this sheet of paper whose loans were forgiven and did not \neven require our action or OMB's forgiveness, we say with respect to \nthe folks on the gulf coast: We are not going to forgive your loan.\n  Carl Levin--Senator Levin--and I spent a good deal of time last night \ntrying to put together a compromise. I appreciate very much the \ncooperation of Senator Landrieu to help find that compromise and \nSenator Vitter and certainly Senator Frist. Senator Levin and I, at the \nmidnight hour last night, were down in the House and found Congressman \nLewis, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and said to him: \nWhat if we provide a change in language in this bill so, in order to \nforgive a loan that FEMA would make under the authorization of this \nbill, it would require an act of Congress? The Senate and House and \nPresident would have to concur in that forgiveness.\n  He said he thought that was a reasonable idea and thought even the \nHouse might go along with that.\n  I am disappointed to hear this morning that is not going to happen. \nSenator Frist, last night in conversation after midnight with Senator \nLevin and me, said he thought that was a reasonable idea. He couldn't \ncommit himself to make it happen, but he thought that was a reasonable \napproach, and, frankly, I do, too. For the life of me, I do not see why \nthat is not acceptable.\n  If we were to include language--and we are not going to get the \nchance do this because Senator Levin's amendment is not going to be \nmade in order, but if we were to include language that said an act of \nCongress was required in order to forgive loans made by FEMA to these \njurisdictions in their hour of need, that is a very high standard. It \nis a standard we never set for these communities. It is a standard we \nnever set for New York.\n  The greatest irony to me is, going back, we didn't require an act of \nCongress or intervention of OMB to enable the forgiveness of these \nloans. Going forward, as I read the legislation--going forward, if you \nare from Delaware or from Michigan or if you are from Georgia and your \ncommunities seek a loan from FEMA in a similar situation, an emergency, \nmoneys that have been authorized and appropriated, you don't have to \nget an act of Congress to have that loan forgiven. You don't have to \nget any special approval from OMB so the loan can be forgiven. It can \nbe forgiven.\n  Yet in this case, with respect to the Gulf Coast States, we do not \nallow that to happen. Going back in time and going forward in time it \nlooks to me as if we protect the rest of us. We allow for the loans to \nbe forgiven for the other 49 States or 48 States. But not in this case. \nThat does not make sense. That does not make sense.\n  As we move to pass the legislation, I echo what some of my other \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\nhave said. We can do better. When we have an opportunity to return, in \na week or so, my earnest hope is that we will do better.\n  In closing, I say to my friend and colleague, Senator Landrieu, it \nhas been an honor to stand by her side in this struggle. The people of \nLouisiana are fortunate to have Senators with that kind of passion and \ncare for them. I hope, as we go forward working with Senator Vitter, we \ncan get to an outcome that is fair to the people you represent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank, so much, the Senator from \nDelaware who, before he was a Senator--because he wasn't born one \neither--was a Governor of Delaware. Before he was Governor, he was a \nhusband and a father, which he still is. I know he does a magnificent \njob at family and in the Senate because I have seen him here at late \nhours.\n  Last night this Senator from Delaware, who does not, obviously, have \na dog in this hunt, stood through the night and negotiated with myself \nand with my colleague from Louisiana, with Senator Frist, with Senator \nReid, and we negotiated and offered one compromise after another in \nmeetings, on the telephone, on the floor, when we could speak--because \nspeech was limited last night. Despite the notion that is out there \nthat Senators can speak any time they want, the rules of the Senate \nactually prevent Senators from speaking. So I was not able to speak as \nmuch as I would have liked through the night last night. When I was not \nable to speak on the floor, we were in meetings, in phone calls, \nspeaking with the White House and the House leadership and Republican \ncolleagues and Democratic colleagues, trying to work through this \nsituation.\n  We put our best efforts forward. We are now down to this time, which \nis basically the end of this debate, having passed a bill by Senator \nVitter and Senator Frist that will basically allow us to have the loans \nwe seek, loans that are so necessary, but a bill that forces us to take \nit in a discriminatory fashion.\n  I believe this Senator has shown, on many occasions, a willingness to \ncompromise and to work through difficult situations. I helped negotiate \nNo Child Left Behind on this floor, one of the premier centerpieces of \nthe current President's administration, of his agenda, even when half \nof my caucus was opposed--not sort of opposed but very opposed. But I \nknew what was best for Louisiana was to move forward because we had \nalready gone down the road of accountability. It was showing some \nresults. The children in my State were learning. The gap between the \nrich and the poor was closing, not because the rich were coming down \nbut because the poor were coming up.\n  White children and Black children, who had been by law separated for \nover 150 years in schools, were then thrust together in the 1960s and \n1970s. I believed that law, and I still believe this law, could help \nlift those who had limited opportunities. I have worked with Senators \non both sides of the aisle, for the 8 years that I have been here, to \ntry to craft and negotiate some of the toughest legislation the Senate \nhas seen--compromise on missile defense, compromise on Corps of \nEngineers to move a WRDA bill. I worked for 10 years to compromise the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act where 4,500 organizations in this \ncountry, from the most liberal to the most conservative, came together \none time on one bill to provide coastal money for all the communities \nin the Nation: 10 years of meetings, 10 years of phone calls, 10 years \nof speeches, 10 years of pleas, 10 years of press conferences, 10 years \nof alliance building, only to get down to the last minute some years \nago to be told, with 72 signatures on that bill at the last minute, 5 \nyears ago: Senator, we cannot bring your bill up, there is an election \naround the corner and it may have repercussions for one or two people \nhere. We can't do it.\n  You could have taken a knife and stabbed it in my heart, but I stood \nthere and took it, not because it was me but because the people I \nrepresent I knew were getting a bad deal. But in my heart I knew that I \nand our delegation had literally done everything we could possibly do. \nWhen it came to the end, the death was quick.\n  When I got back in the next session, after my State had been stabbed \nin the heart and left for dead--which we have died, through this \nhurricane--I started putting yet another bill together because there is \nnothing wrong with me that I don't know how to work through difficult \nsituations. My family has been doing it a very long time.\n  I thank Senator Clinton for her remarks. She obviously understands \nwhat the people of New York went through. I also thank Senator Schumer. \nAlthough he was not here in person, he was here in spirit. He and \nSenator Clinton stood by the Republican mayor at the time, Rudy \nGiuliani, lifted him up and helped him. No second-guessing; they helped \nhim and they lifted the city up.\n  I thank Senator Jeffords, who has been a champion. He stood at the \nLeeville Bridge with me. I have been on so many trips down to Louisiana \nI lose count, but one of them I remember very well. Senator Jeffords \ncame down with me, so far to the bottom of Louisiana if he had taken \none more step he would have been in the Gulf of Mexico. There is not \nmuch down there--no big cities, no big money, no big press conferences. \nThere is hardly a camera at the end of LA-1, at Port Fourchon, but \nSenator Jeffords went. He stood there, and while I was explaining to \nhim the difficulty of getting people out in an evacuation for a \nhurricane on a highway that goes underwater when there is rain, let \nalone when a category 5 hurricane comes bearing down on you--he stood \nthere on the bridge with me and at the moment--if I could have scripted \nit myself I could not have done it any better, and people who were not \nthere are not going to believe what I am going to say but I have a lot \nof witnesses--at the very moment I was pointing to the Leeville Bridge, \na shrimp trawler came in, lifted their nets up as they do--they look \nlike butterflies out on the gulf--they lifted their nets up and ran \ninto the bridge, with Senator Jeffords on it, and shook the bridge and \nshut it down like that.\n  The words had just come out of my mouth: Senator Jeffords, not only \nis the road a problem but when the hurricane comes, if this bridge \nshuts down, there is no way out. And the shrimp trawler hit the bridge.\n  He said to me, laughing with his good sense of humor: Senator, don't \nyou think you went a little too far to make your point?\n  And we had a big laugh about it, not that I laughed about the shrimp \ntrawler, but we literally cannot believe that and have talked about it \nfor 3 years.\n  Our strength is found at home in our neighborhoods, in our churches, \non corners, in our workplaces, and in our places of worship. Right here \nis where our strength is found--not in anyplace overseas, right here at \nhome.\n  I am going to wrap up by showing you pictures of the homes to make my \npoint. This is our home on the gulf coast. After the photographer took \nthis picture, the commentary in the National Geographic magazine was \nsomething like: It looks like a weapon of mass destruction went off on \nthe gulf coast. This is exactly what would happen if a weapon of mass \ndestruction would go off, except you wouldn't have the trees and maybe \nthe beach would be a little disheveled. That is what it looks like. It \nwas a storm of massive destruction.\n  Our strength begins at home.\n  The underlying bill is sending $415 billion overseas. We ask for a \nloan program of $1 billion already allocated under the same terms and \nconditions that everyone in America has received. And we are told no. \nIt was too much to do.\n  I am going to close with this.\n  This is a picture of New Orleans. It doesn't look like this today \nbecause all the water has gone down. But when people say, Why can't you \nbe a little bit more self-reliant, I am not sure any city in America \ncould stand itself up by itself with no loans, no grants, with the \npolice force being laid off, a fire department being laid off, city \nworkers being laid off, an electric company taking bankruptcy, no water \nin the pipes. And when we come to ask for a loan, we are told: Sorry, \nthere is no money in the Treasury. We have made other arrangements for \nthe taxes that you have paid over the last 300 years.\n  Let me submit for the Record a letter from the U.S. Conference of \nMayors\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\nwhich they sent to this Senate.

These local personnel are truly \n     national assets in the recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and \n     Rita, and these cities must not be allowed to go bankrupt. \n     Without a functioning local government, the private sector \n     will be stymied in efforts to invest in the reconstruction \n     effort, and it will be impossible for volunteer relief \n     efforts to be coordinated and to function.\n       If you would like to discuss this further, please contact \n     our Chief of Staff Ed Somers at (202) 861-6706 or \n     esomers@usmayors.org.\n       We look forward to working with you in the coming days, as \n     together we strengthen the intergovernmental partnership \n     needed to make sure our cities are safe and our nation \n     prospers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Beverly O'Neill,\n                                   Mayor of Long Beach, President.\n                                                      Tom Cochran,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have shown all the pictures I can show \nfor the week. I have done all the talking I can do for today. But I can \npromise you this. This talking will continue and these meetings will \ncontinue and this debate will continue. It is not going away.\n  The leadership of the House of Representatives needs to be put on \nnotice that this debate is going to go on for a very long time, until \nwe get relief, recovery, respect, and the dignity that we deserve as \nAmerican citizens from Louisiana to Texas to Alabama to Mississippi and \nthe people whom we represent, Black and White, rich and poor, young and \nold, small and large businesses alike, and our faith-based community, \nget the respect it deserves from the floor of this Senate and the \nCongress of the United States, and gets the help it needs to get \nthrough and rebuild.\n  I assure you that we will rebuild this coast. We will rebuild the \ngulf coast. It was paid for by a great President, President Jefferson, \nat 3 cents an acre in 1803 where he borrowed money. He knew what he was \nborrowing money for. He had a good reason to borrow it, and he bought \nthe Louisiana Purchase. Andrew Jackson came and defended it. His statue \nnever went underwater.\n  We will rebuild this region all through the gulf coast and into \nLouisiana--the ports, the energy infrastructure, turn our lights on \nagain, and keep the lights on all over America, to try to keep people's \nbills as low as we can and keep their heat on this winter, which is \napproaching. Even if you do not give us one penny, even if you do not \nlend us money, we have been self-reliant for over 300 or more years. \nThe people here are pretty tough and it takes a lot more than this to \nbeat our spirit.\n  The bill is gone. It is the best we could do. It is not the best we \ncould have done, but it is what we have. We will live with it, but we \nwill not stop this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11285-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11285-S11287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATURAL GAS CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this week, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nAkaka and I returned from Baton Rogue.\n  We went down to see and learn firsthand about Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita damage to the energy infrastructure. There is a great deal of work \nto be done, and there is a great deal of courage and confidence that it \ncan be done. We need to find ways to make that recovery go right.\n  Yesterday, my committee held a hearing where we heard from energy \nindustry witnesses who have been impacted by the hurricanes. The main \nmessage of that hearing was we are in troubled energy times, \nparticularly on the natural gas front. The CEO of DOW Chemical Company \npainted a very bleak picture for American industry.\n  Our industries that rely on natural gas both as a fuel and a \nfeedstock have hard choices before them about how and where they will \nbase their operations. In the U.S., natural gas prices are close to \n$14. In China, it is less than $5. In Saudi Arabia, it is about $1. If \nwe translated gasoline prices to the level of increases faced by \nnatural gas--we would be seeing $7-a-gallon gasoline at the pump right \nnow.\n  At DOW's St. Charles petrochemical complex that I saw in Baton Rogue, \nI learned that every $1 increase in the cost of natural gas means an \nadditional $35 million a year in fuel costs for that single facility. \nOur manufacturers have to compete in global markets. At those prices, \nthey can't.\n  The energy bill we just passed took some good steps forward to \naddress these challenges but did not secure more natural gas supply \nthat we have available right here at home.\n  In the area on the Outer Continental Shelf known as the nonleased \nportions of Lease Sale 181 which is not under moratorium, but which we \nare not allowing leasing, there is approximately 7.2 trillion cubic \nfeet of gas. In the areas more than 100 miles from any state coastline, \n2 resources are estimated to be approximately 6 trillion cubic feet of \ngas.\n  This area can be leased administratively, without any legislative \naction. At our committee hearing and during yesterday's press \nconference I urged the administration to reconsider this policy in \nlight of our Nation's natural gas crisis, which has seen a 121-percent \nprice increase in just 1 year.\n  I will continue to work to cure more domestic energy supplies, but in \nthe short term all the witnesses the committee heard from yesterday \nsaid conservation is the most effective tool we can use to deal with \nthe present crisis.\n  If every American turns down their thermostat just 2 degrees this \nwinter, it could free up 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day.\n  According to the DOW witness yesterday, that kind of conservation \nwould be equal to having 3 LNG terminals. In addition, we need to focus \nour efforts on organizing the recovery on the energy infrastructure, \nour witnesses all stressed the need to give priority to restoration of \nnatural gas processing plants.\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\n  The Congress and the administration must provide the leadership to \nmake this recovery move quickly and smartly.\n  Our witnesses all emphasized that we are in an energy crisis.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, the country is facing an enormous \nproblem. I might even say, without reluctance, that it is a crisis. \nPeople might say: Well, Senator, you are talking about Katrina, Rita. \nNo. Katrina and Rita have pointed out to us a crisis well beyond those \ntwo hurricanes, and that is that we have a very significant shortfall \nin the natural gas that is needed to run our businesses and to use for \nour people during this ensuing winter. If something is not done, it \nmight be for a very long period of time.\n  Now, it sounds almost impossible, if not incredible, that I would be \nhere on the floor saying this when just 4 or 5 years ago, those who \nwere in the business of producing natural gas and those who knew about \nAmerica's energy situation were saying: There is plenty of natural gas. \nDon't worry about that marvelous product.\n  So what we have done in the last 15 years is to say, since we don't \nknow how to clean up coal sufficient to meet our standards and because \nwe worry about global warming, we will not build any new coal-burning \npowerplants.\n  We have not built a nuclear powerplant in over 20 years. So for the \nlast 15 years, at least 13 years, every new powerplant--that is these \nbig monster powerplants that generate electricity, 500 megawatts, 1,000 \nmegawatts--is fueled by natural gas. Then the people of our country \nhave found this is a marvelous fuel for our kitchens, for houses, so \nmore and more people are using natural gas for our way of life, our \ngreat standard of living. But what isn't understood is that natural gas \nis such a great product that when you change its chemical makeup, you \nuse it for a lot of things. The entire fertilizer industry of America \nis based upon natural gas as one of the components. People don't know \nthe entire chemical and plastic industry is built around and predicated \nand dependent upon natural gas. That means not only is it imperative \nthat we have it, but I am here today to suggest it is also imperative \nthat it not be so high priced that it puts our businesses out of \nbusiness.\n  I had the luxury, as a Senator, to go down and see the aftermath of \nKatrina and Rita with my colleagues Senator Bingaman and Senator Akaka \nof Hawaii. We looked at the damage and the energy infrastructure of all \ntypes that were destroyed or put out of business. They are going to \nhave an immediate impact because supply has been interrupted, both in \nthe generation of electricity and in putting natural gas into pipelines \nto deliver it to the United States and to deliver it to our numerous \npetrochemical plants, plastics plants, and other things. Also the \nfeedstock, you convert things from natural gas, you convert it into the \nbasic things that are used as feedstock for these industries. We are \ngoing to be in short supply in the short term because supply has been \ninterrupted and the capacity to deliver has been interrupted. Those are \ngoing to get fixed in due course, but in the meantime, we have \ndramatically used down our reserves, because they are there to pick up \nwhen we don't have natural supply coming. The offshore wells aren't \nproducing, so you have reserves to take their place. But the reserves \nare being depleted, so we are going to have much less reserve capacity \nwhich means we may have interim difficulties.\n  But what has happened is, all of this has pushed the price of natural \ngas up. Believe it or not, at the beginning of this week, the bid price \nwas $14, where just a few years ago it was $2, and 10 days ago it was \n$7. Understand that it doesn't sound like much if you are talking about \n2 cents or 7 cents. There isn't much difference between that 14 cents. \nThat is just a little change.\n  Here is the problem: We had a hearing in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. I must say, as chairman of that committee, it \nlasted 2\\1/2\\ hours. It was probably as informative a hearing as I have \never presided over. Eight Senators participated. They stayed there and \nlistened to five people talk about the crisis America has with \nreference to natural gas, not only because of the aftermath of Katrina \nand Rita, but because we are using so much natural gas and we don't \nhave enough production to meet the need.\n  We can't sit around and listen to people who say: We don't need any \nmore supply. That is these old industry companies that want to scare \nus, and they don't need more supply.\n  We need more supply. It is imperative that we find more natural gas \nsome way. I will quickly tell you the little bit we can do in that \nregard. I will acknowledge this hearing was attended by witnesses \nrepresenting the entire industry of oil and gas, a leading \nenvironmentalist, three other people who know the problems of Katrina \nvery well, and they were in harmony that we must conserve. So I don't \nwant anybody to think conservation isn't a very important part of this \nproblem I am telling you about, this pending crisis of the rising cost \nof natural gas and the shortages that might occur. Every chance I get \nand by every means available, I am going to try to remind the Senate \nand anybody who will listen that we must understand this fantastic \ncommodity called natural gas is not abundant in the United States. The \nprice is going to go through the roof if something isn't done.\n\n  I don't have an answer right now. I am working at it, but I don't \nhave an answer. I want everybody to know, so they are not surprised, \nthat we understand anything that can be done should be done because the \ncrisis is imminent. If the price stays at $14, the crisis is imminent.\n  Let me tell you how important it is. One of the largest employers in \nAmerica of high-paying, skilled, professionally trained jobs is the \npetrochemical industry, the chemical industry, Dow Chemical, a huge \nplant down there in the middle of Katrina. We went to see it. I won't \ntalk today about the heroics of trying to bring it back and save it and \nsave their people. That is another story. But yesterday the president \nand chief operating officer of that great company came to our \ncommittee. He is reported in the morning's Washington Post in the \nbusiness section with a detailed story about this crisis I am talking \nabout. This gentleman, Andrew Liveris, is a terrific executive. He gave \nus a very simple example which I want everybody to listen to. At this \nplant are 3,500 professionally trained, skilled Americans with terrific \njobs. How good? The average is $70,000 plus great benefits for each and \nevery person there. They produce huge things. They gave us a little box \nof them. They produce all kinds of plastics, things you could never \nimagine that they produce and sell. The principal ingredient in making \ntheir product is natural gas.\n  Without natural gas, all those workers can go home. They can go home \nand say goodbye because they can't operate, not only without natural \ngas, but if natural gas gets too high, petrochemical plants can be \nlocated anywhere. They are not inherent to a piece of geography in the \nUnited States. They are being sought after by everyone in the world. \nThat CEO told us on the record: When I leave you, tomorrow I am going \nto China. You can't tell him: Don't go to China. China wants to build a \npetrochemical industry. They think the greatest in the world is this \none. Do you think he is going over there to have a birthday party? He \nis going over there to talk business.\n  This is not a question of cheap labor. It is a question of natural \ngas prices. You understand, there may be natural gas in China for $1. \nHe is now going to have to pay, if this price stays where it was bid \nMonday, $14. Do you think he will stay here? He can't stay here, not \nonly because he wants to go somewhere, he will go out of business here. \nThese are the numbers. Already 100,000 American jobs are gone, because \n100,000 jobs were for their export business. They can't export because \nthey are totally out of competition. The price is too high because of \nnatural gas. So that part of American employment is gone. But now there \nare almost 800,000 additional Americans. How many jobs can we lose and \nsay it doesn't matter?\n  It was suggested by this gentleman, who had a terrific analytical \nability--he told us how all this works--if the price of natural gas \ncontinues as we are talking about, 800,000-plus jobs will go. They will \nnot be able to stay open.\n  Add to that the fact that everybody must understand you don't see \nnatural gas on a gasoline pump. You don't see day by day the price \ngoing up. When\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\nyou see gasoline go from $2 to $2.50, $2.80, $3, you say: Something is \ngoing wrong. The increase in natural gas price from where it was a year \nago to where it was Monday of this week, if you transfer that into \ngasoline prices, gasoline would be priced at $7 a gallon. Think of what \nwould happen to the American economy and to everyday people if gasoline \nwere $7. Everybody who uses natural gas, in particular the industries \nthat use it, are suffering from that kind of an increase. Two years ago \ngasoline was at $1.69. What if it went to 7? That is what has happened \nto natural gas.\n  I am going to include in the Record a statement that gives further \ndetails about this problem. But I suggest that we must come to grips \nwith the conservation. We are going to put some ideas together.\n  Let me say, if the American people this winter were to reduce their \nthermostats by 2 degrees, do you think it would be hard on everybody? I \nmean just imagine, unless somebody is sick and the doctor prescribes \nit, it would be an enormous savings of natural gas for the United \nStates and for this pipeline to deliver natural gas. Do you know the \npipelines that come out of Louisiana down there in that gulf, these two \ngiant pipelines go all the way from Louisiana up into the United \nStates, with legs off in Ohio, all the way to New York, delivering \nnatural gas from that area so loaded with hydrocarbons? They put them \nin these pipes and have generating pusher stations all the way up into \nAmerica and deliver it.\n  If we conserve the way I have described and other ways, which we are \ncoming to grips with, it will make a big impact on how much those \npipelines have to deliver to meet the demand. We have to find a way to \ndo the best we can by American industry or they are going to close. And \nwhile we have some natural gas to heat our houses, we will be without \njobs for the people who live in those houses.\n  The one thing they all suggested, when they were sitting around that \ntable talking to us, was: There is one major source of natural gas that \nis American that we ought to get. I must say to those States who are \ncoastal States, they must understand they are Americans first and \ncoastal States second. The largest supply of American natural gas is \noff the coasts of our country. No doubt about it. The United States \ncannot sit by with the technology we have developed--we can go way \noffshore so that you cannot even see them. So those States that are \nworried about their visibility, if they are worried about oil spills, \nthere are no oil spills from those platforms that drill.\n\n  Do you know that during the time we had this crisis not one major \noilspill occurred. Those giant platforms with 20 wells drilled \nunderground, with drilling that goes parallel and with one that was \nturned upside down, the oil did not come out. So nobody has to worry \nabout that. We can handle that. That is where the natural gas is.\n  I close by saying that we have been told by the experts that the best \nway to reduce this crisis would be to have an immediate supply of \nnatural gas. That is not possible. We are going to have to open a \nsubstantial number of liquefied natural gas platforms or ports around \nour country. And where they are being delayed, we have tried to solve \nthat in our Energy bill. We are going to push those local governments \nto quit the delay for delay sake and get on with letting us put some of \nthose in so natural gas can come from foreign countries, which I hate \nto say, but at least we can look at it and expect it.\n  In the meantime, it is said that if we were to say to those who pay \nfor natural gas that we are opening parts of the Outer Continental \nShelf, just the section 181 off the coast of Florida and Alabama, which \nI say now to the President of the United States, Mr. President, you \nought to sit down and figure out a way through your Executive order, \nthrough your pen, to open section 181, or portions of it, off the coast \nof Alabama and Florida. Do it, Mr. President. It might take a couple \nyears to produce. It is ready, so it will be very quick.\n  We are told that the mere fact that the market understands that is \nready, that huge entrance of natural gas into the areas for delivery, \nthe pipeline system, that it will reduce the pressure on the cost of \nnatural gas. I think the occupant of the Chair can understand that. The \nmarketplace will say: Oh, it is not going to continue in this crisis \nstate because here comes this huge natural gas that is now released and \nis ready to come. We must do that. Until it is done, at least this \nSenator--I have to worry about my State, but I am also a Senator for \nAmerica, and I am not going to let up until that is done.\n  Secondly, the States in this country that refuse to recognize that we \ncan drill off their shores on land that is owned by the Federal \nGovernment--it is not their land; they only have a few miles, and then \nit belongs to Americans--you can drill way out there, do no harm, and \nbring gas into this country to get us through the next 10 or 12 years \nwhile other sources of energy that are clean, such as nuclear and very \nclean coal, come on to keep America alive.\n  The next thing we are going to do is to find out how we can pass \nlegislation to get those other coastal States in the position where \nthey are either willing to accommodate this in exchange for us giving \nthem substantially more royalties, or we are just going to have to bite \nthe bullet.\n  It is going to come down here, and the people are going to have to \nsay no, or filibuster, but they are going to have to know what they are \ndoing. They are adding to the crisis status of our country and job \nmarket and to one of the few major industries that is left in this \ncountry that we are great at. We are not going to be there very long. \nChina is going to catch up, and then it is not going to be cheap labor. \nIt is going to be high technology and national gas. India is doing the \nsame.\n  I was at an event last night. We used to say how powerful we were. We \nknow where it is; it is in India. Reliance Energy has the largest \nrefinery of crude oil to refine into gasoline-related products. We sit \nhere thinking we are the leaders of the world in everything. We have \nbeen sitting somewhere for a long time. I hate to say on what. But we \nsurely have not been doing anything. If anything, we have been going \nbackwards. There have been no new refineries in the United States for \nmore than two decades. That is almost incredible.\n  I thank the Senate for listening. I will say again, this is probably \nthe most significant event confronting us. I regret to say there are no \neasy answers. If there were, we would have done it, but we finally have \ncome to the understanding that it is major, it is big, it is serious.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11287-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11287-S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss the fiscal \nyear 2006 Homeland Security appropriations conference report. The \nSenate passed this measure earlier today by a voice vote. Frankly, I \nwould have liked to have had a recorded vote on this measure. If a \nrecorded vote had been ordered, I would have expressed my opposition to \nthis conference report.\n  Nevertheless, I would like to begin by recognizing that the authors \nof this conference report, Senator Gregg and Senator Byrd, do a \ntremendous job each year. I have served in the Senate long enough to \nknow how hard it is to pull these types of appropriations bills \ntogether. I also acknowledge the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Cochran. It is no easy task to write and manage a \nbill that provides for our domestic security needs. I further commend \nall of our colleagues and their staffs on the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee for the hard work they have put into this \nlegislation.\n  However, I feel compelled, notwithstanding these efforts, to express \nmy disappointment over the adoption of this conference report. I have \nvery deep\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\nconcerns about how this measure funds our country's vital homeland \nsecurity activities.\n  In many crucial respects, I believe this conference report continues \na pattern of failure on the part of the administration and the \nleadership of our Congress to address the acute and ongoing needs of \nour Nation's homeland security infrastructure.\n  Allow me to read a letter I received 3 days ago from the Republican \nGovernor of my State, a good friend and someone with whom I work all \nthe time. I think it is important to hear--even after we adopted this \nmeasure--from a Governor of a State that is grappling with providing \nthe necessary security to protect its citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. The Governor says:\n\n       . . . [I]n a time when the threat of terrorism remains \n     elevated and natural disasters such as the recent hurricanes \n     have reminded us all of the staggering power of nature, [the \n     cuts in this bill] simply [defy] rational explanation.\n       The conference report inexplicably contains cuts that \n     exceed those in the original House or Senate bills or the \n     President's proposed budget. Funding for the State Homeland \n     Security Grant program is halved, from $1.1 billion to $550 \n     million, while funding for the Urban Area Security Initiative \n     is reduced from $885 million to $765 million. Those programs, \n     along with the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, \n     have accounted for the bulk of [homeland security] funding \n     that our state has received.\n       Of the money available for the State Homeland Security \n     Grant program, states will receive a mere 0.75 percent in \n     guaranteed funding. The balance is to be distributed by the \n     Department of Homeland Security based on risk, though how--or \n     when--that assessment is to be made is not clear.\n       Under the conference report, guaranteed funding for \n     Connecticut in fiscal year 2006 would amount to barely $7.13 \n     million. This is down by two-thirds from the $21 million in \n     fiscal year 2005--itself a reduction from the $46 million in \n     2004.\n\n  My Governor concludes her letter by saying:\n\n       The funding contained within the conference report is \n     utterly insufficient to support the actions needed to protect \n     the people of our State, to say nothing of the millions of \n     travelers and tons of truck, train and barge cargo that pass \n     through Connecticut every year.\n\n  In an age when terrorism continues to be a threat to our country, one \nwould think that the Congress of the United States would be doing \neverything it could to shore up our domestic security, to make it as \nimpregnable as possible against those who would do us harm. Yet when we \nlook at this conference report, I do not believe it does enough to \nprotect our people from terrorism. We are simply not investing in the \nresources required to make this Nation as safe as possible.\n  Instead of filling in the cracks that continue to exist within our \nhomeland security foundation, we are letting those cracks grow.\n  I was particularly disturbed to see that the FIRE and SAFER grant \nprograms--vital firefighting assistance initiatives that I was pleased \nto author with Senators DeWine, Warner, and Levin--was cut by $60 \nmillion over fiscal year 2005 levels. As the Governor of my State says, \nfunding cuts of this nature defy rationality when one considers the \ndevastation recently wrought by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the \nunprecedented burdens placed on emergency first responders who are on \nthe domestic frontlines in the fight against terrorism.\n  For the past 3 years, I have come to the floor and offered \nlegislation that would implement the recommendations made by the Rudman \nCommission.\n  As we all know, our former colleague Warren Rudman, a former \nRepublican Senator from New Hampshire, chaired a blue ribbon commission \nsponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations that included George \nSchultz, William Webster, Harold Varmus and other distinguished \nAmericans.\n  The Rudman Commission concluded that our country's homeland security \ninfrastructure was ``drastically underfunded'' and that our Nation was \n``dangerously unprepared'' to respond effectively to a terrorist \nattack.\n  The Commission recommended that our Nation invest no less than $20 \nbillion a year for 5 years to take the minimum steps necessary to \nprotect all Americans from natural and manmade threats. Regrettably, \nthis conference report neglected to implement the recommendations of \nthe Rudman Commission, providing only $3.4 billion of the $20 billion \nthat the Commission identified as essential each and every year for 5 \nyears.\n  I would point out that in the last 3 years I have offered an \namendment on the Rudman Commission report, it has been regrettably \ndefeated.\n  In March of 2004, we watched the train system in Madrid, Spain, \nattacked by terrorists with nearly 200 dead. Earlier this year, we \nwatched the London Underground and the double-decker buses attacked by \nterrorists, with dozens who were killed. Yesterday, the New York City \nsubway system was placed on high alert. Yet in response to this clear \nand present danger to our Nation's largest transit system, the \nadministration today and the leadership of both the House and the \nSenate have, in effect, cut funding for transit security in this bill, \nproviding funding levels that do not keep pace with expected inflation.\n  There is an added irony to all of this. At a time when we are dealing \nwith record high gas prices and the administration is encouraging \nAmericans to conserve energy by taking public transportation when and \nwhere they can, it is actually doing less than it did last year to \nensure that our public transit systems are as safe as possible.\n  What more is it going to take before the administration and the \nleadership of this body realize that we are not investing nearly enough \nin our homeland security infrastructure and our emergency first \nresponders?\n  When it comes to meeting the security needs of our country, this \nadministration and leadership in Congress are pursuing a policy that, \nat best, in my view, can be called benign neglect. That has become \npainfully apparent in light of the inadequate response to meeting the \nneeds and mitigating the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people \nalong the Gulf Coast. And it has been reinforced by this conference \nreport's failure to make essential investments to keep all Americans \nsafe from the risk of terrorism.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                             State of Connecticut,\n\n\n                                           Executive Chambers,\n\n                                    Hartford, CT, October 4, 2005.\n       Hon. Christopher J. Dodd, Joseph I. Lieberman, John B. \n     Larson, Robert R. Simmons, Rosa DeLauro, Christopher Shays, \n     Nancy L. Johnson\n       Dear Connecticut Congressional Delegation: I have reviewed \n     the Conference Report on H.R. 2360, the Department of \n     Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2006, and I am deeply \n     disturbed by the woefully inadequate funding the bill would \n     provide to Connecticut.\n       Under the Conference Report, guaranteed funding for \n     Connecticut in Fiscal Year 2006 would amount to barely $7.13 \n     million. This is down by two-thirds from some $21 million in \n     FY2005--itself a reduction from nearly $46 million in FY2004.\n       This is incredibly unfair to Connecticut and, in a time \n     when the threat of terrorism remains elevated and natural \n     disasters such as the recent hurricanes have reminded us all \n     of the staggering power of nature, simply defies rational \n     explanation.\n       The threats have not abated. Nature has not gone away. The \n     need for equitable and sensible funding has not ended.\n       The Conference Report inexplicably contains cuts that \n     exceed those in the original House or Senate bills or the \n     President's proposed budget. Funding for the State \n     Homeland Security Grant (SHSG) program is halved, from \n     $1.1 billion to $550 million, while funding for the Urban \n     Areas Security Initiative (UASI) was reduced from $885 \n     million to $765 million. Those programs, along with the \n     Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP), have \n     accounted for the bulk of funding our state has received.\n       Of the money available for the SHSG program, states will \n     receive a mere 0.75 percent in guaranteed funding. The \n     balance is to be distributed by the Department of Homeland \n     Security based on risk, though how--or when--that assessment \n     is to be made is not clear.\n       In essence, the Conference Report reduces the vast majority \n     of homeland security funding to a lobbying contest. States \n     that are most successful in making their case before the \n     Department of Homeland Security will get the bulk of the \n     funding. Those that are not--will not.\n       This is unfortunate, to say the least. In previous years, \n     after guaranteed SHSG and LETPP funding was distributed the \n     remainder was apportioned on the basis of population. None of \n     the UASI funding is guaranteed to states, and you will recall \n     that despite the obvious need--the FY2004 grant for New Haven \n     Harbor was not renewed in FY2005.\n       On September 11, 2001, America was awakened to the need for \n     vigilance against security threats as well as natural \n     disasters.\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\n     Connecticut, as you know, contains a number of major \n     highways, a nuclear power facility, ports that are home to a \n     regional depot for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \n     shipyards, cargo operations and passenger and auto ferries.\n       The funding contained within the Conference Report is \n     utterly insufficient to support the actions needed to protect \n     the people of our state, to say nothing of the millions of \n     travelers and tons of truck, train and barge cargo that pass \n     through Connecticut every year.\n       I am urging you to seek an increase in the funding for \n     Connecticut.

Mr. President, I will not take as much time as others have, \nbut I would like to commend my colleague from Louisiana, Senator \nLandrieu, for her Herculean efforts over the last couple of days to try \nand convince this body to do everything it can to provide the needed \nrelief for thousands of displaced individuals along the Gulf Coast, \nincluding, obviously, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and parts of \nTexas.\n  I am really stunned, in a sense, by the response we are providing to \nthis situation so far.\n  On average we provide $5 billion a week to fund our ongoing efforts \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. Obviously, this funding is critical to protect \nour troops and the work they continue to undertake overseas. When the \nPresident has been asked how he plans to pay for these ongoing efforts, \nhe says that he plans to pay for them using additional Federal \nresources that are not taken out of other Federal spending priorities.\n  And yet when it comes to providing the necessary relief to our own \ncitizens in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas, we are being \ntold by the President that we absolutely have to use existing Federal \nresources to pay for recovery and relief efforts. We are being told \nthat Federal resources cannot be provided unless we reduce other \nFederal spending priorities.\n  I can understand the frustration of the Senator from Louisiana. She \ngoes every week to community after community in her State and still \nsees the horrible circumstances under which thousands of people are \nliving. Meanwhile, the Senate is about to take another week off. As \nliterally hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens are suffering, \nwe are leaving town instead of working together to provide adequate \nlong-term disaster assistance in areas such as public health, \neducation, housing, transportation and homeland security.\n  The Senator from Louisiana took the floor over an extended period of \ntime to talk about the importance of providing this relief: to care for \nthe thousands of displaced children, to assist people who lost their \nhomes, their businesses, their very livelihoods. Nevertheless, we are \ntold by this administration and the leadership in Congress that no \nadequate assistance can be provided unless we cut vital spending \nelsewhere.\n  If we do not have to find offsets for rebuilding Iraq and \nAfghanistan, then why do we have to find offsets to rebuild the Gulf \nCoast--our own soil? If this catastrophe were to happen in my State of \nConnecticut or anywhere else, we would all appreciate what our \ncolleague from Louisiana has gone through and express our frustrations \nin the same way she has.\n  So I join with Senator Landrieu and others who have already spoken. I \nam also waiting to hear about what offsets we are going to be forced to \ncome up with to pay for the recovery and relief efforts along the Gulf \nCoast. They will most certainly come from domestic investments such as \nMedicaid that aid the poor, not from repealing the estate tax or other \ntax cuts that have aided only the wealthiest of Americans.\n  I imagine that we will cut spending to services provided under \nMedicare and Medicaid--services that provide basic health care coverage \nto the poorest of our citizens who are the most dependent for their \nhealth care needs. There is a very sad irony to this. We are going to \nforce the poor to bear the greatest burden on funding recovery and \nrelief efforts along the Gulf Coast. In essence we are going to charge \nthem to pay for this. What kind of logic is that? It is irrational, it \nis wrong, and we ought to be doing better by the people of our own \ncountry.\n  I am disappointed that this body had to rush out of town and could \nnot spend the additional time necessary to get this right for the \npeople of the Gulf Coast.\n  So I, again, applaud the Senator from Louisiana. I admire her \ncourage. I certainly admire her tenacity in fighting as hard as she has \nbeen for the people of her State.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11289-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11289-S11290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             IRAQ ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on October 15, one week from tomorrow, the \nIraqi people will cast their votes on a new, permanent Iraqi \nconstitution, a social compact, which if ratified, will be unique in \nthe history of the Arab Middle East.\n  Since the stunning January 30 elections, Iraqi leaders have worked \ntirelessly to draft this historic document. Next Saturday, the Iraqi \npeople will have the chance to formally express their support for this \nhistoric document.\n  Throughout the summer, we witnessed the complex and painstaking \nnature of the constitution drafting process. These negotiations \nincluded leaders from all of Iraq's ethnic and religious groups. The \nproduct is a result of patience, flexibility, and compromise.\n  As the President said yesterday in his televised speech, ``By any \nstandard or precedent of history, Iraq has made incredible political \nprogress--from tyranny, to liberation, to national elections, to the \nwriting of a constitution, in the space of 2\\1/2\\ years.''\n  Indeed.\n  And they have made this progress under a hail of constant threats and \nviolence from terrorist enemies within and without their borders.\n  American service men and women have sacrificed greatly to advance \nAmerica's interests in Iraq, but many more Iraqis have been killed and \ninjured in the pursuit of a free and democratic Iraq.\n  The draft permanent constitution lays a solid foundation for a stable \nand democratic Iraq in the heart of the Middle East. It establishes a \ntrue democratic system. The voice of all Iraqis will be heard. Human \nrights will be protected. The rule of law will be respected. And women \nwill be full and equal participants.\n  It is critical that Iraqis from all walks of life and all segments of \nIraq's diverse population participate in next week's referendum.\n  It is also important for Iraq's Sunni population to support this \ndocument and the democratic system of government that it establishes.\n  Sunni leaders have expressed strong reservations about several \naspects of the constitution in recent weeks. Many will vote no; that is \ntheir right.\n  However, I believe that they also recognize the importance of \nparticipating in the referendum. Only through participation and \nintegration into Iraq's new democratic system can Iraq's ethnic and \nreligious groups ensure that their rights are secured and their \ninterests are protected. They learned this hard lesson after avoiding \nthe January vote. They will not make the same mistake again.\n  When several of my Senate colleagues and I met with Interim President \nJalal Talabani last month, I was convinced that the Iraqi people \nrecognize the magnitude of this moment.\n  And I am confident that when the time comes next week, they will once \nagain show their courage and determination.\n  The enemy will try to intimidate and threaten them. But the Iraqi \npeople are strong.\n  Eight and one-half million voters defied the killers last January, \nand Iraqis continue to volunteer for the Iraqi security forces, ready \nand willing to defend their new democracy. They do so\n\n[[Page S11290]]\n\ndespite the fact that security forces are being targeted. They do so \nbecause they believe in the vision of a free and democratic Iraq.\n  I am confident that the Iraqi people will demonstrate this same \nfortitude in the referendum next Saturday.\n  And for those who vote against the constitution, they will have the \nchance to express themselves again in December when the Iraqis go to \nthe polls to elect a permanent government.\n  In the meantime, the Iraqis also must undertake another momentous \ntask.\n  On October 19, the Iraqi Special Tribunal will begin the trial of \nSaddam Hussein and some of his closest associates. The opening portion \nof the trial will focus on the 1982 killings of 143 Shiites in the \nvillage north of Baghdad. Saddam will also face charges of human rights \nabuses, crimes against humanity, and genocide.\n  In particular, Saddam Hussein will be required to finally answer for \nhis use of chemical weapons against the civilian Kurdish population of \nHallabja in 1988, and the violent suppression of mass uprisings \nfollowing the Gulf War in 1991.\n  It will be a riveting sight to see the justice system in the hands of \nthe Iraqi people. And to watch as they face down the man and his \nminions responsible for so many hideous and barbaric crimes.\n  I am confident that the Iraqi people will give their former \noppressors a fair trial and that the guilty will be brought to justice.\n  Step by step, the Iraqi people are on the path to democracy. And with \neach step, the terrorists are dealt a devastating blow, and freedom \nshows once again its power to inspire and prevail.\n  The Senate stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the Iraqi people as they \nfulfill their democratic destiny. They deserve our deepest and most \nsincere support.\n  I look forward to watching with hope and admiration as they take to \nthe polling booths once again to secure their future as a free and \nprosperous nation in the heart of the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11290-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11290-S11291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF TIM WINEMAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today to \nrecognize Tim Wineman for his dedicated and invaluable service to the \nUnited States Senate as he prepares to go into retirement.\n  Tim has served the Senate with great distinction. During his 35 years \nhere, he has worked in various positions within the Senate disbursing \noffice. Tim began as a payroll clerk in 1970 and because of his hard \nwork won numerous promotions. He works today as a financial clerk, one \nof the best the Secretary's office has been privileged to have. Tim is \none of those individuals who come here to serve in the Secretary's \noffice not to debate policy or make political statements, but out of a \nrespect and love for the institution, serving each and every Member \nwith the utmost professionalism.\n  Our Senate community is privileged to have individuals with the \ntalent and dedication that Tim Wineman has shown. He is the soul of \ndiscretion, always available to answer a question and provide wise \ncounsel, and he loves the Senate with all his heart. This is no \nsurprise, since Tim has been familiar with our Nation's capital and the \nwork of the people that goes on here from his earliest days.\n  Tim was born and raised in this area. His father worked for DC \nTransit and his mother, Carolyn, worked for Sears and Roebuck. Tim \nattended Bethesda Chevy Chase High School, where he met his life-long \npartner and friend, his wife, Pat. They just celebrated their 36th \nanniversary in August. They are blessed with two children, Matthew and \nLory.\n  Now that Tim is retiring from the Senate, the inevitable question \narises: what will he do with his spare time? I have it on good \nauthority that Tim is planning to get straight down to business. He \nmentioned that he plans to work on his golf game and spend time \ntraveling with Pat. I have heard that Alaska is one of the top \ndestinations on their list of places to visit. The first 6 months, \nhowever, he just wants to spend stress free.\n  In the Senate, we get so involved in the issues of the day, and as \nMembers our days are long and busy. We often forget to pause for a \nmoment and thank those who keep the trains running on time, and for 35 \nyears Tim Wineman has been one of those loyal conductors.\n  We thank Timothy S. Wineman for his service, and we wish Tim and his \nwife, Pat, a happy and content retirement.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Timothy \nWineman, who is retiring after 35 years of dedicated service to the \nSenate.\n  There are thousands of employees who work behind the scenes here in \nthe Senate, who make it possible for the Members of this body to \ndischarge the duties of their office. It is rare that these employees \nget the recognition they deserve.\n  One of the greatest and longest serving of those unsung heroes has \nbeen Tim Wineman, with whom I have had the honor of sharing these halls \nfor the last 25 years. Over that period of time, both my wife Jackie \nand I have come to rely on his experience and counsel. We are both sad \nto see him go, but we know as well as anyone that he has certainly \nearned his retirement.\n  Tim was hired as a payroll clerk in the disbursing office on October \n19, 1970, while my father still served in this Chamber. Six years \nlater, Tim was promoted to payroll supervisor. Four years after that, \nhe became the assistant financial clerk. And, in 1998, he was appointed \nthe Financial Clerk of the United States Senate.\n  He has fulfilled his duties in all of those roles with efficiency, \nintegrity, and vision. When Tim began over 30 years ago, the Senate's \nfinancial services were still performed manually and recorded in pen \nand ink, without the aid of computers. Over the last three decades, \nthrough various leadership positions, Tim has overseen the \ntechnological renovation of the Disbursing Office, as it almost \nflawlessly shifted to cover a marked increase in staff and services.\n  The Senate Disbursing Office handles not only the payroll of Senators \nand staff, but also their retirement funds and life and health \ninsurance. The workload is tremendous. Last year, the Disbursing Office \nalso approved nearly 50,000 expense reimbursement vouchers, \nadministered the oath to over 3,200 new Senate employees, and provided \n36 training sessions to new office managers, among countless other \nresponsibilities requiring attentiveness and precision.\n  Under Tim's leadership, these tasks have been carried out with the \nutmost professionalism. He has adeptly kept the Senate's financial \nhouse in order.\n  I thank Tim for his years of dedicated service to the Senate. He will \nbe sorely missed. I also want to extend to him and Pat, his wife for as \nlong as he has served the Senate, my best wishes as they begin this new \nphase in their lives.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nletters from various foreign officials be printed in the Record.

This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the first concurrent \nresolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2005 \nbudget through September 30, 2005. The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2006 concurrent resolution on the budget, H. Con. \nRes. 95.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is over the budget \nresolution by $3.145 billion in budget authority and over the budget \nresolution by $101 million in outlays in 2005. Current level for \nrevenues is $447 million above the budget resolution in 2005.\n  Since my last report for fiscal year 2005 dated September 29, 2005, \nthe Congress has taken no action that has changed budget authority, \noutlays, or revenues. This is my final report for fiscal year 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying letter and material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2005.\n     Hon.

As a result, the \n     enclosed current level report excludes these amounts (see \n     footnote 2 on Table 2).\n       Since my last letter, dated September 26, 2005, the \n     Congress has taken no action that has changed budget \n     authority, outlays, or revenues.

Mr. President, this week, I learned of another young \nperson from Montana who had been killed in Iraq. PFC Andrew Bedard was \nonly 19 and died Monday when the Humvee he was driving hit a roadside \nbomb.\n  Andrew Bedard was from Missoula and a 2004 graduate of Hellgate High \nSchool. He joined the Marine Corps shortly after graduation and had \nonly finished basic training earlier this year in San Diego. He had \nbeen in Iraq for close to only one month, when his life ended because \nof another improvised explosive device, or ``IED'' while conducting \ncombat operations against enemy forces in the Al Anbar province. The \nmilitary had recently launched a new offensive against insurgents in \nwestern Iraq.\n  Those who knew him best describe Andrew as a personable, positive guy \nwho was friends with most people he ran into and cared a great deal \nabout his family and friends. I actually met Andrew a few years ago \nwhen he and I were involved in a fender bender in Missoula. He was \ncourteous and respectful, and I can say that he was a fine young man.\n  Like me, Andrew was in the U.S. Marine Corps. If they can find solace \nin anything, his loved ones must know that his country is proud of his \nhonorable service in upholding the freedoms and ideals which make this \ncountry great.\n  My heart and prayers go out to the Bedard family, as well as the \nloved ones of all others lost in this War on Terror. Private First \nClass Bedard, unfortunately, was the 13th man with Montana ties to die \nin Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001. Other Montanans who have been killed \nin combat in Operation Enduring Freedom/Iraqi Freedom are:\n  SPC Travis Arndt of Great Falls was the 12th man with Montana ties to \nlose his life in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  Marine LCpl Nicholas Bloem of Bozeman was killed in Iraq on Aug. 3, \nthe day after his 20th birthday, when a roadside bomb was exploded \nunder his amphibious assault vehicle.

These \nbrave souls for whatever reason were not. I thank them for what they \ndid to protect my family and others across this country and around the \nworld. They did not die in vain and will not be forgotten.

Mr. President, the Bible tells us that ``Greater love than \nthis has no man than to lay down his life for his friends.'' I rise \nthis morning to pay tribute to two American heroes from my home town of \nPendleton, OR, who made the ultimate sacrifice by laying down their \nlives for their friends, their country, and the cause of freedom.\n  WO Adrian B. Stump and SGT Tane Travis Baum were two of five soldiers \nwho were lost in the crash of a CH-47 Chinook helicopter as it was \nreturning from an ongoing operation in southern Afghanistan.\n  Warrant Officer Stump was 22 years of age. He was the son of Jerry \nand Anne Stump, who instilled in Adrian the values of hard work, \nhonesty, and integrity. He was a graduate of Pendleton High School, and \nhe was well known in my community for being an outstanding young man, \nwho always had a smile on his face. Like many east Oregonians, he loved \nthe outdoors and could often be found hiking, fishing, and camping.\n  Adrian always dreamed of flying helicopters. And after he graduated \nfrom high school, there was no question of what he wanted to do. He \nwanted to serve his country. Indeed, he recently expressed to a friend \nof mine how great it was to be able to wake up in the morning and do \nwhat one loves to do.\n  SGT Tane Travis Baum was 30 years old. He was married to his high \nschool sweetheart, Tina, and they were the parents of two beautiful \nchildren, Caelan and Dyllon. Sergeant Baum also loved the outdoors and \nflying helicopters. While it was difficult for Sergeant Baum to leave \nhis family behind to serve his country, he carried out his duty like \nthe true hero he was.\n  The author Herman Wouk once wrote:\n\n       Heroes are not supermen. They are good men, and embodied by \n     the cast of destiny, the virtue of a whole people in a great \n     hour . . . . If America is still the great beacon in dense \n     gloom, the promise to hundreds of millions of the oppressed \n     that liberty exists, that it is the shining future, that they \n     can throw off their tyrants, and learn freedom and cease \n     learning war, then we still need heroes to stand guard in the \n     night.\n\n  As of today, Warrant Officer Stump, Sergeant Baum and more than 50 \nOregonians have lost their lives keeping the promise of liberty to \nmillions, the promise our forefathers first made and the charge that is \nours to keep. They stood guard in the night and have earned the \ngratitude of our Nation.\n\n\n                  LIEUTENANT COMMANDER THOMAS E. BLAKE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Navy \nPilot LCDR Thomas E. Blake of Spencer, NE.\n  Lieutenant Commander Blake was a selfless and honorable man whose \ncommitment and service to his country were exemplary. As a 1990 \ngraduate of Spencer-Naper High School, Blake went on to earn a \nbachelor's degree from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1994. \nBlake was an 11-year veteran of the Navy, and had been stationed at Sea \nControl Squadron 32, based at Jacksonville, Florida for the past 6 \nmonths.\n  On September 21, 2005, LCDR Thomas Blake died at the age of 33 when \nan S-3B Viking jet crashed near Jacksonville Naval Air Station, killing \nBlake and LCDR Scoot Bracher of Malverne, NY. Blake was the naval \nflight officer and mission commander on the flight.\n  Lieutenant Commander Blake is survived by his wife Jessica, a native \nof Gretna, NE. Thomas and Jessica are the parents of a 2-year-old son, \nand Jessica is expecting their second child soon. I would like to offer \nmy sincere condolences and prayers to the family and friends of \nLieutenant Commander Blake. His noble service to the United States of \nAmerica is to be respected and remembered by all. Every American and \nall Nebraskans should be proud of the service of brave military \npersonnel such as LCDR Thomas E. Blake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11294-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STATEMENT ON BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, many of us who closely follow the \nstruggle for freedom in Burma have, over the years, repeatedly called \nupon the U.N. Security Council to discuss and debate the dire situation \nin that country that poses an immediate danger to the Burmese people \nand the entire region.\n  Our collective efforts may finally be gaining steam thanks to a \nreport commissioned by former Czech President Vaclav Havel and retired \nSouth African Archbishop Desmond Tutu that in painstaking detail makes \nthe case that the situation in Burma has the same factors that \ntriggered Security Council consideration of tragedies in Rwanda, Haiti, \nSierra Leone, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Liberia, and Yemen.\n  I encourge my colleagues to read last Friday's Washington Post \neditorial entitled ``A Plan to Free Burma,'' which highlights the \nHavel-Tutu report and the need for U.N. action on Burma. While I agree \nthat the administration can and should do more to support a Burma \ninitiative at the United Nations, I am confident that as a stalwart \nfriend of freedom, Ambassador Bolton will make this a priority for \nhimself and his staff. I encourage Secretary Rice to continue to make \nthis effort a priority, as well.\n  Let me close with a brief word urging the United Kingdom to find its \nvoice on Burma at the United Nations. Given Britain's history with that \nSoutheast Asian country, Prime Minister Blair and senior officials at \nthe Foreign Office should keep in mind that Burma's myriad problems--\nincluding humanitarian crises--are political in nature and require a \npolitical solution that involves the active participation of the \nNational League for Democracy and ethnic minorities. Let us not forget \nthat this is a country where the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria had to terminate its grants because of the \nobstructionist policies of the SDPC.\n  I am reminded that this year marks the 60th anniversary of the Burma \nCampaign of World War II, the longest British battle of that war. I \nhope our allies across the Atlantic will continue to show the same grit \nand determination in supporting freedom in Burma today as they did last \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11294-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11294-S11295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESPECTING GUN LAWS IN DC\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we owe it not only to the people who live \nand work in Washington, DC and the millions who visit, but to all \nAmericans to do what we can to prevent gun violence in our nation's \ncapital. It is important that we also respect the wishes of DC \nresidents as they work to address the\n\n[[Page S11295]]\n\nproblems of gun violence in their own communities. Unfortunately, \nlegislation introduced earlier this year would undermine both of these \nobjectives.\n  Among other things, the misnamed District of Columbia Personal \nProtection Act would repeal local laws in Washington, DC that ban the \nsale and possession of unregistered firearms, require firearm \nregistration, impose common sense safe storage requirements, and ban \nsemiautomatic weapons.\n  Elected officials and community leaders throughout Washington, DC, \nhave made clear their opposition to this bill and any other attempt to \nroll back Washington's local gun safety laws. In recent months, many \ngroups around the country working to end gun violence have also \nexpressed strong opposition to the proposed repeal of local gun safety \nlaws in Washington, DC. In July, 44 national, state, and local \norganizations issued an open letter to Congress opposing the so called \nDistrict of Columbia Personal Protection Act. Among the groups who \nsigned the letter were the United States Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the \nNational Black Police Association, Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, and the \nCoalition to Stop Gun Violence. Their letter said:\n\n       The citizens of the District of Columbia should have the \n     power to decide by democratic means whether and how firearms \n     are regulated in the city where they live. DC's current gun \n     laws were passed almost 30 years ago by an elected city \n     council, and these laws continue to enjoy broad support among \n     business executives, law enforcement officials, health care \n     professionals, civic organizations, and ordinary citizens. \n     When legislation to repeal DC's gun laws was introduced last \n     year, it generated widespread opposition--and attracted \n     virtually no support--among DC residents.\n\n  While this bill has not yet been considered in the Senate, the \ncitizens of Washington, DC, continue to face attempts to roll back \ntheir local gun safety laws. During consideration of the fiscal year \n2006 District of Columbia appropriations bill, the House of \nRepresentatives adopted an amendment strongly supported by the National \nRifle Association which would prohibit funds in the bill from being \nused to enforce a local requirement that District residents keep their \nfirearms unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock in their \nhomes. Fortunately, the current Senate version of the bill does not \ninclude a similar provision and I am hopeful the House-passed language \nwill not become law.\n  The Senate should respect the will of the people of Washington, DC, \nwith regard to local gun safety laws. I hope the Senate will focus its \nefforts on legislation that will help make communities across our \nNation safer, not on steps which would make our Nation's Capital less \nsafe.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the above-mentioned letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 15, 2005.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to express our strong \n     opposition to S. 1082, a bill that would strip the District \n     of Columbia's voters and elected officials of the power to \n     pass gun laws.\n       The citizens of the District of Columbia should have the \n     power to decide by democratic means whether and how firearms \n     are regulated in the city where they live. DC's current gun \n     laws were passed almost 30 years ago by an elected city \n     council, and these laws continue to enjoy broad support among \n     business executives, law enforcement officials, health care \n     professionals, civic organizations, and ordinary citizens. \n     When legislation to repeal DC's gun laws was introduced last \n     year, it generated widespread opposition--and attracted \n     virtually no support--among DC residents.\n       DC has made great strides in recent years, both in reducing \n     violent crime and in encouraging people to establish \n     businesses, buy homes, and build their lives in the city. The \n     city's finances are in order (it has an ``A'' rating from \n     bond analysts), the homicide rate is down (by 55 percent over \n     the past ten years), and commercial as well as residential \n     real estate markets are booming.\n       The city has many challenges ahead, but its citizens and \n     political leaders are working to build consensus and solve \n     problems like any other municipality in the country through \n     vigorous debate, hard work, and participation in democratic \n     political institutions. While some members of Congress might \n     have different ideas about what's good for the city, we \n     believe the choices made by DC citizens and their elected \n     representatives in local government should be entitled to \n     respect.\n       The debate over S. 1082 is about democracy, not the Second \n     Amendment. By denying the citizens of DC--who have no \n     representation in Congress--the right to decide how best to \n     protect public safety and reduce violent crime, this bill \n     would violate basic American values, and we urge you to \n     reject it.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance for Justice, Americans for Democratic Action, \n     American Jewish Committee, Anti-Defamation League, Brady \n     Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Break the Cycle Washington, \n     DC, CeaseFire Maryland, Ceasefire NJ, Ceasefire PA, and \n     Children's Defense Fund;\n       Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Common Cause, Consumer \n     Federation of America, DC Action for Children, DC Democracy \n     Fund, DC Vote, The Episcopal Church, USA, Episcopal Diocese \n     of Washington, Florida Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and \n     Florida Consumer Action Network;\n       Hoosiers Concerned About Gun Violence, Illinois Council \n     Against Handgun Violence, Iowans for the Prevention of Gun \n     Violence, Jewish Women International, The League of Women \n     Voters of the United States, Legal Community Against \n     Violence, and Maine Citizens Against Handgun Violence;\n       Michigan Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, National \n     Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), \n     National Black Police Association, National Council of Jewish \n     Women (NCJW), New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, and North \n     Carolinians Against Gun Violence Education Fund;\n       Ohio Coalition Against Gun Violence, Oregon Consumer \n     League, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Saferworld, \n     States United to Prevent Gun Violence, and United Church of \n     Christ, Justice and Witness Ministries;\n       Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, United \n     States Conference of Mayors, Virginians Against Handgun \n     Violence, Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort, and Women Against \n     Gun Violence (California).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11295-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, the original G.I. bill in 1944 made a \nsacred bargain: honor our troops for their sacrifice, and keep faith \nwith our veterans by helping them readjust to civilian life. \nHistorically, G.I. bill educational benefits have risen and fallen--at \ntimes covering over 100 percent of the cost of tuition, books, supplies \nand other educational costs. And we know how valuable its benefits have \nbecome in recruiting the world's finest military.\n  But each year, the G.I. bill covers a little bit less of the cost of \neducation in this country. It's a cruel mathematical calculation--the \ncost of a university education is growing faster than the benefits \nprovided by the G.I. bill. Our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and around \nthe world fight just as hard and sacrifice just as much as any in \nAmerican history. Yet the G.I. bill--this great act of gratitude that \ntransformed America 60 years ago--has not kept pace. Today, our troops \nreturn home to a G.I. bill that covers only 63 percent of the average \nprice of a 4-year public secondary education. The result is veterans \nstruggling to afford the education they were promised and have earned.\n  The U.S. Congress should never break promises to our veterans--like \n28-year-old Jeff Memmer. As a member of the U.S. Navy, Jeff served two \ndeployments in the Persian Gulf between 1996 and 2002. When he came \nhome, he had to take out tens of thousands of dollars in emergency \nloans and work part time as a bartender to get through school because \ncosts kept outpacing benefits. He said, ``When I started putting a plan \ntogether in 1999, the benefit would have covered two-thirds of my \ntuition and costs. By the time I got to college, the tuition had \nincreased so much it only covered half, and by the time I graduated it \nwas only covering a third of my expenses.'' We are not proposing that \nveterans live in luxury while they earn their degrees. But clearly, it \nshouldn't be this hard.\n\n[[Page S11296]]\n\n  Take the case of Eric VonEuw, a veteran of 4 years with the airborne \ninfantry. Even with G.I. bill benefits, he is working part time to make \nends meet and cover the cost of his community college. If he is able to \nfinish at UC Davis, his benefits won't cover half his bills.\n  Today's military looks a lot different from the military I served in \nduring the Vietnam war. Today, almost 60 percent of enlisted men and \nwomen are married. These veterans are faced with a choice: to borrow \nfor their education or to take care of their families now.\n  The amendment I offered on the Defense appropriations bill, \ncosponsored by Senator Ensign, would have required a report on G.I. \nbill educational benefits--who uses them, how they are used, and how \nthey can be improved. The report would have included cost estimates to \nhelp us assess various options for increasing the value of the \neducation benefits so they cover more, if not all, of the costs of a 4-\nyear public education.\n  In the course of preparing this amendment, Senator Ensign and I were \ninvited to work with the Veterans' Affairs Committee to accomplish the \nsame thing. We hope this approach will be successful and will therefore \nnot bring our amendment to a vote.\n  This is the start of an effort to improve G.I. bill educational \nbenefits. It is not just the right thing to do; it is critical to our \nnational security. We all know that this is the most challenging \nrecruiting environment in the history of the All-Volunteer military. In \na 2004 survey, servicemembers reported that the G.I. bill is the number \none reason they choose to enlist in the military. We must make sure \nthat we understand how those benefits are being used and what the \nalternatives are to improve them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter I sent with \nSenator Ensign to the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which was mentioned \nabove, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 2005.\n     Senator Larry Craig,\n     Chairman,\n     Senator Daniel Akaka,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Representative Steven Buyer,\n     Chairman,\n     Representative Lane Evans,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Cannon \n         House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig, Senator Akaka, Congressman Buyer, and \n     Congressman Evans: As you continue negotiations on The \n     Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2005, S1235, and its \n     companion bills in the House, we write to draw your attention \n     to 38 USC, Section 3036, which required a biannual report \n     from the Secretary of Defense on the use and adequacy of \n     readjustment and educational benefits for veterans. As of \n     January 2005, no additional reports are required by this \n     section.\n       We believe receiving this report remains vital today. This \n     country is at war. American forces are serving heroically \n     around the world, in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The \n     men and women of our armed forces serve for many reasons. \n     Undoubtedly, all serve with a sense of patriotism and duty to \n     country. But there are other important reasons a young \n     American chooses the military, and as recently as 2004 a \n     survey indicated that educational benefits are the primary \n     reason soldiers cite for their decision to enlist.\n       It is no secret that we are today in the midst of the most \n     challenging recruiting environment our all-volunteer military \n     has ever faced. The Army officially fell short of its FY2005 \n     recruiting goals, delaying the expansion of the active-duty \n     Army. It is essential that we continue to receive periodic \n     updates from the Secretary of Defense on the value of \n     education benefits to new recruits, how these benefits are \n     used by veterans, and recommendations about how the benefits \n     can be improved.\n       Accordingly, we ask you to reauthorize 38 USC Section 3036, \n     with the minor modification of the first issuance of the \n     report being required within six months of enactment of this \n     bill. We also ask that you consider an additional \n     modification to require that the first report include the \n     attached provisions from an amendment we offered on the \n     Defense Authorization bill to provide a more accurate \n     estimate of the costs of various proposals to increase GI \n     Bill benefits.\n       We appreciate your continued leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Kerry.\n     John Ensign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11296-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11296-S11297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud my Senate \ncolleagues for unanimously passing legislation to protect American \nwomen from domestic violence.\n  The Violence Against Women Act expired this past Saturday, October 1. \nI cosponsored the renewal of this vital legislation because it \nstrengthens Federal and State efforts to prevent domestic violence and \nassist victims of domestic violence. It focuses resources and attention \non some of the most vulnerable women in our society--women who too \noften suffer in silence.\n  I am so pleased that by passing this bill the Senate has reaffirmed \nits commitment to helping women, men, and children prevent and cope \nwith domestic abuse.\n  The Violence Against Women Act responds to an ongoing crisis within \nmany American families. Too many of our grandmothers, mothers, and \ndaughters, and too many of our grandfathers, fathers, and sons are \nabused at home by a partner or family member. Every day in America some \nwomen and men, some elderly, are beaten, have objects thrown at them, \nsuffer emotional and verbal abuse. Teenagers suffer abusive dating \nrelationships. Many victims of domestic violence feel trapped and need \nsupport and assistance to leave their abusers and start violence-free \nlives.\n  The image of a severely battered woman spurs many of us to stop \ndomestic violence, but what is also disturbing is the prevalence of \ndomestic violence. Domestic abuse is the common cold of violence. \nAccording to the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association, \nnearly one in every three women will experience a physical assault by a \nromantic partner. And of this group, one in three will experience a \nsevere physical assault. Every day more than three women in this \ncountry are murdered by their husbands and boyfriends. Children also \nsuffer. Half of women who report rape are under the age of 18. \nShockingly, 22 percent are under the age of 12. And I know that \nviolence against the elderly is a serious and growing problem.\n  For the past decade, the Violence Against Women Act has provided \ncrucial aid to women, men, and children experiencing violence. Between \n1994 and 2000, Congress distributed over $3.8 billion to States and \nlocal communities to train and support police, lawyers, judges, nurses, \nshelter directors and advocates to end domestic violence and sexual \nassault. Our efforts contributed to almost a 50 percent drop in \ndomestic violence.\n  The Violence Against Women Act of 2005 renews several successful \nprograms and provides funding for training, education and outreach to \nprotect women. It encourages collaboration among law enforcement, the \ncourts, and public and private services providers to victims of \ndomestic and sexual violence. It stiffens criminal penalties for repeat \nFederal domestic violence offenders, and updates the criminal law on \nstalking to incorporate new surveillance technology like global \npositioning systems. It incorporates prevention strategies targeted at \nmen and boys. And it strengthens rape crisis centers and the health \ncare system's response to family violence.\n  The bill also addresses the special needs of victims who are elderly, \ndisabled, children, immigrants, residents of rural communities, and \nmembers of ethnic and racial communities. It provides emergency leave \nand long-term transitional housing for victims.\n  The Violence Against Women Act of 2005 will save lives. It also will \nsave money. A 2002 university study found that money spent to reduce \ndomestic violence saved nearly ten times the potential costs incurred \nbetween 1995 and 2000 for medical, legal, and other victimization \ncosts. On an individual level, the bill costs roughly $15.50 per woman \nin the United States and saves an estimated $159 per woman.\n  Despite the funding provided by the Violence Against Women Act, I \nbelieve that reducing the scale and alleviating the human toll of \ndomestic violence requires stronger Federal support. In my own State of \nNew York, in Albany, an award-winning organization dedicated to \nproviding legal assistance to victims of domestic violence and sexual \nassault faces the possibility of shutting down. Just this past \nSeptember, the Department of Justice informed the group,\n\n[[Page S11297]]\n\nThe Capital District Women's Bar Association Legal Project, that its \napplication for continued funding had been denied. The Department of \nJustice has supported the CDWBA Legal Project's efforts on behalf of \nbattered women for nearly a decade. With this financial assistance, the \ngroup has provided critical services for more than 4,000 poor, battered \nwomen and their children since 1996. The program has been so successful \nthat the United States Office of Justice Programs identified it in 2003 \nas a ``best practices program'' as a model for communities striving to \nbetter serve and protect victims of domestic violence and sexual \nassault. Yet this program and, Director Lisa Frisch told me, other \nprograms like it, are losing their funding and ability to prevent abuse \nand assist victims.\n  We critically need to provide this funding--to stop domestic \nviolence, and aid its victims.\n  Domestic abuse is an ongoing crisis for many American families. It is \nthe common cold of violence for Americans today. But working together, \nas Federal, State, and local officials, as governmental and \nnongovernmental organizations, as individuals, we can reduce the \nseverity and the prevalence of domestic violence. We can protect the \nmost vulnerable members of our society women, the elderly, children. I \napplaud Senators Biden, Hatch, and Specter who introduced the Violence \nAgainst Women Act of 2005 in June, and the nearly 60 Senators who \ncosponsored the legislation, Members on both sides of the aisle. Their \nhard work helps to strengthen American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11297-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On December 7, 2003, in Largo, FL, Reshae McCauley, a 30-year-old \ntransgender person, visited Z109, a local club. The following evening \nReshae's body was discovered near her home where she had died of severe \nupper body trauma. According to police, the apparent motivation for the \nattack was her sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11297-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL LATINO AIDS AWARENESS\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, even as our Nation faces new public health \nchallenges, it is crucial that we not lose sight of a devastating \ndisease that has remained a challenge for decades the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic. Over the past two decades, the Nation has witnessed \ntremendous strides in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease, and \noverall, affected individuals are living longer and in better health. \nYet approximately 40,000 Americans are still infected every year, half \nof whom are under the age of 25, and over 1 million Americans are \nliving with this disease. My own State of Illinois ranks sixth in the \nNation for HIV/AIDS, and our health officials and experts continue to \nwork diligently to reduce the number of newly infected, as well as \nprovide high quality care to those who are infected.\n  As with so many diseases, HIV/AIDS has had a disproportionate impact \non the Latino community. While representing only 14 percent of the U.S. \npopulation, Latinos comprise 20 percent of the population affected by \nHIV/AIDS. However, unlike every other racial and ethnic group, the \nnumber of estimated deaths among Latinos with AIDS is actually \nincreasing--a 17 percent growth between 1999 and 2003.\n  As the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority group in the U.S., \nit is imperative that HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in the Latino \ncommunity remain a top priority for our Nation.\n  I am proud to join Representative Hilda Solis, Chair of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus' Task Force on Health, and other members \nof the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Black Caucus, in \nrecognizing October 15 as National Latino AIDS Awareness Day. On this \nday, we renew our commitment to ending the spread of HIV and ensuring \nquality of life to those with HIV regardless of their country of origin \nor immigration status. We do this whether we are Latino, African \nAmerican, Asian, Caucasian or Native American. Although we all belong \nto separate communities, it is important that we stand as one community \nin the fight against this disease that is rapidly targeting populations \nof color.\n  The numbers are growing and so should our national attention towards \nthe issue. The reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act is an example \nof how our Nation can help. It is also critical to increase funding for \nthe Minority AIDS Initiative, MAI, which addresses the disproportionate \nimpact of HIV/AIDS on people of color by allocating specific funds for \nprograms under the Ryan White CARE Act. Programs like Ryan White \nprovide our most vulnerable populations, such as HIV/AIDS-stricken \nLatinos, with a chance for quality health care and a brighter future.\n  On October 15 and every other day of the year, I encourage all of us \nto join in the fight against HIV and AIDS. We cannot become complacent. \nThe need is great, and the time to act is overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11297-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11297-S11298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NOMINATION OF WAN J. KIM\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and admiration \nthat I support the nomination of Wan J. Kim, of my home State of New \nJersey, to be the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Wan Kim's life is a testament to the American dream. Mr. Kim's father \ncame to New York from South Korea in 1971, with only a few hundred \ndollars in his pocket and the dream of building a better life for his \nfamily. He spoke no English and he took a job washing dishes. His wife \njoined him several months later, and worked in a garment factory. In \n1973, Wan Kim and his sister left South Korea, where they had been \nstaying with their grandmother, to reunite with their parents on U.S. \nsoil. Wan Kim was 5 years old at the time.\n  The family soon moved to New Jersey, where Mr. Kim's parents \npurchased a luncheonette in Jersey City, and later a home in Union \nTownship. Mr. Kim's parents worked 7 days a week to provide an \neducation and a life of opportunity for their children. Mr. Kim \nexcelled in school, graduating as valedictorian of his high school \nclass and serving this country in the Army Reserves. He received his \nbachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University and his law degree from \nthe University of Chicago Law School.\n  Following law school, Mr. Kim clerked for Federal Judge James L. \nBuckley on the DC Circuit Court. He then worked as a trial attorney in \nthe Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, where he \nparticipated in the prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombing case. Mr. \nKim later served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of \nColumbia, as counsel on the Senate Judiciary committee, and as a lawyer \nin private practice. Since August 2003, Mr. Kim has served as a deputy \nassistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division at the \nDepartment of Justice, where he is charged with oversight of the \ncriminal, educational opportunities, and housing and civil enforcement \nsections.\n  If confirmed as assistant attorney general, Mr. Kim will be the \nNation's top civil rights law enforcement officer. In that capacity, he \nwill be responsible for overseeing more than 300 attorneys nationwide \nand with ensuring the vigorous enforcement of this nation's civil \nrights laws--including those relating to voting rights, employment \ndiscrimination, human trafficking, and police misconduct. Mr. Kim will \nenjoy the distinction of being the first Korean-American and the first \nnaturalized citizen to assume that post.\n  The position to which Mr. Kim is nominated is one of vital importance \nto our Nation. There are those who\n\n[[Page S11298]]\n\nwould weaken or narrow the authority of the Civil Rights Division, or \nremove it from Congressional oversight altogether. I disagree. The \nDepartment of Justice, and the Civil Rights Division in particular, \nmust continue to carry out its indispensable role in safeguarding the \ncivil rights of all Americans. The Department must hold firm in \nensuring that no person, big or small, strong or weak, Black or White, \nLatino or Asian, is treated with anything less than fairness, equality, \nand justice under our laws. To this end, it is essential that the \npowers of the Civil Rights Division and the oversight authority of this \nbody be vigorous, and that the Division hire only the very best \nattorneys possible to carry out its mission.\n  There is no doubt that the Civil Rights Division will face many \nchallenges in the years ahead. The office will require a leader with a \nfirm commitment to civil rights and the resolve to place the \nconsiderable resources of the Federal Government behind the protection \nof those fundamental rights. Mr. Kim has an impressive record of public \nservice and has earned the strong respect of his colleagues and the \nlegal community. I am confident that Mr. Kim will do all he can to \npreserve and strengthen our civil rights protections, and that in so \ndoing, he will continue to make his family, his home State of New \nJersey, and his country proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11298-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BINATIONAL HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to join my \nfriends from across the United States and Mexico to celebrate the 5th \nAnnual Binational Health Week. Binational Health Week affords us an \nopportunity to reflect upon the many successful efforts made here in \nthe United States in cooperation with Mexican consulates to promote \nhealth and well-being amongst those who might otherwise lack access to \nimportant health care services and to discuss what further efforts \nshould be made to address shortcomings that still exist.\n  Binational Health Week originated as an effort by Mexico's Secretary \nof Health to direct health care services to underserved migrant \npopulations here in the United States. In October 2001, the Mexican \nconsulates in California partnered with the California Department of \nHealth Services to celebrate the first Binational Health Week in an \neffort to mobilize local health clinics and community organizations to \nprovide services to people of Latin origin. Since then, Binational \nHealth Week has expanded to cities across the United States, Mexico, \nand Canada.\n  I feel strongly that we must do all that we can to encourage people \nto pursue healthy lifestyles. Between one-half and two-thirds of \npremature deaths in the United States and much of our health care costs \nare caused by just three risk factors: poor diet, physical inactivity, \nand tobacco. Promoting proper fitness and nutrition is not only good \nhealth policy but it is also good fiscal policy as it prevents costly \nhospitalization and reduces future costs to the taxpayer. We must work \ntogether at the Federal, State and local levels to encourage healthy \neating and exercise.\n  I am excited that Binational Health week encourages the people of our \ngreat nations to discuss how we can work together to ensure that \nfamilies across North America have every opportunity to enjoy good \nhealth and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11298-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I rise to report on a development \nby the American Beverage Association, ABA, and its members who have \nadopted a new policy aimed at helping parents and schools to promote \nhealthy lifestyles for our Nation's students.\n  Recently, the association's board of directors established new school \nvending policies for its members. The purpose was to help parents, \nteachers, and children in the school environment make good lifestyle \nchoices by providing appropriate beverage choices for each grade level.\n  Childhood obesity is a problem facing society, and I believe that \nresponsibility for achieving healthy lifestyles is shared by everyone, \nincluding parents, communities, schools, government, and industry.\n  Under the new ABA policy, the beverage industry will provide the \nfollowing: One, only bottled water and 100 percent juice to elementary \nschool students; two, nutritious and/or lower calorie beverages to \nmiddle school students, such as bottled water, 100 percent juice, \nsports drinks, no-calorie and low-calorie soft drinks and low-calorie \njuice drinks--no full-calorie soft drinks or full-calorie juice drinks \nwith 5 percent or less juice will be provided to middle school students \nuntil after school hours; and three, a variety of beverage choices to \nhigh school students, such as bottled water, 100 percent juice, sports \ndrinks, and juice drinks. No more than 50 percent of the vending \nselections made available to high school students will be soft drinks.\n  This new policy complements the work the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry completed in the 108th Congress with the Child \nNutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004. Under the act, local \nschool districts were directed to develop wellness policies, address \nphysical activity and nutrition education, and implement nutrition \nstandards for all food sold on campus. The ABA's new vending policy is \ntimely and welcomed, and can serve as a key component for the \ndevelopment of local wellness policies by helping set important \nnutrition standards for our students.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize the American Beverage \nAssociation and its members for being part of a solution in achieving \nhealthy lifestyles and in fighting childhood obesity. This commonsense \npolicy does not unfairly single out individual foods or beverages \nthrough wholesale bans, but instead provides a reasonable balance in \nvending choices and complements the industry's school-based physical \nactivity programs.\n  I commend The Coca-Cola Company in my home State of Georgia, and the \nentire beverage industry for its leadership on this issue and for its \ncommitment to making a substantial and positive impact on the well-\nbeing of our students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11298-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11298-S11299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING FORMER GOVERNOR STAN HATHAWAY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life \nand memory of Stan K. Hathaway. Sadly, Stan passed away on October 4, \nat the age of 81.\n  One of six children, Stan was born in Osceola, NE. He grew up in \nHuntley, WY. Stan attended the University of Wyoming until he heard the \ncall of duty, and in 1943, he left college and joined the Army Air \nCorps to serve his country in World War II. During the war, he flew \nbomber missions. For his service, Stan received the French Criox de \nGuerre, U.S. Presidential Unit Citations and five air medals.\n  When Stan returned from his tour in Europe, he enrolled at the \nUniversity of Nebraska to finish his bachelor's degree and continued on \nto complete his law degree at the same institution. While there, he met \nand married his lovely wife Bobby. Bobby was the light in his life. \nTheir relationship was strong and full of love. They complimented one \nanother beautifully, and together, they accomplished tremendous things.\n  Following Stan's graduation from law school, he and Bobby moved to \nTorrington. Bobby began teaching, and Stan established his law \npractice. Here, they had their two daughters, Susan and Sandra. In \n1954, Stan was elected Goshen County Attorney, and in 1966, he was \nelected Governor. After his second term as governor, President Ford \nappointed Stan as secretary of the interior in 1975. He was Wyoming's \nfirst cabinet officer. Health issues forced his resignation shortly \nafter his appointment, and he moved to Cheyenne to resume his law \npractice.\n  Stan always looked toward the future, and his innumerable \ncontributions still resonate in our great State. During his two terms \nas Governor, Stan initiated groundbreaking policy for Wyoming. He \nenacted the State's first severance tax on minerals and created the \nPermanent Mineral Trust Fund where severance tax money is invested. The \nfund now totals more than $2 billion and earns enough to run a major \nportion of the State's government operations.\n\n[[Page S11299]]\n\n  Recognizing the value of our State's natural heritage and the need \nfor conservation, Stan approved Wyoming's first environmental controls \non its minerals industry. In addition to creating the State department \nof environmental quality, he signed into law the State air quality act \nin 1967 and the State water quality act in 1968. He was also a founding \nmember of the Wyoming Heritage Society/Wyoming Heritage Foundation in \n1979. Stan was determined to protect Wyoming's natural treasures while \nsecuring its economic future.\n  Governor Hathaway also had a great love for arts. He signed the 1967 \nbill which established the Wyoming Arts Council. He and Bobby were \nleading patrons of the arts, helped lead the charge to inaugurate \npublic funding for the arts in the State, and helped develop many State \nprograms to encourage art.\n  Stan believed the most important thing Wyoming could give its youth \nwas an education and opportunities to stay in the State. In recognition \nof his contributions to higher education, the 2005 Wyoming Legislature \nnamed the ``Hathaway Student Scholarship Endowment Account,'' a $400 \nmillion dollar endowment for academic scholarships and endowed chairs \nat the State's universities and community colleges, in Stan and Bobby's \nhonor.\n  Governor Hathaway's trailblazing efforts earned him many \nrecognitions. Many credit him with helping Wyoming pull out of its \neconomic depression during the 1950s and 1960s. In 2000, Stan was the \nrecipient of the Mary Mead Steinhaur Heritage Award for his \nachievements in public service, private sector leadership and \ncommitment to Wyoming's economic growth. Stan and Bobby also received \nthe Governor's Arts Award for Excellence in the Arts in 2003.\n  Stan and Bobby were dear friends of my wife Susan and I.

McKEE\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \ndistinguished Hoosier, Mr. Craig M. McKee of Terre Haute, IN, who will \nbe installed as chairman of the board of trustees of the National \nCathedral Association here in Washington, DC, at an Evensong service on \nThursday, October 13.\n  Since graduating from Indiana State University and the Indiana \nUniversity School of Law in Indianapolis, Craig has worked as a \nrespected attorney, eventually becoming a partner in the firm of \nWilkinson, Goeller, Modesitt, Wilkinson & Drummy in Terre Haute. He has \nalso offered distinguished public service in West Central Indiana as a \nmember of the board of directors and chairman of the Greater Terre \nHaute Chamber of Commerce, president of the Terre Haute Rotary Club, \npresident of the United Way of the Wabash Valley, and a member of the \nboard of directors of the Indiana State University Foundation.\n  As chairman of the board of trustees of the National Cathedral \nAssociation, Craig will help to facilitate funding for the Cathedral \nand oversee its programs and activities. The association, with some \n14,000 members, provides leadership and support to the Cathedral. As \none who has had the opportunity to be a reader at an Indiana Day \nobservance at the Cathedral, I am grateful for the work of the \nCathedral staff and the association.\n  The National Cathedral was chartered by Congress in 1893. Contruction \nbegan in 1907, when the foundation stone was laid in the presence of \nTheodore Roosevelt, and lasted for 83 years; the last finial was placed \nin the presence of George H.W. Bush in 1990. The Cathedral has been the \nsite of two Presidential state funerals: for Dwight D. Eisenhower and \nRonald W. Reagan, and the mausoleum is the final resting place for \nWoodrow Wilson. President Eisenhower lay in repose at the Cathedral \nbefore lying in state. In addition, a memorial service for Harry Truman \ntook place at National Cathedral. It has been the venue to national \nprayer services following many events, most recently after Hurricane \nKatrina and the attacks of September 11, 2001.\n  I commend Craig on this signal honor and wish him every continuing \nsuccess in his important leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11299-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11299-S11300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN PAKISTAN\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to bring attention to the \nappalling human rights abuses against women in Pakistan and to express \nmy dismay with the recent comments of President Pervez Musharraf that \nrape in Pakistan has become an opportunity for women of his country to \nmake money and emigrate. Victims of rape and domestic violence in \nPakistan and around the world are offended by these irresponsible \nremarks.\n  On September 13 President Musharraf stated the following in an \ninterview with the Washington Post: ``You must understand the \nenvironment in Pakistan . . . This has become a money-making concern. A \nlot of people say if you want to go abroad and get a visa to Canada for \ncitizenship and be a millionaire, get yourself raped.'' President \nMusharraf subsequently denied making these remarks, but the paper \nposted an audio link of the interview on its website, confirming that \nhe had in fact been accurately quoted.\n  These comments are completely unacceptable. They are especially so \nconsidering the fact that rape and other acts of violence against women \nin Pakistan are a longstanding problem. The U.S. State Department's \nCountry Report on Human Rights Practices for 2004 reported that one out \nof every two Pakistani women last year was the victim of mental or \nphysical violence. That is an astounding number. Additionally, the \nreport states that husbands frequently beat and even occasionally kill \ntheir wives and that many females are disfigured by intentional \nburnings or attacks with acid. So called ``honor killings,'' when \nhusbands murder their wives for alleged infidelity or other acts deemed \nto impugn the man's honor, also continue to be a problem in Pakistan. \nYet the perpetrators of these crimes often escape punishment. Pakistani \nhuman rights organizations documented 1,458 cases of honor killings \nlast year, and many more likely went unreported. A study by Human \nRights Watch estimates that a woman in Pakistan is raped every 2 hours \nand that approximately 70-90 percent of women suffer from some form of \ndomestic violence.\n  The terrible stories of two Pakistani rape victims have been vividly \nportrayed in moving editorials by New York Times reporter Nicholas \nKristof. From Kristof we first learned about Mukhtar Mai, who was gang-\nraped in 2002 on the orders of a council of tribal elders, and also \nabout Dr. Shazia Khalid, a Pakistani physician who was raped in January \n2005 by a military officer in her place of employment.\n  These stories are tragic. But equally troubling is the cruel reality \nthat many rape victims in Pakistan are pressured to drop charges by the \nauthorities, as was the case for Dr. Khalid. Many who courageously \ndecide to press forward are ostracized, beaten or even jailed on \ncharges of adultery or fornication. What we are witnessing is an \narchaic and twisted judicial system where too often the victims are \npunished and the culprits go free. This practice of blaming and then \nabusing the victim is a disgrace.\n  At a time when the Bush administration is embracing President \nMusharraf and giving Pakistan huge amounts of aid on account of his \nsupport for the administration's policies in Afghanistan, it should use \nits influence to press Musharraf to act immediately to address the \nrampant abuse of Pakistani women. This includes abolishing the Hudood \nOrdinances, a harsh penal code introduced in 1979 by then-dictator \nGeneral Zia ul-Haq to Islamize the legal system. Unfortunately, \nPresident Musharraf has taken few concrete steps to protect women from \nthis discriminatory and backward legal system.\n  As we consider the plight of women in Pakistan and the tremendous \nobstacles they must surmount, the U.S. must take a hard look at the \nconsistency of our own policies, especially with respect to advancing \nhuman\n\n[[Page S11300]]\n\nrights around the globe. I was troubled to hear that the State \nDepartment declined to react to Musharraf's comments. When asked about \nthe interview by a member of the press, a Government spokesman skirted \nthe issue by stating that ``The United States Government speaks out \nvery clearly that violence against women, wherever it may occur, is \nunacceptable. And around the world, where this is a problem, we make a \npoint of speaking out against it.''\n  Unfortunately, the administration is not practicing what it preaches. \nThe administration missed an important opportunity to speak out against \na reprehensible allegation that women are using rape in order to make \nmoney and emigrate. In his inaugural address last year, the President \nstated that ``all who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the \nUnited States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your \noppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.'' \nI urge President Bush to live up to his promise to promote democracy \nand advance human rights and to not ignore the women of \nPakistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11300-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN HONOR OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH, SEPTEMBER 15-OCTOBER 15, 2005\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words \nin honor of the Latino communities of the United States. As my \ncolleagues know, September 15 to October 15 each year marks Hispanic \nHeritage Month. Throughout this month, the United States celebrates the \nhistory, culture, and traditions of Latinos as well as their \ncontributions to the United States. September 15 was selected as the \nfirst day for this special month because it marks the anniversary of \nindependence for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and \nNicaragua. Mexico and Chile also commemorate their independence days \nduring the month, on September 16 and September 18, respectively.\n  As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, we must also acknowledge the \nchallenges faced by this community. The Latino population is extremely \nvulnerable to economic downturns and experience high poverty rates, \nparticularly among working families with children. We must work to \ncontinue providing the infrastructure to assist families by \nstrengthening job training, child care, child nutrition, and \ntransportation. Furthermore, we must continue to lift the barriers on \neducation. Only 12 percent of Latinos have graduated from college. As \nnearly half of the Latino population is under age 25, it is crucial \nthat we provide access to higher educational opportunities. The Latino \ncommunity in the United States strives to succeed in all realms. \nProviding a solid educational foundation for the younger generation \nwill ensure continued growth and accomplishments by the community.\n  Today, there are 39.9 million Latinos in the United States, which is \nnearly 14 percent of the total population. Latinos live in every State \nand are vital contributors to every aspect of the future of our Nation. \nMy State of Washington is home to the 10th largest Latino population in \nthe United States. Fourteen percent of Latinos work in managerial and \nprofessional occupations. Twenty-one percent work as operators and \nlaborers, and another 22 percent work in service occupations. Not only \nare Latinos the fastest growing population in the United States, they \nare also the fastest growing group amongst small business owners. In \nthe past two decades, the number of Latino-owned businesses has grown \nby over 600 percent.\n  Such facts about the achievements about the Latino community should \nnot be surprising, as contributions by Latinos can be traced back \nthrough the history of the United States. On March 27, 1513, Juan Ponce \nde Leon's travels led him to a land he named ``La Florida.'' In 1541, \nHernando de Soto became the first European to discover the Mississippi \nRiver. Mexican and Spanish voyagers explored the Pacific Northwest as \nearly as 1774. Joseph Marion Hernandez, a member of the Whig party, \nserved as the first Latino Congressman between 1822 and 1823. In 1962, \nCesar Chavez established the National Farm Workers Association, which \nlater became the United Farm Workers. These examples further evidence \nthat the history of the Latinos in the United States is an integral \npart of our history as a Nation.\n  I am pleased to have this opportunity of Hispanic Heritage Month to \ngive thanks to and honor the Latino community. The accomplishments by \nLatinos throughout the centuries and their significant influence on our \nNation today are cause for celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11300-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11300-S11301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN RECOGNITION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH, OCTOBER 2005\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nDomestic Violence Awareness Month. As we mark the 11th anniversary of \nthe Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, which has given a voice to the \nthousands of women and children who had silently suffered the effects \nof domestic violence, we must continue to build on these protections \nfor victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.\n  The enactment of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act symbolized a \nsignificant Federal response to the problem of violence against women. \nThe original act rewrote Federal criminal law in several respects, \nincluding creating penalties for interstate stalking or domestic abuse, \nstrengthening penalties and requiring restitution for repeat sexual \noffenders, rendering a victim's past sexual behavior inadmissible in \nFederal cases, and allowing a Federal judge to order HIV testing of \nalleged rapists. VAWA also created a grant program to improve law \nenforcement in cases of violent crimes against women, rape prevention \nand education programs, and funds for battered women's shelters. \nEarlier this year, my home State of Washington received a grant of over \n$2.3 million through this program to help victims of domestic violence \nget access to needed services and to enhance the partnership between \ncriminal justice agencies, victim services providers, and community \norganizations which respond to domestic violence.\n  Since passing VAWA, local communities around the United States have \nmade significant strides toward eradicating domestic violence. Between \n1993 and 2001, the rate of nonfatal domestic violence dropped 49 \npercent. States have passed over 660 laws pertaining to domestic \nviolence, stalking, and sexual assault. Yet, despite our progress, a \nwoman in the United States is still more likely to be assaulted, \ninjured, raped, or killed by a male partner than by any other \nassailant. Three to four million American women continue to be battered \nby their husbands or partners every single year. At least a third of \nall female emergency room patients are battered women. A third of all \nhomeless women and children in the U.S. are fleeing domestic violence. \nAt least 5,000 women are beaten to death each year. This is \nunacceptable and we need to continue our efforts to eradicate domestic \nviolence.\n  As we consider all issues of domestic abuse, we need to also be aware \nof the advent of for-profit international marriage brokers--companies \nthat operate solely to connect men and women of different nations with \nthe intent of getting married. Today, experts put the number of \ninternational marriage brokers at nearly 500 worldwide. Based on the \n1999 statistics, there are between 20,000 and 30,000 women who have \nentered the U.S. using an international marriage broker in the past 5 \nyears. While many of these matches result in long, happy unions, there \nis an unfortunate growing epidemic of domestic abuse among couples who \nmeet through a broker. The risk of foreign women being abused and in \nsome cases murdered by men they meet through these mail-order bride \nagencies is heightened greatly when they do not have access to vital \ninformation about their potential husbands or their rights in the \nUnited States. In my home State of Washington, we know of at least 3 \ncases of serious domestic violence, including 2 murders of women who \nmet their husbands through Internet-based brokers.\n  On October 4, my colleagues unanimously passed legislation to \nreauthorize and improve the Violence Against Women Act once again. This \nlegislation includes language I authored that will make information \navailable to foreign women about the marital and violent criminal \nhistory of their prospective American husbands, in addition to\n\n[[Page S11301]]\n\nrequiring international marriage brokers to provide foreign fiances \nwith information about the rights and resources available to domestic \nviolence victims in the United States. Under current practice, American \nclients can get all the information they want about foreign fiancees, \nwhile foreign clients only receive information that the Americans \nchoose to share, and have no way to make sure what they are told is \ntrue. By providing foreign women who meet their potential American \nspouses with ability to access their potential spouse's marital and \ncriminal history, we are taking a further step to curb domestic \nviolence. The decisions we in Congress chose to make concerning the \nViolence Against Women Act of 2005 sets in place the priorities and \nfunding levels that will directly affect how we respond to and prevent \ndomestic violence in the coming years.\n  Because of its occurrence behind closed doors, many Americans are \nunaware of the severity of this problem. While domestic violence most \ndirectly affects women, it hurts us all, no matter our sex, race, \nreligion, or economic status. As our Nation recognizes Domestic \nViolence Awareness Month, let each of us consider what we can further \ndo to prevent its continuation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11301-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL PAYROLL WEEK\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would like to recognize \nNational Payroll Week, which was designated by the American Payroll \nAssociation as the week of September 5-9, 2005. This week signified an \nimportant effort to recognize the over 156 million working Americans \nand the payroll professionals who support the American economy by \npaying wages, reporting worker earnings, and withholding Federal \nemployment taxes.\n  Together, this hard working group of Americans contributes, collects, \nreports, and deposits approximately $1.4 trillion, or 71 percent, of \nthe annual revenue of the U.S. Treasury. Payroll professionals continue \nto play a key role in maintaining the economic health of the United \nStates by carrying out such diverse tasks as paying into the \nunemployment insurance system, providing information for child support \nenforcement, and carrying out tax withholding, reporting, and \ndepositing. Payroll professionals also work with Federal and State tax \nofficials to make the tax system more efficient and to improve \ncompliance.\n  National Payroll Week celebrated the contributions of American \nworkers and payroll professionals and the intricate role they play in \nour economy and everyday lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11301-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BILL WALSH\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a constituent \nand a pioneer in substance abuse treatment, Bill Walsh, who is retiring \nthis year.\n  Mr. Walsh grew up in New Bedford, MA, and attended Seton Hall \nUniversity. He served as a Radioman First Class in the U.S. Navy during \nWorld War II. Aboard the USS Hyter, he participated in the naval escort \nfor President Franklin Roosevelt as he flew to the conference at Yalta.\n  After he left the Navy, Bill Walsh nobly dedicated his life to \nhelping those in need of mental health services and those debilitated \nby alcohol and substance abuse. For 3 years, he served as the executive \ndirector of the Mental Health Association of Eastern Connecticut, where \nhe created community mental health services and educational seminars to \nmeet the needs of eastern Connecticut.\n  And, for the last 34 years, Mr. Walsh has served as the president of \nthe Southeastern Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence. In that \nposition, he oversaw the development of three halfway houses, a \ndetoxification program, outpatient services, and community-based \neducation programs. He has helped thousands confront the devastating \neffects of drug and alcohol abuse and take the difficult steps to \nrecovery.\n  Mr. Walsh was also a pioneer in long-term care in Connecticut. In \n1979 he developed the Lebanon Pines Treatment Facility for those with \nchronic alcoholism, who are invited to live and work at the rural, \nalcohol-free facility for an indefinite period. This program has no \ndoubt helped hundreds of individuals find sobriety.\n  Bill Walsh's selfless desire to truly help those in need is further \nevidenced by the extent to which he has been willing to share the vast \nknowledge that he gained working on the front lines. Over the last five \ndecades, he has strenuously lobbied the Connecticut legislature on \nbehalf of those suffering from addictions to drugs or alcohol and their \ntreatment providers. He has served on numerous boards and advisory \ncommittees dedicated to substance abuse treatment. And he has lectured \non substance abuse and community rehabilitation projects at colleges \nand universities in Connecticut and throughout our Nation.\n  Millions of Americans battle drug and alcohol addiction every day. \nBill Walsh has dedicated his life to making sure that they don't fight \nalone. For his tireless service, Connecticut and, indeed, the whole \nNation owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude.\n  Next week, a dinner will be held in honor of Bill Walsh's many \ncontributions to the field of substance abuse treatment and to raise \nmoney for a scholarship fund to support those who want to become \nsubstance abuse treatment professionals. Both the dinner and the \nscholarship fund are wonderful tributes to Bill's contributions to \nserving those who struggle each and every day with addiction.\n  Once again, I thank Bill Walsh for his years of dedicated service to \nhis community, to Connecticut, and to our Nation. And, I send my best \nwishes to him, his wife Cinda, and his family as he embarks on this new \nstage in his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11301-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11301-S11302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF LEON KLINGHOFFER\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, 20 years ago this month the world \nchanged forever for the family of Leon Klinghoffer. Mr. Klinghoffer was \na 69-year-old American Jewish retired appliance manufacturer from my \nState of New York. In October 1985, he and his wife Marilyn were \ncelebrating their 36th wedding anniversary by taking a vacation aboard \nthe Achille Lauro.\n  On October 7, 1985, four members of the Palestine Liberation Front \ntook control of the Achille Lauro liner off the coast of Egypt. While \nthese hijackers held the passengers and crew hostage, they directed the \nvessel to sail to Tartus, Syria, and demanded the release of 50 \nPalestinians then held in Israeli prisons. After being refused \npermission to dock at Tartus, the hijackers killed the wheelchair-bound \nLeon Klinghoffer and threw his body overboard into the sea.\n  Nothing can ever repair the mindless horror that act of terror \nvisited upon the innocent. Nothing can replace the love of a husband \nand father. Yet we can learn from this cowardly act of terror and \nothers like it. Indeed we must learn from it if we are to survive as a \nfree nation in a world stalked by the terrorist gun and bomb. We must \nunderstand that terrorism has gotten more dangerous to the United \nStates since Leon Klinghoffer's senseless murder. The Achille Lauro \nhijacking signaled the beginning of a new era and shattered illusions \nthat Americans were not vulnerable to international terrorism.\n  Mr. Klinghoffer's widow, Marilyn and his two daughters courageously \nsought to turn their grief into meaningful action by speaking out \nagainst the scourge of terrorism and establishing the Leon Klinghoffer \nMemorial Foundation of the Anti-Defamation League. Since Marilyn's \npassing in 1986, the foundation that now bears both their names \ncontinues to raise awareness about the growing reach, sophistication, \nand lethality of terrorism, to identify gaps in America's \ncounterterrorism law, and to advocate for their closure.\n  Having seen firsthand the destruction and pain caused by the murder \nof even one victim, the Klinghoffer family has reached out to other \nvictims of terror to share their support, strength and experience. The \nKlinghoffer Foundation has developed educational, political, and legal \nstrategies to enhance the fight against terror worldwide.\n  The Senate salutes Leon and Marilyn's two daughters, Lisa and Ilsa, \nwhose longtime education efforts helped put a human face on the threat \nof terrorism long before fighting terror became a necessary way of life \nfor\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\nAmericans, and whose advocacy has helped secure vital improvements in \nAmerican counterterrorism policy. And we join them in remembering Leon \nand Marilyn Klinghoffer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11302-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN HONOR OF MAJOR GENERAL STEPHEN R. LORENZ\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today \nto recognize one of the finest Air Force officers on active duty, MG \nStephen R. Lorenz. On September 6, General Lorenz left his present \nposition as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget to become Special \nAssistant to the Air Force Chief of Staff. During his time in \nWashington, and especially with regard to his work on Capitol Hill, \nGeneral Lorenz personified the Air Force core values of integrity \nfirst, service before self and excellence in all things. Many Members \nand staff enjoyed the opportunity to work with him on a variety of Air \nForce issues and came to appreciate his many talents. Today it is my \nprivilege to recognize some of Steve's many accomplishments since he \nentered the military 32 years ago, and to commend him for the superb \nservice he provided the Air Force, Congress, and our Nation.\n  Steve Lorenz earned a bachelor's degree in international affairs from \nthe U.S. Air Force Academy in 1973 and attended undergraduate pilot \ntraining at Craig Air Force Base, AL. From 1975 to 1980, he flew the \nEC-135 as aircraft commander at Ellsworth AFB, SD, and over the course \nof later assignments to Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, and Castle AFB, CA, \nattained the qualification of KC-135 instructor pilot. General Lorenz \ndemonstrated his skill as an aviator in the T-37, T-38, T-39, UV-18, \nEC-135A/G/C, KC-135A/R, KC-10A, and C-141B aircraft. He is a command \npilot with over 3,300 hours of flying time.\n  From early in his career, General Lorenz's exceptional leadership \nskills were evident to superiors and subordinates alike as he \nrepeatedly proved himself in numerous select command positions. He has \ncommanded an air refueling squadron, the 93rd Air Refueling Squadron, \nCastle AFB, CA, a geographically separated operations group, the 398th \nOperations Group, Castle AFB, CA and holds the distinct honor of four \nWing commands; the 22nd Air Refueling Wing, March AFB, CA, the 722nd \nAir Refueling Wing, March AFB, CA, the 305th Air Mobility Wing, McGuire \nAFB, NJ, and the 34th Training Wing, United States Air Force Academy, \nColorado Springs, CO, as the Commandant of Cadets. Under his command, \ntwo of those wings were recognized and honored as the ``Best Wings'' in \ntheir respective numbered Air Forces.\n  Steve Lorenz excelled in a variety of key staff assignments. These \ninclude serving as Director of Plans and Programs, Headquarters U.S. \nAir Forces in Europe; Chief, European and North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization Policy Branch, European Division, Directorate of Strategic \nPlans and Policy on the Joint Staff; Chief, Northeast Asia Branch, Far \nEast/South Asia Division, Directorate of Strategic Plans and Policy on \nthe Joint Staff; and Deputy Chief Senate Liaison Office. General Lorenz \nis also a published author providing articles to military journals on \nLeadership and the Air Force resource allocation process.\n  During his service to the 107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses, General \nLorenz served as our principal budget liaison with the Air Force, \nproviding clear, concise, and timely information on issues affecting \nsustainment, modernization and readiness of our airmen. Most \nimportantly, he proved an essential conduit between appropriators in \nCongress and frontline combat operations during Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, Operation Noble Eagle, and the global war on terrorism. In his \n4 years as Director of Budget, he developed, advocated, and executed \nover $37 billion of warfighter requirements through supplemental \nappropriations. General Lorenz's leadership, professionalism, and \nexpertise enabled him to foster exceptional rapport between the Air \nForce and the Senate, and enabled Congress to better understand Air \nForce priorities and programs.\n  I was pleased the President nominated and the Senate confirmed \nGeneral Lorenz for his third star with assignment as Commander, Air \nUniversity, Air Education and Training Command, Maxwell Air Force Base, \nAL. This higher grade and command are exceptionally well deserved. I \noffer my congratulations to him, his wife Leslie, and children, Tracy, \nStephen, and Kelly.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the dedication \nof the Federal courthouse building in Fresno, CA, which is to occur \nOctober 18.\n  The magnificent Federal courthouse building will provide the much-\nneeded space and capacity to effectively serve a region that is \ncontinuing to grow at a rapid rate. This building will help ensure the \nswift and efficient administration of justice to the people of the \nFresno Division of the Eastern District, which covers the counties of \nCalaveras, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, \nStanislaus, Tulare, and Tuolumne. Furthermore, this impressive edifice \nwill be the most tangible and powerful symbol of the American justice \nsystem to the people of the region.\n  In addition to meeting the needs of the court for additional space \nand related purposes, the Federal courthouse building will be a \ncenterpiece and catalyst for the continued renaissance of downtown \nFresno. The strikingly designed courthouse stands as part of the \ndowntown skyline that continues to grow. I am particularly pleased that \nthe Federal Government has been an integral partner in downtown \nrevitalization with this and other projects. Together, they have \nbrought thousands of employees to the area. I applaud the efforts of \nall those in the community who, through their commitment and \ndedication, helped make this latest addition to the downtown Fresno \nlandscape a reality.\n  I hope this courthouse will ultimately be named for Senior U.S. \nDistrict Judge Robert E. Coyle, a man who is widely and greatly admired \nand respected for his work as a judge. Judge Coyle has had a \ndistinguished career as an attorney and on the bench. Appointed to \nCalifornia's Eastern Court in 1982, Judge Coyle has served the Eastern \nDistrict for 20 years, including 6 years as a senior judge.\n  For over a decade, Judge Coyle has been a tireless champion of the \neffort to build this courthouse. He has been seen daily walking to and \nfrom the building site assuring that the job was done right, which I am \nproud to report is certainly the case. A courthouse building named in \nhis honor will stand as a testament to the people of California of the \ndistinguished career and the dedicated work of Judge Robert E. Coyle.\n  I am proud to commemorate the dedication of the Federal courthouse \nbuilding in Fresno, and wish its occupants and the people of the Fresno \nDivision of the Eastern District a bright future as we continue to work \nto bring justice and equality to all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11302-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11302-S11303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THANKING AND CONGRATULATING JANA DAVIS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, each year at about this time, \nthree dozen or so scientists descend on Capitol Hill looking to work \nfor Members of Congress or congressional committees. They come to us \noffering their expertise and service free of charge, courtesy of the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS. For over 30 \nyears now, AAAS and its constituent professional societies have \nprovided science fellows, and Congress and the Nation are better for \nit.\n  Science and technology dominate our lives and yet there are \nrelatively few scientists and engineers engaged in formulating public \npolicy, either as Members of Congress or as congressional staff. As \nCarl Sagan said, ``We live in a society exquisitely dependent on \nscience and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about\n\n[[Page S11303]]\n\nscience and technology.'' That is why the AAAS science fellows are so \nimportant.\n  Scientific expertise has never been more important than it is right \nnow. The Bush administration and its allies in and out of government \nare pursuing policies that seem to depend on repudiating science on \neverything from the environment to biomedical research to education. \nWhether we are talking about global warming or stem cell research or \nteaching evolution, this administration and the majority here in \nCongress too often ignore or dispute the solid consensus that exists in \nscientific communities with regard to these and other crucial issues.\n  For the past year, I have been fortunate to have Dr. Jana Davis work \nin my office as a AAAS science fellow. Her tenure has come to an end \nand she will soon start a new job with the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Agency, NOAA, so I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank her for her service here in the Senate and to congratulate her on \nher new job.\n  Jana is a New Jersey native who went to Yale University for her \nundergraduate degree in environmental biology. She received her Ph.D. \nin oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. After \nthat, she served as a postdoctoral fellow and biologist at the \nSmithsonian Environmental Research Center. She has held various \nteaching jobs and has a lengthy list of scholarly publications to her \ncredit.\n  In her short time here, Jana worked on a number of bills and became a \ntrusted adviser on a range of scientific issues, especially those which \nfall under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Environment & Public \nWorks and the Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation--two of \nthe three committees I serve on. For instance, Jana was the principal \nauthor of several measures I have introduced, including S. 1645, an \nocean and coastal science literacy and education bill; S. 1635, a bill \nto protect deep sea coral habitat; S. 1619, a bill to reduce pesticide \nuse in schools; and S. Res. 99, a resolution urging the U.S. delegation \nto the International Whaling Commission to press for an end to dolphin \nslaughter. Jana also drafted the ``Save Climate SCIENCE''--Scientific \nCredibility, Integrity, Ethics, Non-partisanship, Consistency, and \nExcellence--amendment I offered to H.R. 6, the Energy bill. And she \nserved as my representative in Commerce Committee staff negotiations on \nreauthorizing the Coastal Zone Management Act, ballast water exchange \nlegislation, and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act.\n  Jana has done a superb job during her fellowship. I have relied on \nher scientific expertise and she has shown a great aptitude for public \npolicy. I am grateful for her service and value her numerous \nsubstantive contributions. I regret that she is moving on but our loss \nhere in the Senate is NOAA's gain. She will do a superb job at NOAA.\n  I want to thank the American Geophysical Union for sponsoring Jana \nand the AAAS for sponsoring the science fellows program. The program is \ninvaluable because it brings talented, energetic, and idealistic \nscientists like Jana Davis to Capitol Hill. We need more people like \nthat here in Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11303-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11303-S11304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN SOLAR HOME IN SOLAR DECATHLON 2005\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, from October 7 through October 16, \n2005, the National Mall will be transformed into a solar village. The \nSolar Decathlon 2005 will showcase 18 solar homes designed, built, and \noperated by university teams from across the United States as well as \nCanada and Spain. Each of the university teams chosen for the decathlon \ncompeted in 10 contests that measured the aesthetics and livability of \nthe solar homes as well as their capacity to provide lighting, heat \nwater, and run household appliances, including a TV, refrigerator, and \ncomputer. Each team demonstrated the ability to power an electric car \nfrom the energy harnessed by the solar home--an important achievement \nin this day of skyrocketing fuel prices. I am proud that the Rhode \nIsland School of Design, known as RISD, is among the 18 participating \nteams in the Solar Decathlon.\n  The first Solar Decathlon, held on the Mall in 2002, received more \nthan 100,000 visitors. The decathlon, sponsored by the U.S. Department \nof Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, aims to \neducate policymakers and the public about alternative energy sources to \nimprove building design and quality of life. The competition motivates \nparticipating teams to use cutting-edge solar technologies, renewable \nmaterials, and energy-efficient building principles so that these \nfeatures will become part of the mainstream of home design.\n  RISD's solar home is a team effort on the part of more than 60 \nstudents and seven departments from both the Rhode Island School of \nDesign and Brown University. The team was led by architecture faculty \nmembers, William Yoder and Jonathan Knowles. These students worked for \n2 years on the production of an environmental and energy-smart home \ndesign while taking classes specifically geared toward this end. Last \nweek, they transported their solar home to Washington, DC, for assembly \non the National Mall.\n  The principle behind RISD's design is to incorporate high-tech solar \ntechnologies with low-tech materials that increase energy efficiency. \nThrough this combination, the students illustrated that designers and \nhomeowners do not need to be well-versed in complex technologies to \nincorporate solar into their homes. Furthermore, many of the materials \nused in the RISD solar home, while having high insulation values, are \nreclaimed--an effort on the part of the Rhode Island team to reduce \nconstruction waste.\n  As a design school, RISD was concerned about the attractiveness of \nthe materials and design principles, which will improve the \nmarketability of solar home features. Function and aesthetics led the \nteam to incorporate both a roof garden and a louvered skin. The \nlouvered skin is adaptable, so as to reflect heat during the day and \nkeep in heat during cold nights. Moreover, the skin provides \n``chameleon-like'' color variations and graphics that add to the home's \nartistic style as it tracks the cycle of the sun. The roof garden \nbrings an element of tranquility to the home's design but is also a \nsmart use of space for a home designed for an urban setting where a \nlawn is hard to find. This element is one that illustrates the team's \ngoal to blend the boundary between home and environment.\n  The Rhode Island team also created a home that is adapted to its \nsurroundings. Since the home was designed as an urban dwelling, it uses \na north/south orientation, allowing for the home to receive ample \nlighting if serving as a townhouse between adjacent homes. The RISD \nteam took into account the expansion of its townhouse style to a \ncommunity scale. With the addition of mirrored or identical units, the \nentire lot would collectively become more energy efficient. \nFurthermore, the variations in how these modules fit together would \ncreate open spaces that provide a private haven when juxtaposed against \nan urban backdrop.\n  The Rhode Island team applied great effort to the design of the \n``mechanical core'' that runs the heating, cooling, plumbing, and \nelectricity of the house. Centrally located, this unit minimizes the \nneed for ducts and piping throughout the home, thereby increasing \nenergy efficiency throughout the structure. RISD's house is so \nefficient that it produces enough reserve energy from the sun that it \nwill be able to power a car.\n  Upon conclusion of the competition, several teams will offer the \nhomes that they designed and built for educational or living use. The \nRISD students intend to transport their solar home back to Providence, \nRI, where it will serve as an example of smart building design for the \ncommunity.\n  The Solar Decathlon offers an opportunity to witness first hand the \ningenuity of the participating teams and the innovative solutions \navailable to Americans to reduce our energy demand and propel us on a \ncleaner and sustainable energy path. Visitors to the solar village will \nbe able to tour each of the 800 square-foot homes and ask the students \nquestions regarding their solar design and technology choices. \nWorkshops are scheduled throughout the week for visitors to learn how \nto incorporate into their homes both active and passive solar energy, \nimproved energy efficiency technologies, and biobased products. My\n\n[[Page S11304]]\n\nsincere congratulations to the Rhode Island team for a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11304-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NORMAN L. KIRKHAM\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nmany years of service Norman ``Norm'' L. Kirkham has provided to the \npeople of southern West Virginia. For the last 19 years, Mr. Kirkham \nhas held the position of executive director of the West Virginia Region \nI Planning and Development Council and worked tirelessly on various \nprojects during the 10 years prior to that. This organization is a \nnonprofit public agency that coordinates with the Federal, State, and \nlocal governments to provide comprehensive planning for the coalfields \nof southern West Virginia. After numerous years of working with the \ncitizens of McDowell, Mercer, Monroe, Raleigh, Summers, and Wyoming \nCounties to improve their quality of life and develop the regional \neconomy, Norm is retiring effective October 31, 2005.\n  Many of Norm's colleagues praise him for his active role as the \ndriving force behind the scenes, turning proposed plans and ideas into \neconomic realities for southern West Virginia. One such example is a \nproject to bring a new Federal prison to McDowell County, West \nVirginia. Over the last decade, I have worked alongside Norm to help \ndevelop a site for the prison and secure approval for the prison. As a \nresult of his relentless hard work and determination, the new Federal \nprison will create 350 high-paying jobs in an area that desperately \nneeds them. I am enormously proud to have worked with Norm on this and \nso many projects.\n  During his tenure as executive director, Norm has helped to secure \nfunds to provide flood relief to the flood-prone valleys and riverbanks \nof southern West Virginia, enhanced the water systems in towns such as \nPrinceton, Welch, and Union, and lobbied for grant money to support \nsenior citizen centers. In addition to advancing specific economic \ndevelopment projects, Norm has helped ease access to technology, \nsewage, and other forms of infrastructure throughout southern West \nVirginia.\n  Without a doubt, Norm has contributed a great deal to his agency and \nto the people of southern West Virginia. His contributions are even \nmore impressive when one considers the dire need for economic \ndevelopment in the southern West Virginia coalfields. Traditionally, \nthe economy of southern West Virginia has relied heavily on the coal \nindustry. Through coordination and planning, Norm and his agency have \nhelped diversify the region's economy and tremendously enhance the \ninfrastructural needs that are vital to development in southern West \nVirginia. Many successful economic development sites can be attributed \nto Norm's dedication to promoting and developing economic prosperity \nfor every person and family in his region. Public servants in his line \nof work normally do not receive the recognition they deserve. Our State \nneeds more people like Norm who dedicate their entire professional \ncareers to ensure that people have adequate employment, roads, water, \nsewage, and other services and infrastructural needs commonly taken for \ngranted.\n  Always modest and never in the limelight, Norm is firmly rooted in \nrural Summers County where he inherited the values that make southern \nWest Virginia a unique and wonderful area--service to community and \nnation and dedication to family and neighbors. Through his hard work \nand integrity, Norm has earned the respect of every local official in \nsouthern West Virginia; Federal and State officials; Governors, past \nand present; and the Members of the congressional delegation.\n  In retirement, Norm can more fully devote himself to what he \ncherishes most in life--his family, his Summers County farm and his \ncommunity. He will surely be missed at Region I and throughout all of \nWest Virginia, but he leaves a career of good work that will last \ngenerations.\n  I will sincerely miss working with Norm but I suspect even in \nretirement, some very worthwhile community projects are going to find \nthemselves in need of a seasoned volunteer just like him. Regardless, I \nwish him the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11304-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING COLONEL JOSEPH JULIAN McLACHLAN\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \nlegacy of COL Joseph Julian McLachlan. Colonel McLachlan is a World War \nII hero and a proud Air Force veteran who died at the age of 85 in late \nJuly. Next week, he will be interred at Arlington National Cemetery. \nWith the honors of a full military funeral, he will take his rightful \nplace alongside America's greatest heroes, Medal of Honor recipients \nand veterans going back to the American Revolution.\n  Born in 1920, Joseph McLachlan enlisted in the Army Air Corps at the \nstart of World War II. He completed his pilot training and was \ncommissioned in 1942. As part of the famed 368th Fighter Group, \nMcLachlan flew two strafing missions in support of ground troops on D-\nDay. Six days later, he was shot down and hid behind enemy lines until \nhe could rejoin American troops. Over the course of the war, he \ncompleted 91 missions as a P-47 pilot. He earned a Silver Star, \nDistinguished Flying Cross, Purple Heart, 17 Air Medals, and the Legion \nof Merit.\n  Today, more than 60 years later, it is hard to recapture the \ntremendous uncertainty that America faced at the eve of the Normandy \ninvasion. Operation Overlord employed more than 5,000 ships and landing \ncraft, more than 12,000 airplanes, and more than 150,000 troops. Their \nbravery carried the day and led to the victory of freedom and democracy \nover tyranny and oppression. Ordinary Americans like Joseph McLachlan \ngave the best years of their lives to the greatest mission this country \nhas ever taken on. The world owes them a huge debt of gratitude.\n  After the war, McLachlan stayed in the military. In 1948, he flew 44 \nmissions in the Berlin Airlift, one of the first major crises of the \nCold War. A command pilot, McLachlan led a B-47 Squadron at MacDill Air \nForce Base in Tampa. He was vice-commander of Zaragoza Air Base in \nSpain and Commander of Lincoln Air Base in Nebraska. He retired as \nChief of Foreign Liaison at the Pentagon.\n  After leaving the military, Colonel McLachlan went on to have a \nsuccessful 19-year career in the private sector. His greatest legacy is \nhis large and loving family. He had 6 children, 10 grandchildren, and 7 \ngreat-grandsons.\n  Mr. President, COL Joseph McLachlan was a great American. As we \nprepare to lay his remains to rest at Arlington, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in honoring him and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11304-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Saunders, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11304-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11304-5", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11304-S11305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 8:54 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Brandon, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1413.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to requesting the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to provide for federal \n     deployment of the Strategic National Stockpile within Mexico; \n     to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                     Senate Concurrent Resolution 2\n\n       Whereas, Created in 1999 to help state and local \n     jurisdictions prepare for a national emergency, the Strategic \n     National Stockpile is a repository of pharmaceuticals and \n     medical supplies administered jointly by the United States \n     Department of Homeland Security and United States Department \n     of Health and Human Services; and\n       Whereas, Currently, if an act of bioterrorism occurs within \n     Mexico near the United States border, it is up to each United \n     States border state, including Texas, to request and deploy \n     the Strategic National Stockpile across the border to protect \n     the citizens of the state; and\n       Whereas, Procedures for deploying Strategic National \n     Stockpile assets require the affected state governor's office \n     to request deployment from the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention or the Department of Homeland Security; \n     although the assets are transferred to state and local \n     authorities once they arrive at the designated receiving and \n     storage site in the affected state, the stockpile materials \n     remain a federal asset; and\n       Whereas, Deployment, which may include a mass antibiotic \n     dispensing operation, requires substantial state and local \n     resources to receive, secure, and distribute Strategic \n     National Stockpile assets; staging and dispensing the assets \n     in another country requires a coordinated, comprehensive \n     approach that is best addressed by the federal government; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Homeland Security Act of 2002 charged the \n     United States Department of Homeland Security with defining \n     the goals and performance requirements of the Strategic \n     National Stockpile program as well as managing the actual \n     deployment of assets; critical to the success of this \n     initiative is ensuring capacity at the federal level to \n     respond to binational public health emergencies; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully request the Congress of the United States \n     to enact legislation to provide for federal deployment of the \n     Strategic National Stockpile within Mexico, provided that the \n     Mexican government approves said request pursuant to treaties \n     and other agreements with the United States; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-189. A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to legislation to authorize \n     National Guard members to enroll in Department of Defense \n     managed health care program; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 282\n\n       Whereas, The United States of America is founded on the \n     principle of citizen-soldiers safeguarding our national \n     security, a construct that is as essential today as it was \n     more than 368 years ago when the National Guard was \n     established; and\n       Whereas, The oldest military institution in the United \n     States, the National Guard has been, since its founding in \n     1636, a community-based force composed of citizen-soldiers, \n     the members of the Army and Air National Guard serving the \n     nation in time of war and their states in time of domestic \n     emergency; and\n       Whereas, As our nation continues to fight the War on \n     Terrorism and our military forces continue to be engaged in \n     operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan, we are, more than \n     ever, dependent on the National Guard to defend the United \n     States, both overseas and at home; and\n       Whereas, More than 197,000 soldiers of the Army National \n     Guard and 31,000 members of the Air National Guard have been \n     mobilized since September 11, 2001, the largest mobilization \n     of the National Guard since World War II; and\n       Whereas, At this time, more than 51,000 Army Guardsmen are \n     on the ground in Iraq and 15,000 are serving in Afghanistan, \n     and sadly, more than 100 National Guard members have made the \n     ultimate sacrifice; and\n       Whereas, Whether serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan \n     theaters or at home in the US, National Guard members are \n     operating side-by-side with their active-duty counterparts; \n     and\n       Whereas, With a presence in more than 3,000 communities \n     across the nation, the National Guard is also playing a \n     crucial role in homeland security; and\n       Whereas, The ``Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention \n     Act of 2005,'' embodied in S. 337 and H.R. 558, are currently \n     pending before the 109th United States Congress; and\n       Whereas, In part, this legislation extends TRICARE \n     coverage, the managed health care system for the U.S. \n     military, on a contributory basis, to all members of the \n     National Guard, regardless of mobilization status; and\n       Whereas, In light of their expanded role in military \n     operations overseas and national security at home in our \n     post-9/11 society, a re-evaluation of our nation's commitment \n     to the citizen-soldiers of the National Guard is in order; \n     and\n       Whereas, These brave men and women deserve more than our \n     thanks, they deserve more substantial personnel and readiness \n     benefits that ensure the National Guard will continue to \n     attract the best and brightest, from the active-duty \n     component of the military as well as the civilian population; \n     and\n       Whereas, The provision of adequate health care coverage to \n     each and every citizen-soldier of the National Guard would \n     repay but a small portion of our nation's debt to these \n     exceptional men and women who are vigilantly defending our \n     homeland, both at home and abroad; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House calls upon the United States Congress to \n     provide health care benefits for National Guard members and \n     their families by authorizing a member to enroll, on a \n     contributory basis, for individual or family coverage under \n     the TRICARE program, regardless of mobilization status.\n       2. This House urges that the United States Congress pass \n     and the President of the United States approve the ``Guard \n     and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005,'' now \n     pending in the 109th Congress as S. 337 and H.R. 558, which \n     authorizes a member of the National Guard to enroll for \n     individual or family coverage under the TRICARE program, a \n     Department of Defense managed health care program.\n       3. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested by the Clerk \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to the Vice President of the \n     United States, the Majority Leader of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives and to every member of Congress elected from \n     this State.\n                                  ____\n\n  POM-190. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \nState of Texas relative to fully funding the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration budget request in support\n\n[[Page S11306]]\n\nof the Space Exploration Vision for fiscal year 2006; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                      House Concurrent Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The Legislature of the State of Texas is pleased \n     to pay tribute to National Aeronautics to Space \n     Administration (NASA), whose intrepid explorations of space \n     and important scientific discoveries have inspired and \n     benefited the people of our nation and state; and\n       Whereas, The Space Exploration Vision has set a goal of \n     returning the Space Shuttle to flight, completing assembly of \n     the International Space Station, developing the Crew \n     Exploration Vehicle, returning humans to the moon, and \n     pursuing and human exploration of Mars and the solar system; \n     and\n       Whereas, NASA's landmark achievement in putting the first \n     man on the moon, astronaut Neil Armstrong, on July 20, 1969, \n     captured the imagination of people everywhere; and\n       Whereas, This new and major accomplishment ushered in new \n     and exciting technological advances that have benefited our \n     nation's security and cellular communications; NASA has also \n     advanced our health care system through the development of \n     MRI and CAT scan technology, fetal heart monitors, \n     programmable heart pacemakers, and other important medical \n     devices; and\n       Whereas, Through education programs like Texas Aerospace \n     Scholars, the NASA Explorer Schools, and the Network of \n     Educator Astronaut Teachers, NASA is nurturing a new \n     generation of explorers and scientists who can contribute to \n     our nation's excellence; and\n       Whereas, NASA plays a vital role in the economy of the Lone \n     Star State, by employing nearly 3,000 civil servants and \n     approximately 13,000 contractors at the Johnson Space Center \n     and by awarding almost $4 billion worth of NASA contracts \n     annually; small businesses across Texas with technical \n     challenges have benefited from the support of the aerospace \n     industry, NASA, and the State of Texas' support of the \n     Technology Outreach Program, resulting in new business \n     ventures within the state; and\n       Whereas, The Space Exploration Vision has the potential to \n     further drive innovation, development, and advancement in the \n     aerospace and other high technology industries across the \n     nation and in the State of Texas; and\n       Whereas, The extraordinary contributions of NASA to science \n     and technology are the pride of our state, and the Space \n     Exploration Vision is truly deserving of legislative \n     recognition; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge all members of the United States \n     Congress to fully fund the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration budget request in support of the Space \n     Exploration Vision, as submitted to the congress for fiscal \n     year 2006, to enable the United States, and the State of \n     Texas, to remain leaders in the exploration and development \n     of space; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the administrator of \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to the \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives and the president of the Senate of the \n     United States Congress, and to all members of the Texas \n     delegation to the Congress with the request that this \n     resolution be officially entered in the Congressional Record \n     as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-191. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to corporate average fuel \n     economy standards; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, California has more than 26 million registered \n     motor vehicles and\n       Whereas, California represents at least 12 percent of the \n     light-duty vehicle market in the United States; and\n       Whereas, Californians consume more than 18 billion gallons \n     of motor fuel annually; and\n       Whereas, A study adopted by the State Energy Resources \n     Conservation and Development Commission (California Energy \n     Commission) and the State Air Resources Board (California Air \n     Resources Board) projects that demand for onroad gasoline \n     fuel will increase by about 1.6 percent annually between now \n     and 2020; that onroad diesel demand will increase by about \n     2.4 percent annually between now and 2020; and that the \n     number of miles that Californians drive is growing at a rate \n     greater than the population growth; and\n       Whereas, California's refineries are operating at near \n     capacity, and California is importing more gasoline and \n     diesel fuel annually to meet this growing demand; and\n       Whereas; The combination of greater dependence on imported \n     fuels and vulnerability to refinery outages exposes \n     California's economy to more frequent and higher fuel price \n     spikes; and\n       Whereas, Fuel price spike vulnerability creates a business \n     climate with diminished certainty about anticipated expenses; \n     and\n       Whereas, Petroleum extraction, refining, and use are \n     significant sources of pollution and environmental \n     degradation in California and around the world; and\n       Whereas, Motor vehicle fuel economy dramatically affects \n     fuel demand; and\n       Whereas, A study adopted by the California Energy \n     Commission and the California Air Resources Board determined \n     that doubling the fuel economy of the nation's light-duty \n     motor vehicle fleet is technically achievable and will result \n     in important reductions in consumer demand for fuel; and\n       Whereas, Only the federal government has the authority to \n     require motor vehicle fuel economy improvements through the \n     corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard; and\n       Whereas, In recent years, the nationwide motor vehicle \n     fleet fuel economy has declined as motor vehicles have become \n     larger, heavier, and less aerodynamic; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress, through its \n     legislative powers, and the President of the United States, \n     through the President's administrative powers, are in \n     position to require a significant increase in the CAFE \n     standard; and\n       Whereas, The National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration's current rulemaking raising CAFE standards \n     for light-duty trucks and sport utility vehicles by just 1.5 \n     miles per gallon above the 1996 levels, over three years, \n     bringing total requirements far below requirements for \n     passenger cars, is insufficient to address the critical need \n     to improve fuel economy and reduce fuel demand; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the Congress and the President of the \n     United States to take necessary action to increase CAFE \n     standards by at least 1.5 miles per gallon per annum until \n     total average fuel economy for the new light-duty motor \n     vehicle fleet sold in California is double today's average; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to all Members of the Congress of the United States, \n     and to the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-192. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to establishing a domestic \n     energy policy that will ensure an adequate supply of natural \n     gas, the appropriate infrastructure, and a concerted national \n     effort to promote greater energy efficiency and that will \n     open promising new areas for environmentally responsible \n     natural gas production; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                      Senate Concurrent Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The price of natural gas in the United States is \n     among the highest in the industrial world and continues to \n     show great volatility; and\n       Whereas, Abnormally high natural gas prices have been an \n     unanticipated burden on the economy of the United States over \n     the past 18 months; and\n       Whereas, The United States is reliant on natural gas in our \n     national energy supply, and forecasts predict a future \n     imbalance between natural gas supply and demand; and\n       Whereas, Manufacturers, farmers, small businesses, local \n     governments, and retailers are struggling from the \n     uncertainty in natural gas prices, and thousands of jobs are \n     threatened because many businesses use natural gas as a raw \n     material as well as a source of energy; and\n       Whereas, The natural gas imbalance is not a free-market \n     problem; the high price of natural gas is created by \n     governmental policies that increase demand for natural gas \n     while impeding the development of a greater supply of natural \n     gas by discouraging more exploration and production; and\n       Whereas, The United States needs policies to encourage and \n     ensure the safe and efficient domestic production and \n     importation of natural gas; and\n       Whereas, The State of Texas supports a sound, domestic \n     energy policy; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the United States Congress to enact \n     legislation in the 109th Congress establishing a domestic \n     energy policy that will ensure an adequate supply of natural \n     gas the appropriate infrastructure, and a concerted national \n     effort to promote greater energy efficiency and that will \n     open promising new areas for environmentally responsible \n     natural gas production; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas Secretary of State forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the President of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the Congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-193.

[U.S.] United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, and various concerned \n     federal, state and local agencies; and\n       Whereas, The Passaic River and its surrounding wetlands \n     have been degraded as a\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\n     result of [the State's] commercial growth in the State that \n     brought industrial development to the [Passaic's] shores of \n     the Passaic River and surrounding properties; and\n       Whereas, The Passaic River, which traverses New Jersey \n     through Newark, is an ideal pilot [for the proposed PRRI as \n     appropriated by Congress] project to showcase nationally the \n     restoration of urban waterways, wildlife habitat, and one of \n     America's most historic rivers; and\n       Whereas, Under the PRRI, the [U.S.] United States Army \n     Corps of Engineers will engage in a cooperative project \n     planning and development process to identify and apply \n     feasible solutions to achieve environmental restoration and \n     economic revitalization of the Passaic River; and\n       Whereas, The results of the project development process \n     will be incorporated in a report to Congress from the Chief \n     of Engineers as project implementation will require \n     authorization by Congress; and\n       Whereas, The PRRI is related to several other current major \n     federal initiatives, such as those under [Brownfields \n     Redevelopment] brownfields redevelopment, the NY/NJ Harbor \n     Estuary Program, and the Natural Resources Damage Assessment \n     and Restoration Program; and\n       Whereas, On April 11, 2000 the Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure in the United States House of \n     Representatives approved a resolution authorizing the [U.S.] \n     United States Army Corps of Engineers to conduct the Passaic \n     River Environmental Restoration reconnaissance study, which \n     is currently underway by the [Corps'] New York district of \n     the United States Army Corps of Engineers; and\n       Whereas, It is in the best interest of the State to support \n     the enactment of the Passaic River Restoration Initiative in \n     order to restore and preserve [the Passaic River to] healthy \n     environmental and economic conditions in and along the \n     Passaic River; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House urges the United States Congress to support \n     the Passaic River Restoration Initiative in order to restore \n     and preserve the Passaic River to healthy environmental and \n     economic conditions, and to provide the funding for the \n     federal share of the project development process and the \n     necessary study funds of the [U.S.] United States Army Corps \n     of Engineers to advance the Passaic River Restoration \n     Initiative.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of New Jersey relative to rejecting \n     privatizing Social Security; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 94\n\n       Whereas, Social Security is based on a promise to the \n     American people: if you work hard and contribute to Social \n     Security, you will be able to retire and live in dignity; and\n       Whereas, Social Security is the primary source of income \n     for two-thirds of American seniors; and\n       Whereas, The State of New Jersey recognizes that over \n     1,363,814 beneficiaries in this State, including 140,693 \n     disabled workers and their families, as well as over 100,000 \n     children, receive guaranteed Social Security benefits which \n     allow them to live without falling into poverty or suffering \n     from a diminished quality of life because of retirement, \n     disability, or the death of a parent or spouse; and\n       Whereas, As of January 2005 (the most recent data \n     available) Social Security benefits for retired workers \n     average only $965.32 per month, which amount is barely \n     sufficient to maintain a decent standard of living in many \n     parts of New Jersey, especially for seniors with relatively \n     high health care costs; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. Congress has consistently spent the \n     Social Security surplus on other programs including tax cuts, \n     which has created a long-term funding shortfall; and\n       Whereas, In 2001 President George W. Bush created the \n     President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security \n     (referred to in this resolution as the ``Bush Social Security \n     Commission''), naming as Commission members only those who \n     advocated Social Security privatization, and mandating that \n     the proposals put forward by the Commission include \n     privatization of Social Security; and\n       Whereas, The Bush Social Security Commission's proposed \n     changes could reduce Social Security benefits to future \n     retirees by as much as 46 percent; and\n       Whereas, Under the Bush Social Security Commission's \n     proposal, the cuts in Social Security benefits would apply to \n     all seniors, not just those who choose to participate in \n     privatized accounts; and\n       Whereas, The cuts in Social Security benefits could be even \n     deeper if individuals shift funds to privatized accounts; and\n       Whereas, Privatization advocates attempt to justify cuts in \n     Social Security benefits by pointing to future projected \n     shortfalls in the Social Security trust fund, but diversion \n     of payroll tax revenues from the trust fund into privatized \n     accounts would substantially accelerate the date by which the \n     Social Security trust fund becomes insolvent; and\n       Whereas, In order to avoid accelerating the insolvency of \n     the Social Security trust fund, the Bush Social Security \n     Commission was forced to propose that the Federal Government \n     incur as much as $4,700,000,000,000 in Federal debt (in \n     today's dollars) by 2042; and\n       Whereas, The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     predicts that there will be no shortfall until 2052, when \n     Social Security will be able to pay only 80% of recipients' \n     benefits due to insufficient revenue from the payroll tax, if \n     no action is taken in the meantime; and\n       Whereas, In the past, the Social Security Trust Fund has \n     encountered similar challenges, including larger projected \n     shortfalls during the 1980's, which were resolved without \n     privatization schemes and without reducing guaranteed \n     benefits for the elderly, the disabled, and children; and\n       Whereas, Private accounts would not only reduce guaranteed \n     benefits, but would also speed up the Social Security \n     shortfall, causing recipients to receive reduced benefits by \n     the year 2018 instead of 2052; and\n       Whereas, The deep cuts in Social Security benefits proposed \n     by the Bush Social Security Commission could jeopardize the \n     financial security of not only thousands of New Jersey \n     residents but also the security of millions of Americans; and\n       Whereas, Under President Bush's proposal, guaranteed Social \n     Security protections to the elderly, disabled, survivors, and \n     children will gradually erode for future generations, driving \n     millions of Americans into poverty and destroying the most \n     successful social insurance program ever created in the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, It is recognized that Social Security faces future \n     challenges, but powerful members in both the President's \n     party and the opposition do not find the solution in \n     privatizing the most successful government program in our \n     nation's history; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. This House respectfully memorializes the Congress of the \n     United States to reject the Social Security privatization \n     proposals of the President's Social Security Commission that \n     would create private accounts, require deep cuts in \n     guaranteed Social Security benefits and lead to excessive \n     federal borrowing.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the President of the Senate and attested by the Secretary of \n     the Senate, shall be transmitted to the presiding officers of \n     the Congress of the United States and each member of New \n     Jersey's Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-195. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to eliminating current caps on \n     funded Medicare resident training positions and related \n     limits on costs per resident used to determine Medicare \n     graduate medical education reimbursement payments and to \n     reexamine the direct and indirect graduate medical education \n     reimbursement rates for graduate medical education in Texas; \n     to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                      Senate Concurrent Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Two major phases comprise the American system of \n     medical education--medical school, consisting of classroom \n     and clinical training, and the several years of graduate \n     medical education completed during a student's residency, \n     typically in an accredited medical education program at a \n     teaching hospital or academic health center; and\n       Whereas, Significant funding for this postgraduate training \n     is provided through Medicare's graduate medical education \n     program, whereby the federal government reimburses teaching \n     hospitals and certain other facilities for a portion of the \n     costs associated with operating health education programs; \n     and\n       Whereas, Medicare's funding includes two categories of \n     reimbursement payments, direct graduate medical education \n     payments and indirect graduate medical education payments; \n     direct graduate medical education payments cover the costs of \n     resident stipends, salaries for supervising faculty \n     positions, and administrative expenses associated with the \n     residency program; indirect graduate medical education \n     payments cover the increased operating expenses resulting \n     from training residents, such as greater technological needs, \n     longer patient stays, and the ordering of a greater number of \n     tests; and\n       Whereas, The amount of Medicare's reimbursement to a \n     teaching hospital is partially determined by the number of \n     full-time equivalent residents enrolled in the facility's \n     graduate medical education program; however, in 1997, the \n     federal Balanced Budget Act considerably reduced the amount \n     of federal support for graduate medical education programs by \n     limiting the number of full-time equivalent residents that \n     hospitals can use in calculating direct graduate medical \n     education payments and indirect graduate medical education \n     payments and by scheduling an estimated 29 percent further \n     reduction in indirect graduate medical education payments \n     over a five-year period; and\n       Whereas, The rates of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services payments for direct graduate medical education in \n     Texas are already significantly lower than those in many\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\n     comparable states, largely based on historical differences, \n     and the potential consequences of these caps and the \n     resulting reductions in federal graduate medical education \n     reimbursement are severe; teaching hospitals and the training \n     they provide to physicians and other health professionals are \n     a critical component of the American health care system--\n     these facilities are the vanguard of medical research and \n     technology and provide a broader range of an increasingly \n     diverse and sicker patient care to population than general \n     hospitals; and\n       Whereas, In addition, teaching hospitals are a traditional \n     fixture of the health care ``safety net,'' serving uninsured \n     and underinsured patients; the importance of this service to \n     Texans is evident in light of United States Census Bureau \n     reports indicating that nearly 25 percent of the state's \n     population is not covered by health insurance; and\n       Whereas, More specifically, the resident caps threaten the \n     future availability of health care professionals and with the \n     population of the nation aging, the demand for doctors and \n     other health care professionals is increasing; in fact, a \n     2003 study commissioned by the United States Department of \n     Health and Human Services Bureau of Health Professions at the \n     National Center for Health Workforce Analysis forecasts a \n     greater need for physicians and nurses by 2020 if current \n     health care consumption and physician productivity remain \n     constant; and\n       Whereas, Furthermore, the study found that the health care \n     workforce is also aging and will retire just as their \n     services are most needed and that the proportion of the \n     population age 18 to 30 is declining, impeding efforts to \n     recruit an adequate number of new health care workers; and\n       Whereas, Congress has acknowledged the deleterious effects \n     of the federal Balanced Budget Act caps and made bipartisan \n     efforts to diminish its effect on graduate medical education \n     programs: the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP) Balanced Budget Refinement Act of \n     1999 froze indirect graduate medical education payments for \n     one year and the Medicare prescription Drug, Improvement and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 increased indirect graduate medical \n     education payments slightly for federal fiscal years 2004 and \n     2005; and\n       Whereas, Nevertheless, these measures offered only brief \n     and minor reprieves to the dramatic reductions in indirect \n     graduate medical education reimbursement payments and did not \n     directly address the issue of federal caps in resident \n     training positions though, clearly, the caps and the \n     decreased commitment to indirect graduate medical education \n     funding continue to endanger the entire system of medical \n     education in the United States; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully encourage the Congress of the United \n     States to eliminate current caps on funded Medicare resident \n     training positions and related limits on costs per resident \n     used to determine Medicare graduate medical education \n     reimbursement payments and to reexamine the direct and \n     indirect graduate medical education reimbursement rates for \n     graduate medical education in Texas; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the President of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-196. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to port customs revenue; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, The State of California is committed to protecting \n     and preserving its ports, and those employed in and around \n     the ports; and\n       Whereas, The state supports the safe and reliable \n     transportation of goods into and through the state; and\n       Whereas, California is home to more than 12 percent of the \n     nation's population; and\n       Whereas, The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which \n     together transport 43 percent of the nation's trade, 1 \n     million cruise passengers, and more than $200,000,000,000 in \n     trade annually, comprise the largest port complex in the \n     United States and the Western Hemisphere; and\n       Whereas, California serves as an international commerce \n     gateway between the nation and most of its trade partners \n     and, according to the California Transportation Commission, \n     California moves over $400,000,000,000 in goods annually with \n     a source or destination outside of California; and\n       Whereas, Forecasts predict that the amount of trade \n     transported through the state's ports will triple by 2020 if \n     adequate infrastructure improvements are completed; and\n       Whereas, California is the single largest trading entity in \n     the United States, and three of the four largest volume \n     container ports in the United States are located in \n     California; and\n       Whereas, California ports, harbors, and businesses that \n     depend on federal channels and breakwaters contribute more \n     than $40,000,000,000 per year to national economic output, \n     1.6 million jobs, and approximately $21,000,000,000 annual \n     personal income to the United States economy; and\n       Whereas, Federal grants for security upgrades mandated by \n     the United States Department of Homeland Security amount to \n     just over $51,000,000, while it is estimated that these \n     security upgrades will cost California's three major \n     container ports an estimated $200,000,000 to install; and\n       Whereas, The American Association of Port Authorities has \n     called for the federal government to provide $400,000,000 in \n     port security funds annually; and\n       Whereas, The United States Coast Guard has additionally \n     estimated that it will require $7,300,000,000 in federal \n     funds for its own maritime security duties during 10-year \n     period of 2003 to 2012, inclusive; and\n       Whereas, Limited federal port security funds have fallen \n     short of fully funding port security needs throughput the \n     nation; and\n       Whereas, On August 25, 2004, Stephen E. Flynn, the Jeanne \n     J. Kirkpatrick Senior Fellow for National Security Studies at \n     the Council on Foreign Relations testified to the House \n     Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation on \n     the risk of terrorist attacks, stating that ``the risk of \n     harm is great or greater in the maritime and surface \n     transportation modes''; and\n       Whereas, An internal audit report produced by the United \n     States Department of Homeland Security entitled ``Review of \n     the Port Security Grant Program'' criticized the \n     ineffectiveness of the federal port security grant program \n     stating, in part, that the ``current design of the program \n     compromises the program's ability to direct resources toward \n     the nation's highest priorities''; and\n       Whereas, A Public Policy Institute of California study \n     entitled, ``Federal Formula Grants and California: Homeland \n     Security,'' has found that California receives only $5 per \n     person to distribute to first responders in the state, while \n     other states, such as Wyoming, received more than $38 per \n     capita in 2004; and\n       Whereas, California received only $23.71 per capita in \n     Homeland Security grant funding during fiscal years 2002-03 \n     and 2003-04, ranking 44th in the nation; and\n       Whereas, Federal port security grants cannot be used for \n     maintenance and operations expenditures related to security, \n     thereby complicating emergency communications and operations \n     duties expected of first responders; and\n       Whereas, A number of ports are located on state tidelands \n     and, therefore, must act as stewards of the land and manage \n     those lands in a manner that benefits all Californians; and\n       Whereas, A shut down of the ports can result in an \n     estimated loss to the national economy of more than \n     $1,000,000,000 per day, as demonstrated during the shutdown \n     of the west coast ports in 2002; and\n       Whereas, California ports are responsible for \n     $8,000,000,000 of the $20,000,000,000 that the United States \n     Customs Service collects annually in fees and duties, and \n     none of that revenue is reinvested in the state's or \n     country's system for moving goods because customs fees are \n     deposited into the General Fund; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to increase federal funding for \n     California's ports for infrastructure and security \n     improvements; and be it further\n       Resolved, That legislation be enacted, in recognition of \n     the unique role served by ports in California, to ensure a \n     return of an equitable share of the customs revenues \n     generated by, and collected from, this state; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature supports efforts by \n     California's congressional and senate representatives to \n     obtain an equitable share of federal port security and goods \n     movement infrastructure funding and encourages those \n     representatives to support measures that will guarantee that \n     California has the funds necessary to secure and facilitate \n     commercial activity at its many ports; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, and to the Director of the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-197. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to Darfur; to the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, Sudan's government and southern rebels have come \n     to an historic, long-awaited agreement that ends Africa's \n     longest civil war and brings hope to millions of exiled \n     Sudanese yearning to return home; and\n       Whereas, Continued violence in the troubled region of \n     Darfur, Sudan, previously described by the Bush \n     administration as genocide, cast a shadow over the agreement, \n     which does not cover the Darfur conflict; and\n       Whereas, Darfur, an area of 256,000 square kilometers \n     constituting the western region of the Sudan, is home to an \n     estimated five million people, a population made up of a \n     complex tribal mix; and\n       Whereas, Large swathes of Darfur have been prone to drought \n     and desertification, intensifying demands on its more fertile\n\n[[Page S11309]]\n\n     lands, making areas of Darfur subject to sporadic intertribal \n     clashes over use of resources in recent decades; and\n       Whereas, The government of the Sudan appears to have \n     sponsored a militia composed of a loose collection of \n     fighters, apparently of Arab background, known as the \n     ``Janjaweed''; and\n       Whereas, With the active support of the regular army, the \n     Janjaweed have attacked villages, targeting those suspected \n     of supporting the rebels and committing numerous human rights \n     violations; and\n       Whereas, The humanitarian consequences of the situation in \n     Darfur are grave, with an estimated 70,000 innocent civilians \n     brutally murdered, and according to the Office of the United \n     Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, an estimated \n     1,600,000 people internally displaced, and more than 200,000 \n     people forced from their homes and fleeing to neighboring \n     Chad; and\n       Whereas, The government of the Sudan should; at the highest \n     levels, publicly and unequivocally condemn all violations of \n     human rights and international humanitarian law, investigate \n     those violations, and bring the perpetrators to justice; and\n       Whereas, The Janjaweed and other militias should be \n     immediately disarmed and disbanded, and humanitarian workers \n     must be given full and unimpeded access to Darfur; and\n       Whereas, Refugees and displaced persons should be permitted \n     to return to their lands and homes voluntarily, and should \n     receive restitution or fair compensation for their losses; \n     and\n       Whereas, Fundamental human rights must be respected in \n     times of peace and in times of armed conflict; and\n       Whereas, The Sudan is a party to several core human rights \n     treaties, including the International Covenant and Civil and \n     Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Convention on the \n     Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), \n     the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and the \n     African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights; Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That it is the sense of the Legislature \n     of the State of California that the government of the Sudan \n     should, at the highest levels, publicly and unequivocally \n     condemn all actions and crimes committed by the Janjaweed, \n     ensure that all militias are immediately disarmed and \n     disbanded, and pursue a policy of national reconciliation, \n     ending impunity and ensuring the rule of law and the \n     protection of minorities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That it is the further sense of the Legislature \n     that humanitarian workers must be given full and unimpeded \n     access to Darfur in order to ensure that there is no blockage \n     in the delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That it is the further sense of the Legislature \n     that the government of the Sudan should put in place measures \n     to ensure that human rights abuses, war crimes, and crimes \n     against humanity are not repeated in the future and that the \n     rule of law is restored in Darfur in conformity with \n     internationally agreed standards; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature respectfully requests that \n     the President and Congress of the United States continue to \n     take all prudent and necessary steps to ensure that these \n     matters are addressed at the highest levels of the federal \n     government; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, to the \n     United States Secretary of State, and to the Secretary \n     General of the United Nations.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-198. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Colorado relative to expressing sympathy for the \n     victims of the earthquake and tsunamis that occurred on \n     December 26, 2004, and thanking Coloradans for their generous \n     charitable donations; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 05-1005\n\n       Whereas, On the morning of December 26, 2004, one of the \n     largest earthquakes in recent memory registering a magnitude \n     of 9.0 occurred undersea in the Indian Ocean, setting off one \n     of the largest tsunamis in recorded history that killed tens \n     of thousands of people in Southeast Asia; and\n       Whereas, The tsunamis crossed into the Pacific Ocean and \n     were recorded as far away as New Zealand and along the west \n     coast of South and North America; and\n       Whereas, The earthquake and resulting tsunamis affected a \n     large number of countries, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, \n     India, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Maldives, and \n     Somalia; and\n       Whereas, At least 150,000 people have lost their lives in \n     East Africa and Southeast Asia in the aftermath of the \n     earthquake and resulting tsunamis; and\n       Whereas, Millions of people remain homeless and at risk \n     from disease: and\n       Whereas, Thousands of people are still missing, and the \n     death toll continues to grow; and\n       Whereas, Aid workers and volunteers are focused on stopping \n     the spread of disease and on delivering food and drinking \n     water to survivors; and\n       Whereas, Coloradans have always stepped forward to help in \n     times of need by providing financial, material, and medical \n     assistance; and\n       Whereas, The American Red Cross reports that emergency \n     assessment and first-aid teams were on the ground quickly and \n     are working with local groups to support relief efforts; and\n       Whereas, The people of Colorado have shown their generosity \n     by donating thus far $4.1 million statewide to the various \n     chapters of the American Red Cross, $3.5 million of which has \n     been donated to the Mile High Chapter of the American Red \n     Cross; and\n       Whereas, Chennai, India became Denver's 7th sister city in \n     1984 and has been deeply affected by the tsunamis in that \n     more than 6,000 people in Chennai were killed; and\n       Whereas, Local radio and television stations and various \n     local groups are contributing their time and efforts to help \n     provide financial assistance for areas devastated by the \n     tsunamis, including Chennai; and\n       Whereas, The United States government has pledged $350 \n     million in aid, to meet the overwhelming needs of the tsunami \n     victims; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the sixty-\n     fifth General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein:\n       1.

A Senate Joint Resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Colorado relative to a \n     reaffirmation by the Colorado General Assembly of the strong \n     bonds connecting the United States and the State of Israel \n     and an expression by the Colorado General Assembly of support \n     and solidarity with the State of Israel in its struggle \n     against terrorism; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution 05-038\n\n       Whereas, On November 29, 1947, the United Nations General \n     Assembly voted to partition the British mandate of Palestine \n     and, by that vote, created the state of Israel; and\n       Whereas, On May 14, 1948, the people of the state of Israel \n     proclaimed the establishment of the sovereign and independent \n     state of Israel; and\n       Whereas, The United States government recognized the state \n     of Israel just minutes after its declaration of independence \n     and, at that time, established full diplomatic relations with \n     the nascent state; and\n       Whereas, The establishment of the state of Israel as a \n     modern homeland for the Jewish people followed the \n     extermination of more than six million European Jews during \n     the Holocaust; and\n       Whereas, Since its establishment fifty-seven years ago, the \n     Israeli people have built a modern nation, forged a new and \n     dynamic society, and created a unique and vital economic, \n     cultural, and intellectual life while confronting immense \n     pressures and burdens associated with war, terrorism, \n     ostracism from much of the international community, and \n     economic boycotts; and\n       Whereas, In spite of this severe degree of adversity \n     confronting them since 1948, including the War of \n     Independence, the Six-Day War, the Yom Kippur War, and the \n     terrorist attacks of the two Intifadas, the people of the \n     state of Israel have established a vibrant and functioning \n     pluralistic and democratic political system that guarantees \n     fundamental freedoms of speech and of the press, free, fair, \n     and open elections, and respect for the rule of law; and\n       Whereas, At great financial and social cost, Israel has \n     absorbed several millions of immigrants from many nations \n     around the world and has made great strides in fully \n     integrating these immigrants into Israeli society; and\n       Whereas, For over half a century, the people of the United \n     States and the people of the state of Israel have created and \n     maintained a special relationship based upon mutually shared \n     democratic values, common strategic interests, and the bonds \n     of friendship and mutual respect; and\n       Whereas, The bonds connecting the United States and Israel \n     include increased economic ties between the two nations, \n     particularly increased trade between Colorado and Israel as \n     evidenced by the following facts: In 2003, Colorado exported \n     approximately $38 million worth of goods to Israel; total \n     Colorado exports to Israel have exceeded $250 million since \n     1991; in 2003, Israel ranked as Colorado's 21st leading trade \n     partner; and collaboration between Colorado-based and Israeli \n     business concerns is taking place in, among other things, the \n     areas of advanced technology, telecommunications, and health \n     care; and\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\n       Whereas, The bonds connecting the United States and Israel \n     also include greater collaboration between scientific \n     researchers in both nations, including researchers in \n     Colorado and Israel, and researchers in Colorado and Israel \n     are collaborating on scientific projects involving, among \n     other things, atmospheric science, applied chemistry and \n     physics, medicine, and agriculture; and\n       Whereas, The United States also has benefited from the \n     exchange of technology and expertise from Israel in the area \n     of homeland security, providing invaluable benefits to our \n     nation in combating and responding to terrorism; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-fifth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:\n       (1) That we, the members of the General Assembly of the \n     state of Colorado, hereby reaffirm the strong bonds that have \n     connected the people of the United States and the people of \n     the state of Israel together through turbulent times for more \n     than half a century.\n       (2) That we commend the people of the state of Israel for \n     their remarkable achievements in building a democratic and \n     pluralistic society in the wake of almost unrelieved \n     adversity spanning the entirety of the nation's existence.\n       (3) That we express empathy with the people of the state of \n     Israel as they endure a daily struggle against terrorism and \n     violence and support efforts to bring security to the Jewish \n     and democratic state of Israel.\n       (4) That we express outrage against, and in the strongest \n     possible terms condemn, all acts of terror perpetrated \n     against the Israeli people with the intent and effect of \n     murdering Israeli civilians, including women and children.\n       (5) That we support the brave efforts of the government and \n     people of Israel in pursuing peace by way of negotiation.\n       (6) That we applaud the government of Israel's difficult \n     and painful decision to disengage from Gaza and the northern \n     section of the West Bank in order to advance peace \n     negotiations.\n       (7) That we reaffirm the commitment of the American people \n     to a just, lasting, and secure peace for the people of the \n     state of Israel and all of the peoples of the Middle East, be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent to \n     President George W. Bush, Vice President Richard B. Cheney, \n     Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, His Excellency Daniel \n     Ayalon, the Ambassador of Israel to the United States, and to \n     each member of Colorado's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-200. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to urging the Congress of the \n     United States to increase the presence of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention in Texas, improve coordination \n     of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention programs with \n     those operated by the Texas Department of State Health \n     Services, and increase the amount of federal resources coming \n     into Texas from the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                      House Concurrent Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The State of Texas is the second most populous \n     state in the United States and currently registers more than \n     1,000 births per day; and\n       Whereas, Texas has a 1,254-mile international border with \n     the United Mexican States with millions of border crossings \n     and thousands of international flights arriving in Texas each \n     year, and 10 percent of Texans living on the border with \n     Mexico; and\n       Whereas, Mexico is the United States' second-largest \n     trading partner and, according to the Center for \n     Transportation Research at The University of Texas at Austin, \n     76 percent of all U.S. trade with, Mexico passes through \n     Texas; and\n       Whereas, The nation's food industry has a pivotal role in \n     the health and bio-security of all Americans, and Texas is \n     the nation's second largest agricultural producing state; and\n       Whereas, Preventing infectious livestock and plant diseases \n     and protecting our food supply goes a long way toward \n     ensuring both human health and economic stability in Texas \n     and the United States; and\n       Whereas, Serving as an infectious disease buffer zone for \n     the rest of the United States, Texas faces a significant \n     burden regarding a number of diseases, with the rate of \n     waterborne diseases such as hepatitis A and amebiasis in the \n     Texas counties bordering Mexico that has, as an example, been \n     reported to be two to three times greater than the statewide \n     average; in 2003, the rate of tuberculosis incidence per \n     100,000 in population was nearly twice that of non-border \n     counties; and\n       Whereas, The condition of public health within Texas, \n     particularly along the international border, is clearly \n     critical to that of the entire country; and\n       Whereas, With more than 22 million residents, Texas also \n     faces a number of other alarming public health issues, such \n     as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes; in 2003, \n     the Texas Department of Health reported that 39 percent of \n     Texas fourth-graders, 38 percent of eighth-graders, and 61 \n     percent of Texas adults were overweight or obese; and\n       Whereas, Heart disease and stroke are the number one and \n     number three causes of death in Texas, accounting for \n     approximately 54,000 deaths each year in Texas; and\n       Whereas, The Texas Diabetes Council estimates that more \n     than one million adults in Texas have been diagnosed with \n     diabetes and more than 500,000 adults are believed to have \n     undiagnosed diabetes; and\n       Whereas, An increased presence and resources from the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could help prevent \n     vaccine-preventable childhood and adult diseases and prevent \n     and control the introduction of lethal diseases such as \n     tuberculosis and SARS, which could potentially lead to \n     catastrophic consequences in terms of morbidity, mortality, \n     health care costs, and statewide impact; and\n       Whereas, Partnerships and coordination between the State of \n     Texas and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     could greatly enhance protection against the spread of \n     infectious disease, further obesity prevention activities, \n     and improve early detection, treatment, and self-\n     management of chronic diseases such as heart disease and \n     diabetes; and\n       Whereas, Texas' growing population, demographic diversity, \n     and border with the United Mexican States present unique \n     challenges to providing quality health care to its citizens; \n     as a buffer to the remainder of the United States against \n     infectious disease and contamination of the country's food \n     supply, the State of Texas merits additional resources to \n     provide for the health of its residents and, ultimately, to \n     safeguard the health of the entire United States; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby strongly encourage the United States Congress to \n     increase the presence of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention in Texas, improve coordination of Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention programs with those operated \n     by the Texas Department of State Health Services, and \n     increase the amount of federal resources coming into Texas \n     from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and, be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies Of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the President of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, and all members of the Texas delegation to the \n     Congress with the request that this resolution be officia11y \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America and that copies also \n     be forwarded to the secretary of the United States Department \n     of Health and Human Services and the director of the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-201. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to urging the Congress of the \n     United States to increase funding to the fully authorized \n     level and include advance funds for the Low Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Program and to pursue a more equitable \n     funding allocation formula for the program; to the Committee \n     on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution 166\n\n       Whereas, More than four million Texans are at or below 125 \n     percent of Federal poverty guidelines, but only 173,323, or \n     4.3 percent, are served by the Federal Low Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Program (LIHEAP), according to the Texas \n     Department of Housing and Community Affairs (TDHCA), which \n     administers the program in our State; and\n       Whereas, Income guidelines for LIHEAP, which provides \n     funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program and the \n     Comprehensive Energy Assistance Program at TDHCA, allow \n     households to have income levels of up to 125 percent of \n     current poverty guidelines; however, based upon 2000 census \n     data, Texas has more than three million persons who are at or \n     below 100 percent of the poverty guidelines; and\n       Whereas, Home energy assistance is particularly important \n     in Texas due to the intense heat, which is a critical health \n     threat to the elderly, persons with disabilities, and very \n     young children; in fact, the Texas Department of Health \n     reports that in our State more individuals die due to heart-\n     related stress than exposure to excessive cold; and\n       Whereas, LIHEAP funds are distributed based on an outdated \n     formula that disproportionately favors heating degree days in \n     northern States over cooling degree days in southern States \n     and does not utilize the most current State-specific \n     population, income, and energy price data; and\n       Whereas, While funding was close to level from Federal \n     fiscal year 2003 to 2005, the recent increase in energy costs \n     has further reduced the already limited number of eligible \n     Texans who can be served by LIHEAP; and\n       Whereas, Current appropriations for LIHEAP do not include \n     advance funds, which are vital to ensuring the timely and \n     orderly delivery of services during the period after funding \n     for the program is authorized by Congress and before Texas is \n     notified of its final appropriation level for the program \n     year; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     increase funding to the fully authorized level and include \n     advance funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Program and to pursue a more equitable funding allocation \n     formula for the program; and, be it further\n       Resolved,  That the Texas Secretary of State forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, to\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President \n     of the Senate of the United States Congress, and to all the \n     members of the Texas delegation to the Congress with the \n     request that this resolution be officially entered in the \n     Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the \n     United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-202.

Saund immigrated to the United States \n     from India at a time when Indian nationals were denied \n     eligibility for American citizenship; and\n       Whereas, Thanks to his initiative and the help of Indians \n     in California and New York, Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce \n     and Congressman Emanuel Cellar were convinced to jointly \n     introduce a bill in the United States Congress to allow \n     Indian nationals to become American citizens, and after a \n     long and hard struggle the bill was signed by President \n     Truman on July 3, 1946; and\n       Whereas, Though Dr. Saund had started as a farmhand, he \n     obtained a Ph.D. from the University of California at \n     Berkeley; and as a naturalized citizen started taking an \n     active role in the political process of his adopted homeland; \n     and\n       Whereas, In June 1950, he won his first political battle \n     when he ran for and won a seat on the Imperial County \n     Democratic Central Committee; and\n       Whereas, In November 1950, he was elected as a judge in \n     Westmorland due to his exemplary grassroots campaign, but \n     because he had not been a citizen for one full year the \n     judgeship was denied him; and\n       Whereas, In 1952, he ran again for the judgeship against \n     the incumbent and won, serving as judge in Westmorland for \n     four years; and\n       Whereas, In October 1955, Dr. Saund became a candidate for \n     Congress from the 29th Congressional District, facing a \n     highly celebrated opponent who had rich supporters and who \n     was a personal friend of the then President of the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, With the help of dedicated volunteers, Dr. Saund \n     carried out an intensive campaign of voter registration, \n     passed out thousands of ``Saund circulars,'' visited \n     thousands of homes, and thus made a definite impact on \n     voters, resulting in the election of the ``first native of \n     Asia'' to the United States Congress on November 6, 1956; and\n       Whereas, Today, the population of Asian Americans in the \n     United States is in excess of 10 million, and Asian \n     Americans, and particularly Indian Americans, seeking \n     political office invoke Dr. Saund's name, much the same way \n     as Dr. Saund himself invoked President Lincoln's name, as a \n     source of inspiration and a worthy role model; and\n       Whereas, November 6, 2006, marks the 50th anniversary of \n     the historic election of Dr. Saund to the United States \n     Congress; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the President and \n     Congress of the United States to urge the Citizens' Stamp \n     Advisory Committee and the United States Postal Service to \n     issue a commemorative stamp to honor the first Asian member \n     of Congress, Dr. Dalip S.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to ZIP Codes; to the \n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, Many communities in California have the advantage \n     and convenience of possessing ZIP Codes that are unique to \n     their respective communities; and\n       Whereas, The private development sector measures economic \n     feasibility for investing in local communities based on data \n     collected by ZIP Codes; and\n       Whereas, Sales taxes, franchise fees, federal funding, and \n     other city revenue sources are traced through ZIP Codes; and\n       Whereas, Cities who share ZIP Codes may lose a portion of \n     their revenue stream to other jurisdictions which the post \n     office recognizes as the primary geographic area for that \n     particular ZIP Code; and\n       Whereas, Unique ZIP Codes help to develop a city's identity \n     so that citizens can rightfully participate in their local \n     election processes holding their own elected officials \n     accountable; and\n       Whereas, Local political and fiscal accountability is the \n     cornerstone of democracy; and\n       Whereas, The ZIP Codes have a wider application than the \n     delivery of mail to the cities in California; and\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\n       Whereas, The United States Postal Service advises residents \n     and businesses to identify their address by post office \n     address rather than city address to ensure proper mail \n     delivery; and\n       Whereas, Several cities in California also contain shared \n     ZIP Codes and may not be aware of the negative impact such an \n     arrangement may have on their community; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and. the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges the United \n     States Postmaster to create ZIP Codes that do not encompass \n     more than one municipality; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate, to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States, and the United States Postmaster.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-206. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to supporting parity for \n     Mexican visitors to the United States by enacting legislation \n     that would allow them the same six-month length of stay \n     afforded to Canadian travelers; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 13\n\n       Whereas, Canadian travelers to the United States may stay \n     in this country for up to six months, while Mexican visitors \n     only recently gained the right to a 30-day stay with a laser \n     visa under an expansion of the United States Visitor and \n     Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program, \n     which previously limited such stays to 72 hours and no more \n     than 25 miles inside the U.S. border; and\n       Whereas, Aside from adversely affecting international \n     goodwill between the United States and its neighbors to the \n     north and south by the disparate treatment of their citizens, \n     this disparity also has a negative impact on the economic \n     stability of the U.S.-Mexico border; and\n       Whereas, If Mexican tourists, businesspersons, and other \n     short-term travelers received the same opportunities to visit \n     and do business in the United States as their Canadian \n     counterparts, it would facilitate business between the United \n     States and Mexico, boosting the U.S. and Texas economies; and\n       Whereas, El Paso and other Texas border communities that \n     directly benefit from cross-border travel may expect a \n     dramatic increase in local economic development if the length \n     of stay for Mexican nationals with laser visas is extended \n     from 30 days to six months; and\n       Whereas, Local community leaders attending a recent \n     gathering of the U.S. Hispanic Chambers of Commerce were \n     assured by U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n     Undersecretary Asa Hutchinson that the Bush Administration \n     supports treating all international guests equally; and\n       Whereas, U.S. Senator John Cornyn and U.S. Representative \n     Ruben Hinojosa, both of Texas, introduced legislation in the \n     108th Congress (S. 1908 and H.R. 3488, respectively) to allow \n     Mexican nationals currently admissible under laser visa \n     border crossing regulations to enter the United States as \n     six-month nonimmigrant visitors; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     support parity for Mexican visitors to the United States by \n     enacting legislation that would allow them the same six-month \n     length of stay afforded to Canadian travelers; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies or this resolution to the U.S. Department of \n     Homeland Security and U.S. Department of State and to the \n     president of the United States, to the speaker of the house \n     of representatives and the president of the senate of the \n     United States Congress, and to all the members of the Texas \n     delegation to the congress with the request that this \n     resolution be officially entered in the Congressional Record \n     as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n       POM-207. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to the 32nd anniversary of \n     Roe v. Wade; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Whereas, January 22, 2005, is the 32nd anniversary of the \n     historic United States Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade \n     (1973) 410 U.S. 113, guaranteeing women's reproductive \n     rights, an occasion deserving of celebration and special \n     public commendations; and\n       Whereas, The 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade established \n     constitutionally based limits on the power of states to \n     restrict the right of a woman to choose to terminate a \n     pregnancy; and\n       Whereas, Roe v. Wade is one of the most significant Supreme \n     Court decisions in the 20th century promoting women's rights; \n     and\n       Whereas, Reproductive rights are central to the ability of \n     women to exercise their full rights under federal and state \n     law; and\n       Whereas, It is the right of every American woman to \n     determine when, if, and with whom to have children, and how \n     many children to have; and\n       Whereas, Women's ability to control their reproductive \n     lives has facilitated their equal participation in the \n     economic and social life of the nation; and\n       Whereas, The state should not interfere with a woman's \n     decision to either bear a child or terminate a pregnancy \n     through a safe and legal abortion; and\n       Whereas, Women should not be forced into illegal and \n     dangerous abortions, as they often were prior to the Roe v. \n     Wade decision; and\n       Whereas, During the first half of the 20th century, illegal \n     abortions accounted for about 50 percent of all maternal \n     deaths; and\n       Whereas, Roe v. Wade has significantly reduced the \n     mortality rate for women terminating their pregnancies; and\n       Whereas; Roe v. Wade continues to protect the health and \n     freedom of women throughout the United States; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     Califori1ia memorializes the Congress and the President of \n     the United States to protect and uphold the intent and \n     substance of the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision in \n     Roe v. Wade; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States and to all Members of the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-208. A Senate Joint Memorial adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Colorado relative to proposing an amendment \n     to the United States Constitution requiring that the total \n     amount of all federal appropriations made by Congress for any \n     fiscal year not exceed the total of all estimated federal \n     revenues for that fiscal year; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                      Senate Joint Memorial 05-007\n\n       Whereas, In 1998, the federal budget reported its first \n     surplus, $69 billion, since 1969; and\n       Whereas, From 1998 through 2001, the United States \n     experienced 4 surpluses in a row and in 2001, the surplus \n     reached $128 billion; and\n       Whereas, The last time the United States had 4 surpluses in \n     a row was over 70 years ago, from 1927-30; and\n       Whereas, Since 2001, the budget surpluses, which were \n     projected to continue until 2008, have disappeared, and the \n     total budget deficit for the 2004 fiscal year was about $412 \n     billion; and\n       Whereas, Due to congressional overspending, the budget \n     deficit for the 2005 fiscal year could be around $394 \n     billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office's \n     budgetary projections; and\n       Whereas, President Bush's $2.57 trillion dollar budget \n     request estimates a budget deficit of $427 billion, which \n     includes additional funding for the ongoing military \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas, President Bush's $427 billion deficit estimate is \n     approximately 17% of the federal budget, which would be the \n     equivalent of a $2.58 billion deficit for the state budget if \n     Colorado's deficit equaled 17% of the state's $15.2 billion \n     budget; and\n       Whereas, The federal deficit is expected to remain around \n     $250 billion each year for the next 5 years, unless drastic \n     cuts to programs or significant increases to taxes are made; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Congressional Budget Office projects a \n     cumulative deficit of $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years; \n     and\n       Whereas, The federal public debt has increased and is now \n     more than $7.6 trillion, an amount equaling approximately \n     $121,000 for each American family or over $25,000 for every \n     man, woman, and child; and\n       Whereas, The baby boomer generation will soon retire, \n     leaving less tax revenue and a higher drain on social \n     services; and\n       Whereas, In fiscal year 2004, $321 billion was paid in \n     interest on the federal debt, which is 13% of the total \n     federal budget, the third largest expense in the federal \n     budget, according to the National Debt Awareness Center; and\n       Whereas, Fiscal irresponsibility at the federal level is \n     lowering our standard of living, destroying jobs, and \n     endangering economic opportunity now and for future \n     generations; and\n       Whereas, Continued deficit spending demonstrates an \n     unwillingness or inability of both the federal executive and \n     legislative branches to spend no more than available \n     revenues; and\n       Whereas, The federal government's unlimited ability to \n     borrow raises questions about fundamental principles and \n     responsibilities of government, with potentially profound \n     consequences for the nation and its people, making it an \n     appropriate subject for limitation by the Constitution of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, The Constitution of the United States vests the \n     ultimate responsibility to approve or disapprove \n     constitutional amendments with the people, as represented by \n     their elected state legislatures, and opposition in the \n     United States Congress repeatedly has thwarted the will of \n     the people that a balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution be submitted to the states for ratification; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Rersolved by the Senate of the Sixty-fifth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:\n       That the General Assembly of the state of Colorado requests \n     the United States Congress to expeditiously pass, and propose \n     to the legislatures of the several states for ratification, \n     an amendment to the United States Constitution requiring \n     that, in the absence of a war or national emergency, the \n     total of\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\n     all federal appropriations made by Congress for any fiscal \n     year not exceed the total of all estimated federal revenues \n     for that fiscal year; be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial be sent to the \n     President and Vice President of the United States, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Minority Leader \n     of the House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate, the Minority Leader of the Senate, and to each member \n     of Colorado's congressional delegation.\n       POM-209. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to urging the Congress of the \n     United States and the Department of Veterans Affairs to \n     fulfill the department's goal of providing excellence in \n     patient care by building a veterans hospital in Weslaco, \n     Texas; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution 138\n\n       Whereas, Our veterans who live in South Texas have served \n     their country bravely and risked their lives to preserve our \n     country's freedom and democracy, and their sacrifices in our \n     behalf are deserving of a veterans hospital to meet their \n     health care needs; and\n       Whereas, Regrettably, South Texas currently lacks adequate \n     health care resources for these proud men and women; the sole \n     outpatient clinic in the eight-county area at the southern \n     tip of Texas has limited hours of operation and must refer \n     patients to other facilities for special tests or treatments; \n     in addition, the nearest veterans hospital to the region with \n     inpatient acute medical and surgical care and extended care \n     is more than 250 miles away in San Antonio; and\n       Whereas, Veterans in Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, and Willacy \n     Counties alone number greater than 46,000, and a May 2004 \n     report by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) \n     acknowledged the need for improved and expanded medical \n     facilities for veterans in South Texas; and\n       Whereas, Despite this assessment, however, the DVA has \n     planned only the addition of 10 contract beds in Harlingen's \n     Valley Baptist Medical Center; and\n       Whereas, Weslaco is located in the center of the Rio Grande \n     Valley, less than one hour's drive from McAllen, Harlingen, \n     and Brownsville, making it a convenient site for a hospital \n     to serve the area's veterans; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     respectfully urge the Congress of the United States and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs to fulfill the department's \n     goal of providing excellence in patient care by building a \n     veterans hospital in Weslaco, Texas, to serve the more than \n     46,000 veterans in South Texas who have bravely defended and \n     served our country; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, to the secretary of veterans affairs, and to all \n     the members of the Texas delegation to the congress with the \n     request that this resolution be officially entered in the \n     Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the \n     United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-210. A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to rejecting provisions in \n     the President's proposed federal budget that would result in \n     the loss of funding for Veterans' Memorial Homes in New \n     Jersey; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 263\n\n       Whereas, The President's proposed federal budget for fiscal \n     year 2006 contains reductions to veterans' programs that \n     would result in the loss of funding for the Veterans' \n     Memorial Homes in this State; and\n       Whereas, The proposed budgetary reductions would hinder \n     this State's ability to operate its three Veterans' Memorial \n     Homes and may result in the closure of one or more of the \n     homes if an alternate funding source is not provided; and\n       Whereas, The three Homes currently have a resident \n     population of 812 veterans and the funding reductions \n     contained in the President's budget would [cut that \n     population] reduce the number of veterans eligible for \n     federal funding to 159 [residents]; and\n       Whereas, Under the President's proposed budget, the \n     Veterans' Memorial Homes would not meet the criteria for \n     retaining federal matching funds [for] invested in \n     construction, thereby requiring the State to reimburse the \n     federal government for construction costs totaling \n     approximately $53.3 million; and\n       Whereas, The proposed reductions to veterans' programs \n     contained in the President's budget would negatively impact \n     New Jersey's ability to care for its veterans; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House urges Congress to reject provisions in the \n     President's proposed federal budget that would result in the \n     loss of funding for Veterans' Memorial Homes in this State.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested by the Clerk \n     of the General Assembly, shall be transmitted to the \n     President of the United States, the Vice-President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, every member of this State's Congressional \n     delegation and the Governor.\n       POM-211.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to improve \nenergy production and reduce energy demand through improved use of \nreclaimed waters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, nearly every form of energy production \nrequires the use of large quantities of water. Electricity production, \noil and gas production, and certain renewable energy sources are all \ndependent on having adequate access to water. Because water \navailability, particularly for human consumption, is an increasingly \nimportant international and domestic issue, it is important for us to \nensure that we use our water resources in the most efficient manner in \nthe production of energy. As the world's population grows and stores of \nfresh water are depleted, finding additional sources of fresh water is \nvital to meeting our energy needs and ensuring peace and security \ndomestically and abroad. For this reason, developing cost-effective \ntechnologies that allow us better access to water for human use and \nenergy production is of great significance.\n\n[[Page S11316]]\n\n  Electricity production is entirely dependent on the availability of \nwater, regardless of fuel source. Much of our fossil fuel energy \nproduction is entirely dependent on having adequate access to water. \nSandia National Laboratories estimates that for every barrel of oil \nproduced, ten gallons of water are required. For this reason, ensuring \nan adequate supply of water, coupled with efficient use of that water \nsupply in our energy processes, is critical to the United States' \nenergy portfolio. Similarly, making water available to our citizens is \nlargely dependent on energy. Transportation, distribution, acquisition \nand purification of water require large amounts of energy.\n  Providing water to meet population growth will become increasingly \nimportant in the coming years. Nearly 1.2 billion people, roughly one \nfifth of the world's population, live without reliable access to water. \nIt is estimated that by 2025, roughly one-third of the world will have \ninadequate access to water. By 2030 there will be an additional 3 \nbillion people. By 2025, it is estimated that the population of the \nArab world will reach 600 million, twice the population of 2000. At the \nWorld Economic Forum this summer, experts testified that most of the \ncountries in the Arab world had exhausted their water resources and \nthat the only way to provide water is the expensive prospect of \ndesalination. At the forum, former Jordanian water minister told those \nin attendance ``We are not secure about water supplies. Supplies are \nsimply not enough . . . This is a scary issue.'' He went on to estimate \nthat the water deficit in the Arab world will grow by more than 600 \npercent by 2025.\n  The need for renewed Federal investment to develop technologies that \nwill ensure efficient use of scarce water resources in energy \nproduction is critically important for domestic growth and prosperity. \nA study by the Governmental Accountability Office stated that ``water \nmanagers in thirty-six States anticipate shortages in localities, \nregions, or state-wide in the next 10 years.'' In the West, the \ncompeting demands of population growth, drought, energy resources \ndevelopment, agricultural needs, environmental needs, and tribal \ninterests have resulted in a paucity of available water. Unbridled \npopulation growth in the western U.S. has stretched water resources \neven thinner. The U.S. Census Bureau recently estimated that by 2030 \nNevada will have more than four million residents, twice as many as in \n2000. In a region already critically short of water and subject to the \nunpredictable nature of an already over-allocated Colorado River, even \na mild drought could stymie growth and economic development. For this \nreason, we need to investigate new technologies that allow us to access \nadditional water, and just as importantly, to use water in the most \nefficient ways, particularly in the production of all forms of energy.\n  While stories are legion about the deleterious effects of the \nprolonged drought in the West, including my home State of New Mexico, \nthe availability of water is an increasingly critical issue in the \neastern United States. Usable supplies of water in the east coast have \nbeen stretched thin. Despite receiving substantially more rainfall than \nthe western U.S., much of the east coast is facing water shortages. For \nexample, Boston, Atlanta and much of Florida are nearing the end of \nreadily available water. Just as with our current oil and natural gas \nenergy crisis, the answer for our looming water crisis is not just to \nproduce more, but to foster new technologies that will both aid in more \nproduction, and just as significantly, reduce the amount of water \nrequired for energy production and other needs.\n  I rise today to introduce the Energy-Water Efficiency Technology \nResearch, Development, and Transfer Program Act of 2005. The emphasis \nof this program is to address the inextricable relationship between \nenergy and water. Large amounts of water are required for electric \ngeneration and oil and gas production. Additionally, large amounts of \nenergy are required for reclaiming and transporting water. Water \nshortages impair our ability to meet our energy needs and conversely, \nenergy shortages impair our ability to provide adequate supplies of \nwater. The bill would establish an ambitious program within the \nNational Laboratories to develop, transfer and demonstrate in real \nworld applications energy and water efficiency technologies to meet the \nincreased demand for water internationally and domestically. The bill \nestablishes a merit-based competitive grant program for research \ngrants, provides that a set percentage of funding received by the \nprogram be used to demonstrate promising technologies, and provides for \nresearch undertaken by our National Laboratories. Our National \nLaboratories have shown an ability to push the state of the art \nforward, furthering technologies such as highspeed computing, nano-\ntechnology, and advanced engineering and science. Federal investment in \nthese areas has resulted in thousands of new technologies that benefit \nhumanity. We now have the opportunity to direct a portion of this \nimmense capability to solve our water and related energy issues. I have \nno doubt that this legislation would help to push the state of the art \nforward to ensure that the world has access to this life sustaining \nresource for years to come.\n  For the reasons I have articulated, renewed Federal investment in \nthis area is of critical importance both domestically and abroad. I \nthank Senator Bingaman, ranking member of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, Majority Leader Frist and Senator Alexander for \nbeing original co-sponsors of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1860\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster \nPreparedness Agency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, our Nation's history is not only one of \ngrowing prosperity, opportunity, and the steady progress of a free and \nindustrious society, but it is also uniquely identified by the \nchallenges that we have faced and overcome. Sometimes, these challenges \nhave been natural disasters--earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes that \nhave devastated entire towns and cities, uprooted communities, and \ntragically killed hundreds, if not thousands, of people. Disasters such \nas the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, \nthe Great Flood of 1927, and Hurricane Camille are the first ones that \ncome to mind, although there are others that we could also add to this \nlist of superdisasters.\n  Unfortunately, it now appears that the list of these superdisasters \nhas gotten longer. In a number of respects, the devastation inflicted \nby Hurricane Katrina has so far exceeded any natural disaster that our \ncountry has faced: the official death toll is around 1,000 and could go \nhigher; approximately 90,000 square miles, nearly the size of the \nUnited Kingdom, has been impacted; a city of nearly half a million was \nalmost entirely emptied; as many as 1 million jobs have been directly \naffected; and recovery and reconstruction costs could go to as high as \n$200 billion, if not more. Figures aside, the tragic and widespread \ndevastation that this storm has wreaked is apparent to anyone who has \nwatched news footage from the golf coast region. The images are heart \nwrenching, and our prayers go out to those who have suffered and have \nlost loved ones.\n  Weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast region, Hurricane \nRita brought further devastation to areas that were either already \nimpacted or to areas further south and to the west. Although not as \npowerful as Katrina, Rita dealt a strong blow to many communities. \nLives were lost, entire neighborhoods were completely destroyed, and \nmany families were displaced. Again, we extend our prayers and wishes \nto those who were directly affected by this storm.\n  While the combined impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is similar \nto other superdisasters, it also unprecedented in a few key aspects. In \nparticular, the Federal Government is now expected to play, and is \nplaying, a significant role in the response and recovery efforts. This \nis partly due to the significant growth in the Federal Government over \nthe past 100 years. Back in 1900 when the Galveston Hurricane occurred, \nthere were only eight executive departments in the entire government--\nthe Department of Commerce, the Department of Labor, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HUD, the U.S. Coast Guard, the EPA, FEMA, \nand, of course, the Department of Homeland Security had yet to be \nestablished. Today, the federal government is much more expansive than\n\n[[Page S11318]]\n\nwhen previous superdisasters took place, and it now delivers a wide \narray of services and benefits that Americans have come to expect.\n  In response, President Bush and Congress have approved the spending \nof billions in Federal funds, unleashing an outpouring of federal aid, \nassets, and manpower. Over the past 2 weeks, Congress already has \napproved over $61 billion in supplemental appropriations, and it is \ncontemplating the spending of additional federal funds. Almost every \nexecutive department and Federal agency is taking part, taxpayer funds \nare being doled out to contractors and State and local authorities, and \nthe future of the gulf coast region and millions of its residents is \nbeing shaped daily by this massive effort. While mistakes have been \nmade at all levels, we now have the opportunity to make sure that \nmistakes are not repeated and that we do not come out of this whole \nexperience wondering where all the money went and whether we did the \nbest we can to respond to this challenge.\n  My Senate colleagues and I have been discussing various proposals for \nhow the federal recovery effort should be managed. I believe that \nhistory can be of help--for instance, we can learn from the Great Flood \nof 1927, a natural disaster that killed hundreds in seven states and \nflooded around 27,000 square miles. In response, President Coolidge \nappointed Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover to coordinate relief \nacross eight different agencies, the Red Cross, and other \norganizations. While the relief effort had its flaws, I believe that \nCoolidge's appointment of a lead director, who had substantial crisis \nmanagement experience and public recognition, was a wise decision. By \ncentralizing oversight authority over the entire effort under such a \ncentral person, Coolidge's appointment of Hoover helped minimize \nfriction and discoordination across agencies, ensuring that the relief \nresponse was run efficiently. The appointment also enhanced \naccountability since everyone knew who was in charge.\n  The recovery effort for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is going to be \nmuch more complicated and multifaceted than the relief response for the \nGreat Flood of 1927. The breadth of the destruction and the wide array \nof Federal departments and agencies involved--combined with the efforts \nof State and local authorities, nonprofit organizations, and private \ncontractors--make the potential for bureaucratic tensions, redundancy, \nconfusion, and waste even greater. I therefore believe that a \ncentralized management structure is as necessary now as it was back in \n1927. So, before Congress continues pouring billions of taxpayer \ndollars and adding additional tasks on top of the recovery effort, \nCongress should first make sure that a centralized management structure \nis in place. In particular, we need a person with impeccable \ncredentials endowed with robust planning, operational, and budgetary \nauthorities to be on the ground in the gulf coast region. We need to \nmake sure that accountability is clearly assigned, not diffused. We \nneed to make sure that the right hand knows what the left hand is \ndoing, so to speak, and that federal funds are effectively being used \nto get the gulf coast region back on its feet. And we need this \ncentralized structure as soon as possible.\n  As such, I am proposing the Gulf Coast Recovery and Preparedness Act \nof 2005, along with Senator Kennedy, which establishes the Gulf Coast \nRecovery and Disaster Preparedness Agency, a new agency that will be \nheaded by a director who will oversee the entire recovery effort. The \nDirector will be the person responsible for budgeting, overseeing, and \nexecuting the entire recovery effort to the extent that Federal \nresources are used. The director will also regularly report to Congress \non how this effort is being conducted and will have deputies and \nsupport staff to keep track of how funds are being spent and to \ninvestigate any fraud, waste or abuse. Lastly, I recognize that we do \nnot want the legacy of Katrina and Rita to be another layer of \nbureaucracy, so the legislation would make sure that the agency and the \ndirector's position are only temporary, and that it terminates within 6 \nyears.\n  Within the agency, there will be essentially a planning board--named \nthe Gulf Coast Revitalization Authority that will consist of Federal, \nState, and local officials, as well as representatives from affected \ncommunities. The board, which will be chaired by the director, will be \ntasked with creating a comprehensive plan for redeveloping the entire \nregion impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The plan will ensure \nthat objectives, priorities, and critical infrastructure decisions are \ndeveloped in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner before federal \nresources and other funds are completely committed. The authority board \nwill also make sure that there is substantial and meaningful public \nparticipation, which is critical for making potentially difficult \nrebuilding and revitalization decisions. The director, who must approve \nthe plan after it is passed by the authority, will be responsible for \nexecuting it.\n  Our Nation has been through a lot since Katrina and Rita hit the gulf \ncoast, and I am continually amazed at the acts of heroism and charity \nthat are taking place across the gulf coast region. And while the tasks \nahead may be less dramatic and less attention-grabbing, I believe that \nit is how we address these challenges--in particular, the rebuilding of \ninfrastructure, the provision of social services to evacuees scattered \nacross the country, and the redevelopment of entire communities--that \nwill truly test our Federal Government in ways that we have not seen in \nrecent memory. In the end, I am confident that we can succeed and the \ngulf coast region will fully recover and thrive. Our Nation's history \nhas shown how well Americans perform in the face of challenges. \nHowever, we must not simply expect this success nor expect that \nthrowing around billions of dollars will necessarily achieve it. \nInstead, Congress must take action now to ensure that the recovery \neffort is managed efficiently and effectively. By setting into place \nsuch a management structure, I believe that we will be able to look \nback at these difficult times and be proud of how we handled the \npublic's trust and the taxpayers' money. This is what the American \npeople have elected us to do, and I know that it can be done if we make \nthe right choices right now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1863\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, when I last spoke on the Senate floor \nabout Hurricane Katrina, I spoke of my visit to the region--to \nLouisiana and Mississippi--where I witnessed first hand the devastation \nto these communities. Entire blocks were left bare to their foundations \nwhere families once lived. Schools and hospitals were destroyed. Power \nlines were draped over fallen trees and there was water everywhere. \nRoads were washed out and bridges were destroyed. Much of the great \ncity of New Orleans was under water. It was beyond what any of us could \nhave imagined.\n  Seeing the Gulf Coast in such a state has deeply touched me and my \nfamily\n\n[[Page S11322]]\n\nin deeply personal ways. My wife Vicki and her strong and wonderful \nfamily are from Louisiana. She went to school in Louisiana, attending \nTulane University, and considers New Orleans her second home.\n  It has now been more than a month since Hurricane Katrina first hit \nthe Gulf Coast. Hurricane Rita wreaked further havoc on the region. And \nalthough the emergency phase of the response may be over, we now face \nthe extraordinary challenge of rebuilding this region and restoring \npeople's lives.\n  Relief workers and agencies have been working tirelessly to clear \ndebris, and connect evacuees to services and temporary housing. Just \nthis week, New Orleans has finally been drained of all water left \nstanding in the city. Health workers are working to address the public \nhealth challenges and the ongoing health needs of the evacuees. And \nStates across the country continue to work with evacuees in their area \nto help them with housing, jobs and services.\n  Relief and recovery efforts have revealed that we have our work cut \nout for us. Thousands of homes were destroyed and more have water marks \nto the ceilings, mold and severe structural damage are everywhere. \nEntire schools and hospitals must be rebuilt. Roads and bridges that \nwere washed out must be replaced. Museums with artifacts of the rich \ncultural tradition of the region have been damaged. Much of what has \nmade these cities and towns vibrant has been destroyed and kept \nresidents away from their beloved communities.\n  We need to make these communities whole again. We need to make them \nstronger and healthier. We need to build the roads and bridges that \nwill bring the many evacuees home to quality, permanent homes, and get \ntheir children back to their schools.\n  We must rebuild the region thoughtfully and swiftly. We owe it to the \nresidents of the region who want to come home. And we owe it to the \nthousands of relief workers, charities, and businesses that have come \ntogether to make the region and its residents safe and secure.\n  It is up to us in Congress to ensure that the region is equipped to \nrebuild. The residents of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans take pride in \ntheir cities and towns and they want to lead the way in reviving their \nown communities. But they desperately need our help. That is why today, \nSenator Gregg and I are introducing the Gulf Coast Recovery and \nDisaster Preparedness Act.\n  We need a response that is as good and generous as the American \npeople but our existing disaster relief structures are not equipped for \nthis monumental task.\n  The primary focus of our Department of Homeland Security is to \nprotect the Nation from terrorism, and it is imperative for that work \nto go on unimpeded. And FEMA is primarily a rapid response agency whose \nfirst responsibility is to provide relief in the immediate aftermath of \na disaster.\n  Given the enormity of the number of people displaced by Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, the rebuilding will be an all-consuming task. And if \nit is to take place as rapidly as possible, it requires the creation of \na new Federal entity to be an effective partner in that effort.\n  Our bill creates a Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Preparedness \nAgency to aid in the work of rebuilding the region. The enormous \nFederal investment that will be needed to revitalize the region would \nbe channeled through this agency. Estimates of the cost of rebuilding \nthe region are as high as $200 billion. We need someone who will be \nresponsible for the coordinated deployment of these dollars.\n  The agency will be headed by a Director, an eminent, nonpartisan \nperson with demonstrated leadership in large organizations. It will \ntake strong leadership that has the attention of the President to \ncoordinate redevelopment efforts and cut through the redtape to ensure \nthat Federal funds are deployed swiftly, efficiently and effectively.\n  Under our bill, the President appoints the Director with the advice \nand consent of the Senate. The Director will have overall control of \nFederal funding, personnel, and assets used for rebuilding the region.\n  The Director of the Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Preparedness \nAgency will work with an Authority, composed primarily of residents \nfrom the affected area, that will develop a comprehensive plan for \nrebuilding the region.\n  Governors, mayors, community leaders, business and non-profit \nleaders, citizens and the Federal Government will be able to sit around \nthe same table to develop a common blueprint for reconstructing their \ncommunities and their lives.\n  While only the Federal Government possesses the necessary resources \nto rebuild the devastated areas, it is essential that State and local \nofficials who know the area best be full partners. Local residents must \nshare the decisionmaking authority. Creating this Authority to develop \na comprehensive plan for redevelopment will guarantee that local \nconcerns are taken seriously.\n  How to rebuild should not be determined by the biggest, most powerful \ncontractors. We need to work from a shared vision for the future in \nwhich we all do our part in rebuilding the new Gulf Coast.\n  The rebuilding process does not merely involve reproducing in place \nthe structures that existed prior to the hurricane and the flooding, \nalthough that alone would be an enormous task. It involves planning for \nthe future of the affected communities.\n  To develop this plan, the Authority will involve the best flood \ncontrol engineers, the best community and urban development \nspecialists, planners, and experts to address rebuilding or restoring \nwater management facilities, environmental restoration, transportation, \nports, housing, schools, hospitals, utility infrastructure, other \npublic facilities, and employment and training.\n  And, while we need to build water control systems and structures that \nwill be able to withstand giant hurricanes and floods in the future, it \nis not just about the bricks and mortar. It is about promoting economic \ndevelopment and improving the quality of life for the residents of the \nregion; it is about preserving the unique historical, cultural and \narchitectural character of communities; and restoring the ecological \nresources of the region. It is about promoting access to housing, \ntransportation, jobs and schools to residents of all incomes.\n  We have a chance to build the Gulf economy of the future--and in \ndoing so improve the entire Nation's economic destiny. We have a chance \nto build a new economy that works for everyone--with diverse housing \nand more job opportunities.\n  We cannot wait any longer. The people of Louisiana, the people of \nMississippi, Alabama and now Texas, and the many States who have taken \nin evacuees, cannot wait any longer. We need to act and appoint an \nexecutive who will lead recovery and redevelopment efforts and really \nlisten to what the residents of the Gulf Coast, its community leaders, \nbusiness leaders and elected officials really need.\n  All of those who visited the region and those who have seen images of \nthe devastation on TV recognize that rebuilding the Gulf Coast requires \nan unprecedented national effort. It must be a principal focus of our \nnational government in the months ahead and it must be done in a \ngenuine collaboration with the people of the affected region.\n  I want to commend my colleague Senator Gregg who has worked very hard \nto ensure that we come up with a sensible way of addressing the \nenormous challenge of rebuilding that lies ahead.\n  We believe that a Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Preparedness \nDirector and a Gulf Coast Revitalization Authority is the best way to \ncombine the Federal resources and coordination with real local \ninvolvement in the decisionmaking process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1866. A bill to establish an Under Secretary for Policy in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and \nSenators Warner and Coburn, to introduce a bill establishing an Under \nSecretary for Policy within the Department of Homeland Security. This \nlegislation would meet a critical need of the Department: an official \nat the highest\n\n[[Page S11323]]\n\nlevel of the Department to develop coherent strategies and provide \ncomprehensive policy guidance for responding to the full range of \nthreats to our homeland.\n  This past spring, soon after being confirmed as the second Secretary \nof Homeland Security, Secretary Chertoff conducted a top-to-bottom \nreview of the Department. As Secretary Chertoff said at the launch of \nthis ``Second Stage Review,'' the Congress created the Department of \nHomeland Security ``to do more than simply erect a big tent under which \na lot of different organizations would be collected.'' Instead, the \npurpose of the Department is to integrate the capabilities and achieve \nunity of effort among a wide range of agencies and entities that are \ninvolved in protecting our homeland.\n  In July, Secretary Chertoff announced the results of the ``Second \nStage Review'' and proposed several organizational changes aimed at \nfurther integrating the Department's many components. Chief among these \nproposed changes was the creation of a Senate-confirmed Under Secretary \nwith responsibility for policy development across the Department.\n  Thus, in keeping with Secretary Chertoff's proposal, this legislation \nwould create an Under Secretary for Policy who is appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate. This Under \nSecretary would serve as the Secretary's principal policy advisor and \nenable the Department to develop comprehensive policies and \nstrategies--across all of the Departments' components--to meet homeland \nsecurity challenge. The Under Secretary's responsibilities would cover \nfour key areas: policy development, strategic planning, international \naffairs, and private sector outreach. The policy development and \nstrategic planning functions are new, while the international affairs \nand private sector outreach functions are transferred from other parts \nof the Department in order to consolidate the full range of policy-\nlevel functions under this Under Secretary.\n  We need no better reason to take up this bill than the tragic events \nof a month ago. Hurricane Katrina was a natural disaster, but the \ndevastation, suffering, and deprivation left in the wake of this \npowerful storm were compounded by the failure of all levels of \ngovernment--local, State, and Federal--to prepare and respond in a \nunified, integrated way. Moreover, the capabilities needed to have \ndealt with Hurricane Katrina are in many instances the same \ncapabilities that are needed to protect America from terrorism.\n  The governmental failures highlighted by Hurricane Katrina are \nevidence of the need for greater integration and unity of effort within \nthe Department. At the heart of this integration, the Department needs \na stronger emphasis on policy development and strategic planning to \nmeet the full range of threats to our homeland. Creating an Under \nSecretary for Policy is a critical step for ensuring that our \ngovernment has a truly capable Department of Homeland Security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill establishing an \nUnder Secretary for Policy within the Department of Homeland Security \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1866\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

He has been a real advocate for victims of Hurricane \nKatrina, and I greatly appreciate his leadership on this issue.\n  We are continuing to learn more about and to grapple with the myriad \nways that the Hurricane Katrina disaster has affected the lives of \nresidents of the Gulf Coast. Hundreds of thousands of people fled their \nhomes, and are temporarily displaced. Most of these people hope to \neventually return to the communities from which they were driven, and \nhave every intention of rebuilding their lives there. As the \ncommunities in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi begin to rebuild, it \nis crucial that those who wish to return are able to take part in the \ngovernment decisions that will have an impact on their communities and \ntheir lives. They must be able to elect the Federal leaders who will \nshape this recovery process.\n  The legislation that I will introduce today will make sure that \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina who are temporarily displaced, and who \nintend to return to their home States, continue to be eligible to vote \nin their States, and that the government takes steps to inform them of \ntheir rights in this area. It would extend the same voting protections \ncurrently available to members of the military and overseas voters to \nthose who are displaced temporarily by Katrina. Individuals who are \nqualified to vote in their original place of residence, and who intend \nto return to that place in the near future, will be able to vote by \nabsentee ballot for Federal elections held through 2008. Voters who \nintend to return to their original place of residence would be able to \nuse the forms available online that are currently used by members of \nthe military and other citizens who are overseas to request absentee \nballots from their home State. Voters requesting an absentee ballot \nwould be required to include an affidavit certifying that they intend \nto return to their home State in the near future with their ballot. The \nbill also directs motor vehicle authorities and voter registration \nagencies to take steps to notify the public that this absentee ballot \noption is available for Katrina victims.\n  This legislation does not mandate where people should vote, nor does \nit place additional burdens on State election officials. It simply puts \na mechanism in place to make sure that these voters do not lose their \nright to vote in elections simply because they are temporarily \ndisplaced.\n  The challenges that we face in the wake of Katrina are many, and \nunfortunately there is some disagreement in Congress about how best to \nhelp those affected by this tragedy. This is different. This bill is a \nstraightforward, simple, and direct response that will help keep the \nelectoral process accessible for victims of Hurricane Katrina. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1867\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure gasoline affordability and security; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Gasoline \nAffordability and Security, GAS, Act. With the average price of \ngasoline at $2.86 a gallon in Pennsylvania and the national average \neven higher, conditions are ripe for Congress to critically examine why \nprices are rising and act to address those factors we can control. \nWhile we have little influence over OPEC, events in oil-exporting \ncountries or growing demand in other nations, we can take steps to \nexpand our shrunken refining capacity, diversify our transportation \nfuel supply and reduce demand.\n  Though critical for our Nation's energy security, the benefits of \nmany Federal policies will take some time to realize. For this reason, \nmy bill combines consumer protection provisions with proposals \nincentivizing innovative technology and conservation.\n  Consumers are understandably concerned that they are being taken \nadvantage of at the pump. My bill will protect consumers by \ndistinguishing retailers engaging in predatory business activities from \nthose simply responding to market conditions beyond their control. \nUnder my proposal, the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, is directed to \ndefine ``price gouging'' and set rules that they will have the \nauthority to enforce. This provision would be effective in times of a \ndeclared energy emergency and would not be limited to a specific \ngeographic area in which a major disaster occurs. My constituents can \nvigorously attest to the fact that the effects of a natural disaster on \ngasoline prices are not confined to that region. The damage caused by \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita has affected consumers' pocketbooks \nnationwide.\n  And to better inform consumers, the FTC will be required to make \navailable a list disclosing the name of any entity penalized under the \nFederal price gouging prohibition.\n  Twenty-eight States currently have price gouging laws on the books. \nIn an effort to further assist States to tackle this issue, the GAS Act \nalso directs the FTC to create a task force that will aid any state \nrequesting assistance with the investigation of potential price gouging \nand provide technical assistance in reviewing or establishing state \nprice gouging laws.\n  High prices are often not the result of price gouging, and consumers \nhave a right to know what they're paying for in a gallon of gasoline. \nThis information is available through the Energy Information \nAssociation, EIA. But because many Americans do not have Internet \naccess or may not be able to easily extract this data, my bill \nencourages the EIA to disseminate, in a\n\n[[Page S11325]]\n\nmanner suitable for posting, information regarding the cost components \nof a gallon of gasoline to individuals selling gas or diesel fuel. \nRetailers may then display this information for their customers.\n  One important strategy to combat rising fuel prices is to diversify \nour fuel supply. This can be accomplished through use of coal, a \nresource plentiful in my State of Pennsylvania and in other regions of \nthe country. Coal-to-liquid fuel technology now enables us to use this \nresource in an environmentally friendly way that can greatly benefit \nour economy and create hundreds of jobs in Pennsylvania alone. I am \nproud to be a longtime supporter of this technology and other clean \ncoal initiatives. In 2001, I was able to secure language to enable a \nPennsylvania-based coal and energy company to compete for a Clean Coal \nPower Initiative, CCPI, grant, and I was pleased to secure a provision \nin the Energy bill earlier this year that helped make this project a \nreality. My legislation will further encourage the production of this \nclean fuel by dedicating funds from the CCPI to at least one additional \nproject.\n  Another way all Americans can help reduce fuel prices is to reduce \ngasoline consumption. But the reality is that cutting back on gas, \nwhich we need to perform responsibilities as basic as going to work and \ngetting to the grocery store, is not easy. To help encourage \nconservation, I am proposing a tax credit for employees who telecommute \nfrom home and for employers who make that possible. With today's \nadvanced technology, telework should be a part of the 21st century \nworkplace. Forty percent of our Nation's jobs are already compatible \nwith telecommuting. It creates the best of all worlds for both \nemployers and employees, while reducing gas consumption and emissions.\n  President Bush recently called on Federal agencies to cut back on \nunnecessary travel and look for other ways to conserve fuel. The \nlegislative branch should make a concerted effort to do the same. We \ncannot expect the American people to make sacrifices that we ourselves \nare not willing to make. Accordingly, my bill includes language to urge \nCongress and legislative branch employees to conserve transportation \nfuel by whatever means practicable, and as a part of these efforts, \npromote teleworking.\n  It is my hope that Congress will take a hard look at this country's \nfuel supply and will act decisively to make us less reliant on foreign \nsources. This Act contains steps we can take now to protect consumers \nand conserve fuel, while moving towards our goal of lower prices and \nenergy independence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation titled: the \n``Gasoline Affordability and Security Act'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1868\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 271\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the Nation requires that the \n     young people of the United States become an involved, caring \n     citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth, to help young people \n     develop the essential traits and characteristics that \n     comprise good character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the Nation;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those who have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Character Counts \n     Week, during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations would focus on character education, would \n     be of great benefit to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n\n[[Page S11327]]\n\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 16, 2005, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to--\n       (A) embrace the elements of character identified by local \n     schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; and\n       (B) observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, programs, \n     and activities.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend Senator Dodd \nto introduce a resolution regarding National Character Counts Week. Our \nresolution says the week of October 16 through 22 of this year will be \nknown across the country as National Character Counts Week.\n  I have risen many times on this Senate floor to speak about the \nimportance of character in our everyday lives. Over this past year, \nthere have been many instances when our individual and our country's \ncharacter have been challenged. These situations have compelled us to \nevaluate our core beliefs, our ethics, but most of all our character. I \nask that everyone take some time during October 16-22 to stop and \nreflect upon their individual core character beliefs.\n  The Character Counts program identifies the following values as the \nSix Pillars of Character. They are: trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. Character Counts \nincludes support from forty States and 500 municipalities, school \ndistricts, and business groups. But not only is this program promoting \nthe six tenants nationwide, it is becoming utilized on an international \nlevel as well. Last year in 2004, celebrations for Character Counts \nWeek included Bangkok, Thailand; Busan, Korea; and Cholutecta, \nHonduras.\n  Since my initial involvement with Character Counts in 1993, I have \nalways had a specific interest in the programs run in my home State of \nNew Mexico, especially how these programs have influenced students. \nFrom its start in Albuquerque, it has expanded statewide to areas such \nas Grants, Shiprock, Roswell, Laguna, Portales, Farmington, Carlsbad, \nRamah, and Los Alamos. I am proud to say that many of the staffers in \nmy personal office are graduates of the initial chartering program of \nCharacter Counts New Mexico. It is extremely rewarding to hear how this \nprogram impacted their lives growing up and I look forward to continual \ndevelopment of this program not only in my home State but nationally \nand internationally.\n  I believe we can all learn a lot from the Character Counts program. \nWhile the Character Counts program specifically focuses on youth, I \nwould like to share some of the simple lessons that are taught under \nthe Six Pillars of Character. These words might be simple but they \nspeak with magnitude.\n  Trustworthiness: Be honest. Don't deceive, cheat or steal. Be \nreliable--do what you say you'll do. Have the courage to do the right \nthing. Build a good reputation. Be loyal--stand by your family, friends \nand country.\n  Respect: Treat others with respect; follow the Golden Rule. Be \ntolerant of differences. Use good manners, not bad language. Be \nconsiderate of the feelings of others. Don't threaten, hit or hurt \nanyone. Deal peacefully with anger, insults and disagreements.\n  Responsibility: Do what you are supposed to do. Persevere: keep on \ntrying. Always do your best. Use self-control. Be self-disciplined. \nThink before you act--consider the consequences. Be accountable for \nyour choices.\n  Fairness: Play by the rules. Take turns and share. Be open-minded; \nlisten to others. Don't take advantage of others. Don't blame others \ncarelessly.\n  Caring: Be kind. Be compassionate and show you care. Express \ngratitude. Forgive others. Help people in need.\n  Citizenship: Do your share to make your school and community better. \nCooperate. Get involved in community affairs. Stay informed; vote. Be a \ngood neighbor. Obey laws and rules. Respect authority. Protect the \nenvironment.\n  The bottom line is that I believe the Character Counts program is \nworking in New Mexico and other parts of the country. Today, we salute \nthe efforts already underway and encourage even more character \neducation across our country.\n  So today, Senator Dodd and I are here to introduce a resolution to \naccomplish just that and hopefully our renewed effort will bring \ntogether even more communities to ensure that character education is a \npart of every child's life.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this effort.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici, in submitting a resolution declaring the \nweek of October 16th ``National Character Counts Week.'' Senator \nDomenici and I have worked together for many years on the issue of \ncharacter education and hope that by designating a special week to this \ncause, students and teachers will come together to participate in \ncharacter building activities in their schools. In 1994, Senator \nDomenici and I established the Partnerships in Character Education \nPilot Project and have worked regularly since then to commemorate \nNational Character Counts Week. I am pleased that we are continuing our \nefforts today to help expand States' and schools' abilities to make \ncharacter education a central part of every child's education.\n  Our schools may be built with the bricks of English, math and \nscience, but character education certainly is the mortar. Character \neducation means teaching students about such qualities as caring, \ncitizenship, fairness, respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, and \nother qualities that their community values. It isn't a separate \nsubject, but part of a seamless garment of learning providing students \nwith a context within which to learn.\n  Earlier this week I was in Connecticut attending an event that \nhonored the fundamentals of character education, especially those of \ncaring, responsibility and citizenship. In response to the devastation \ncaused by the tsunami last December, Connecticut schoolchildren across \nthe State came together to raise money for tsunami relief. \nCollectively, 350 schools rose over $300,000 in hopes of building a \nschool in Sri Lanka. Knowing that it would take approximately a half \nmillion dollars to rebuild one, the students also worked to find a \nnonprofit willing to match their donation. They did. The Brother's \nBrother Foundation, a nonprofit that seeks to improve international \nhealth and education, brought the final contribution amount to \n$600,000.\n  These collective dollars will be used to build a 1,500-pupil school \nconsisting of four buildings, including science and computer labs, in \nSri Lanka. But that's not all. Dedicated to their cause, these students \nplan to continue to donate money for the next five years to fill the \nSri Lankan students' library with books and to make sure that they have \nnecessary school supplies. Since the initial fundraising effort, these \nsame students have begun collecting small change and checks for Katrina \nrelief efforts. These efforts, efforts to help students, hundreds and \nsome times hundreds of thousands of miles away, demonstrate character \nat its best.\n  Schools across the country that have adopted formal character \neducation programs report better student performance, fewer discipline \nproblems, and increased student involvement within the community. \nChildren want direction--they want to be taught right from wrong. The \nAmerican public wants character education in our schools, too. Studies \nshow that about 90 percent of Americans support schools teaching \ncharacter education.\n  As all education policy should be, character education is bi-\npartisan. This year we have 26 cosponsors to our resolution, cosponsors \non both sides of the aisle. Character education not only cultivates \nminds, it nurtures hearts. While our children may be one-quarter of our \npopulation, they are 100 percent of our future.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \noffered by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Pete Domenici. For \nmany years, I have supported his efforts to identify a week in October \nas National Character Counts Week. The important aspect of this \nlegislation is its focus on children. Children growing up in these \ntimes often face much more difficult experiences and must mature more \nquickly than when I was young. One of fastest growing problems in \nMontana is the rate of methamphetamine use and addiction by teens. All \nit takes is one try--teens get hooked trying to recreate that first \nrush. It is vitally important to encourage young people to have \npositive role models in their lives in\n\n[[Page S11328]]\n\norder to develop a strong, positive character to avoid the temptation \nto try meth or engage in other dangerous behaviors. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution, and I thank Senator Domenici for \nhis leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11328-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 272--RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE LIFE AND \n ACHIEVEMENTS OF CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY, A JUDGE FOR THE UNITED STATES \n             DISTRICT COURT, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. \nBayh, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Wyden, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nHarkin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Leahy, \nMr. Hatch, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \nHagel, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Reid, and Mr. \nKerry) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Connan, which \n     was received by the Senate and appeared in the Congressional \n     Record of July 29, 2005.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the nomination of Stewart \nBaker to be Assistant Secretary for Policy at the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Last week, when Mr. Baker's nomination came before the Senate \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, I voted no. \nThat is my position today.\n  Mr. Baker is an intelligent and accomplished man, but he does not \nhave the experience necessary to fill this important post at this \nimportant time. Mr. Baker is a lawyer with experience in national \nsecurity, trade, and technology. He has been widely published on topics \nsuch as cyber-security and civil liberties. I understand that he \nperformed capably as the general counsel of the Silverman-Robb \nCommission on WMD intelligence capabilities. Mr. Baker might be well \nqualified for many positions at DHS, but he is not qualified to be \nAssistant Secretary for Policy.\n  During his confirmation hearing before our committee, Mr. Stewart \ntestified that he expected to be the ``central player'' at DHS on \n``lessons learned'' from Hurricane Katrina, to develop emergency \nresponse policy, and to be a key player on immigration reform, among \nother matters. Yet when asked at his hearing if he had emergency \nresponse experience, he said ``no.'' He also admitted to having little \nexpertise on immigration issues.\n  While no one could be expected to be an expert on all of the issues \naddressed by DHS, it makes little sense to me to appoint a person with \nno emergency response experience to be the central player on lessons \nlearned from Katrina, or to appoint a person with little immigration \nexpertise to articulate Federal immigration policy, especially when, \nover the next few years, both issues--emergency response and \nimmigration--will be so prominent at the Department. As we have learned \nfrom the Katrina disaster, we cannot afford to have inexperienced \npeople in senior positions at DHS for on-the-job training.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11331-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 237\n\n       Whereas, on June 10, 1999, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 1244 which authorized the \n     Secretary-General of the United Nations to establish an \n     interim administration for Kosovo to assume the supreme legal \n     authority in Kosovo with the task of promoting ``substantial \n     autonomy and self-governance'' in Kosovo and facilitating a \n     political process to determine the future status of Kosovo;\n       Whereas, on December 10, 2003, the United Nations interim \n     administration, known as the United Nations Interim \n     Administration Mission in Kosovo, presented the Standards for \n     Kosovo document which set out the requirements to be met to \n     advance stability in Kosovo;\n       Whereas the Standards for Kosovo require the establishment \n     of functioning democratic institutions in Kosovo, including \n     providing for the holding of elections, establishing the \n     Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, and establishing \n     media and civil society, the establishment of rule of law to \n     ensure equal access to justice and to implement mechanisms to \n     suppress economic and financial crime, and the establishment \n     of freedom of movement in Kosovo, including the free use of \n     language;\n       Whereas the Standards for Kosovo further require \n     sustainable returns and the rights of communities and their \n     members, improvements in economic and financial institutions, \n     including the prevention of money laundering and the \n     establishment of an attractive environment for investors, the \n     establishment of property rights, including the\n\n[[Page S11332]]\n\n     preservation of cultural heritage, and the development of a \n     sustained dialogue, including a Pristina-Belgrade dialogue \n     and a regional dialogue;\n       Whereas the ethnic violence that occurred in Kosovo from \n     March 17, 2004 through March 19, 2004, represented a severe \n     setback to the progress the people of Kosovo achieved in \n     implementing the Standards for Kosovo and resulted in 20 \n     deaths and damage to or destruction of approximately 900 \n     homes and 30 Serbian Orthodox churches and other religious \n     sites;\n       Whereas the bomb attacks against the people and \n     international institutions in Kosovo that occurred from July \n     2, 2005 through July 4, 2005, were unacceptable events that \n     work counter to the interests and efforts of the majority of \n     the people of Kosovo and signal that more work must be done \n     to promote the implementation of the Standards for Kosovo;\n       Whereas the status of Kosovo, which is neither stable nor \n     sustainable, is a critical issue affecting the aspirations of \n     Southeast Europe for stability, peace, and eventual \n     membership in the European Union;\n       Whereas the authorities and institutions of Kosovo must be \n     empowered to act independently to achieve the Standards for \n     Kosovo so that such authorities and institutions may assume \n     responsibility for any progress or setbacks;\n       Whereas 2005 must be a year of decision for representatives \n     of Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro, and the United Nations to \n     move forward on the status of Kosovo;\n       Whereas the basic values of multi-ethnicity, democracy, and \n     market-orientation must remain at the heart of any effort to \n     resolve the question of the future status of Kosovo; and\n       Whereas the support of all of the people of Kosovo is \n     required to achieve a successful outcome that addresses those \n     basic values: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the unresolved status of Kosovo is neither sustainable \n     nor beneficial to the progress toward stability and peace in \n     Southeast Europe and its integration with Europe;\n       (2) the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia and Montenegro and the \n     representatives of the United Nations should work toward an \n     agreement on the future status of Kosovo and a plan for \n     transformation in Kosovo;\n       (3) such agreement and plan should--\n       (A) address the claims and satisfy the key concerns of the \n     people of Kosovo and the people of Serbia and Montenegro;\n       (B) seek compromises from both Kosovo and Serbia and \n     Montenegro to reach an agreement;\n       (C) promote the integration of Southeast Europe with the \n     European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n       (D) reinforce efforts to encourage full cooperation by the \n     governments of Kosovo and of Serbia and Montenegro with the \n     International Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia;\n       (E) promote stability in the region and take into \n     consideration the stability of democracy in Kosovo and in \n     Serbia and Montenegro;\n       (F) promote the active participation of Serbians in Kosovo \n     in elections and in the government of Kosovo; and\n       (G) require the fulfillment of the Standards for Kosovo, \n     the requirements that the United Nations Interim \n     Administration Mission in Kosovo established to advance \n     stability in Kosovo, in accordance with prior commitments and \n     in support of the initiation of discussions on status with \n     particular emphasis on the problem of human rights in \n     minority communities;\n       (4) the anticipated discussions of the long-term status of \n     Kosovo should result in a plan for implementing the Standards \n     for Kosovo, particularly with regard to minority protections, \n     return of property, and the development of rule of law as it \n     relates to the improvement of protection of minorities, the \n     return of internally displaced persons, the return of \n     property, and the prosecution of human rights violations; and\n       (5) Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro, and the United Nations, \n     during the negotiations related to the long-term status of \n     Kosovo, should require--\n       (A) increased monitoring and reporting of the progress on \n     the implementation of the Standards for Kosovo and any \n     incidents of human rights violations, and should broaden the \n     involvement of minorities and community-level representatives \n     in monitoring, reporting, and publicizing that progress;\n       (B) that the authorities and institutions of Kosovo be \n     given greater authority and independence in fulfilling the \n     Standards for Kosovo, including assuming the responsibility \n     for any setbacks and progress and acquiring experience in \n     assuming greater autonomy; and\n       (C) a broad public awareness campaign to raise awareness of \n     both the plan to resolve the question of the status of Kosovo \n     and the requirements for the transition of Kosovo to a \n     permanent status, including the importance of the progress in \n     implementing the Standards for Kosovo and the necessity of \n     ensuring peace and suppressing all forms of discrimination \n     and violence so that the region may move forward toward a \n     future of greater prosperity, stability, and lasting peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11332-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EXTENDING AUTHORITY OF THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Res. 271\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the Nation requires that the \n     young people of the United States become an involved, caring \n     citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth, to help young people \n     develop the essential traits and characteristics that \n     comprise good character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the Nation;\n\n[[Page S11333]]\n\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those who have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Character Counts \n     Week, during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations would focus on character education, would \n     be of great benefit to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 16, 2005, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to--\n       (A) embrace the elements of character identified by local \n     schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; and\n       (B) observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, programs, \n     and activities. 3\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/07/senate-section/article/S11333-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11333-S11334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF CONSTANCE BAKER \n                                 MOTLEY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 272, submitted early \ntoday by Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please report the resolution by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 272) recognizing and honoring the \n     life and achievements of Constance Baker Motley, a judge for \n     the United States District Court, Southern District of New \n     York.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am in support of this resolution to \nrecognize and honor the life and achievements of Constance Baker \nMotley, a judge for the United States District Court, Southern District \nof New York. Sadly, Judge Motley passed away last week, on September \n28, 2005, at the age of 84, after having lived an extraordinary and \nexemplary life.\n  Constance Baker Motley was the first African American woman, and only \nthe fifth woman, to serve on the federal judiciary. Before becoming a \njudge, she was a renowned civil rights lawyer, public servant, and \ntrailblazer. Her remarkable career reads like a civil rights history \nbook.\n  After earning her Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from New York \nUniversity and her law degree from Columbia University, Constance Baker \nMotley joined Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense and \nEducational Fund. For 2 decades, Constance Baker Motley worked closely \nwith Marshall and other leading civil rights lawyers to dismantle \ndesegregation throughout the country.\n  She was the only woman on the legal team that won the landmark \ndesegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education. She went on to argue \n10 major civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, winning all but \none of them, including James Meredith's fight to gain admission to the \nUniversity of Mississippi.\n  In 1964, Judge Motley became the first African-American woman elected \nto the New York State Senate, and in 1965, she became the first \nAfrican-American woman, and woman, to serve as a city borough \npresident, the great borough of Manhattan. During this time, Judge \nMotley worked tirelessly to revitalize the inner city and improve urban \nhousing and public schools.\n  In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Constance Baker Motley \nto the Southern District of New York. She was confirmed 9 months later, \nover the strong opposition of Southern Senators. She rose to the \nposition of Chief Judge in 1982, and assumed senior status 4 years \nlater. She served with distinction for nearly 4 decades, until last \nweek. Her passing is a great loss to New York, as well as the country, \nand for this reason her life must be remembered and celebrated.\n  This resolution extends the Senate's heartfelt sympathy to Judge \nMotley's friends and family and commends her for her 39-year tenure on \nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of New York \nand her lifelong commitment to the advancement of civil rights and \nsocial justice.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to say that, as I have often \nthought, justice is a curious thing.\n  She has been poked and prodded, detained and defaced, and her \npiercing light is too often hidden from view. Justice had a tough time \nin Montgomery and Selma, and she took a sore drumming alongside Susan \nB. Anthony and the other fighters for women's suffrage. If you asked \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. or Ms. Fannie Lou Hamer where justice was \nduring those cold nights in jail in 1963, they might have said that she \nwas nowhere to be found.\n  But inevitably and incredibly justice always seems to find her way. \nShe creeps into the dark spots of our history. She rears her head where \nshe is not wanted. And, eventually, she causes the barriers meant to \nhold her back to crack and crumble, under the collective weight of \nthose who fight for her cause.\n  On January 25, 1966, justice was at it again. It was on that date \nafter a storied career of educational success, fervent legal advocacy, \nand legislative accomplishments that Constance Baker Motley became the \nfirst African-American woman appointed to the Federal judiciary. Judge \nMotley passed away on September 28, 2005, at the age of 84. She is \nsurvived by her husband Joel, a son, three sisters and a brother. I \nrise today to honor her and the concept of justice for which she fought \nall her life.\n  Constance Baker was born on September 14, 1921, in New Haven, CT. Her \nfather was a chef for an exclusive club at Yale, and her mother was \nactive in the NAACP. She graduated from New York University in 1943 and \nreceived her law degree from Columbia University in 1946. As a third-\nyear student at Columbia, Judge Motley joined the staff of the NAACP \nLegal Defense and Educational Fund. She would eventually become its \nprincipal trial attorney.\n  Judge Motley's list of accomplishments while working for the Legal \nDefense Fund is stunning. In 1950, she drafted the complaint that would \nbecome Brown v. Board of Education. In 1957 she argued the case in \nLittle Rock, AR, which prompted President Eisenhower to call in Federal \ntroops to protect the ``Little Rock Nine''. She personally argued the \n1962 case in which James Meredith won admission to the University of \nMississippi, as well as the suit that resulted in the enrollment of \nblack students at the University of Georgia. All told, Judge Motley won \n9 of the 10 civil rights cases she argued before the Supreme Court, an \nastounding accomplishment for that or any other time period.\n  After 20 years with the NAACP, Judge Motley was elected to the New \nYork State Senate and became the first African-American woman to serve \nin that body. Among her first tasks was fighting for additional low- \nand middle-income housing. In February of 1965, Judge Motley was \nelected to serve as the President of the Borough of Manhattan, becoming \nthe first woman of any race to serve in that post. And in 1966, \nPresident Johnson helped bring justice's work full circle. He appointed \nJudge Motley to the Federal District Court for the Southern District \nCourt of New York, making her the first African American woman to sit \non the Federal bench. She served with distinction in the Southern \nDistrict, and became the chief judge of this court in 1982. She took \nsenior status in 1986.\n  I honor Judge Motley today. I honor her for her wisdom, for her \ntenacity, and for the fire with which she advocated for equal rights. \nAnd, equally important, I honor the spirit of justice that motivated \nConstance Baker Motley. It spurred her on from her early days in \nConnecticut to her long and distinguished tenure on the Federal bench. \nI ask that this body and all Americans remember Judge Motley today. And \nI ask that we attempt to infuse the same sense of justice which\n\n[[Page S11334]]\n\nguided Judge Motley into our own work, and our daily lives.\n  I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues in \nintroducing a resolution honoring the life of Judge Constance Baker \nMotley and I hope this body will move swiftly to its passage.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that \nany statements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 272) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT SUBJECT TO UNDERSTANDING\n\n       Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein), The Senate advises and consents to the ratification \n     of the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism (the \n     ``Convention''), adopted at the thirty-second regular session \n     of the General Assembly of the Organization of American \n     States meeting in Bridgetown, Barbados, and signed by the \n     United States on June 3, 2002 (Treaty Doc. 107-18), subject \n     to the understanding in Section 2.\n\n     SECTION 2. UNDERSTANDING\n\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following understanding, which shall be \n     included in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       The United States of America understands that the term \n     ``international humanitarian law'' in paragraph 2 of Article \n     15 of the Convention has the same substantive meaning as the \n     law of war.\n\n     SECTION 3. RESERVATIONS, UNDERSTANDING, AND DECLARATION \n                   RELATIVE TO THE TRAFFICKING PROTOCOL\n\n       (a) Reservations.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     under section 1 is subject to the following reservations \n     relative to the Trafficking Protocol, which shall be included \n     in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The United States of America reserves the right not to \n     apply in part the obligation set forth in Article 15, \n     paragraph 1(b), of the United Nations Convention Against \n     Transnational Organized Crime with respect to the offenses \n     established in the Trafficking Protocol. The United States \n     does not provide for plenary jurisdiction over offenses that \n     are committed on board ships flying its flag or aircraft \n     registered under its laws. However, in a number of \n     circumstances, U.S. law provides for jurisdiction over such \n     offenses committed on board U.S.-flagged ships or aircraft \n     registered under U.S. law. Accordingly, the United States \n     will implement paragraph 1(b) of the Convention to the extent \n     provided for under its federal law.\n       (2) The United States of America reserves the right to \n     assume obligations under this Protocol in a manner consistent \n     with its fundamental principles of federalism, pursuant\n\n[[Page S11335]]\n\n     to which both federal and state criminal laws must be \n     considered in relation to conduct addressed in the Protocol. \n     U.S. federal criminal law, which regulates conduct based on \n     its effect on interstate or foreign commerce, or another \n     federal interest, such as the Thirteenth Amendment's \n     prohibition of ``slavery'' and ``involuntary servitude,'' \n     serves as the principal legal regime within the United States \n     for combating the conduct addressed in this Protocol, and is \n     broadly effective for this purpose. Federal criminal law does \n     not apply in the rare case where such criminal conduct does \n     not so involve interstate or foreign commerce, or otherwise \n     implicate another federal interest, such as the Thirteenth \n     Amendment. There are a small number of conceivable situations \n     involving such rare offenses of a purely local character \n     where U.S. federal and state criminal law may not be entirely \n     adequate to satisfy an obligation under the Protocol. The \n     United States of America therefore reserves to the \n     obligations set forth in the Protocol to the extent they \n     address conduct which would fall within this narrow category \n     of highly localized activity. This reservation does not \n     affect in any respect the ability of the United States to \n     provide international cooperation to other Parties as \n     contemplated in the Protocol.\n       (3) In accordance with Article 15, paragraph 3, the United \n     States of America declares that it does not consider itself \n     bound by the obligation set forth in Article 15, paragraph 2.\n       (b) Understanding.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     under section 1 is subject to the following understanding \n     relative to the Trafficking Protocol, which shall be included \n     in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       The United States of America understands the obligation to \n     establish the offenses in the Protocol as money laundering \n     predicate offenses, in light of Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of \n     the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized \n     Crime, as requiring States Parties whose money laundering \n     legislation sets forth a list of specific predicate offenses \n     to include in such list a comprehensive range of offenses \n     associated with trafficking in persons.\n       (c) Declaration.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     under section 1 is subject to the following declaration \n     relative to the Trafficking Protocol:\n       The United States of America declares that, in view of its \n     reservations, current United States law, including the laws \n     of the States of the United States, fulfills the obligations \n     of the Protocol for the United States. Accordingly, the \n     United States of America does not intend to enact new \n     legislation to fulfill its obligations under the Protocol.\n\n     SECTION 4. RESERVATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING RELATIVE TO THE \n                   SMUGGLING PROTOCOL\n\n       (a) Reservations.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     under section 1 is subject to the following reservations \n     relative to the Smuggling Protocol, which shall be included \n     in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The United States of America criminalizes most but not \n     all forms of attempts to commit the offenses established in \n     accordance with Article 6, paragraph 1 of this Protocol. With \n     respect to the obligation under Article 6, Paragraph 2(a), \n     the United States of America reserves the right to \n     criminalize attempts to commit the conduct described in \n     Article 6, paragraph 1(b), to the extent that under its laws \n     such conduct relates to false or fraudulent passports and \n     other specified identity documents, constitutes fraud or the \n     making of a false statement, or constitutes attempted use of \n     a false or fraudulent visa.\n       (2) In accordance with Article 20, paragraph 3, the United \n     States of America declares that it does not consider itself \n     bound by the obligation set forth in Article 20, paragraph 2.\n       (b) Understanding.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     under section 1 is subject to the following understanding \n     relative to the Smuggling Protocol, which shall be included \n     in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       The United States of America understands the obligation to \n     establish the offenses in the Protocol as money laundering \n     predicate offenses, in light of Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of \n     the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized \n     Crime, as requiring States Parties whose money laundering \n     legislation sets forth a list of specific predicate offenses \n     to include in such list a comprehensive range of offenses \n     associated with smuggling of migrants.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senate is prepared to ratify two \nimportant treaties, the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism, \nand the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized \nCrime.\n  As a former prosecutor, I believe these treaties will provide \nimportant tools in our war against terrorism and organized crime.\n  However, as chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, and as a \nUnited States Senator, it is my job to carefully review all legislation \nand treaties to ensure that they are consistent with our Constitution \nand in the best interest of the United States.\n  In reviewing these treaties, there were two matters I felt needed \nfurther clarification.\n  First, the issue of extradition. I believe it is important that if we \nare going to enter into an extradition arrangement, it strengthen our \nhand with respect to nations, such as Mexico, who have refused to \nextradite violent criminals to the United States for prosecution. It \nserves no purpose to enter into treaties with no teeth.\n  Second, the International Criminal Court: The position of the United \nStates has been firm in opposition to any expanded powers of the \nInternational Criminal Court. These treaties were silent on the ICC. \nThey did not explicitly permit the ICC from exercising jurisdiction \nover matters, nor do they prohibit it from doing so. Were I not \nabsolutely certain that these treaties would provide no mechanism for \nan overzealous ICC prosecutor to assert new jurisdiction, these \ntreaties would not be ratified today.\n  However, based on an exchange of correspondence with the United \nStates Department of Justice, I am satisfied that there is absolutely \nno way the ICC may assert any new jurisdiction based upon these \ntreaties.\n  I received this letter by fax within the last few minutes, and it is \non this basis that I am permitting these treaties to proceed. I am \nconfident that these treaties are in the interest of the United States, \nand this correspondence will serve as legislative history with respect \nto the concerns I just addressed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the above-referenced letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: We are pleased to have the \n     opportunity to respond to your letter of October 6, posing \n     questions about the United Nations Convention Against \n     Transnational Organized Crime and the Inter-American \n     Convention Against Terrorism. Both Conventions are strongly \n     supported by the Administration, and we urge immediate action \n     by the Senate to provide its advice and consent to \n     ratification. As you may be aware, the first Conference of \n     States Parties to the U.N. transnational organized crime \n     convention will commence in Vienna on October 10, and thus \n     there is particular urgency to the Senate acting today to \n     approve this treaty and thereby strengthen the United States' \n     ability to participate effectively at this meeting.\n       Your first question concerned Article 16 of the U.N. \n     Convention on transnational organized crime and its impact on \n     our existing bilateral extradition relations. This is a \n     common provision in multilateral law enforcement treaties, \n     and it can strengthen our extradition relationships under \n     existing bilateral extradition treaties by requiring that the \n     organized crime offenses covered by the U.N. Convention be \n     included as extraditable offenses under those existing \n     treaties. This can be helpful with older treaties that \n     contain a limited list of extraditable offenses. Our treaty \n     with Mexico, however, is not so limited.\n       As you suggest in your letter, a particular concern with \n     Mexico at this time is the impact of a 2001 Mexican Supreme \n     Court decision which barred extradition where a defendant \n     would be subject to a life sentence. The U.N. Convention does \n     not resolve this issue; at the same time it in no way \n     endorses, or requires the United States to acquiesce in, such \n     a limitation on extradition. You can be assured that \n     resolving this problem in our extradition relations with \n     Mexico remains a major objective of the Departments of \n     Justice and State and is one that Attorney General Gonzales \n     has raised personally with the Mexican Attorney General and \n     with the Mexican Foreign Minister. We are hopeful that a \n     recent decision of the Mexican Supreme Court in a domestic \n     criminal case may open the door to a favorable revision of \n     its 2001 decision, and we are committed to working with \n     Mexico to that end.\n       With respect to your question concerning potential \n     interplay between these treaties and the International \n     Criminal Court (ICC), I can assure you that the \n     Administration continues to have fundamental concerns about \n     the ICC and would not advocate the United States joining any \n     treaty that would expand the jurisdiction of the ICC or \n     impose directly or indirectly any obligation on the United \n     States to support the ICC. The jurisdiction of the ICC is \n     strictly defined by the Rome statute at Article 5. Neither of \n     the treaties now being considered by the Senate extends or \n     could extend that jurisdiction. This is clear from the text \n     of the treaties and the intent of the negotiators. Moreover, \n     in no respect will the United States becoming a party to \n     these two treaties affect the provisions of the American \n     Service-members' Protection Act of 2002 (ASPA), including its \n     restrictions on assistance to the ICC. We do\n\n[[Page S11336]]\n\n     not believe there is any ambiguity on these points and thus \n     no need for clarification through understandings in the \n     resolution of ratification. You and other members of the \n     Senate can be confident that the Administration shares your \n     concerns about the ICC and is fully satisfied that none of \n     those concerns are implicated in these treaties.\n       We have consulted with the Department of State, which \n     concurs fully in these views, and hope with this letter you \n     and your colleagues will be able to vote in favor of these \n     two important treaties today.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William E. Moschella,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Senate Steering Committee,\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2005.\n     Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Attorney General: I am writing regarding two \n     critical treaties that the Senate is considering. As a former \n     prosecutor, I believe these treaties could provide important \n     new tools to law enforcement. However, before we ratify them, \n     I seek your assistance in addressing several concerns.\n       1. Article 16 of the United Nations Convention Against \n     Transnational Organized Crime. I am interested in learning \n     whether or not the extradition provisions of this treaty \n     would strengthen our current bilateral arrangements to \n     address problems we have had with nations such as Mexico who \n     refuse to extradite dangerous criminals to the United States. \n     Further, it would appear that our moral position for \n     extradition would be undermined if we explicitly acquiesce in \n     allowing the nation to consider penalties as a basis for \n     denying extradition.\n       2. International Criminal Court. The ICC is mentioned in \n     neither treaty, and the Department of Justice attorneys have \n     maintained that the ICC would have no jurisdiction over \n     matters addressed in them. However, the main reason that the \n     United States rejects the Rome Statute is that the ICC has \n     one prosecutor who initiates investigations with virtually \n     unchecked discretion. I seek further clarification from the \n     Department on whether we can be absolutely certain that these \n     treaties would not provide a vehicle for a case to be brought \n     to the ICC by an overzealous prosecutor. Absent such \n     certainty, it would be my desire to include an understanding \n     to the resolution of ratification that clarifies the United \n     States's position that the ICC may not try cases under the \n     Convention or avail itself of the Convention's extradition or \n     judicial assistance provisions. We could also add an explicit \n     understanding to the resolution that ASPA shall govern \n     application of the Convention by the Executive branch.\n       Thank you for your assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jeff Sessions.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for a division vote on the \nresolutions of ratification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A division vote is requested. Senators in \nfavor of the resolutions will rise and stand until counted.\n  Those opposed will rise and stand until counted.\n  On a division vote, two-thirds of the Senators present and voting \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the resolutions of ratification are \nagreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am delighted to represent two-thirds of \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
