Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to executive session to consider calendar No. 71, the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nFifth Circuit; provided further that the first hour of debate, from \n9:45 to 10:45, be under the control of the majority leader or his \ndesignee; further that the next hour, from 10:45 to 11:45, be under the \ncontrol of the Democratic leader or his designee; and the time for \ndebate rotate in a similar manner every 60 minutes; provided further \nthat the Senate recess from 3:45 to 4:45 to accommodate an all-Senators \nbriefing; provided further that the time from 5:45 to 7:15 be under the \ncontrol of the Democratic leader and the time from 7:15 to 7:45 be \nunder the control of the majority leader or his designee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first of all, \nI would ask the distinguished majority leader to amend his unanimous \nconsent request to have the time begin when we complete our statements \ntoday. We might not be at a quarter of the hour, but whenever that \nwould be we would rotate on an hourly basis.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the modified \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have another reservation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished majority \nleader would we not be better off moving to\n\n[[Page S5374]]\n\nget rid of--I don't mean that in a pejorative sense--but clear the \ncalendar of four, at this stage, noncontroversial judges? We could move \nto Thomas Griffith, who is on the calendar. We could move to discharge \nand consider the Michigan Circuit Court nominees, Griffin, McKeague, \nand Neilson. We could get time agreements on all those. We would have \nfour circuit judges. They would be able to go to work within a few \ndays--actually go to work. Otherwise, they are going to be waiting \nuntil we go through all of this. It would seem to me that would be the \nbetter thing to do. So I would ask the distinguished majority leader if \nhe would agree that we could move to these, with reasonable time \nagreements, prior to moving to Priscilla Owen?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, we have given careful \nconsideration of which would be the most appropriate person to begin \nwith. It is Priscilla Owen. So we will proceed with Priscilla Owen. \nThere are five people on the Executive Calendar, and our intention \nwould be to debate these nominees, one by one; and hopefully, as other \nnominees come out of the Judiciary Committee, to take them up as well. \nSo we will be proceeding with Priscilla Owen.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one further statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in that we have started this process, my \nfriend, the distinguished majority leader, should be advised we will \nnot agree to committees meeting during the time we are doing debate on \nPriscilla Owen.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request, \nas modified?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was wondering if our leader is familiar \nwith the letter which members of our Judiciary Committee sent to the \nchairman of our committee that points out there are now some 30 \nvacancies on the Federal bench for which the President has not yet sent \na nominee to the Senate. If he would work with Senators of both parties \nto identify qualified, consensus nominees for each of these spots, the \nvacancy numbers on our courts could be lowered even further. However, \nas much as we have offered to work with him finding these nominees and \ngetting them confirmed, there has been absolutely no response.\n  I am just wondering whether, as we are addressing the issues of one \nnominee--and the issue that is before the Senate is filling vacancies \non the courts--I am just interested if the majority leader has any \ninformation from the administration as to when we are going to be able \nto fill these other nominations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would be happy to look at the letter and \nrequest of the administration, what requests are made in the letter, \nand see what their response would be.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, what I would like to do is proceed \nwith Priscilla Owen, who is a qualified nominee, who is a nominee we \nare going to have a lot of debate on back and forth, to determine \nwhether or not she is out of the mainstream, as people say. We will go \nthrough regular order and take these nominees the President has \nsubmitted to the Judiciary Committee, who have been fully evaluated in \nthe Judiciary Committee, and who now are on the Executive Calendar \nready for business.\n  So we are going to begin that debate shortly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, reserving my rights further, Mr. President, as I \nunderstand, there is a new nominee who is on the Executive Calendar, \nBrian Sandoval of Nevada, who has general broad support. Is he not a \nnominee we could confirm in a matter of moments here? We could at least \ntake care of that vacancy.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do not believe he is on the Executive \nCalendar. To the best of my knowledge--at least he is not on the \nExecutive Calendar as printed today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot, but I would also remind everybody that the distinguished \nDemocratic leader has said he had no objection to going to--this is a \ncourt of appeals judge--Thomas Griffith, of Utah, to be U.S. circuit \njudge for the District of Columbia circuit. While Mr. Griffith is one I \nwould vote against, for reasons I have already stated, from the nose \ncount I have, he would easily be confirmed.\n\n  I would also note that I have total agreement with the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Nevada, who said he would be willing to do this in \na relatively short time. I just mention that because I would not want \nanybody to think this is a person being held up, even though some of us \nobject to him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would also like to make a suggestion. The \nidea is not original with me. I wish it were. But we had a meeting last \nnight. The distinguished majority leader was present at that meeting. \nMy friend, the junior Senator from Utah, suggested that what might be \ngood for this body is the same thing that happened when we had the \ndifficult issue here 6\\1/2\\ years ago dealing with the impeachment of a \nPresident of the United States. At that time, we retired to the Old \nSenate Chambers. No staff was there, just 100 Senators. We worked \nthrough some very difficult problems, and it surprised everyone.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and now retired Senator \nPhil Gramm were the people who saved the day--two people who battled \nideologically for a combined total of 40 or 50 years. Basically, \nbecause of them, we resolved an extremely difficult issue as to how the \nimpeachment would be handled.\n  So I would ask my distinguished friend, the Republican leader, to \nconsider joining with me and having, in the next day or so--hopefully \ntoday--have all of us retire to the Chamber and sit down and talk \nthrough this issue and see if there is a way we can resolve this short \nof this so-called nuclear option. I think it would be good for the \nbody. I think it would be good for the American public to see we are \nable to sit down in the same room and work things out. I am not sure \nthat we could, but I think it would be worthy of our efforts. Nothing \nventured, nothing gained. I would ask my friend if he would consider \nfollowing the suggestion of Senator Bennett of Utah.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as always, we will take into consideration \nall suggestions and be happy to talk to the leadership on both sides of \nthe aisle as to whether that suggestion is the most appropriate way. We \nhave engaged in negotiations and attempts to satisfy both sides over \nthe last 4 months, 5 months, since these unprecedented filibusters came \nbefore this body. After 214 years of a threshold of 50 votes, all of a \nsudden, in the last Congress, it was radically changed by the other \nside to become 60 votes, denying the sort of people--a little bit akin \nto what we just heard over the last few minutes, where I am trying to \nmove to a qualified nominee, Priscilla Owen, and we hear these attempts \nto delay, even right now, and to sidetrack and consider somebody else. \nThat is the challenge.\n  That is why we are on the floor of the Senate, with the light of day, \nwith the American people watching at this point, to take it to the body \nof the Senate and ask that fundamental question: Is Priscilla Owen out \nof the mainstream? Eighty-four percent of Texans think she is in the \nmainstream. Are 84 percent of Texans out of the mainstream? If the \nanswer to that question is, no, they are not out of the mainstream, \nthen all we want is a vote, an up-or-down vote--accept, reject; \nconfirm, yes, no. That is all we are asking for.\n  We do not want the constitutional option. We did not ask for the \nconstitutional option. What has happened is because of the other side \nof the aisle, in shattering the Senate tradition for 214 years, where \nthe filibuster was never even contemplated, now it is being used on a \nroutine basis. One out of every four of the President's nominees who \nhave come over for the circuit\n\n[[Page S5375]]\n\ncourts are filibustered, blocked, not given that courtesy of a vote, \nwhen that is our responsibility, to give advice and consent.\n  So in response to my good friend, the Democratic leader, yes, as \nproposals come forward, we will consider all. Both leaders spent 50 \nminutes or so, as the papers reported, today talking with people who \nare trying to come to some reasonable conclusion. We will continue to \ndo that. So I would be happy to consider another idea.\n  I think what is important now, though, is to come to the floor of the \nSenate. Let's shed light on this. Let's do take this. Yes, it is an \ninside-the-Senate decision, and we make our own traditions and rules, \nbut it is important for the American people to see is Priscilla Owen, \nis Janice Rogers Brown deserving of a vote, yes or no, on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  So I would recommend we continue discussions and let's proceed with \nthis nominee, continue the debate over the course of the day, or it may \nbe 2 days, and answer this question: Is she qualified? Does she deserve \nan up-or-down vote?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know we need to move on. I want to briefly \nsay we are following the rules. We believe in following the rules, not \nbreaking the rules. And while it is good to talk about this up-or-down \nvote, the fact is if we move forward as contemplated by the majority, \nit is moving toward breaking the rules to change the rules. That is \nimproper. It will change the Senate forever and that is not good.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, I \nwant to support our Democratic leader. I believe the record now is we \nhave approved 96 percent of the judicial nominees of this \nadministration. And as we know in terms of reading the Constitutional \nConvention our Founding Fathers expected this was going to be, we were \ngoing to exercise our own independent best judgment on nominees. And if \nI could ask the majority leader, is this the same Priscilla Owen which \nour current Attorney General suggested ``unconscionable acts of \njudicial activism?'' That is, our current Attorney General has accused \nthis nominee of that kind of activity. Is this the same Priscilla Owen \nwho is now being recommended, about which our current Attorney General \nmade that comment not once, not twice, not three times, but 11 times?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Regular order has been called for. \nThe Senator must either object or permit the request to move forward.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I would not object----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator cannot reserve the \nright to object. He must object or grant the request.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the nominee.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Priscilla Richman Owen, \nof Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The first hour of debate is now \nunder the control of the majority leader or his designee.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today as the leader of majority \nparty of the Senate, but I do not rise for party. I rise for principle. \nI rise for the principle that judicial nominees with the support of the \nmajority of Senators deserve up-or-down votes on this floor. Debate the \nnominee for 5 hours, debate the nominee for 50 hours, vote for the \nnominee, vote against the nominee, confirm the nominee, reject the \nnominee, but in the end vote.\n  Senators, colleagues, let's do our duty and vote. Judicial nominees \ndeserve an up-or-down vote.\n  In this debate we will discuss two of the President's judicial \nnominees. These outstanding nominees, Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers \nBrown, had the support of a majority of Senators in the last Congress, \nbut they were denied, they were denied up or down votes. I expect we \nwill also discuss such consequential topics as the meaning of the \nConstitution and Senate rules and procedures. No doubt this will be a \nspirited debate, as it should be. And I also hope it will be a decisive \ndebate. So let us begin.\n  In the last Congress, for the first time in history a minority of \nSenators obstructed the principle of a fair up-or-down vote on judicial \nnominees. That was unprecedented. Never in 214 years of Senate history \nhad a judicial nominee with majority support been denied an up-or-down \nvote. Yet it happened--again, and again, and again, and again, and \nagain, and again. A minority of Senators denied an up-or-down vote not \njust once to one nominee but 18 times on 10 individual nominees. These \nmen and women, these nominees are among the best legal minds in America \nand they all would be serving on the Federal bench today. All they \nneeded was a vote. But they were not given the courtesy of an up-or-\ndown vote on the floor of the Senate. The minority denied them a vote \nand set a new precedent. The minority in the last Congress rewrote the \nrules of advice and consent. They unilaterally increased the threshold \nfor confirmation from 50 votes, where it had been throughout history, \nto 60 votes.\n  Now some in the minority say they will harden the precedent and \nobstruct judicial nominees in this Congress. And if they are not \nallowed to do so, if the Senate returns to the way it worked for 214 \nyears, they will retaliate. They will obstruct the Senate's other \nbusiness. They will obstruct the people's business. They will hold back \nour agenda to move America forward. An energy strategy to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, held back; an end to the medical lawsuit \nabuse to reduce the cost of health care, held back; a simpler, fairer \nTax Code to create jobs and to encourage economic growth, held back. A \nminority of Senators will hold America back just because a majority of \nSenators, a majority of people in this body want to do what most \nAmericans of all things expect us to do, and that is to vote.\n\n  The minority should allow Senators to fulfill our constitutional \nresponsibility of giving advice and consent and vote. And they should \nallow America to move forward.\n  The principles that endured for 214 years do not endure because they \nappeal to one party or the other. They endure because they serve a \nvital purpose. In this case, the principle of an up-or-down vote \nensures the President can fulfill his constitutional duty to appoint \njudges.\n  Let me read a passage in the Constitution.\n\n       The President shall have power, by and with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds \n     of the Senate present concur, and he shall nominate, and by \n     and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint \n     Ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of \n     the Supreme court, and all other officers of the United \n     States.\n\n  The Framers wrote in the Constitution that two-thirds of Senators \nmust approve treaties, but they specifically did not require the same \nnumber of votes to confirm judicial nominees.\n  After much debate and compromise, the Framers concluded that the \nPresident should have power to appoint and the Senate should confirm or \nreject nominees by a simple majority vote. For 214 years Republican and \nDemocratic minorities alike restrained themselves, they used restraint, \nthey abided by the Framers' design and Senate tradition and gave \nnominees brought to this floor simple majority up-or-down votes. This \nwas the practice.\n  Then came the last Congress. With its obstruction the minority set a \nnew precedent--60 votes before the Senate could proceed to an up-or-\ndown vote on a judicial nominee. For 214 years the threshold for advice \nand consent in the Senate was 50 votes, a majority. In the last \nCongress----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague yield for a question.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to proceed with my statement \nand would be happy to yield for a comment.\n  For 214 years the threshold for advice and consent in the Senate was \n50 votes. In the last Congress the minority party radically increased \nthat threshold to 60, and that is wrong, and we will restore the \ntradition.\n  This unprecedented threshold gave the minority a virtual veto, in \neffect control, over the judicial appointments of the President. The \nminority destroyed 214 years of Senate tradition,\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\ndefied the clear intent of the Constitution, and undermined the \nDemocratic will of the American people. You can't get much more radical \nthan that.\n  This new precedent cannot be allowed to stand in this Congress. We \nmust restore the 214-year-old principle that every judicial nominee \nwith majority support deserves an up-or-down vote.\n  Why? First, the American people elect their Senators for a reason. It \nis to represent them. And they expect us to do our job. The Senate is a \ndeliberative body. We are a proudly deliberative body. But we also have \ncertain responsibilities which include giving advice and consent on the \nPresident's judicial nominations. When a judicial nominee comes to this \nfloor and has majority support but is denied a simple up-or-down vote, \nSenators are simply not doing their job. And the sad fact is we did not \ndo our job in the last Congress. The minority's judicial obstruction \nhas saddled President Bush with the lowest confirmation rate for \nappeals court nominees of any modern President. This is disgraceful. We \nowe it to the people we serve and to the Senate as an institution to do \nour job. We should vote up or down on judicial nominees.\n  Second, the judicial branch also has a job to do and it needs judges \nto do it. Right now there are 46 vacancies on the Federal bench. That \nincludes 17 vacancies on appeals courts. But it is not just the \nvacancies. Qualified nominees who can fill those seats can't get up-or-\ndown votes to be confirmed in the Senate.\n  Let me give you an example. Four of the 17 vacancies on Federal \nappeals courts are in the region that serves my home State of \nTennessee--4 of the 17 vacancies. Those nominees have been waiting a \ncombined 13 years for a simple up-or-down vote on this floor--13 years \nthey have been waiting. Either confirm these nominees or reject the \nnominees but don't leave them hanging. Don't leave our courts hanging. \nDon't leave the country hanging. If nominees are rejected, fine, that \nis fair. At least rejection represents a vote. But give nominees the \ncourtesy, the courtesy of a vote.\n  Third, judicial nominees deserve up-or-down votes because they \ndeserve to be treated fairly. Let me tell you about the nominees we are \nabout to consider, Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown. Priscilla \nOwen has been a Texas Supreme Court Justice for the last 10 years. She \nwas reelected with 84 percent of the vote in 2000. Her service won \npraise from Members of both parties. Former Justice Raul Gonzalez, a \nDemocrat, said:\n\n       I found her to be apolitical, extremely bright, diligent in \n     her work and of the highest integrity. I recommend her for \n     confirmation without reservation.\n\n  Justice Owen has also been a leader for providing free legal service \nfor the poor and she has worked to soften the impact of legal \nproceedings on children of divorcing parents.\n  On May 9, 2001, President Bush nominated Priscilla Owen to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. To this day, more than 4 years later, even \nthough a majority of Senators in this body support her, she has been \ndenied an up-or-down vote. That is just plain wrong, and it is unfair. \nPriscilla Owen deserves a vote.\n  Now let me tell you about Janice Rogers Brown. She is the daughter of \nan Alabama sharecropper. She was educated in segregated schools and \nworked her way through college and law school. She went on to serve in \nprominent positions in California State government. Today Janice Rogers \nBrown is a justice on the California Supreme Court and she was retained \nas a justice by the people of California with 76 percent of the vote.\n  On July 25, 2003, President Bush nominated Justice Brown for the U.S. \nCourt of appeals. To this day, nearly 2 years later, even though a \nmajority of Senators support her, she has been denied an up-or-down \nvote on the floor of the Senate.\n  That is wrong. That is unfair. Janice Rogers Brown deserves a vote.\n  Janice Rogers Brown can get 76 percent of the vote in California, \nPriscilla Owen can get 84 percent of the vote in Texas, but neither can \nget a vote here on the floor of the Senate. Why? The minority says they \nare out of the mainstream. Are 76 percent of Californians and 84 \npercent of Texans out of the mainstream? Denying Janice Rogers Brown \nand Priscilla Owen a vote is what is out of the mainstream. Justice \nBrown and Justice Owen deserve better. They deserve to be treated \nfairly. They deserve the courtesy of a vote.\n  The consequences of this debate are not lost on any Member of this \nbody. Soon we, 100 Senators, will decide the question at hand: Should \nwe allow a minority of Senators to deny votes on judicial nominees who \nhave the support of a majority of this body or should we restore the \n214-year practice of voting up or down on all judicial nominees who \ncome to this floor?\n  I have to believe the Senate will make the right choice. We will \nchoose the Constitution over obstruction. We will choose principle over \npolitics. We will choose votes over vacillation. And when we do, the \nSenate will be the better for it. The Senate will be, as Daniel Webster \nonce described it:\n\n     . . . a body to which the country looks, with confidence, for \n     wise, moderate, patriotic, and healing counsels.\n\n  To realize this vision, we don't need to look as far back as the age \nof Webster or Clay or Calhoun. All we must do is look at the recent \npast and take inspiration from the era of Baker, Byrd, and Dole. For 70 \npercent of the 20th century, the same party controlled the White House \nand the Senate. Yet during that period, no minority ever denied a \njudicial nominee with majority support an up-or-down vote on this \nfloor. Howard Baker's Republican minority didn't deny Democrat Jimmy \nCarter's nominees. Robert Byrd's Democratic minority did not deny \nRepublican Ronald Reagan's nominees. Bob Dole's Republican minority did \nnot deny Democrat Bill Clinton's nominees. These minorities showed \nrestraint. They respected the appointments process. They practiced the \nfine but fragile art of political civility. Sure they disagreed with \nthe majority at times, but they nonetheless allowed up-or-down votes to \noccur.\n  The Senate must do what is right. We must do what is fair. We must do \nthe job we were elected to do and took an oath to do. We must give \njudicial nominees the up-or-down votes they deserve. Let us debate, and \nlet Senators be heard. Let the Senate decide, and let this body rise on \nprinciple and do its duty and vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague from Tennessee yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would be happy to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, when I came on the floor, my colleague \nwas talking about the 214 years of tradition of no filibusters. Isn't \nit correct that on March 8 of 2000, my friend from Tennessee voted to \nuphold the filibuster of Richard Paez?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, the Paez nomination--we will \ncome back and discuss it further. Actually, I would like to come back \nto the floor and discuss it. It really brings to, I believe, a point \nwhat is the issue. The issue is that we have leadership-led partisan \nfilibusters that have obstructed not 1 nominee but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \n9, 10 in a routine way. The issue is not cloture votes per se; it is \nthe partisan leadership-led use of the cloture vote to kill, to defeat, \nto assassinate these nominees. That is the difference.\n  Cloture has been used in the past on this floor to postpone, to get \nmore information, to ask further questions. But each and every time, \nthe nominee, including Paez, got an up-or-down vote on the floor of the \nSenate where all 100 Senators could vote yes or no, confirm or reject.\n  Paez got an up-or-down vote. That is all that we ask on the floor, \nthat Priscilla Owen, that Justice Brown get a simple vote, approved, \ndisapproved, confirmed, rejected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader said that during the \nDole years, Clinton nominees were treated fairly. Sixty-nine Clinton \nnominees were not even given the decency of a hearing. They never saw \nthe light of day. We have participated in hearings. The matters have \ncome to the floor. For my friend to say that Clinton was treated fairly \nunder the Dole years is simply untrue.\n  Everyone should know that Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown have \nhad votes right here on the Senate\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\nfloor in compliance with the rules of the Senate. They have had votes. \nIt is as if we are retreating 50, 60 years. When you keep telling these \nfalsehoods enough, people start believing them. The American people are \nnot believing this. These two women about whom my friend speaks have \nhad votes.\n  My friend from Massachusetts asked a question. The President's \nlawyer, Alberto Gonzales, and now the Attorney General of the United \nStates and previously a member of the Texas Supreme Court, said on \nmultiple occasions that Priscilla Owen's activism was unconscionable. \nAlberto Gonzales is a smart man. He knows what the word means, but in \ncase someone doesn't, let me read what it does mean. Unconscionable: \nShockingly unjust and unscrupulous. That is what the Attorney General \nof the United States of America says about Priscilla Owen. Mainstream? \nI think not. Shockingly unjust or unscrupulous--that is what Priscilla \nOwen is in the mind of the Attorney General of the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my time be charged against the \nDemocrats' time when we take that, approximately an hour from now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. There will be a lot more said about Priscilla Owen, but I \nthink a fairly good indication of the kind of judge she is should come \nfrom the Attorney General of the United States who says that her \nunconscionable activism is replete through her opinions. I assume he \nknows what it means. I am confident he does. He is a brilliant man. \n``Shockingly unjust, unscrupulous''--those are not the words of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, not some special interest group; those are \nthe words of the Attorney General of the United States about Priscilla \nOwen. And she has had a vote here on the Senate floor.\n  Janice Rogers Brown, I am sure she has come from nothing to \nsomething. I think that is good. That is the way America should be. But \nbefore anyone starts crowing about the vote in California, she didn't \nhave an opponent. It is a Missouri system. She had no opponent.\n  Her opinions, if they weren't on such serious matters, would be \nlaughable--seriously, laughable. The California Supreme Court is made \nup of seven justices; six of them are Republicans. She has dissented, \nin the last 6 years alone, 31 different times.\n  Among other things, she has said: Supreme Court decisions upholding \nNew Deal protections, like the minimum wage and the 40-hour workweek, \nare, in her words, ``the triumph of our own socialist revolution.'' \nTell someone working at General Motors, tell someone working at \nTitanium Metals in Henderson, NV, that the 40-hour workweek is part of \nthe socialist revolution. Tell somebody working on nights and weekends \nand holidays that they can't get time and a half, or tell somebody \nworking at McDonald's or in a plastics factory in Fallon, NV, that they \nare not entitled to the minimum wage. That is Janice Rogers Brown, who \nhas had a vote on the Senate floor.\n  Yesterday, I spoke about a statement the majority leader made calling \nthe filibuster a procedural gimmick. Again, going to the dictionary, it \ndefines gimmick as ``an ingenious new scheme or angle.'' The filibuster \nis not a scheme, and it certainly is not new. The filibuster is far \nfrom a procedural gimmick. It is part of the fabric of this institution \nwe call the Senate. It was well known in colonial legislatures, before \nwe became a country, and it is an integral part of our country's 214-\nyear history.\n  The first filibuster in the Congress happened in 1790. It was used by \nlawmakers from Virginia and South Carolina who were trying to prevent \nPhiladelphia from hosting the first Congress. Since then, the \nfilibuster has been employed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of \ntimes. It has been employed on legislative matters. It has been \nemployed on procedural matters relating to the President's nominations \nfor Cabinet and sub-Cabinet posts. And it has been used on judges for \nall those years. One scholar estimates that 20 percent of the judges \nnominated by Presidents have fallen by the wayside, most of them as a \nresult of filibusters.\n  Senators have used the filibuster to stand up to popular Presidents, \nto block legislation and, yes, even, as I have stated, to stall \nexecutive nominees. The roots of the filibuster are found in the \nConstitution and in our own rules.\n  In establishing each House of Congress, Article I, section 5 of the \nConstitution states that:\n\n       Each House may determine the rules.\n\n  In crafting the rules of the Senate, Senators established the right \nto extended debate. And they formalized it with rule XXII almost 100 \nyears ago. This rule codified the practice that Senators could debate \nextensively.\n  Under rule XXII, debate may be cut off under limited circumstances: \n67 votes to end a filibuster of a motion to amend a Senate rule. That \nis what is being attempted here. But, no, we are not going to follow \nthe Senate rules. No, because of the arrogance of power of this \nRepublican administration, which controls the Supreme Court, the House, \nand the Senate. It is not enough that they come to the people's body \nand say: Let's take our chances by a fair ball game. They are going to \nchange the rules in the middle of the ball game. Talk about people \nhaving votes--these nominees, all 10 of them, have had votes. It is \nunfair for the majority to continually say it is 10. Three of them \neither retired or withdrew. We have agreed for votes on two others. It \nis five people who are not in the mainstream. Janice Rogers Brown \naccuses senior citizens of blithely cannibalizing their grandchildren. \nThat is in the mainstream? Priscilla Owen in the mainstream?\n\n  This administration is unwilling to play by the rules. It takes 67 \nvotes to change a Senate rule when there is a filibuster in progress. \nBut we are going to have Cheney, the Vice President, come sit where the \nPresiding Officer is sitting now and say that it only takes 51. This \ngreat paragon of virtue is going to say it only takes a simple \nmajority. We need 60 votes to end a filibuster against legislative \nbusiness.\n  It doesn't take a legal scholar to know this. We have all read in the \nnewspapers that this is a slippery slope. Once you have a rule \nchanged--illegally--then you can do it again. There is precedent on the \nbooks. In the future, it will be changed. If we decide we don't like \nBolton--the man who was chasing people down the hall throwing papers at \nthem--to be a representative of the U.N., if we decide we want to \nfilibuster him, we can change the rules to say he is the President's \nman and is entitled to a simple majority vote. You cannot do that. It \nmay be an issue of importance to the President or the majority leader \non a legislative matter, so just change the rule. The precedent will \nhave been set. A simple majority is all that is necessary.\n  A conversation between Thomas Jefferson and George Washington I \nbelieve describes the Senate and our Founding Fathers' vision of this \nbody in which we are so fortunate to serve. Jefferson asked Washington:\n\n       What is the purpose of the Senate? Washington responded \n     with a question of his own:\n       Why did you pour that coffee into your saucer?\n\n  Jefferson replied:\n\n       To cool it.\n\n  To which Washington said:\n\n       Even so, we pour legislation into the senatorial saucer to \n     cool it.\n\n  That is exactly what the filibuster does. It encourages moderation \nand consensus, gives voice to the minority so cooler heads may prevail. \nIt also separates us from the House of Representatives, where the \nmajority rules through the Speaker appointing the Rules Committee. It \nis very much in keeping with the spirit of the Government established \nby the Framers of our Constitution, limited government, separation of \npowers, and checks and balances. The filibuster is a critical tool in \nkeeping the majority in check. The Presiding Officer, who is a new \nMember of the Senate, someday will be in the minority. That is the way \nit works.\n  This central fact has been acknowledged and even praised by Senators \nfrom both parties: The filibuster is a critical tool to keep the \nmajority in check. In fact, another freshman Senator, my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Isakson, recently shared a conversation he had with an \nIraqi Government official. Senator Isakson asked this official if he \nwas worried about the majority in Iraq overrunning the minority. The \nofficial replied:\n\n       No . . . we have the secret weapon called the \n     ``filibuster.''\n\n\n[[Page S5378]]\n\n\n  In recalling the conversation, Senator Isakson remarked:\n\n       If there ever were a reason for optimism . . . it is one of \n     [the Iraq] minority leaders proudly stating one of the \n     pillars and principles of our Government as the way they \n     would ensure that the majority never overran the minority.\n\n  They were comparing what they were going to experience in Iraq to \nwhat we now have--the filibuster. Of course, he was right.\n  I spoke yesterday about Senator Holt and his 1939 filibuster to \nprotect workers' wages and hours. There are also recent examples of the \nfilibuster achieving good.\n  In 1985, Senators from rural States--even though there were few of \nthem--used the filibuster to force Congress to address a major crisis \nin which thousands of farmers were on the brink of bankruptcy.\n  In 1995, 10 years later, the filibuster was used by Senators to \nprotect the rights of workers to a fair wage and a safe workplace.\n  I cannot stand here and say the filibuster has always been used for \npositive purposes. It has not. Just as it has been used to bring about \nsocial change, it was also used to stall progress that this country \nneeded to make. It is often shown that the filibuster was used against \ncivil rights legislation. But civil rights legislation passed. Civil \nrights advocates met the burden. It is noteworthy that today, as I \nspeak, the Congressional Black Caucus is opposed to the nuclear \noption--unanimously opposed to it.\n  For further analysis, let's look at Robert Caro. He is a noted \nhistorian and Pulitzer Prize winner, and he said this at a meeting I \nattended. He spoke about the history of the filibuster. He made a point \nabout its legacy that was important. He noted that when legislation is \nsupported by the majority of Americans, it eventually overcomes a \nfilibuster's delay, as a public protest far outweighs any Senator's \nappetite to filibuster.\n\n  But when legislation only has the support of the minority, the \nfilibuster slows the legislation--prevents a Senator from ramming it \nthrough, and gives the American people enough time to join the \nopposition.\n  Mr. President, the right to extended debate is never more important \nthan when one party controls Congress and the White House. In these \ncases, the filibuster serves as a check on power and preserves our \nlimited government.\n  Right now, the only check on President Bush is the Democrats' ability \nto voice their concern in this body, the Senate. If Republicans roll \nback our rights in this Chamber, there will be no check on their power. \nThe radical rightwing will be free to pursue any agenda they want, and \nnot just in judges. Their power will be unchecked on Supreme Court \nnominees, the President's nominees in general, and legislation such as \nSocial Security privatization.\n  Of course, the President would like the power to name anybody he \nwants to lifetime seats on the Supreme Court and other Federal courts. \nIt is interesting to note that the statistics used by the majority \nleader do not take into consideration the nominees who we have been \nwilling to clear. Sure, you get statistics like that when they will not \nbring them forward.\n  Basically, that is why the White House has been aggressively lobbying \nSenate Republicans to change Senate rules in a way that would hand \ndangerous new powers over to the President over two separate branches--\nthe Congress and the judiciary--and he and his people are lobbying the \nSenate to break the rules to change the rules. I am sorry to say this \nis part of a disturbing pattern of behavior by this White House and the \nRepublicans in Washington, especially the leadership.\n  From Dick Cheney's fight to slam the doors of the White House so the \nAmerican people are kept in the dark about energy policy while the \nWhite House has the lights turned on--between the public interests or \nthe corporate interests, it is always the corporate interests--to the \nPresident's refusal to cooperate with the 9/11 Commission, to Senate \nRepublicans' attempt to destroy the last check in Washington on \nRepublican power, to the House majority's quest to silence the minority \nin the House, Republicans have sought to destroy the balance of power \nin our Government by grabbing power for the Presidency, silencing the \nminority, and weakening our democracy.\n  America does not work that way. The radical rightwing should not be \nallowed to dictate to the President and to the Republican Senate \nleaders, as they are trying to do.\n  For 200 years, we have had the right to extended debate. It is not \nsome ``procedural gimmick.'' It is within the vision of the Founding \nFathers of this country. They did it; we didn't do it. They established \na government so that no one person and no single party could have total \ncontrol.\n  Some in this Chamber want to throw out 214 years of Senate history in \nthe quest for absolute power. They want to do away with Mr. Smith, as \ndepicted in that great movie, being able to come to Washington. They \nwant to do away with the filibuster. They think they are wiser than our \nFounding Fathers. I doubt that is true.\n  Mr. President, will the Senator notify us as to how much time the \nRepublicans have in the first wave of statements and how much time the \nDemocrats have when they are allowed to make statements?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Republicans have 42 minutes \nand the Democrats have 41 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: It was my understanding that I \nwas to have 1 hour because a good bit of time has been consumed by \ndialog and questions earlier today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will respond, if I could. As indicated, \nthat is why I asked the question. You have 42 minutes and we have 41. \nWe need to stick to that. I would have no objection to your using the \nfull time and deducting 15 minutes, or whatever it is, from the next \nhour that you have. That would be appropriate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that would be acceptable to me. I am the \nmanager, in my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on \nPriscilla Owen. We would accommodate to have an equal amount of time \nallotted to the Democrats. It may be, Mr. President, that I will not \nuse the full hour.\n  Mr. REID. I simply say, if the Senator needs the full hour, I ask \nthat it be deducted so we can kind of keep on track here. We will use \n42 minutes our first go-around. We ask that you deduct whatever time \nyou use off of the second time that you are to be recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman this. We \nhave 41 minutes on our side and 42 on the other side. If you don't \ncomplete your remarks in 41 minutes, then we will agree to yield an \nequivalent amount of time in the next hour, to deduct that equal amount \nof time in the next hour from both sides.\n  Mr. REID. We don't need the time on our side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the suggestion the Senator from \nPennsylvania made was a good one. Whatever time he uses beyond the 40 \nminutes, we get an equal amount of time here. That way we would also \nknow where we stand. The distinguished Senator from Nevada--\n  Mr. REID. Then following the two managers making their statements, \nthereafter, we go to an hourly timeframe and we have to, I think--it \nwould be good for the managers not to be extending the time because it \nmakes it impossible when you have people scheduled to come over here. I \nagree to this under the extraordinary circumstances also of the two \nmanagers of this nomination--that they be given a full hour. Following \nthat, the Republicans would be recognized for an hour, and the \nDemocrats for an hour, and we go on that basis.\n  Mr. President, I have somebody here complaining that we have already \nset the schedule. We are entitled to the time by the rules.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask if the chairman would try to keep his \nremarks within the time limit agreed to, about 42 minutes, and we can \nstay on schedule. I ask the Democratic leader, would that be \nacceptable? I ask unanimous consent that we, as agreed earlier, have 42 \nminutes on our side and 41 minutes on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n[[Page S5379]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as we begin consideration of the \nnomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen for the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the Senate Chamber is filled \nwith anticipation that we may be embarking on a historic debate which \ncould redefine minority rights in the Senate and impact our fundamental \nconstitutional doctrine of separation of powers.\n  As we all know, if 60 votes are not obtained to invoke cloture to cut \noff debate on this nominee and three others to be called up \nsequentially for confirmation votes, a ruling is likely to be sought to \nchange the required vote from 60 to 51, unless a compromise can first \nbe reached.\n  This controversy did not arise, in my judgment, because Democrats \nconcluded that Miguel Estrada and nine other President Bush circuit \ncourt nominees were unqualified, so they should be filibustered, but \nrather because it was payback time for Republican treatment of \nPresident Clinton's nominees.\n  While there have been a few scattered cloture votes in the history of \nthe Senate, it is totally unprecedented for a party to engage in such a \nsystematic pattern of filibusters. In almost 25 years on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have seen circuit court nominees confirmed routinely where \ntheir qualifications were no better than those under fire today. These \nfilibusters are the combination of a power struggle between Republicans \nand Democrats as to which party can control the judicial selection \nprocess through partisan maneuvering.\n  As a starting point, it is important to acknowledge that both sides--\nDemocrats and Republicans--have been at fault. Both claim they are the \nvictims and that their party's nominees have been treated worse than \nthe other's. Both sides cite endless statistics. I have heard so many \nnumbers spun so many different ways that my head is spinning. I think \neven Benjamin Disraeli, the man who coined the phrase, there are \n``lies, damn lies, and statistics,'' would be amazed at the creativity \nemployed by both sides in contriving numbers in this debate.\n  In 1987, upon gaining control of the Senate and the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Democrats denied hearings to seven of President Reagan's \ncircuit court nominees and denied floor votes for two additional \ncircuit court nominees. As a result, the confirmation for Reagan \ncircuit nominees fell from 89 percent prior to the Democratic takeover \nto 65 percent afterwards.\n  While the confirmation rate decreased, the length of time it took to \nconfirm judges increased. From the Carter administration through the \nfirst 6 years of the Reagan administration, the confirmation process \nfor both district and circuit court seats consistently hovered at \napproximately 50 days. For President Reagan's final Congress, however, \nthe number doubled to an average of 120 days for these nominees to be \nconfirmed. The pattern of delay and denial continued for 4 years of \nPresident George H.W. Bush's administration. President Bush's lower \ncourt nominees waited on average 100 days to be confirmed, which is \nabout twice as long as had historically been the case. The Democrats \nalso denied hearings for more nominees.\n  President Carter had 10 nominees who did not receive hearings. For \nPresident Reagan, the number was 30. In the Bush senior administration, \nthe number jumped to 58.\n  When we Republicans won the 1994 election and gained the Senate \nmajority, we exacerbated the pattern of delay and blocking of \nnominations. Over the course of President Clinton's Presidency, the \naverage number of days for the Senate to confirm judicial nominees \nincreased even further to 192 days for district court nominees and 262 \ndays for circuit court nominees. Through blue slips and holds, 70 of \nPresident Clinton's nominees were blocked.\n  During that time, I urged my Republican colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee to confirm well-qualified Democrats. For example, I broke \nrank with my colleagues on the Republican side to speak and vote in \nfavor of Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez.\n  After the 2002 elections, with control of the Senate returning to \nRepublicans, the Democrats resorted to the filibuster on 10 circuit \ncourt nominations, which was the most extensive use of that tactic, \nreally unprecedented, in the Nation's history.\n  The filibuster started with Miguel Estrada, one of the most competent \nand talented appellate lawyers in the country. The Democrats followed \nwith filibusters against nine other circuit court nominees. During the \n108th Congress, there were 20 cloture motions on 10 nominations, and \nall 20 failed.\n  To this unprecedented move, President Bush responded by making for \nthe first time in the Nation's history two recess appointments of \nnominees who had been successfully filibustered by the Democrats. That \nimpasse was broken when President Bush agreed to refrain from further \nrecess appointments.\n  Against this background of bitter and angry recriminations, with each \nparty serially trumpeting the other party to get even or really to \ndominate, the Senate now faces dual threats. One called the filibuster \nand the other the constitutional or nuclear option which rivals the \nU.S.-U.S.S.R. confrontation of mutual assured destruction. Both \nsituations are accurately described by the acronym, MAD.\n  We Republicans are threatening to employ the constitutional or \nnuclear option to require only a majority vote to end judicial \nfilibusters. The Democrats are threatening to retaliate by stopping the \nSenate agenda on all matters except national security and homeland \ndefense. Each ascribes to the other the responsibility for blowing up \nthe place.\n  This gridlock occurs at a time when we expect a U.S. Supreme Court \nvacancy within the next few months. If a filibuster would leave an \neight-person Court, we could expect many 4-to-4 votes since the Court \nnow decides cases with 5-to-4 votes. A Supreme Court tie vote would \nrender the Court dysfunctional leaving in effect the circuit court \ndecision with many splits among the circuits, so the rule of law would \nbe suspended on many major issues.\n  Regardless of which side wins the vote on the constitutional or \nnuclear option, there would be serious consequences. If the option \nsucceeds, first, the rights of the Senate's minority would be \nsignificantly diminished, and, second, reducing the cloture vote on \nnominees would inevitably and ultimately invite a similar attack on \ncloture on the legislative calendar which would change the nature of \nthe Senate tremendously.\n  On the other hand, if the option fails, there are undesirable \nconsequences. Then, any Senate minority party of 41 or more would be \nemboldened to institutionally and permanently revise the balance of \npower between the President's constitutional power of nominations and \nthe Senate's constitutional authority for confirmation.\n\n  Second, I think it would embolden the Democrats to use the filibuster \non other Presidential nominations, such as John Bolton whose nomination \nis pending before the Senate for ambassador to the U.N.\n  After a Democratic member of the Foreign Relations Committee put a \nhold on the Bolton nomination, the ranking member was quoted on a \nSunday talk show as saying:\n\n       It's too premature to talk about filibustering Mr. Bolton.\n\n  Therefore, it is obvious that a filibuster on Bolton is not ruled \nout.\n  A vote on the constitutional or nuclear option could affect an \nimminent nomination or nominations to the Supreme Court. If a vote on \nthe option failed, it would be a reaffirmation of the Democratic \nminority's power to filibuster any judicial nominee without necessarily \nshowing substantial cause or extraordinary circumstances. If the option \npassed, it could give the President greater leverage, reducing his \nconcern that his nomination could be thwarted.\n  Historically--and I believe this is of tremendous importance, Mr. \nPresident--historically, the constitutional separation of powers has \nworked best when there was a little play in the so-called joints. When \nboth sides are unsure of the outcome, the result is more likely to be \nin the middle rather than at either extreme.\n  On the current state of the record, in my opinion, the outcome of a \nprospective vote on the constitutional or nuclear option is uncertain. \nI have not rendered a decision because I believe I can be most helpful \non brokering a compromise by remaining silent. When neither side is \nconfident of success--\n\n[[Page S5380]]\n\nand I think that is the case today--the chances for compromise are far \ngreater.\n  As I see it, the national interest would be served by structuring a \ncompromise to return to the status quo before 1987. When Senator Harry \nReid, the Democratic leader, says his party would abandon the \nfilibuster unless there are ``extraordinary circumstances,'' that \nescape clause should be narrowly defined and codified in a Senate rule \ninstead of an agreement between the parties' leaders.\n  Even with a narrowly defined definition of what constitutes \nextraordinary circumstances, the final decision would necessarily \nreside with the individual Senators in the case of any perceived \nambiguity. If we Republicans then concluded that there was not a good-\nfaith exercise of extraordinary circumstances, we could regard the \nagreement as vitiated and feel free to resort to the constitutional or \nnuclear option.\n  To achieve a compromise, Senators must take the initiative without \nbeing unduly influenced by the far left or far right. It has not \nescaped attention that the so-called groups are using this controversy \nas major fundraising vehicles. I continue to be personally highly \noffended by the commercials, from Gregory Peck in 1987 to the ones \nbroadcast this weekend in Pennsylvania, seeking to influence my own \nvote. Believe me, they are counterproductive or ineffectual at best and \ncertainly insulting.\n  Senators, with our leaders, must take charge to craft a way out. The \nfact is, all or almost all of the Senators want to avoid the pending \ncrisis. I have had many conversations with my Democratic colleagues \nabout the filibuster of judicial nominees. Many of them have told me \nthey do not personally believe it is a good idea to filibuster \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees in such a pattern. They believe this \nunprecedented use of a filibuster does damage to this institution and \nto the prerogatives of the President. Yet despite their concerns, they \nhave given in to party loyalty and voted repeatedly to filibuster \nFederal judges in the last Congress.\n  Likewise, there are many Republicans in this body who question the \nwisdom of the constitutional or nuclear option. They recognize that \nsuch a step would be a serious blow to the rights of the minority that \nhave always distinguished this body from the House of Representatives. \nKnowing that the Senate is a body that depends upon collegiality and \ncompromise to pass even the smallest resolution, many of my Republican \ncolleagues worry that the rule change would impair the ability of the \ninstitution to function.\n  I have repeatedly heard colleagues on both sides of the aisle say it \nis a matter of saving face. But as yet, we have not found a formula to \ndo so. I suggest the way to work through the current impasse is to \nbring to the floor circuit court nominees one by one for up-or-down \nvotes with both leaders explicitly releasing their Members from party-\nline voting.\n  There are at least five, and perhaps as many as seven, pending \ncircuit court nominees who could be confirmed or at least voted up or \ndown. If the straitjacket of party loyalty were removed, even more \nmight be confirmed.\n  In moving in the Judiciary Committee to select nominees for floor \naction shortly after becoming chairman earlier this year, I first \nselected William Myers because two Democrats had voted to end debate in \nthe 108th Congress and one candidate for the Senate in 2004 since \nelected made a campaign statement that he would vote to end the Myers \nfilibuster and confirm him. Adding those 3 votes to 55 Republicans, we \nwere within striking distance to reach 60 or more.\n\n  I carefully examined Myers' record. Noting that he had opposition \nfrom some groups such as Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club, it \nwas my conclusion that nonetheless his environmental record was \nsatisfactory, or at least not a disqualifier, as detailed in my \nstatement at the Judiciary Committee executive session on March 17.\n  To be sure, critics could pick at his record, as they could at any \nSenator's record, but overall, in my judgment, Mr. Myers was worthy of \nconfirmation.\n  I then set out to solicit views on Myers, including the ranchers, \nloggers, miners, and farmers. In those quarters, I found significant \nenthusiasm for his confirmation. I then urged them to have their \nmembers contact Senators who might be swing votes. I then followed up \nwith personal talks to many of those Senators and found several \nprospects to vote for cloture.\n  Then the screws of party loyalty were applied and tightened, and the \nprospects for obtaining the additional votes to secure 60 for cloture--\nthe prospects vanished. I am confident that if the party pressure had \nnot been applied, the Myers filibuster would have ended, and he would \nhave been confirmed. That result could still be obtained if the \nstraitjacket of party loyalty were removed on the Myers nomination.\n  Informally, but authoritatively, I have been told that the Democrats \nwill not filibuster Thomas Griffith or Judge Terrence Boyle. Griffith \nis on the Senate calendar awaiting floor action and Boyle is on the \nagenda for Judiciary Committee action. Both could be confirmed this \nmonth.\n  There are no objections to three nominations from the State of \nMichigan for the Sixth Circuit, Richard Griffin, David McKeague and \nSusan Neilsen, but their confirmations are held up because of \nobjections to a fourth nominee. I urge my Democratic colleagues to \nconfirm these three uncontested Michigan Sixth Circuit nominees and \nfight out the fourth vacancy and the Michigan District Court vacancies \non another day. The Michigan Senators do make a valid point on the need \nfor consultation on the other Michigan vacancies, and I believe that \ncan be accommodated.\n  In the exchange of offers and counteroffers between Senator Frist and \nSenator Reid, Democrats have made an offer to avoid a vote--on the \nnuclear option--by confirming one or perhaps two of the four \nfilibustered judges: Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, William H. \nPryor, or William Myers, with the choice to be selected by Republicans. \nAn offer to confirm any one or two of four nominees is an explicit \nconcession that each is qualified for the court and that they are being \nheld hostage as pawns in a convoluted chess game which has spiraled out \nof control.\n  If the Democrats really believe each one is unqualified, a deal for \nconfirmation for any one of them is repugnant to the basic Democratic \nprinciple of individual fair and equitable treatment and violates \nSenators' oaths on the constitutional confirmation process. Such a deal \non confirmations would only confirm public cynicism about what goes on \nin Washington behind closed doors.\n  Instead, let the Senate consider each of the four without the \nconstraints of party-line voting. Let both leaders release their \ncaucuses from the straitjacket of party-line voting and even encourage \nMembers to vote their consciences on these issues of great national \nimportance. Let us revert to the tried-and-tested method of evaluating \neach nominee individually.\n  In a ``press availability'' on March 10, Senator Reid referred to the \nnuclear option and said:\n\n       If it does come to a vote I ask Senator Frist to allow his \n     Republican colleagues to follow their conscience. Senator \n     Specter recently said that Senators should not be bound by \n     Senate loyalty--they should be bound by Senate loyalty rather \n     than by party loyalty on a question of this magnitude. I \n     agree.\n\n  But Senator Reid did not make any reference to my urging him to have \nthe Democrats reject the party-line straitjacket on filibustering. If \nboth parties were to vote their consciences without regard to the party \nline, I believe that the filibusters would disappear in the context of \nthe current constitutional crisis and many, if not most, Republicans \nwho do not like the constitutional/nuclear option would abandon it.\n  The fact is that any harm to the Republic, at worst by confirming all \nof the pending circuit court nominees, is infinitesimal compared to the \nharm to the Senate whichever way the vote would turn out on the \nnuclear/constitutional option. None of these circuit judges could make \nnew law because all are bound and each agreed on the record to follow \nU.S. Supreme Court decisions. While it is frequently argued that \ncircuit court opinions are, in many cases, final because the Supreme \nCourt grants certiorari in so few cases, circuit courts sit in panels \nof three so that no one of these nominees could\n\n[[Page S5381]]\n\nunilaterally render an egregious decision, since at least one other \ncircuit judge on the panel must concur.\n  If a situation does arise where a panel of three circuit judges makes \nan egregious decision, it is subject to correction by the court en \nbanc, and then the case may always be reviewed by the Supreme Court if \nit is really egregious.\n  While it would be naive to deny that the quid pro quo or log rolling \nare not frequent congressional practices, these approaches are not the \nbest way to formulate public policy or make governmental decisions. The \nSenate has a roadmap to avoid the nuclear winter in a principled way. \nFive of the controversial judges can be brought up for up-or-down votes \non this state of the record, and the others are entitled to \nindividualized treatment on the filibuster issue. It may be that the \nopponents of one or more of these judges may persuade a majority of \nSenators, including some Republican Senators, that confirmation should \nbe rejected. A group of Republican moderates has, with some frequency, \njoined Democrats to defeat a party-line vote. The President has been \nexplicit in seeking only up-or-down votes as opposed to commitments on \nconfirmation.\n\n  The Senate has arrived at this confrontation by exacerbation, as each \nside ratcheted up the ante in delaying and denying confirmation to the \nother party's Presidential nominees. The policy of conciliation and \nconsultation could diffuse the situation. One good turn deserves \nanother. If one side realistically and sincerely takes the high ground, \nthere will be tremendous pressure on the other side to follow suit. So \nfar, offers by both sides have been public relations maneuvers to \nappear reasonable, to avoid blame and place it elsewhere.\n  Meanwhile, the far left and the far right are urging each side to the \nshun compromise. One side shouts ``pull the trigger.'' The other side \nretorts, ``filibuster forever.'' Their approach would lead to the \nextreme judges at each end of the political spectrum as control of the \nSenate inevitably shifts from one party to another.\n  Late yesterday afternoon, a group of so-called moderate Senators met \nwith the leaders, and one idea which came from one of the Democratic \nSenators was to consider the five nominees--Owen, Brown, Pryor, and \nMyers, along with Judge Saad of Michigan--and then to either have three \nconfirmed, two rejected; or two confirmed and three rejected.\n  The suggestion was then made that if all of the nominees could get a \nfloor vote, that there might be a whip check to determine whether two \nmight not pass on a rollcall vote, which is the way the Senate \nfunctions. That consideration I think is worth further exploration.\n  A well-known story is told about Benjamin Franklin. Upon exiting the \nConstitutional Convention in Philadelphia, he was approached by a group \nof citizens asking what sort of a government the constitutional \ndelegates had created. Franklin responded, ``A Republic, if you can \nkeep it.''\n  In this brief response, Franklin captured the essential fragility of \nour great democracy. Although enshrined in a written Constitution and \nhoused in granite buildings, our government is utterly dependent upon \nsomething far less permanent, the wisdom of its leaders. Our Founding \nFathers gave us a great treasure, but like any inheritance, we pass it \non to successive generations only if our generation does not squander \nit. If we seek to emulate the vision and restraint of Franklin and the \nFounding Fathers, we can hand down to our children and grandchildren \nthe Republic they deserve, but if we turn our backs on their example, \nwe will debase and cheapen what they have given us.\n  At this critical juncture in the history of the Senate, let us tread \ncarefully, choose wisely, and prove ourselves worthy of our great \ninheritance. Since the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist \nRepublics avoided a nuclear confrontation in the Cold War by \nconcessions and confidence-building measures, why should not Senators \ndo the same by crossing the aisle in the spirit of compromise?\n  Mr. President, I now turn to the specifics on the nomination of Texas \nSupreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen. She comes to the floor of the \nSenate for consideration with an outstanding academic record. She \nattended the University of Texas in 1972 and 1973. She graduated from \nBaylor University in 1975, cum laude, from the Baylor University School \nof Law in 1977, cum laude, evidencing an excellent academic record. She \nhas a fine professional record with a practice of Sheehy, Lovelace and \nMayfield, where she was a law clerk in 1976 and 1977, and then an \nassociate and partner at Andrews, Kurth, Campbell and Jones from 1978 \nto 1994. From 1995 to the present, she has been a justice on the \nSupreme Court of Texas.\n  She was at the top of her law school class; in 5 years, completed law \nschool and undergraduate, contrasted with the usual 7. She had the \nhighest score on the statewide bar exam and was reelected with 84 \npercent of the vote and endorsement of every major newspaper.\n  The American Bar Association has unanimously rated her well \nqualified.\n  In the course of her work on the Texas Supreme Court, she has handed \ndown many decisions which have demonstrated real analytical and real \nlegal scholarship. She has been criticized on some of the decisions \nwhich she has rendered on the so-called judicial bypass.\n  Under the a Texas law, constitutional under U.S. Supreme Court \nprecedent, a minor may have an abortion if there is notice to at least \none parent.\n  Justice Owen has been criticized, with a very broad brush, for being \nhostile to Roe v. Wade, which on the record is simply not true.\n  In the case of Jane Doe (I), in the year 2000, she voted with the \nmajority but filed a concurring opinion. The language she used was that \nthe legislature intended for the minors to learn about arguments \n``surrounding abortion'', and not ``against'' abortion. So, in handing \ndown this decision, she was not urging that minors making their \ndecision on obtaining an abortion hear the arguments against abortion, \nbut rather ``surrounding,'' which would obviously state both sides.\n  On cases where she has denied judicial bypass, they have been in the \ncontext of sound judicial principle, where she has refused to overturn \nthe findings of the lower court judge who had access to the witnesses \nand could see and hear exactly what was going on and had a much better \nbasis for fact-finding.\n  Illustrative of this position is the case captioned In re Doe (II), a \n2000 Supreme Court of Texas decision where the court reversed and \nordered a judicial bypass.\n  It is true Justice Owen was one of three justices who dissented, but \nshe did so because she concluded that the majority improperly reweighed \nthe evidence and usurped the rule of the trial judge. As a sound legal \nprinciple, the trial judge is entitled to deference on the findings of \nfact because the trial judge, rather than the appellate court, has \nheard the witnesses.\n  There are other notable cases where Justice Owen has handed down \nthoughtful, informed, scholarly opinions. They have not pleased \neveryone, but that is what judges do. One case is particularly worthy \nof note, a case captioned Operation Rescue National v. Planned \nParenthood of Houston and Southwest Texas. In this case, doctors and \nabortion clinics brought action for civil conspiracy, tortious \ninterference, and invasion of privacy and property rights against anti-\nabortion groups and protesters, seeking injunctive relief and damages. \nThe trial court entered a $1.2 million judgment on jury verdict and a \npermanent injunction creating buffer zones around certain clinics and \nhomes in which protesters could not protest.\n  The issue was whether the jury verdict was based on a proper jury \ncharge and whether the injunction infringed on the protesters' freedoms \nof expression. Justice Owen joined the 7 to 2 majority decision which \naffirmed the jury verdict was proper under Texas law.\n  The decision also upheld the injunction while modifying it in certain \nrespects. Under the majority's opinion, a limited number of peaceful \nprotesters could approach patients and act as sidewalk counselors who \nwould seek to discuss the issues surrounding abortions with patients, \nas long as such discussions were ceased upon request of the patient. \nThe majority concluded this type of protesting would not endanger \npatients' health and safety.\n\n[[Page S5382]]\n\n  Following Justice Owen's nomination to the Fifth Circuit, pro-choice \ngroups criticized the ruling as hostile to abortion rights. But at the \ntime the ruling was handed down, Planned Parenthood of Houston and \nSouthwest Texas hailed it as ``a complete and total victory.''\n  This case is illustrative of some of the difficult issues involved in \nthat kind of a factual situation. In enjoining this kind of harassing \npractice, subject to certain limitations, and upholding a verdict in \nexcess of $1 million, Justice Owen exercised judicial discretion and \nsensibility in arriving at the decision.\n  In the case of Ft. Worth Osteopathic Hospital, Inc. v. Reese, Justice \nOwen handed down decisions demonstrating respect for Roe v. Wade under \na factual situation where plaintiffs brought wrongful death and \nsurvival action on behalf of a viable fetus who died in utero against \nthe treating physicians and the hospital and also brought medical \nnegligence claims in their individual capacities.\n  Justice Owen joined the Texas Supreme Court's 8-to-1 decision holding \nthat the Texas wrongful death and survival statutes do not violate the \nequal protection clause by prohibiting parents of a stillborn fetus \nfrom bringing those claims. Justice Owen, in joining in that decision, \nwas explicitly following the precedent of Roe v. Wade.\n  There is a series of cases which illustrates judicial temperament, \njudicial demeanor, a sound judicial philosophy, which I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record: First, Chilkewitz v. Hyson, 22 \nS.W.3d 825 (Tex. 1999); second, In Re D.A.S., 973 S.W.2d 296 (Tex. \n1998); third, Abrams v. Jones 35 S.W.3d 620 (Tex. 2000); fourth, Quick \nv. City of Austin, 7 S.W.3d 109 (Tex. 1999); fifth, Hernandez v. Tokai \nCorporation, 2 S.W.3d 251 (Tex. 1999); sixth, NME Hospitals v. Rennels, \n994 S.W.2d 142 (Tex. 1999); next, Kroger Company v. Keng, 23 S.W.3d 347 \n(Tex. 2000); and, Crown Life Insurance Company v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d \n378 (Tex. 2000), all of which show Justice Owen to be a very sound \njurist and worthy of confirmation to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Chilkewitz v. Hyson\n\n\n                       22 S.W.3d 825 (Tex. 1999)\n\n       Facts: Plaintiff brought suit against defendant doctor for \n     medical practice. After the statute of limitations ran, the \n     defendant moved for summary judgment on the basis that he was \n     a professional association and because the plaintiff had not \n     claimed the professional association as a defendant, the \n     statute of limitations barred suit against him.\n       Issue: Whether the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permitted \n     a suit against a party's assumed name, in this case the \n     doctor, if the plaintiff did not name the defendant's \n     association as a defendant in the suit.\n       Outcome: A unanimous Texas Supreme Court, in an opinion \n     written by Justice Owen, held that the rules of civil \n     procedure permitted suit against a party in its assumed name. \n     The court also held that there was evidence in this case that \n     the defendant's professional association conducted business \n     in the name of the individual doctor and the plaintiff's \n     naming of the defendant's assumed name in the complaint was \n     sufficient.\n       Note: Justice Owen stood up against formalism and allowed a \n     Plaintiff to bring suit for medical malpractice.\n\n                              In re D.A.S\n\n\n                       973 S.W.2d 296 (Tex. 1998)\n\n       Facts: The defendants, two juveniles, challenged a ruling \n     that held the Anders procedure, which requires defense \n     counsel, if they find a case to be wholly frivolous, to \n     request permission to withdraw and submit a briefing to the \n     court with anything in the record that might arguably support \n     the defendant's appeal, was inapplicable in juvenile cases. \n     The defendants requested mandamus relief.\n       Procedural History: The Court of Appeals rejected the \n     challenge and refused to allow the defense counsel to \n     withdraw.\n       Issue: Whether the Anders procedure applies to juvenile \n     cases.\n       Outcome: Justice Owen, writing for the 6-2 majority, held \n     that the Anders procedure applied to juvenile proceedings \n     because Anders protected the juveniles' statutory right to \n     counsel on appeal. Justice Owen found that extending Anders \n     to juvenile appeals properly balanced a juvenile's statutory \n     right to counsel against the appointed counsels' obligation \n     not to prosecute frivolous appeals. She also determined that \n     Anders provided the juveniles with more protection because \n     both the attorney and the court of appeals would have to \n     determine whether there were any arguable issues on appeal.\n       Dissent: The dissent argued that mandamus relief was \n     inappropriate. Judicial review through petition for review \n     from the court of appeals' final decision was an adequate \n     remedy for the juvenile defendants.\n\n                            Abrams v. Jones\n\n\n                       35 S.W.3d 620 (Tex. 2000)\n\n       Facts: In the midst of an acrimonious divorce, the \n     plaintiff father sued his daughter's psychologist for access \n     to his minor daughter's medical records.\n       Issue: Whether a parent has judicial recourse under Tex. \n     Health & Safety Code Ann. Sec.  611.0045(e) when a treating \n     psychologist refuses to allow another psychologist, selected \n     by the challenging parent, access to the minor-child's \n     medical records.\n       Outcome: Justice Owen, writing for the 7-2 majority, \n     reversed and denied access of the medical records to the \n     father. Justice Owen held that the Texas legislature imposed \n     some limits on the parent's right of access to confidential \n     mental health records. Justice Owen found that the \n     psychologist had presented sufficient evidence that the child \n     would be harmed if the records were released to the father.\n\n                        Quick v. City of Austin\n\n\n                        7 S.W.3d 109 (Tex. 1999)\n\n       Facts: Landowners challenged the City of Austin's Save Our \n     Springs Ordinance, a water pollution control measure enacted \n     in 1992. The landowners contested the ordinance because it \n     was arbitrary, unreasonable, and inefficient. They also \n     asserted that the Ordinance was void because it was enacted \n     without a public hearing, it impermissibly regulated the \n     number, use, and size of buildings in the City's \n     extraterritorial jurisdiction, and the Texas Natural Resource \n     Conservation Commission had not approved it.\n       Issue: Whether the City of Austin's ``Save Our Springs'' \n     Ordinance was a valid exercise of city authority.\n       Outcome: Justice Owen joined the 5-4 majority, which held \n     that the Ordinance was a valid legislative act that did not \n     need to be approved by the Texas Natural Resource \n     Conservation Commission to become effective and enforceable. \n     While the Ordinance clearly affected land use, its methods \n     were nationally recognized limitations and thus furthered the \n     stated goal of protecting and preserving a clean water \n     supply. The Court found that the Legislature did not limit \n     the city's authority to set the ordinance's effective date; \n     therefore, Austin was not required to obtain permission of \n     the Commission before enacting the ordinance.\n\n                        Hernandez v. Tokai Corp.\n\n\n                        2 S.W.3d 251 (Tex. 1999)\n\n       Facts: Minor child misused a butane lighter and was \n     injured. Suit brought against manufacturer and distributor of \n     the lighters. The trial court granted summary judgment for \n     the lighter manufacturer. On appeal, the 5th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals submitted a certified question as to whether the \n     action could proceed under Texas law.\n       Issue: Whether a defective-design products liability claim \n     against the product's manufacturer may proceed if the product \n     was intended to be used only by adults, if the risk that \n     children might misuse the product was obvious to the \n     product's manufacturer and to its intended users, and if a \n     safer alternative design was available.\n       Outcome: The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals submitted a \n     certified question as to whether the action could proceed \n     under Texas law. Justice Owen joined the unanimous opinion of \n     the court, holding that a defective-design claim may proceed \n     for an injury caused by a product that did not have a child-\n     resistant mechanism that would have prevented or \n     substantially reduced the risk of injury from a child's \n     foreseeable misuse if, with reference to the product's \n     intended users, the design defect made the product \n     unreasonably dangerous, a safer alternative design was \n     available, and the defect was the cause of the injury.\n       Note: Justice Owen held that a manufacturer of cigarette \n     lighters has a duty to make certain that its products are \n     child resistant--even though the lighters were only meant to \n     be used by adults.\n\n           NME Hospitals, Inc. v. Margaret A. Rennels, M.D.,\n\n\n                       994 S.W.2d 142 (Tex. 1999)\n\n       Facts: The plaintiff doctor sued NME Hospitals for unlawful \n     employment discrimination under the Act and conspiracy to \n     violate the Act. The defendant hospital filed for summary \n     judgment because it was not her direct employer under the \n     Texas statute.\n       Procedural History: The lower trial court granted summary \n     judgment for the hospital. The appeals court reversed.\n       Issue: Whether a plaintiff may sue someone other than her \n     own employer for an unlawful employment practice under Texas \n     Labor Code Sec. 21.055, the Texas Commission on Human Rights \n     Act\n       Outcome: In a case of first impression, the Texas Supreme \n     Court unanimously held that to have standing under the Texas \n     statute the plaintiff must show: (1) that the defendant is an \n     employer within the statutory definition of the Act; (2) that \n     some sort of employment relationship exists between the \n     plaintiff and a third party; and (3) that the defendant \n     controlled access to the plaintiff's employment opportunities \n     and denied or interfered with that access based on unlawful \n     criteria. Finding that the plaintiff met these criteria, the \n     Court held that the plaintiff had standing to sue the client \n     of her employer for unlawful employment practice.\n\n                           Kroger Co. v. Keng\n\n\n                       23 S.W.3d 347 (Tex. 2000)\n\n       Facts: Plaintiff brought suit against the defendant grocery \n     store, a workers' compensation nonsubscriber, alleging that \n     the\n\n[[Page S5383]]\n\n     store's negligence proximately caused her to suffer injuries \n     during an on the job accident. Kroger denied the allegations \n     and responded that plaintiff's conduct either caused or \n     contributed to the incident, entitling Kroger to protection \n     under the comparative responsibility statute.\n       Issue: Whether a non-subscriber to workers' compensation \n     insurance is entitled to a jury question regarding its \n     employee's alleged comparative responsibility for his or her \n     injuries.\n       Outcome: Justice Owen joined the Texas Supreme Court's \n     unanimous opinion, affirming the court of appeals' decision \n     and holding that a non-subscribing employer was not entitled \n     to a jury question on its employee's alleged comparative \n     responsibility. The court relied on the legislative intent of \n     Texas' comparative responsibility statute and deference to \n     the legislature in reconciling a Texas Court of Appeals' \n     circuit split.\n       Note: Justice Owen ruled for the plaintiff and a \n     plaintiff's right not to have her workers compensation claims \n     reduced for comparative negligence.\n\n                  Crown Life Insurance Co. v. Casteel\n\n\n                       22 S.W.3d 378 (Tex. 2000)\n\n       Facts: Casteel sold insurance policies as an independent \n     agent of Crown Life Insurance Company. One of the policies \n     sold by Casteel led to a lawsuit by policyholders against \n     Casteel and Crown. In that lawsuit, Casteel filed a cross-\n     claim against Crown for deceptive trade practices. The trial \n     court rendered judgment that Casteel did not have standing to \n     bring suit against Crown, holding that Casteel was neither a \n     ``person'' as defined under Article 21.21 of the Texas \n     Insurance Code, nor a ``consumer'' under the Deceptive Trade \n     Practices Act (DTPA), and therefore lacked standing to bring \n     suit under those statutes. The court of appeals held that \n     Casteel was a ``person'' with standing to sue Crown under \n     Article 21.21, but that Casteel did not have standing to sue \n     under the incorporated DTPA provisions because he was not a \n     ``consumer.''\n       Issue: Whether an insurance agent is a ``person'' with \n     standing to sue an insurance company under Article 21.21 and \n     whether an insurance agent must also be a ``consumer'' to \n     have standing to recover under Article 21.21 for incorporated \n     DTPA violations.\n       Outcome: Justice Owen joined a unanimous Texas Supreme \n     Court in holding that an insurance agent does not have \n     standing to sue as ``consumer'' for violations of the DTPA. \n     However, the court also held that despite not having standing \n     to bring suit under the DPTA, an insurance agent is a \n     ``person'' with standing to sue an insurance company for \n     violations of Article 21.21 of the Insurance Code.\n       Note: Illustrates Justice Owen's willingness to rule \n     against the insurance and allow the plaintiff to bring suit.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. In conclusion, Mr. President, I know my time is nearly \nup. I had a chance to talk at some length with Justice Priscilla Owen. \nShe is an intelligent, articulate lawyer who has had very substantial \nexperience on the Supreme Court of her State for some 10 years. She has \nbeen endorsed by 84 percent of the electorate of Texas. She has \nrecognized the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade and is bound to \napply it and has recognized its principles and is not at all hostile to \nRoe v. Wade.\n  In the 24 years and 4 months I have served on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have voted on many, many, many circuit judges. If \nPriscilla Owen had come before this Senate in any other context for \nconsideration, except get-even time in response to the way President \nClinton's nominees were treated, with some 70 rejected, in a spiraling \ncontext which started the last 2 years of President Reagan's \nadministration, had she come here at any other time, she would have \nmoved through this Senate on a voice vote or been unanimously \nconfirmed.\n  I suggest a careful reading of her record and a careful analysis, \naside from the tumult and turmoil of the Senate today, supports her \nconfirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is available to the Senator \nfrom Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 39 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  It is my understanding the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \ndid not use extra time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recommend all the Republicans and \nDemocrats listen to the speech given by the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. I said to him earlier this morning if it were he and I \nwho were allowed to work this out, we could work it out probably in \nless than an hour. I said the same thing to the President and to our \ntwo leaders.\n  Hopefully everyone understands the significance of this debate and \nwhat the Republican leader, the majority leader is doing. He has \ndecided to trigger the nuclear option. That is what it is. This nuclear \noption is something any Senate majority could have done any time over \nthe past 50 years. It boils down to the Republican Senate leader \ndeclaring the Senate rules governing filibusters are out of order.\n  The nonpartisan Senate Parliamentarian has indicated that would \nviolate the Senate rules. It would. The nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service has studied this and concluded it is unprecedented. \nWhy? Because it amounts to breaking the rules.\n  We are talking about judging whether nominees will be fair and \nimpartial judges who will follow the law and the majority is willing to \nbreak the rules to do that. When you have a slim majority and are \nwilling to use parliamentary brute force, if you want to break the \nrules, you can. It does not make it right. It makes it wrong, but you \ncan do it.\n  The American people ought to recognize this for what it is, an abuse \nof power to advance a power grab. It is an effort by the White House \nand the Republican Senate majority to undercut the checks and balances \nof the Senate. They intend to use majority power to override the rights \nof the minority.\n  Actually, it is not an isolated effort. It is part of a sustained \neffort by this administration and partisan operatives in the Congress \nto consolidate power in one branch, the executive branch, and ignore \nour constitutional history of three separate branches acting as checks \nand balances on each other. It is an effort at one-party rule. It \nundercuts the rights of the minority in the Senate, it undermines the \nrole of the Senate as a check on the executive, and it leads to a \nRepublican rubberstamp on a less independent judiciary.\n  The constitutional protections of the American people are at stake in \nthis debate, not just someone's political future, the constitutional \nprotections of the American people. At stake are the protections \nprovided for the American people by the judicial branch against \noverreaching by the political branches; by the Senate against an \naggressive executive branch, and by the minority against the tyranny of \nthe majority.\n  As this debate begins, I urge the American people to be involved \nbecause it is their rights that are at stake. It is the independence, \nfairness, and nonpartisan protection of the judiciary that protects \ntheir rights that is being threatened. It is a constitutional check \nthat the Senate was intended by the Founders to keep the executive from \nacting like a king, that is being threatened by curtailing the rights \nof the minority.\n  This is an exercise in breaking the rules to change the rules. Note \nthat as this debate begins, it begins in accordance with the Senate \nrules, including rule XXII, the longstanding rule the Republican \nmajority intends to override by the end of this process by \nparliamentary brute force.\n  The Senate is now being threatened with a fundamental change through \na self-inflicted wound. ``Master of the Senate'' author Robert Caro \nrecalled an important chapter in the Senate and the Nation's history. \nConsider this and contrast it with what is happening here today.\n\n  When Senator Lyndon Johnson of Texas left the Senate, he was the most \npowerful majority leader in the history of this country. When he was \nelected Vice President with President Kennedy and he was preparing to \nleave the Senate, he told his protege and successor, Senate Mansfield \nof Montana, that he, Johnson, would keep attending the Democratic \nluncheons and help his successor as majority leader in running the \nSenate. Senator Mansfield said no, Vice President Johnson was no longer \na Member of the Senate, but an officer of the executive branch and by \nmeans of that office was accorded the privilege of presiding over the \nSenate.\n  What a contrast Senator Mike Mansfield's respect for the separation \nof powers and checks and balances is from those in power today. I say \nthat as one who was privileged to serve here with Senator Mansfield.\n  Instead, this White House took an active role in naming the present \nSenate leadership and this White House regularly sends Vice President \nCheney and\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\nKarl Rove to Republican caucus luncheons to give the Republican \nmajority its marching orders. What a difference from the days of Mike \nMansfield and Lyndon Johnson.\n  The current Republican majority leader, who is my friend, announced \nthat he intends to leave the Senate next year. He made no secret of his \nintent to run for the Republican nomination for President. With that in \nmind, he is apparently prepared to become the first majority leader in \nthe history of the Senate whose legacy would be a significantly \nweakened Senate. Every other majority leader has left the Senate \nstronger than it was or at least as strong as it was, as a check and \nbalance against an executive. This would be the first time it would be \nleft weaker.\n  Many, unfortunately, on the other side--many but not all--are \napparently ready to sacrifice the Senate's role in our constitutional \nsystem of checks and balances. It is my hope that our system of checks \nand balances will be preserved with a handful of Republican Senators \nvoting their conscience and standing up to the White House and its \npressure. I know the zealotry of the narrow special interest leaders \nwho are demanding this mutilation of the Senate's character. I am one \nof many who have been the target of their brutal and spurious personal \nattacks.\n\n  My hope is that a number of the fine women and men of both parties \nwith whom I am privileged to serve as a custodian of our Nation's \nliberties will act in the finest traditions of the Senate. One of their \nnumber has come to this floor in recent days to remind all Senators of \nsenatorial profiles in courage. Sadly, it is that courage that will be \nnecessary to avert the overreaching power grab now underway.\n  There have been other recent threats to our system of government. \nRepublican partisans in the House, in a standoff with President \nClinton, shut down the Government in 1995. A few years later, they \nimpeached a popularly-elected President for the first time in our \nhistory. Fortunately, the Senate stood up and functioned as it was \nintended during that trial and rejected those efforts. I was privileged \nto be one of those who worked with both sides to make sure that trial \nended the way it did.\n  In 2000, a divided nation saw an election decided by the successful \nlitigation of the Republican Party and the intervention of a narrow \nactivist decision of the Supreme Court to stop vote counting in \nFlorida. Then we witnessed Senator Jeffords virtually driven out of the \nRepublican caucus. We have seen an aggressive executive branch that has \nbeen aided by a compliant congressional majority.\n  If the Senate's role in our system of coequal branches of the Federal \nGovernment is to be honored, it is going to take Republican Senators \njoining others in standing up for the American people's rights, the \nindependence of the judiciary, the rules of the Senate, and the rights \nof the minority.\n  During the last several days, we have seen the Democratic leader make \noffer after offer to head off this showdown. We have heard stirring \nspeeches from Senator Byrd, Senator Inouye, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nBiden, Senator Baucus, Senator Murray, Senator Boxer, Senator \nFeinstein, and others, who have come to this floor to set the record \nstraight. But this is a setting in which Democratic Senators alone will \nnot be able to rescue the Senate and our system of checks and balances \nfrom the breaking of the Senate rules being planned. If the rights of \nthe minority are to be preserved, if the Senate is to be preserved as \nthe greatest of parliamentary bodies, it will take at least six \nRepublicans standing up for fairness and for checks and balances.\n  Now I know from my own conversations that a number of Republican \nSenators know in their hearts this nuclear option is the wrong way to \ngo. I know Republican Senators, with whom I have had the privilege to \nserve for anywhere from 2 years to more than 30 years, know better. I \nhope more than six of them will withstand the political pressures being \nbrought upon them and do the right thing and the honorable thing, and \nthat they will put the Senate first, the Constitution first, but \nespecially the American people first. History and those who follow us \nwill carefully scrutinize these moments and these votes. Those voting \nto protect the rights of the minority will be on the right side of \nhistory.\n  Like the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, I remember President \nKennedy's publication of ``Profiles in Courage.'' Along with so many \nAmericans, I remember reading about those Senators who stood up to \ntheir party to vote against the conviction of President Andrew Johnson. \nMore recently, I witnessed the strength it took for my friend, Senator \nMark Hatfield, a distinguished Republican, to cast a vote of conscience \nagainst amending the Constitution. He did it under intense and unfair \npressures. I believe we are now seeing the current Senate leadership \ntaking the Senate to another precipice. It will take the votes of \nindependent and conscientious Republican Senators, such as Senator \nHatfield, to prevent the fall.\n  The Framers of the Constitution warned against the dangers of \nfactionalism undermining our structural separation of powers. Some in \nthe Senate have been willing to sacrifice the historic role of the \nSenate as a check on the President in the area of nominations.\n  Under pressure from the White House, over the last 2 years we saw the \nformer Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee lead \nSenate Republicans in breaking with longstanding precedent, in breaking \nthe rules, even committee rule IV, which was put in there at the \nrequest of Republicans to protect minorities. But when the Republicans \ntook the majority, they violated the rules, longstanding precedent and \nSenate tradition. With the Senate and the White House under control of \nthe same political party, we have witnesses committee rules broken or \nmisinterpreted away. The broken committee rules and precedent include \nthe way that home-state Senators were treated, the way hearings were \nscheduled, the way the committee questionnaire was unilaterally \naltered, and the way the Judiciary Committee's own historic protection \nof the minority by rule IV was repeatedly violated. In the last \nCongress, the Republican majority of the Judiciary Committee destroyed \nvirtually every custom and courtesy that used to help create and \nenforce cooperation and civility in the confirmation process. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent article from \nthe Wall Street Journal noting some of these developments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 3, 2005]\n\n              War Over Judges is No Longer a Subtle Fight\n\n       Washington.--Just 10 years ago, a Senate minority had \n     several avenues for affecting a president's judicial \n     nominations, from closed-door maneuvers within the Judiciary \n     Committee to quiet negotiations with the White House.\n       Now there is only one sure way, and it isn't quiet at all: \n     the filibuster.\n       The gradual disappearance of other levers of influence is \n     an often overlooked cause of the battle over judicial \n     nominations that is raging in Washington. Both parties have \n     played a part, with the result that the Senate stands on the \n     brink of a governmental crisis.\n       Some analysts say the consequences could be deep and \n     lasting. Republicans are threatening to choose the ``nuclear \n     option'' of using Senate rules to bar judicial filibusters. \n     In the short term, Democrats have threatened to bottle up \n     Republican legislative priorities. But over the long term, \n     some analysts say, the ban could dilute the Senate's power \n     and smooth the way for judicial choices reflecting the \n     dominant ideological blocs within the party holding the White \n     House.\n       The filibuster once was a seldom-used threat that forced \n     competing political camps to compromise--``the shotgun behind \n     the door,'' says Charles Geyh, a law professor at Indiana \n     University. If it is disarmed, he adds, ``The long-term \n     impact is pretty scary. These devices have been stabilizing \n     influences on the process for a long time.''\n       The chipping away at minority influence began in the 1970s \n     when Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, then \n     chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, attempted to \n     dilute the ability of a senator to employ a common tactic for \n     blocking unwelcome nominations. It was called the ``blue \n     slip''--named for the color of the paper used by the chairman \n     to inform senators not on the committee that the White House \n     had submitted a judicial nominee from their states.\n       A senator could object by checking off his or her \n     disapproval or by refusing to return the blue slip to the \n     chairman. For decades, opposition from a home-state senator \n     was enough to kill a nomination. As a result, the blue slip \n     was most commonly employed as a\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\n     lever for forcing negotiations with the White House.\n       As President Jimmy Carter sought to put his stamp on the \n     federal bench in the late 1970s, Mr. Kennedy proposed a new \n     blue-slip policy. It allowed the Judiciary chairman to \n     override a home-state senator's objection if he concluded \n     that opposition was based on race or sex. The Massachusetts \n     liberal met only mixed success, however, as other senators \n     continued to respect the traditional blue-slip process.\n       Two decades later, with Republicans in charge of the \n     Judiciary Committee, they began using their clout to exercise \n     what Democrats called a ``shadow filibuster'' by simply \n     refusing to give about 60 of President Bill Clinton's \n     judicial candidates a hearing or vote on the Senate floor.\n       Republicans argue that the White House shared blame for \n     some of the delays, saying some nominees hadn't undergone \n     background checks when they were forwarded to the committee. \n     But Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky recently \n     conceded on the Senate floor that the Democrats have ``a \n     legitimate complaint'' about how the Clinton appointees were \n     treated.\n       In 2003, Republican Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah \n     changed the practice further. He proceeded with hearings on \n     Bush judicial nominees even if they were vigorously opposed \n     by senators from the nominee's home state.\n       That change reduced the need for the White House to \n     negotiate with the Senate. The result was diminished \n     consultation between the president and the minority within \n     the chamber, a practice that started with President George \n     Washington, and extended through the Clinton administration. \n     Mr. Clinton consulted with Mr. Hatch even on his two U.S. \n     Supreme Court nominees, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen \n     Breyer.\n       In the last Congress, five judicial nominees had blue-slip \n     problems, including four receiving negative recommendations \n     from both of Michigan's Democratic senators. Even so, all \n     five of them were approved by the committee on party-line \n     votes and advanced to the full Senate, according to committee \n     records. Democrats blocked final votes on all of them.\n       Before the current stalemate, the filibuster had been used \n     effectively against a judicial nominee just once. In 1968, a \n     minority coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats \n     blocked President Lyndon B. Johnson's attempt to elevate \n     Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, a supporter of civil rights \n     and the Great Society programs, to the chief justice's chair. \n     After a cloture vote to end the filibuster failed, 45-43, Mr. \n     Fortas asked the president to withdraw his name.\n       Republicans today discount the significance of that vote, \n     arguing it wasn't clear Mr. Fortas would have been approved \n     by the full Senate if the filibuster had been overcome. By \n     contrast, there is little doubt that President George W. \n     Bush's contested nominees could attract a majority in the \n     chamber, where Republicans hold 55 seats.\n       Yet even in that 1968 debate, some senators recognized the \n     possibility that the Fortas stalemate would echo in future \n     debates. ``If we, for the first time in our history, permit a \n     Supreme Court nomination to be lost in a fog of a \n     filibuster,'' cautioned Democratic Sen. Philip Hart of \n     Michigan, ``I think we would be setting a precedent which \n     would come back to haunt our successors.''\n       After the Fortas battle, senators gradually began reaching \n     for the filibuster weapon. According to a 2003 analysis by \n     the Congressional Research Service, the Senate held 17 votes \n     to halt filibusters on judicial nominees between 1969 and \n     2002, although many were intended to force negotiations on \n     legislation or judicial candidates rather than defeating the \n     nominees.\n       None of the filibusters succeeded until the Democrats \n     managed to block 10 of Mr. Bush's first-term appellate-court \n     nominees. After his re-election, Mr. Bush resubmitted the \n     names of seven of those candidates. Those are the nominees in \n     contention today.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. We suffered through 3 years during which Republican staff \nstole Democratic files off the Judiciary computer servers. It is as \nthough those currently in power believe they are above our \nconstitutional checks and balances and they can reinterpret any treaty, \nlaw, rule, custom, or practice. If they don't like it or they find it \ninconvenient, they set it aside. It was tragic that the committee that \njudges the judges did not follow its own rules but broke them to \nachieve a predetermined result.\n  It was through these means that divisive and controversial judicial \nnominees were repeatedly brought before the Senate in the last \nCongress. It was through these abuses that the majority acted as \nhandmaidens to the administration to create confrontation after \nconfrontation over controversial nominees. They dragged the judiciary, \nwhich should be above politics, into the political thicket and did so \nfor partisan gain.\n  I applaud the Senator from Pennsylvania who has worked to bring us \nback in the Senate Judiciary Committee to following our rules in the \ncomity that makes it work. I regret that filibusters have been \nnecessary in the past 2 years. I wish Republicans would not have \nfollowed their years of secret holds and pocket filibusters of more \nthan 60 of President Clinton's nominees, judicial nominees, and more \nthan 200 of his executive nominees. I wish they would not have flipped \nthe script once a Republican became President and dismembered the rules \nand traditions of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I have urged consultation and cooperation over the last 4 years. I \nhad the privilege of chairing the Senate Judiciary Committee for 17 \nmonths with President Bush in the White House, and we confirmed 100 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees, including a number of controversial \nnominees, including some I was opposed to. I voted against them, but I \nmade sure they got hearings.\n  The President and his enablers in the Senate cannot seem to take \n``yes'' for an answer. The Senate has confirmed 208 of his judicial \nnominees and we are withholding consent on 5.\n  He rejects our advice, but he demands our consent. That is wrong, and \nthat goes against the Constitution. The Constitution speaks of advice \nand consent, not order and rubberstamp.\n  What the White House ignores is that President Bush completed his \nfirst term with the third highest total of confirmed judges in our \nhistory--in our history--and more Federal judges on the courts than at \nany time in our history. The truth is, Senate Democrats have cooperated \nextensively in confirming more than 95 percent of this President's \njudicial nominees--208 of them.\n  George Washington, the most popular and powerful President in our \nhistory, was not successful in all of his judicial nominations. The \nSenate rejected President Washington's nomination of John Rutledge to \nbe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. For example. And certainly I \nwould hope that the current President would not assume he stands higher \nin our history books than George Washington.\n  The truth is, in President Bush's first term, the 204 judges \nconfirmed were more than were confirmed in either of President \nClinton's two terms, more than during the term of this President's \nfather, and more than Ronald Reagan's first term when he had a \nRepublican majority in the Senate. By last December, we had reduced \njudicial vacancies from the 110 vacancies I inherited in the summer of \n2001 to its lowest level, lowest rate, and lowest number in decades, \nsince President Ronald Reagan was in office.\n  Unfortunately, this President has chosen confrontation over \ncooperation. In fact, it is mid-May, and he has only sent one new \nnomination to the Senate all year. Im connection with that nomination, \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee have written to the Chairman \nurging a prompt hearing. With the support of the nominee's home-state \nSenators, one a Democrat and one a Republican, the nomination of Brian \nSandoval will be added to the long list of judicial confirmations.\n  But that leave 30 judicial vacancies without nominations. Back on \nApril 11, the Democratic leader and I wrote to the President urging him \nto work with Senators of both parties to identify nominees for these 30 \nvacancies. To date, he has not responded. Instead he, his Vice \nPresident, his Chief of Staff and his spokesperson continue to prod the \nSenate toward triggering the nuclear option. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2005.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There are currently 28 vacancies on the \n     Federal courts of appeals and district courts for which you \n     have not forwarded nominees to the Senate. We write to offer \n     to help you obtain consultation and advice from the Senate on \n     these vacancies so that you may select nominees who will \n     generate strong, bipartisan support.\n       This evening the Senate is scheduled to consider your \n     nomination of Paul Crotty to become a federal judge in New \n     York. We expect Mr. Crotty to be confirmed with the support \n     of his home-state Senators and an overwhelming vote. We have \n     each been urging you for some time to work with the Senate to \n     fill federal judicial vacancies with qualified, consensus \n     nominees. It is now imperative that we do so.\n       When you met with Russian President Putin earlier this \n     year, you noted that\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\n     checks and balances and an independent judiciary are among \n     the fundamental requirements of democracy. We agree. We \n     therefore urge you to make clear to Senate Republican leaders \n     that you do not favor the so-called ``nuclear option'' which \n     would remove an important check on executive power. Instead, \n     let us work together to identify consensus judicial \n     candidates. Let us preserve our independent judiciary, which \n     is the envy of the world.\n           Respectfully,\n     Harry Reid,\n       Democratic Leader.\n     Patrick Leahy,\n       Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. When it comes to the judiciary, the independent judiciary, \nthe branch of Government always looked at with most favor and most \nrespect by Americans, wouldn't it be good if the President, in making \nhis nominations, would act as a uniter, not as a divider? Instead, the \nPresident has acted as a divider, not a uniter. He has sent the Senate \ndivisive and controversial nominees. When the Senate debates them and \nwithholds consent, he stubbornly renominates them over and over again. \nRather than work with us to find consensus nominees, which usually pass \nthis Senate 100 to nothing, he disparages us and exploits the issue as \na partisan matter.\n  Under our Constitution, the Senate has an important role in the \nselection of our judiciary. The brilliant design of our Founders \nestablished the first two branches of Government would work together to \nequip the third branch to serve as an independent arbiter of justice. \nAs George Will once wrote: ``A proper constitution distributes power \namong legislative, executive and judicial institutions so that the will \nof the majority can be measured, expressed in policy and, for the \nprotection of minorities, somewhat limited.''\n  The structure of our Constitution and our own Senate rules of self-\ngovernance are designed to protect minority rights and to encourage \nconsensus. Despite the razor-thin margin of recent elections, the \nmajority party is not acting in a measured way but in complete \ndisregard for the traditions of bipartisanship that are the hallmark of \nthe Senate. When these traditions are followed, I can tell my \ncolleagues from 31 years of experience, the Senate works better, and \nthe American people are better served. Instead, the current majority is \nseeking to ignore precedents and reinterpret longstanding rules to its \nadvantage.\n  The practice of ``might makes right'' is wrong. The Senate's rules \nshould not be toyed with like a playground game of King of the Hill, to \nbe changed at the whim of any current majority.\n  The Senate majority leader seems intent on removing the one Senate \nprotection left for the minority, the protection of debate in \naccordance with the longstanding tradition of the Senate and its \nstanding rules. In order to remove the last remaining vestige of \nprotection for the minority, the Republican majority is poised to break \nthe Senate rules, violate the Senate rules, overturn the Senate rules, \nand end the filibuster by breaking those rules. They are intent on \ndoing this--why?--to force through the Senate this President's most \ncontroversial and divisive judicial nominees.\n  As the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote in his famous Letter \nFrom A Birmingham Jail:\n\n       Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust \n     laws.\n       An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority \n     group compels a minority group to obey but does not make \n     binding on itself. This is difference made legal. By the same \n     token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a \n     minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. \n     This is sameness made legal.\n\n  Fair process is a fundamental component of the American system of \nlaw. If we cannot have a fair process in these halls or in our courts, \nhow will the resulting decisions be viewed? If the rule of law is to \nmean anything, it must mean that it applies to all equally. The rule of \nlaw must apply the same to Republicans and Democrats. The rule of law \nmust apply the same to all Americans. And certainly the rule of law \nmust apply on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  No man and no party should be above the law. That has been one of the \nstrengths of our democracy. Our country was born in reaction to the \nautocracy and corruption of King George, and we must not forget our \nroots as a nation of both law and liberty. The best guarantee of \nliberty is the rule of law, meaning that the decisions of government \nare not arbitrary and that rules are not discretionary or enforced to \nhelp one side and then ignored to aid another.\n  Mr. President, nothing I will ever do in my life will equal the \nopportunity, the honor, the privilege to be one of the 100 serving in \nthis Senate. But not one of this 100--who are privileged to serve at \nany given time to represent 280 million Americans--none of us owns the \nSenate. The Senate will be here once we leave. It is our responsibility \nto leave the Senate as strong as it was when we came in. It is our \nresponsibility, our sworn responsibility, to leave the Senate the body \nthat has always been a check and balance.\n  How can any Senator look himself or herself in the mirror if they \nweaken the Senate, if they allow the Senate to no longer be the check \nand balance it should be? Why would anyone want to serve here if they \ncome to this body with that in mind?\n  James Madison, one of the Framers of our Constitution, warned in \nFederalist Number 47 of the very danger that is threatening our great \nNation, a threat to our freedoms from within:\n\n       [The] accumulation of all powers legislative, executive and \n     judiciary in the same hands . . . may justly be pronounced \n     the very definition of tyranny.\n\n  That is what they are trying to do, put all the power into one hand. \nAll of us should know enough of history to know we should not do that.\n  George Washington, our great first President, reiterated the danger \nin his famous Farewell Address to the American People:\n\n       The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers \n     of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever \n     the form of government, a real despotism.\n\n  Now, our freedoms as Americans are the fruit of too much sacrifice to \nhave the rules broken in the Senate, especially to break them in \ncollusion with the executive branch. What ever happened to the concept \nof separation of powers? We all give great speeches on the separation \nof powers. Don't just give the speeches, do not just talk the talk, \nlet's walk the walk.\n  The effort to appoint loyalists to courts in the hope that they will \nreinterpret precedents and overturn the very laws that have protected \nour most fundamental rights as Americans is base and wrong. The \nAmerican people deserve better than what we have seen with the \ndestruction of rule after rule by a majority willing to sacrifice the \nrole of the Senate as a check and balance in order to aid a President \ndetermined to pack the Federal courts. It is the courts themselves that \nserve as the check on the political branches. Their independence is \ncritical and must be preserved.\n\n  Look at what we are talking about, Mr. President. We have confirmed \n208 judges. We are saying no to five. Is this a judicial crisis that \nshould allow the majority to destroy the Senate? The record of 208 \nconfirmations and reduction of judicial vacancies to an historic low \nprovide no basis on which to break the rules of the Senate. The \nDemocratic leader's efforts to make additional progress demonstrate \nthere is no reason for the majority to take the drastic and \nirreversible step of ending protection of the minority through the \ntradition of extended debate in the Senate.\n  The White House and Senate Republican leadership's campaign for the \nnuclear option seeks to end the role of the Senate serving as a check \non the executive. That is so shortsighted. It is so wrong. It is so \nunjustified. We fought a revolution in this country to have a \nConstitution that is designed to have the Senate provide balance and \nact as a check.\n  I will have more to say about these important matters and about the \nnomination that the Judiciary Committee previously rejected and that \nthe Senate has previously debated as we proceed over the next several \ndays. There is one other aspect of this matter I need to mention. I \nwill say this in my individual capacity as a Senator from Vermont, as a \nman of faith, as a man who cares deeply about this institution, our \ncountry, our Constitution, our first amendment and our constitutional \nprovision that does not allow a religious test for those who serve.\n  Supporters of a power-hungry executive have gone so far as to seek to \ninject an unconstitutional religious test\n\n[[Page S5387]]\n\ninto the debate. All Americans should fear this. They have \ncharacterized those who oppose the most extreme of the President's \nnominees as being against faith, against people of faith. They have \ncalled for mass impeachment of judges and other measures to intimidate \nthe judiciary, to remove the independence of the judiciary. I commend \nthe President for personally rejecting at least that demagoguery at a \nrecent press conference. I wish he would go further and tell those \nmaking these charges and inflammatory claims to stop.\n  A Republican clergyman, Pat Robertson, said he believes Federal \njudges are ``a more serious threat to America than Al Qaeda and the \nSeptember 11 terrorists'' and ``more serious than a few bearded \nterrorists who fly into buildings'' and ``the worst threat America has \nfaced in 400 years--worse than Nazi Germany, Japan, and the Civil \nWar.''\n  For shame. For shame. This is the sort of incendiary rhetoric that is \npaving the way to the nuclear option. It is wrong. It is destructive. \nFurther, injecting religion into politics to claim a monopoly on piety \nand political truth by demonizing those you disagree with is not the \nAmerican way.\n  As Abraham Lincoln has said:\n\n       I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right, \n     but it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this \n     nation should be on the Lord's side.\n\n  He was so right. We all would do well spending a little more time \nwondering whether we are on God's side and less time declaring \ninfallibly that He is on ours.\n  Those driving the nuclear option engage in a dangerous and corrosive \ngame of religious McCarthyism in which anyone daring to oppose one of \nthis President's nominees is being branded as anti-Christian or anti-\nCatholic or against people of faith.\n  Dr. Dobson of Focus on the Family said of me, ``I do not know if he \nhates God but he hates God's people.''\n  I wonder every Sunday when I am at mass, what planet is this person \nfrom?\n  When Senator Hatch was attacked during his Presidential campaign on \nhis religion, I came to his defense. When Senator Lott was under \nattack, Senators Jeffords and Specter spoke in his defense.\n  When they charge us with being against people of faith for opposing \nnominees, what are they saying about the 208 Bush judicial nominees \nwhom Democrats have voted for and helped confirm? Are they saying the \nfive we oppose are people of faith but the 208 we voted for are not? \nAre they by definition people without faith?\n\n       These kinds of charges, this virulent religious \n     McCarthyism, is fraudulent on its face. It is contemptible. \n     It is contemptible.\n\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist is right to refer to the Federal judiciary as \nthe crown jewel of our system of government. It is an essential check \nand balance, a critical source of protection of the rights of all \nAmericans, including our religious freedom.\n  Just this morning the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania \nand the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois conducted a hearing \nin the Judiciary Committee where they heard the testimony of Judge Joan \nLefkow of Chicago. She is the Federal judge whose mother and husband \nwere murdered in their home. The hearts of all of us go out to her. She \nasked that we repudiate the gratuitous attacks on the judiciary, and I \ndo so, again, here today. I ask those members of Congress who are so \nquick to take the floor and say let's impeach judges or let's condemn \njudges or specific judges, to stop it. Listen to what Judge Lefkow \nsaid:\n\n       In this age of mass communication, harsh rhetoric is truly \n     dangerous. Fostering disrespect for judges can only encourage \n     those that are on the edge, or on the fringe, to exact \n     revenge on a judge who ruled against them.\n\n  We should stop those kinds of speeches, whether it is on this floor \nor the other body. They are beneath, us, all of us.\n  I remember Justice Sandra Day O'Connor made a similar observation. I \nrecently spoke with her and told her how much I appreciated that.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania spoke about Benjamin Franklin. Let me \nreiterate. In September 1787, as the Constitutional Convention drew to \na close, someone came up to Benjamin Franklin to ask whether all of the \narduous work of drafting the Constitution produced a republic or a \nmonarchy. Benjamin Franklin told them, ``A Republic, if you can keep \nit.''\n\n  We have fought world wars, a civil war, we have gone through \nelections, assassinations, changes in Government, we have gone through \nall these traumas, the Great Depression, and attacks on our soil. In \nall of it we have joined together to keep this Republic. We have kept \nour freedoms through checks and balances, checks and balances woven \nthrough our constitutional system so brilliantly by our Founders. Those \nchecks and balances can easily be unthreaded and unwoven by the abuse \nof power. Let us hope that never happens. Remember, it can happen not \njust through big steps, it can happen through small steps.\n  This action that is being proposed to the Senate, the nuclear option, \nis a large step, a large abuse of power, a step with consequences we \ncan only begin to imagine. It would be a vote for confrontation over \nconsensus. I hope each of us will reflect on its consequences, and \nthen, in the end, such a travesty will never befall the Senate.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining to the Senator from \nVermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished deputy Democratic \nleader in the Chamber and I will yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont, not only for his \nexcellent statement this morning, but also for his leadership in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. It has been my honor to serve with him on \nthat committee during my tenure in the Senate.\n  The point he made at the close of his remarks bears repeating. We are \ndebating an important constitutional principle of checks and balances. \nWe are considering for the first time in over 200 years the so-called \n``nuclear option'' which will destroy one of the rules of the Senate \nwhich has been used so many times on so many occasions for so many \ndifferent things. This is a strategy that has been put together by the \nleadership in the Senate and it undoubtedly will occasion great debate \nin this Chamber for many hours.\n  But I would like to admonish my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto take care in the words they use during the course of this debate. \nThis morning, unfortunately, the majority leader came to the floor and \nsaid the following:\n\n       The issue is not cloture votes per se; it is the partisan \n     leadership-led use of cloture votes to kill, to defeat, to \n     assassinate these nominees.\n\n  I know the majority leader. I know him to be a man of genuine caring \nand humanity. He has proven that so many times in his personal life as \na doctor, as a surgeon, as a person who has taken on humanitarian \ncauses which many in the Senate would shrink from. And so I know those \nwords, if they were given to him by someone, do not reflect his heart. \nAnd if they were said in a moment without thinking, it is something we \ncould all make a mistake and do. But I would urge him and urge each and \nevery one of us to choose words carefully in the debate about judges.\n  We were reminded this morning with the testimony of Judge Lefkow \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee how important words can be. She \ncalled for a variety of things we can do to protect judges across \nAmerica, but she also went to the question of words. She said:\n\n       Frankly, I ask you--\n\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee--\n\n     to publicly and persistently repudiate gratuitous attacks on \n     the judiciary such as the recent statement of Pat Robertson \n     on national television and, unfortunately, some Members of \n     Congress, albeit in much more measured terms.\n\n  Judge Lefkow understands as I do and every Member of the Senate that \nwe live in a country that prides itself on freedom, the freedom to \nexpress yourself, the freedom for people to say things without fear \nthat the Government will come down on them, even if we hate every word \nthey say. But the point she was making was to take care, to denounce \nthose comments that cross the line.\n  When we hear in this debate about changing the rules of the Senate as \nit\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\nrelates to judges, let us take care to understand there are differences \nof opinion as to whether these men and women who are being discussed \nshare the views of many Americans, whether their views are extreme. But \nthe issue is not about them personally.\n  Some have suggested you can't oppose a judicial nominee here unless \nyou oppose that nominee's gender, that nominee's religion, that \nnominee's race, that nominee's ethnic background, that nominee's \nupbringing. All of those things are false. My consideration of these \nnominees has gone to the heart of the issue. I consider myself to be \nwithout prejudice. I hope I am. I do my best to avoid it in everything \nI say and do. But for those who come to the floor and say you can't \noppose this nominee unless you are in a position where you disagree \nwith their religion, that is just plain wrong. There are so many lines \nthat are crossed between religious and political belief. The issue of \nthe death penalty in my Catholic religion is one that is hotly debated \namong Catholics. Many of the leading Catholic legislators, Republican \nand Catholic, disagree in their votes with the church's official \nposition. But it is a public issue that should be discussed and it \ndoesn't reflect on the nominee or the religion of a Congressman or \nSenator when we discuss it.\n  So when words are expressed during the course of the debate that \nthose of us who oppose these nominees are setting out to kill, to \ndefeat, or to assassinate these nominees, those words are \ninappropriate. Those words go too far.\n  Let me remind those who follow this debate, as I said earlier, the \nmajority leader is a good man, a humane man, a sensitive man who has \nbeen closer to life and death than any of us in this Chamber, and I \nbelieve those words given to him were inappropriate, and if they were \nsaid in a careless moment I am sure do not reflect his heart.\n  But let us take care during the course of this debate to understand \nthat our differences as to these nominees come down to issues of law \nand public policy which members of the judiciary decide. If I disagree \nwith one of these nominees or any judge as to their opinions, it is not \ngoing to reflect anything on them personally. It reflects on the fact \nthat we have to make decisions as to whether they should serve on the \nbench.\n  This is a historic moment in the Senate. There may never be another \none like it. We are considering a change in the Senate, a change in \nthis institution which, sadly, will ripple out as a pebble in a pond \nfor generations to come. This is not an isolated case involving one, \ntwo, or five judges. It is a change in the Senate rules that will \nuniquely change this special institution.\n  I fear that many of the people in the White House and on the floor of \nthe Senate who are grabbing for this political victory don't realize it \nis going to change an important institution we have counted on \nthroughout our history. Those Founding Fathers who wrote the \nConstitution made the Senate a special institution, an institution \nwhere, in fact, minority rights and the minority's opportunity to speak \nwould always be protected. To take away those minority rights by Vice \nPresident Cheney making a casual ruling from the Chair, to sweep away \n214 years of precedent and rules so that someone can score a quick \nvictory in terms of even 1, 2, or 10 judges is entirely inappropriate.\n  I hope there will be enough Members on the other side of the aisle \nwho understand our special responsibility. It is an historic \nresponsibility. It goes beyond this President. It goes beyond any \npolitical party, and it certainly goes beyond the press release of the \nday. It goes to the heart of why we are entrusted with this \nresponsibility to serve in the Senate. We are hoping that when the \nnuclear option comes, there will be Senators willing to stand up for \nthis tradition and for these constitutional values.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate. The \npeople who may be listening to this across the country and around the \nworld on television, to the extent they are following it, may be \nforgiven if they wonder what is going on. People are talking about what \nwe are doing on the floor in such breathless and nearly apocalyptic \nterms, referring to the nuclear option. This is not about America's \nforeign policy. This is about the rules of the Senate and the power of \nthe Senate to determine for itself the rules by which we are governed. \nIt is certainly an important matter, but we should tone down our \nrhetoric a little and try to address squarely the issue.\n  I worry when I hear Senators use words such as ``despicable,'' \n``Neanderthal,'' ``scary,'' or ``kook'' in describing nominees by this \nPresident to the Federal bench. I would have thought that kind of \nrhetoric was unbecoming to a body such as the Senate, sometimes called \nthe world's greatest deliberative body. I hope during the course of the \ndebate we will take a deep breath, as we try to calmly but deliberately \naddress the issues that lie before us. That is what I will strive to do \nfor my part.\n  I want to talk in particular about Priscilla Owen. Before I do, I \nneglected to ask unanimous consent that I be allotted 20 minutes out of \nour side's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I want to respond first to an argument made earlier this \nmorning. This is in the category of we can disagree about matters of \nopinion and matters about policy, but we should not disagree about the \nfacts, when the facts are so plainly there before us and evident.\n  Richard Paez, a nominee of President Clinton, has been held up as \nperhaps one of the examples of our side treating a Democratic \nPresident's nominee unfairly. As this chart aptly demonstrates, if we \nwould agree to treat Priscilla Owen exactly the way that Paez was \ntreated, then Priscilla Owen would be sitting on the Fifth Circuit \ntoday, just as Judge Paez is now serving on the circuit court in the \nFederal judiciary. In other words, this is not an example justifying \nthe actions being taken against this President's nominees. This is an \nexample of why the obstruction we have seen is wrong and unfair. All we \nare asking for in this debate is a simple up-or-down vote for this \nPresident's nominees.\n  Priscilla Owen has been waiting 4 years for that simple up-or-down \nvote, which is all we are asking for. As I said, 4 years ago, Priscilla \nOwen was nominated to serve on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. She \nserves currently and has served on the Texas Supreme Court, where I had \nthe honor of serving with her. She is an exceptional jurist, a devoted \npublic servant, and an extraordinary Texan. Yet after 4 years, she \nstill awaits an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  This is the irony of where we find ourselves. Although a bipartisan \nmajority stands ready to confirm her nomination, a partisan minority \nobstructs the process and refuses to allow a vote. What is more, this \npartisan minority insists for the first time in history that she must \nbe supported by a supermajority of 60 Senators, rather than the \nconstitutional standard and Senate tradition of a majority vote.\n  I know Priscilla personally. It is hard for me to reconcile the \ncaricature that most people have seen drawn of her by some of the \nrhetoric used, certainly, with what I know about her personally. Those \nwho know her would not recognize her from the caricature being created \nin the Senate and elsewhere when talking about this outstanding \nnominee.\n  She is a distinguished jurist and a distinguished public servant. She \nhas excelled at virtually everything she has undertaken. She was a top \ngraduate of her law school class at the remarkable age of 23 years and \nreceived the top score on the Texas bar examination. She entered the \nlegal profession at a time when few women did. After a distinguished \nrecord in private practice, she reached the pinnacle of the Texas bar, \nwhich is the Texas Supreme Court. She was supported by a larger \npercentage of Texans in her last election than any of her colleagues--\n84 percent--after enjoying the endorsement of virtually every newspaper \nin the State. She has been honored as the Young Lawyer of the Year by \nher alma mater, as well as an outstanding alumna of Baylor University.\n  The irony in this partisan obstruction of a bipartisan majority who \nstand ready to confirm her is that Priscilla Owen enjoys bipartisan \nsupport in the State of Texas. Three former Democratic judges on the \nTexas Supreme\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\nCourt, as well as a bipartisan group of 15 past presidents of the State \nbar of Texas support this nominee.\n  The Houston Chronicle, one of our major newspapers, in the year 2000 \ncalled her ``[c]learly academically gifted,'' stating that she ``has \nthe proper balance of judicial experience, solid legal scholarship, and \nreal-world know-how to continue to be an asset on the high court.''\n  The Dallas Morning News, another major newspaper in our State, wrote \non September 4, 2002:\n\n       She has the brainpower, experience and temperament to serve \n     ably on an appellate court.\n\n  The Washington Post wrote in 2002:\n\n       She should be confirmed. Justice Owen is indisputably well \n     qualified.\n\n  Priscilla Owen is not just intellectually capable and legally \ntalented, she is also a fine human being with a big heart. The depth of \nher humanity and compassion is revealed through her significant free \nlegal work and community activity. In fact, she has spent most of her \nlife devoted to her community. She has worked, for example, that all \ncitizens be ensured access to justice, as the Texas Supreme Court's \nrepresentative on the mediation task force of that court, as well as \nher service on statewide committees of lawyers and her successful \nefforts to prompt the Texas Legislature to provide millions of dollars \nper year for legal services to the poor.\n  She was instrumental in organizing a group known as Family Law 2000, \nwhich seeks to find ways to educate parents about the effect that \ndivorce can have on their children and to lessen the negative impacts \ntherefrom. She teaches Sunday school at her church, St. Barnabas \nEpiscopal Mission in Austin, TX, where she is an active member. It is \nplain, from these and so many other examples, that Justice Owen bears \nno resemblance to the caricature that has been painted of her in the \nSenate. She is, in fact, a fine person and a distinguished leader of \nthe legal community.\n  One would think that after 4 long years, she would be afforded the \nsimple justice of an up-or-down vote. I remain optimistic, hopeful, \nthat this violation of many years of Senate tradition, the imposition \nof a new supermajority requirement of 60 votes, will be laid aside in \nthe interest of proceeding with the people's business, a job my \ncolleagues and I were elected to faithfully execute.\n\n  For more than 200 years, it was a job that we faithfully executed \nwhen it came to voting on a President's judicial nominees. Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle exercised mutual restraint and did not \nabuse the privilege of debate out of respect for two coequal branches \nof government--the executive, that has a constitutional right to choose \nhis or her nominees, and an independent judiciary.\n  Until 4 years ago, colleagues on both sides of the aisle consistently \nopposed the use of the filibuster to prevent judicial nominees from \nreceiving an up-or-down vote. One of our colleagues, the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, said in 1998:\n\n       Nominees deserve a vote. If our . . . colleagues don't like \n     them, vote against them. But don't just sit on them--that is \n     an obstruction of justice . . .\n\n  The senior Senator from Vermont, in 1998, said:\n\n       I have stated over and over on this floor that I would \n     refuse to put an anonymous hold on any judge; that I would \n     object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, whether \n     it is somebody I opposed or supported; that I felt the Senate \n     should do its duty.\n\n  I could not agree more with those comments made in 1998 from the very \nsame colleagues who today oppose the same principle they argued for a \nfew short years ago. We are doing a disservice to the Nation and a \ndisservice to this fine nominee in our failure to afford her that up-\nor-down vote.\n  The new requirement the partisan minority is now imposing--that \nnominees will not be confirmed without the support of 60 Senators--is, \nby their own admission, unprecedented in Senate history. The reason for \nthis is simple. The case for opposing this fine nominee is so weak that \nusing a double standard and changing the rules is the only way they can \nhope to defeat her nomination. What is more, they know it.\n  Before her nomination was caught up in partisan special interest \npolitics, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee predicted \nthat Priscilla Owen would be swiftly confirmed. On the day of the \nannouncement of the first group of nominees, including Justice Owen, he \nsaid he was ``encouraged'' and that ``I know them well enough that I \nwould assume they'll go through all right.''\n  Notwithstanding the change of attitude by the partisan minority, this \ngridlock is really not about Priscilla Owen. Indeed, just a few weeks \nago the Democratic leader announced that Senate Democrats would give \nJustice Owen an up-or-down vote, albeit only if other nominees were \ndefeated or withdrawn. Obviously, with these kinds of offers being made \nbased on cutting deals and pure politics, this debate is not about \nprinciple. It is all about politics. It is shameful.\n  We should all subscribe to the notion that any nominee of any \nPresident, if they enjoy majority support in the Senate, should get an \nup-or-down vote. I am talking about whether we have a Democrat in the \nWhite House or a Republican, whether we have Democrat majorities in the \nSenate or Republican.\n  The rules should apply across the board exactly the same to all \nnominees, regardless of who wins and who loses from a political \nconsideration.\n  But what bothers me most is that any fair examination of Justice \nOwen's record demonstrates how unconvincing and unjustified the \ncritics' arguments are against her specifically.\n  For example, she was accused of ruling against injured workers, \nemployment discrimination plaintiffs, and other sympathetic parties on \na variety of occasions. Never mind the fact that good judges, such as \nJustice Owen, do their best to follow the law, regardless of which \nparty will win and which party will lose. That is what good judges do. \nNever mind that many of her criticized rulings were unanimous or near-\nunanimous decisions of a nine-member Texas Supreme Court. Never mind \nthat many of these rulings simply followed Federal precedents authored \nor agreed to by appointees of President Carter and President Clinton, \nor by other Federal judges unanimously confirmed by the Senate. And \nnever mind the fact that judges often disagree, especially when a law \nis ambiguous and requires careful and difficult interpretation.\n  One of the focal points on Justice Owen's record is a criticism of \nenforcing a popular Texas law that requires parental notification \nbefore a minor can obtain an abortion. Her opponents allege in the \nparental notification case that then-Justice Alberto Gonzales, our \ncurrent Attorney General, accused her of ``judicial activism.'' I heard \nthat argument again this morning on the floor, notwithstanding the fact \nthe charge is demonstrably untrue.\n  For any Member to repeat this argument that is simply not true, in \nspite of the fact that it has been demonstrated that it is not true, is \nto me an unconscionable act of distortion of the facts. Here again, we \ncan disagree about the policies, and we can even decide to vote \ndifferently on a nominee, but let's not disagree on the facts when they \nare so clear. Not once did Alberto Gonzales say Justice Owen is guilty \nof judicial activism. To the contrary, he never even mentioned her name \nin the particular opinions that are being discussed. Furthermore, our \ncurrent Attorney General has since testified under oath that he never \naccused Justice Owen of any such thing.\n  What's more, the author of the parental notification law that was at \nissue supports Justice Owen for this nomination, as does the pro-\nchoice, Democratic law professor who was appointed to the Texas Supreme \nCourt advisory committee who was supposed to write rules, and did write \nrules, to implement the law. In her words, Owen simply did ``what good \nappellate judges do every day. . . . If this is activism, then any \njudicial interpretation of a statute's terms is judicial activism.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the American people know judicial activism \nwhen they see it. They know a controversial ruling that is totally out \nof step with a judge's accepted role in our form of government when \nthey see it,\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\nwhether it be the redefinition of marriage, the expulsion of the Pledge \nof Allegiance from our classrooms and other expressions of faith from \nthe public square, the elimination of the three-strikes-and-you're-out \nlaw, and other penalties for convicted criminals, or the forced removal \nof military recruiters from college campuses. Justice Owen's rulings \ncome nowhere near those examples of judicial activism that we would all \nrecognize clearly and plainly.\n  There is a world of difference between struggling to interpret the \nambiguous expressions of a statute and refusing to obey a legislature's \ndirectives altogether, or substituting one's personal views or agenda \nfor the words of a statute.\n  It is clear, then, that Justice Owen's record deserves the broad and \nbipartisan support that she has gotten, and it is equally clear that \nher opposition only comes from a narrow band on the far-left fringes of \nthe political spectrum.\n  So if the Senate were simply to follow more than 200 years of \nconsistent Senate and constitutional tradition, dating back to our \nFounders, there would be no question about her being confirmed; she \nwould be. Legal scholars across the political spectrum have long \nconcluded what we in this body know instinctively, and that is to \nchange the rules of confirmation, as the partisan minority has done, \nbadly politicizes the judiciary and hands over control of the judiciary \nto special interest groups.\n  Mr. President, 4 years is a long time. The majority leader and those \nwho support this nominee's confirmation have shown extraordinary \npatience during this debate. But there is a point at which patience \nceases to be a virtue, and I suggest that we have reached that point. \nWe need a resolution of this issue. We need for Senators to step up and \nto vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.'' But we simply need for them to vote.\n  The record is clear. The Senate tradition has always been majority \nvote, and the desire by some to alter that Senate tradition has been \nroundly condemned by legal experts across the spectrum.\n  Professor Michael Gerhardt, who advises Senate Democrats about \njudicial confirmations, has written that a supermajority requirement \nfor confirming judges would be ``problematic, because it creates a \npresumption against confirmation, shifts the balance of power to the \nSenate, and enhances the power of the special interests.''\n  D.C. Circuit Judge Harry Edwards, a respected Carter appointee, has \nwritten that the Constitution forbids the Senate from imposing a \nsupermajority rule for confirmations. After all, otherwise, ``[t]he \nSenate, acting unilaterally, could thereby increase its own power at \nthe expense of the President'' and ``essentially take over the \nappointment process from the President.'' Edwards thus concluded that \n``the Framers never intended for Congress to have such unchecked \nauthority to impose supermajority voting requirements that \nfundamentally change the nature of our democratic processes.''\n  Georgetown law professor Mark Tushnet has written that ``[t]he \nDemocrats' filibuster is . . . a repudiation of a settled, pre-\nconstitutional understanding.'' He has also written: ``There's a \ndifference between the use of the filibuster to derail a nomination and \nthe use of other Senate rules--on scheduling, on not having a floor \nvote without prior committee action, etc.--to do so. All those other \nrules . . . can be overridden by a majority vote of the Senate . . . \nwhereas the filibuster can't be overridden in that way. A majority of \nthe Senate could ride herd on a rogue Judiciary Committee chair who \nrefused to hold a hearing on some nominee; it can't do so with respect \nto a filibuster.''\n  And Georgetown law professor Susan Low Bloch has condemned \nsupermajority voting requirements for confirmation, arguing that they \nwould allow the Senate to ``upset the carefully crafted rules \nconcerning appointment of both executive officials and judges and to \nunilaterally limit the power the Constitution gives to the President in \nthe appointment process. This, I believe, would allow the Senate to \naggrandize its own role and would unconstitutionally distort the \nbalance of powers established by the Constitution.''\n  She even wrote on March 14, 2005: ``Everyone agrees: Senate \nconfirmation requires simply a majority. No one in the Senate or \nelsewhere disputes that.''\n  Mr. President, the record is clear. The Senate tradition has always \nbeen majority vote, and the desire by some to alter that Senate \ntradition has been roundly condemned by legal experts across the \npolitical spectrum.\n  Throughout our Nation's more than 200-year history, the \nconstitutional rule and Senate tradition for confirming judges has been \nmajority vote--and that tradition must be restored. After four years of \ndelay, giving Justice Priscilla Owen an up-or-down vote would be an \nexcellent start.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      May 3, 2005.\n     Re Priscilla Owen.\n\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I write in support of the nomination \n     of Priscilla Owen to the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Fifth Circuit. I write as a law professor who specializes \n     in constitutional law. I write as a pro-choice Texan, who is \n     a political independent and has supported many Democratic \n     candidates. And I write as a citizen who does not want the \n     abortion issue to so dominate the political debate that good \n     and worthy judicial candidates are caught in its cross hairs, \n     no matter where they stand on the issue.\n       Justice Owen deserves to be appointed to the Fifth Circuit. \n     She is a very able jurist in every way that should matter. \n     She is intelligent, measured, and approaches her work with \n     integrity and energy. She is not a judicial activist. She \n     does not legislate from the bench. She does not invent the \n     law. Nothing in her opinions while on the Texas Supreme Court \n     could possibly lead to a contrary conclusion, including her \n     parental notification opinions. I suspect that Priscilla \n     Owen's nomination is being blocked because she is perceived \n     as being anti-choice on the abortion issue.\n       This perception stems, I believe, from a series of opinions \n     issued by the Texas Supreme Court in the summer of 2000 \n     interpreting the Texas statute that requires parental \n     notification prior to a minor having an abortion. The statute \n     also provides for what is called a ''judicial bypass'' to \n     parental notification. Justice Owen wrote several concurring \n     and dissenting opinions during this time. She has been \n     criticized for displaying judicial activism and pursuing an \n     anti-choice agenda in these opinions. This criticism is \n     unfair for two reasons.\n       First, the Texas statute at issue in these cases contains \n     many undefined terms. Further, the statutory text is not \n     artfully drafted. I was a member of the Texas Supreme Court's \n     Advisory Committee that drafted rules in order to help judges \n     when issuing decisions under this parental notification \n     statute. My involvement in this process made it clear to me \n     that in drafting the parental notification statute, the Texas \n     Legislature ducked the hard work of defining essential terms \n     and placed on the Texas courts a real burden to explicate \n     these terms through case law.\n       Moreover, the statute's legislative history is not useful \n     because it provides help to all sides of the debate on \n     parental notification. Several members of the Texas \n     Legislature wanted a very strict parental notification law \n     that would permit only infrequent judicial bypass of this \n     notification requirement. But several members of the Texas \n     Legislature were on the other side of the political debate. \n     These members wanted no parental notification requirement, \n     and if one were imposed, they wanted courts to have the \n     power to bypass the notification requirement easily. The \n     resulting legislation was a product of compromise with a \n     confusing legislative history.\n       In her decisions in these cases, Justice Owen asserts that \n     the Texas Legislature wanted to make a strong statement \n     supporting parental rights. She is not wrong in making these \n     assertions. There is legislative history to support her. \n     Personally, I agree with the majority in these cases. But I \n     understand Justice Owen's position and legal reasoning. It is \n     based on sound and clear principles of statutory \n     construction. Her decisions do not demonstrate judicial \n     activism. She did what good appellate judges do every day. \n     She looked at the language of the statute, the legislative \n     history, and then decided how to interpret the statute to \n     obtain what she believed to be the legislative intent.\n       If this is activism, then any judicial interpretation of a \n     statute's terms is judicial activism. Justice Owen did not \n     invent the legislative history she used to reach her \n     conclusion, just as the majority did not invent their \n     legislative history. We ask our judges to make hard decisions \n     when we give them statutes to interpret that are not well \n     drafted. We cannot fault any of these judges who take on this \n     task so long as they do this work with rigor and integrity. \n     Justice Owen did exactly this.\n       Second, we must be mindful that the decisions for which she \n     is being criticized had to do with abortion law. I do not \n     know if Justice Owen is pro-choice or not, but it does not \n     matter to me. I am pro-choice as I stated before, but I would \n     not want anyone placed on the bench who would look at \n     abortion law\n\n[[Page S5391]]\n\n     decisions only through the lens of being pro-choice. Few \n     categories of judicial decisions are more difficult than \n     those dealing with abortion. A judge has to consider the fact \n     that the fetus is a potential human, and this potential will \n     be ended by an abortion. All judges, including those who are \n     pro-choice, must honor the spiritual beauty that is potential \n     human life and should grieve its loss. But a judge has other \n     important human values to consider in abortion cases. A judge \n     also has to consider whether a woman's independence and \n     rights may well be unconstitutionally compromised by the \n     arbitrary application of the law. All this is further \n     compounded when a minor is involved who is contemplating an \n     abortion. I want judges who will make decisions in the \n     abortion area with a heavy heart and who, therefore, will \n     make sure of the legal reasoning that supports such \n     decisions.\n       I think the members--all the members--of the Texas Supreme \n     Court did exactly this when they reached their decisions in \n     the parental notification cases. I was particularly struck by \n     the eloquence of Justice Owen when she discussed the harm \n     that may come to a minor from having an abortion. She \n     recognized that the abortion decision may haunt a minor for \n     all her life, and her parents should be her primary guides in \n     making this decision. Surely, those of us who are pro-choice \n     have not come to a point where we would punish a judge who \n     considers such harm as an important part of making a decision \n     on parental notification, especially when legislative history \n     supports the fact that members of the Texas Legislature \n     wanted to protect the minor from this harm. As a pro-choice \n     woman, I applaud the seriousness with which Justice Owen \n     looked at this Issue.\n       If I thought Justice Owen was an agenda-driven jurist, I \n     would not support her nomination. Our founders gave us a \n     great gift in our system of checks and balances. The judicial \n     branch is part of that system, and it is imperative that it \n     be respected and seen as acting without bias or predilection, \n     especially since it is not elected. Any agenda-driven \n     jurist--no matter the issue--threatens the honor accorded the \n     courts by the American people. This is not Priscilla Owen. So \n     even though I suspect Justice Owen is more conservative than \n     I am and even though I disagree with some of her rulings, \n     this does not change the reality that she is an extremely \n     well-qualified nominee who should be confirmed.\n       It would be unfair to place Priscilla Owen in the same \n     category with other nominees who, in my opinion, are judicial \n     activists and who I do not support. Some of these other \n     nominees appear to want to dismantle programs and policies \n     based on a political or economic agenda not supported by \n     legal analysis or constitutional history. They appear to want \n     to push their views on the country while sitting on the \n     bench. Priscilla Owen should not be grouped with them. \n     Justice Owen possesses exceptional qualities that have made \n     and will make her a great judge. I strongly urge her \n     confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Linda S. Eads,\n                                       Associate Professor of Law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I see my colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, on the \nfloor, and she intends to speak on the same subject.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I am very pleased my colleague, \nSenator Cornyn, has made a wonderful statement about Priscilla Owen. He \nis one of the few people who has actually served with her, being a \nmember of the Texas Supreme Court with her. So having his insight into \nher as a professional is, I think, very enlightening for the record of \nthis debate. I thank my colleague from Texas, who is one of the few \npeople in the Senate who actually has been a state Supreme Court \njustice. I think that gives him a particular advantage in talking about \nher as a judge with judicial temperament, the demeanor of a judge, and \nher qualities as a judge. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I am going to talk today about Priscilla Owen as a \nperson. I think it is a part of this debate that has never really been \nbrought forth. I am here to support her because she has been a stellar \nrepresentative of the judges in our country, as she has waited more \nthan 4 years since she was nominated to have an up-or-down vote by the \nSenate. We have voted on Priscilla Owen, and she has won confirmation \nfour times in the Senate. But here we are again trying to get a vote \nthat will put her in the office to which she has been nominated and for \nwhich she has received the majority vote.\n  I have heard my colleagues, and some interest groups, use very \nextreme language to describe Priscilla Owen. These statements are \ncoming, in many cases, from people who have never met her and whose \nminds were made up before they ever learned one thing about her. I want \nto spend a few minutes talking about Priscilla Richman Owen, the person \nthat is known to those of us in Texas who have seen her as a \nprofessional.\n  Last month, I was sent an interesting document. It was the newsletter \nof the graduating class of Texas A University, the class of 1953. A \nprominent story had the headline: ``Pat Richman's Legacy.'' It told a \nstory almost nobody in the class knew--that Pat Richman, of Palacious, \nTX, who had died tragically only 2 years after their graduation from \nTexas A and had left a baby daughter, that daughter of their beloved \nclassmate is now at the center of a national controversy.\n  Pat Richman was a leader of the Corps of Cadets at Texas A, first \nsergeant of his company, and later its battalion commander. He was one \nof the stars of the class, one of its most promising leaders. Pat \nRichman entered active duty in the U.S. Army upon graduation and was \nshipped to Korea eight months later, but not before marrying his long-\ntime sweetheart. When the boat left, his wife was pregnant.\n  Pat returned from Korea in May, 1955, having served his country, \nhaving done his duty to our Nation. Priscilla was 7 months old. He had \nnever seen his baby daughter. On the way back across the Pacific, news \ncame to the ship. Researchers, led by Jonas Salk, had created a vaccine \nto combat the scourge of polio. One of Pat's best friends remembers him \nexclaiming: ``This is wonderful. This means my daughter will never have \nto worry about being crippled by that disease.''\n  When Pat arrived back in Texas and was discharged, he accepted a job \nwith the extension service that took him to south Texas. Suddenly, over \na single weekend, he contracted bulbar polio. He was rushed into an \niron lung--and died in a Houston hospital. Priscilla Owen was 10 months \nold.\n  As you would expect, the sudden death of this promising young man \nsent his entire family into shock, especially his wife. Priscilla's \nmother retreated to a family farm in Collegeport, Texas. She stayed \nthere for five years grieving and trying to reassemble her life. \nEventually, she remarried, and the small family moved to what was \nconsidered the big city, Waco, Texas. That is where Priscilla Richman \nOwen grew up and went to school.\n  Priscilla became a top student. She was a class officer. She worked \npart time in high school and college at her stepfather's insurance \nbusiness, and she sent out premium notices and posted payments. During \nsummers, she returned to Collegeport, helping run cattle and work in \nthe rice field. As a teenager, she spent long days during the rice \nharvest driving the auger wagon, taking rice from the wet fields to a \nkiln and drying them.\n  Priscilla Richman started college at the University of Texas at \nAustin. After a year, though, she returned home to Waco to be closer to \nher family, and she enrolled at Baylor University. Her academic record \nwas good, we should say, but it was not perfect. It was not perfect. \nShe got one B-plus--one B-plus in all of her days in college and law \nschool. The rest were A's. Priscilla Owen advanced to law school after \nonly three years of college. She was named editor of the Baylor Law \nReview.\n  She finished college and law school after five years and three \nmonths, and when she took the Texas bar exam in 1977 at age 23, she got \nthe highest score in the State.\n  Priscilla Owen was recruited into the Andrews Kurth law firm, one of \nthe biggest in Houston, as a litigator at a time when women were not \nreally in the courtroom very much. She was highly successful, creating \na statewide reputation in oil and gas litigation. She chaired the \nfirm's recruitment committee and was made a partner of the firm at the \nage of 30.\n  In 1993, when she had been at Andrews Kurth for 17 years, she was \nasked to run for election to the Texas Supreme Court as a Republican. \nAlthough judicial nominees run by party in Texas, she was really \napolitical. She had made donations to judicial candidates in both \nparties just trying to be a contributor and a community leader.\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\n  I am amused when I hear interest groups say that Priscilla Owen is a \npartisan, an ideologue. In 1993, when she was asked to run for the \nSupreme Court of Texas, she could not remember in what primary she had \nvoted. It would have been determined by the judge races at the time and \nwhether there was a race in the Democratic or Republican primaries. She \nwas told it would be difficult to run on the ticket if she had not \nvoted in the primary in the previous election, and she had to go down \nto the courthouse to find out in which primary she had voted. It was \nRepublican, and so she said yes.\n  As it happened, in 1994, when she was running, I was running for \nreelection, and we campaigned together. I invited her to join me on \ncampaign trips. I have to tell you, she is not a rabble-rousing \nspeaker. Priscilla Owen is a judge. She is soft spoken. She is \nscholarly. She is what you would want a judge to be. She managed to win \nwith 53 percent of the vote and became an immediate leader on the Texas \nSupreme Court.\n  She also became a leader in a cause that makes me smile because I \nhear people on the other side of the aisle describing her as if she is \nsome big partisan. She writes articles and lobbies the Texas \nLegislature to do away with partisan election of judges because, as she \nsaid in her articles, she thinks it taints the ability of the court to \nprovide impartial justice.\n  This is actually a controversial position for a judge in our State to \nsay that we should do away with partisan elections, because most of the \nRepublicans in Texas think we should keep partisan elections. But she \nis not a politician, she is a judge--exactly what we would want in a \nperson nominated for the circuit court of appeals.\n  When she was up for reelection in 2000, something happened that \nreally had not happened very often to a Republican running statewide in \nTexas. The Democrats did not even put an opponent against her. She had \na libertarian opponent, and virtually every major newspaper in Texas \nendorsed her. She was returned to office with 84 percent of the vote.\n  We will have a lot of opportunity on the Senate floor to discuss her \ncourt opinions, especially the mischaracterizations of those opinions \nthat various interest groups have made. But I want to share with you \nwhat she does when she is not hearing and deciding cases because I \nbelieve it will shed light on the character of this person whom I do \nnot recognize when I hear her described on this floor by many who have \nnot even met with her.\n  She gave up a highly lucrative private practice a dozen years ago at \nthe height of her earning power to run on a reform platform for our \nState's highest court because there were scandals on the supreme court \nat the time and we were trying to recruit top-quality people to bring \nback the integrity and dignity of our supreme court. So she sought a \nState government salary and gave up her big law firm partner share.\n  The Code of Judicial Ethics restricts her off-bench activities. She \ncannot help raise funds even for her church. But she has devoted \ncountless hours toward helping the less fortunate, those in need, and \nimproving access to the judicial system.\n  For example, Justice Owen is a dog enthusiast and serves on the board \nof Texas Hearing and Service Dogs. This organization rescues dogs from \npounds, provides expensive training for them, and then gives the dogs \nto quadriplegics, paraplegics, and the hearing and sight impaired--\npeople who cannot afford these trained animals on their own. The dogs \nperform all sorts of tasks that allow these disabled people to live \nmore independent lives.\n  She is a founding member of the St. Barnabas Episcopal Mission in \nAustin, Texas. She serves as head of the church's altar guild. And she \nteaches Sunday school to preschool, kindergarten, and grade school \nchildren. On any given Sunday, you can find Justice Owen hopping on one \nleg, reading stories, and helping these children find ways to make the \nright choices in their conduct.\n  Justice Owen has also worked to ensure that all Texas citizens are \nnow provided access to justice. Yesterday at a press conference, a \nformer president of the Texas Bar Association, one of 15 former State \nbar presidents--Republicans and Democrats--who support her, told an \ninteresting story. In the mid-1990s, the Congress sharply reduced \nfunding for the Legal Services Corporation. The Texas legal aid system \nfor the poor, including migrant workers, was in serious jeopardy. \nPriscilla Owen led a committee that persuaded the Texas Legislature to \nprovide millions in additional funding for legal services for the poor. \nThe funding filled gaps caused by the Federal cut to help give legal \nhelp for housing, domestic abuse, and food assistance eligibility to \nthousands of low-income Texans who otherwise would not have been able \nto have that help.\n  Priscilla Owen was the supreme court's representative on the \nMediation Task Force. The group worked countless hours over many months \nto resolve differences between lawyer and non-lawyer mediators. As we \nknow, mediation often provides an effective alternative to expensive, \nfull-blown trials, thus making justice more accessible to people who \ncannot afford expensive lawyers.\n\n  Justice Owen is a member of the Gender Bias Reform Implementation \nCommittee and the Judicial Efficiency Task Force on Staff Diversity. \nShe was instrumental in organizing Family Law 2000 to educate parents \nabout the effect of divorce and to lessen the negative impact on \nchildren.\n  These are not headline-grabbing assignments. There is no public glory \nin this quiet work. I do not see pictures of Justice Owen in the \nnewspapers about all of these activities she has undertaken just to \nmake our State and her community a better place to live. Justice Owen \nis not a particularly public person. In fact, as you may have read in \nthe press last week, members of her church had no idea what she did for \na living until a story appeared about her and this controversy in the \nAustin newspaper.\n  Throughout her four years awaiting a Senate vote, Priscilla Owen has \nnot complained, not in public, not in private. She has sat quietly by \nas people who do not have the faintest idea what she is really like \nhave vilified her, distorted her opinions, and questioned her motives.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have declined \nany opportunity to meet with this lovely person. They have refused to \nsit down and ask her questions, to see if the person who is portrayed \nin the propaganda is really the same person. It is their loss because \nthey are missing the opportunity to know a truly exceptional human \nbeing.\n  Over two years ago, an ordinary Texan named Nancy Lacy, who is \nPriscilla Owen's sister, attended her long-delayed confirmation \nhearings before the Judiciary Committee in Washington. She sat behind \nJustice Owen, and she later gave the Dallas Morning News a summary of \nwhat she saw. She said:\n\n       It was eye opening. . . . It was a hard experience because \n     no matter what she said, they were going to stick with the \n     propaganda. It was obvious. I was hoping they were going to \n     really give her a shot, try to get to know who she really is, \n     ask thoughtful questions.\n       But the information they had was wrong to begin with. I \n     felt sorry for them at times; their staffs didn't do a very \n     good job. It was obvious the special interest groups gave \n     them the information, and they didn't research to see if it \n     was true. The handwriting was on the wall.\n\n  You know, Madam President, it makes you stop and think when real \npeople come before committees in this Congress how they must feel when \nthey are tortured and pricked and badgered the way we often do without \nrealizing that these are good people. They are people willing to serve, \neven if you might disagree with them. They are willing to serve our \ncountry and they have not been treated well. I believe Priscilla Owen, \nespecially, has not been treated well by this Senate.\n  I am going to end with a wrap-up of the beginning of the speech that \nI have made. The Texas A class of 1953 held their annual reunion at a \nhotel in San Antonio last month. Priscilla Richman Owen, known to the \ngroup as Pat Richman's daughter, was their special guest. She was able \nto hear contemporaries of her father tell stories about him that she \nhad never heard before to get a better idea of what he would have been \nlike if he had lived into his seventies instead of dying when she was \n10 months old. It was, by all accounts, a moving experience.\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\n  I hope that when the class of 1953 and the people who went with Pat \nRichman to serve our country in Korea meet again, that Pat Richman's \ndaughter will come back and she will be a member of the Court of \nAppeals, of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States. I \nthink she deserves confirmation.\n  I thank the chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Is it true that the pending business before the Senate is \nthe nomination of Priscilla Owen and other judges?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, in my view there are four pillars that \nare absolutely essential for a free and just society. The first of \nthose pillars is freedom of religion, where people's rights are not \nenhanced or diminished on account of their religious beliefs. The \nsecond pillar is freedom of expression, where people say what they want \nwithout retribution. Third is private ownership of property. And the \nfourth pillar for a free and just society is the rule of law, where \ndisputes are fairly adjudicated and our God-given rights are protected.\n  I believe it is absolutely essential that we have judges on the bench \nat the Federal level and indeed all levels of Government who understand \nthat their role is to adjudicate disputes fairly and honestly, to apply \nto the facts and the evidence of the case the laws that were made by \nelected representatives. We are a representative democracy. Judges \nought to apply the law, not invent the law, not serve as a \nsuperlegislature, not to use their own personal views as to what the \nlaw should be. It is absolutely essential for our country, for the rule \nof law, for the stability one would want for the rule of law, for the \ncredibility and the fair administration of justice, that we have judges \nwho understand this basic principle.\n  When it comes to the appointment of judges and the election of \njudges, in some States they are elected, in some they are appointed. At \nthe Federal level, the way it has been since the beginning of the \nRepublic is the President nominates a man or a woman for a particular \nvacancy. That individual is examined very closely by the Judiciary \nCommittee. They question and try to determine what is their temperament \nand what will they become once they put on a robe. Especially at the \nFederal level it is important because they are given lifetime \nappointments, so there is questioning done as to their scholarship and \ntheir judicial philosophy. That is very important.\n  If that person passes muster in the Judiciary Committee, the \nprocedure, for the past 200 years, was that the nominee get a favorable \nrecommendation. Once in a while they come out of the committee with no \nrecommendation. But ultimately what happens is 100 Senators vote. They \nvote up or down on these nominations. That is our responsibility. It is \nmy responsibility to the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia who \nelected me to confirm judges or deny confirmation--but ultimately vote.\n  What has happened in the last three years, though, is an abrogation \nof this approach and fair consideration of judicial nominees. We have \nseen unprecedented obstruction and a requirement, in effect, of a 60-\nvote margin, particularly for circuit court judges.\n  Wendy Long, the counsel to the Judicial Confirmation Network, \nobserved a month ago:\n\n       It is abundantly clear that the American people are tired \n     of the partisan, political maneuvering and the unwarranted \n     character assassinations against qualified candidates for the \n     Federal bench.\n\n  She observed, and I agree:\n\n       People see through these aggressive negative attacks waged \n     by some individuals and groups on the left and they want it \n     to end. They want Senators to do their jobs and hold a \n     straight up-or-down vote on nominees based on their \n     qualifications, not the baseless negative rhetoric of the \n     left.\n\n  I agree. I think the people of America believe these nominees deserve \na fair vote based on their qualifications. I think my colleagues should \ntake notice.\n  Two of the nominees who have suffered at the hands of the opposition \nare Judges Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown. First, in respect to \nJustice Owen, I listened to the heartfelt views of Senator Hutchison of \nTexas about Justice Owen. Senator Hutchison knows her better than I do, \nbut I strongly support Justice Owen; not just her nomination but her \nconfirmation. In fact, she is arguably one of the best nominees \nPresident Bush has nominated to the appellate court. Even the American \nBar Association agrees. They unanimously rated Judge Owen well \nqualified, their highest rating.\n  Sadly, Justice Owen was the first unanimously approved well-qualified \nABA nominee who was held up a few years ago in the Judiciary Committee.\n  What are some of the reasons why the Democrats are opposing Justice \nOwen? The Number one reason I have heard is it was because of her \ninterpretation of Texas' parental notification statute. The Democrats \nand her opponents have charged Justice Owen is found to be an activist \nin cases involving the interpretation of the Texas parental \nnotification statute that was enacted in 1999.\n  If you want to look at that statute, it says as follows. It requires \nnotice to a parent when a minor woman seeks an abortion, but allows \nexceptions when the trial court judge concludes the minor is mature and \nsufficiently well informed to make the decision without notification of \na parent; that notification would not be in the best interests of the \nminor; or that notification may lead to physical, sexual, or emotional \nabuse of the minor.\n  From reading Justice Owen's opinions with respect to the statute, I \nfound that Justice Owen interpreted the parental notice statute in \nTexas and its exceptions fairly and neutrally, in accord with the plain \nlegislative language, as well as relying on precedent from the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. She expressly relied on U.S. Supreme Court \ncases addressing similar laws to interpret the statutory exceptions. In \nfact, even the Washington Post has opined that:\n\n       While some of Justice Owen's opinions--particularly on \n     matters related to abortion--seem rather aggressive, none \n     seems to us beyond the range of reasonable judicial \n     disagreement.\n\n  That is the Washington Post and I would hardly call the Washington \nPost a bastion of conservative philosophy.\n  Justice Owen's record in these cases is far from that of an activist. \nIn fact, it demonstrates her judicial restraint and her understanding \nof the proper role of an appellate judge. Under the Texas statute, the \nSupreme Court of Texas does not review judicial bypass cases unless the \nbypass has already been rejected at the trial and the intermediate \nappellate court level. In other words, every time Justice Owen voted to \ndeny a judicial bypass, she was simply upholding the rulings of lower \ncourts. That means she upheld the ruling of the trial judge, the only \njudge who actually saw and heard the case, a decision with which at \nleast two out of three appellate court judges agreed.\n  This type of deference is entirely appropriate in cases such as this, \nwhere the determination turns largely on the factual findings and the \ncredibility of the witnesses. The trial judge who actually observes and \nhears the testimony of a plaintiff in a judicial bypass case is best \npositioned to determine the credibility of that evidence and that \nwitness.\n  By deferring to the trial court's judgment on factual questions, \nJustice Owen has appreciated, obviously, the proper role of an \nappellate judge. However, when a trial judge commits a clear error, \nJustice Owen has not hesitated to reverse the judgment and order a \nbypass, or remand for further proceedings, as she has done on three \noccasions.\n  My colleagues, I understand this parental notification issue. As \nGovernor of Virginia, I worked for the passage and signed Virginia's \nrequirement to notify parents if their unwed minor daughter, 17 or \nyounger, is planning an abortion. Opponents of this attacked me and \nsaid things very similar to what you hear about Justice Owen. They said \nwe were trying to tear down Roe v. Wade. That is quite contrary from my \nstandpoint. I want the record\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\nto note that Justice Owen has repeatedly demonstrated adherence to \nSupreme Court precedent, including Roe v. Wade. In fact, almost 80 \npercent of the American people believe a parental notification statute \nfor a minor is reasonable.\n  I asked my staff to look back in my documents to find the speech I \ngave before I signed the bill on March 22, 1997. Here is the reasoning \nthat motivated me and the people of Virginia to finally pass a parental \ninvolvement measure--and I am for parental consents even better, but \nour statute is similar to Texas. I said on the steps of Mr. Jefferson's \ncapital in Richmond, VA:\n\n       Today we are signing legislation affirming the importance \n     and the necessity of a parent's guidance and counsel if their \n     young daughter is facing the trauma of an abortion. Ladies \n     and gentlemen, parents have the right and the responsibility \n     to be involved with important decisions in their young \n     children's lives, especially those that affect their physical \n     and emotional health.\n\n  It was hard to get this bill passed. It was 17 years before it \nactually passed, a true parental notification bill. This was logical \nlaw. When one considers that for a minor to get their ears pierced, one \nneeds parental consent, it makes a great deal of sense to me that if a \nyoung daughter, unwed, 17 or younger, is going through a trauma of \nabortion, a parent ought to be involved. That is what the Texas law was \nabout. When daughters are going through this trauma, parents ought to \nknow as opposed to being in the dark.\n\n  But I want to stress that the Texas statutes and the Virginia \nstatutes are merely parental notice statutes. Those statutes express \nthe views of the people of the State of Texas, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, and indeed the more than 40 States that have some sort of \nparental involvement statutes on their books. In fact, they reflect the \nviews of this country. In fact, they believe what Justice Owen was \ndoing was correct in applying this statute as she did.\n  In summation, Justice Owen is a person with outstanding \nqualifications. She graduated at the top of her class at the Baylor Law \nSchool and subsequently earned the highest score in the State on the \nDecember 1977 Texas Bar Exam. After graduation she practiced commercial \nlitigation for 17 years and became a partner at one of the most \nrespected law firms in the State of Texas. Finally, in 1994, Justice \nOwen was elected to the Texas Supreme Court. In 2000, she won \nreelection by an overwhelming 84 percent of the vote, and was endorsed \nby every major newspaper in Texas.\n  Her support is wide and it is bipartisan, ranging from a number of \nformer Democratic judges on the Supreme Court of Texas to a bipartisan \ngroup of 15 past presidents of the State Bar of Texas.\n  It is important that we act on Justice Owen's nomination because the \nJudicial Conference of the United States has designated the seat \nJustice Owen is nominated for as a judicial emergency. Justice Owen is \nwell qualified to be a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and \nthe longer the opposition keeps holding up this nomination--and this \nhas been going on now for 4 years--the longer average citizens will \nhave to wait to have their cases heard. She deserves a fair up-or-down \nvote.\n  With respect to Justice Janice Rogers Brown, she has been nominated \nby the President to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, where \ncurrently one-fourth of that court is vacant. Her qualifications are \nimpeccable. In the past years I talked about Miguel Estrada, another \noutstanding nominee who had unanimous support, the highest \nrecommendation from the American Bar Association, and who was denied, \nyear after year, the fairness of an up-or-down vote. He was a modern-\nday Horatio Alger story.\n  Justice Brown is an American success story as well. She reflects the \nfact that with hard work and determination you can succeed if you put \nyour mind to it. Her rise from the humble beginnings she had in the \nsegregated South to becoming the first African-American woman to serve \non the highest court in the largest State in the country is truly an \ninspiring American success story.\n  In her 9 years on the California Supreme Court, Justice Brown has \nearned the reputation of being a brilliant and fair jurist who is \ncommitted to the rule of law. That reputation has returned her to the \ncourt when she was supported by 76 percent of California voters, which \nwas the largest margin of any of the four justices up for retention \nthat year. Her reputation has also led the Chief Justice of the \nCalifornia Supreme Court to call on Justice Brown to write the majority \nopinion more times, in 2001 and 2002, than any other justice on the \nSupreme Court of California. When someone gets 76 percent of the vote \nand is called on to write the majority opinion more times than any \nother justice on that court, that means you are well respected and you \nare doing a good job and that you are clearly within the mainstream, \nnot out of the mainstream as is asserted by those who obstruct her \nvote.\n\n  Justice Brown's opponents would like the American people to think she \nis a radical, an ideological extremist in her opposition to government. \nI contend if she was so extreme, why did 76 percent of California \nvoters support her? Sadly, her opponents continually attack her for her \nopposition to government even though she has stated for the record that \nshe does not hate government. If she hates government, why is she a \npart of it?\n  A thorough analysis of her opinions clearly indicate she is capable \nof dissecting her personally held views of her dislike of expansive \ngovernment, from her opinions that seek to apply the law as it exists \nand defer to the legislative judgments on how best to address social \nand economic problems.\n  Justice Brown has been extremely cooperative with the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. She testified for nearly 5 hours at her hearing \nand answered every charge leveled against her. Justice Brown is clearly \nqualified for this job, and her colleagues, Republican and Democrats \nalike, agree.\n  Twelve of her colleagues wrote the following about her:\n\n       We who have worked with her on a daily basis know her to be \n     extremely intelligent, keenly analytical and very hard \n     working. We know she is a jurist who applies the law without \n     favor, without bias and with an even hand.\n\n  Now, isn't that what one would want in a judge? This quote best \nsummarizes my faith that many people, including myself, have in Justice \nBrown. In an October 17, 2003 letter to Senator Hatch, Judge Talmadge \nR. Jones of the Sacramento Superior Court wrote:\n\n       More importantly, the exceptional judicial performance of \n     Justice Brown as a Circuit Judge will readily be apparent to \n     everyone, and a worthy tribute to the confidence placed in \n     her by both the President and the United States Senate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator wants to arrange to go for the next hour \nunder Republican time, that is just fine.\n  I would like to accommodate my friend, but we have a set schedule. We \ncome at different times and places and we have stuck by it. We are \nalready 2 or 3 minutes over, so I have to object.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask Unanimous Consent that I be allowed \n1 minute and add 1 minute to the Democrats' side to sum up.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will accept that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank my colleagues.\n  In summation, Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, and all of the \nPresident's nominees, deserve a fair up-or-down vote.\n  The people all across this country, whether they are down in Cajun \ncounty in Louisiana, whether they are down in Florida, whether they are \nin the Black Hills of South Dakota, or whether they are in the \nShenandoah Valley of Virginia, expect action on judges. As much as \npeople care about less taxation and energy security for this country \nand wanting us to be leaders in innovation, they really expect the \nSenate to act on judges. It is a values issue. It is a good government \nissue. It is a responsibility-in-governing issue that needs to be \naddressed.\n  As I said earlier, there is no reason to filibuster these \nnominations. As Senators we have a responsibility to vote. These \nnominees deserve fair consideration, fair scrutiny, but ultimately we \nhave a responsibility to get off our\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\nhaunches, show the backbone, show the spine, vote yes or vote no, and \nbe responsible to our constituents.\n  I thank you, Madam President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe I now have 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The minority has 61 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. But I have 30 of that, or 31. I yield 3 minutes to my \ncolleague from the State of Washington, and then 1 minute to my \ncolleague from the State of California, and then I will take the \nremaining 26 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for \nyielding me just a few minutes. I was over in my office a few minutes \nago listening to the debate on both sides, and I heard my good friend \nand colleague, the Senator from Texas, talk about her tremendous \nfriendship and passion for the woman whose nomination is in front of \nthe Senate today, Priscilla Owen.\n  I have tremendous respect for Senator Hutchison and all of her \npassion she has put in here. All Senators have been in a position of \nfighting hard for something we believe in, someone we care about. \nSometimes we win, sometimes we have lost.\n  One of the things that was said was that many of the colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle, many of my colleagues have declined any \nopportunity to meet with this lovely person. They have refused to sit \ndown and ask her questions to see if the person that is portrayed and \nthe propaganda is really the same person.\n  Mr. President, I want to set the record straight. I did sit down and \nmeet with Judge Owen yesterday at the request of the Senator from \nTexas. I could not agree more, she was a lovely person. But this is not \na debate about a lovely person. This is a debate about a record on \njudicial decisions and about whether that record merits promoting \nsomeone to a lifetime appointment.\n  I will later today join with my colleagues to give more specifics, \nbut I have sat down with Priscilla Owen. I have asked her questions, \nand I have reviewed the record. This is not about a person. This is \nabout a record. It is about a record that is outside the mainstream on \nparental consent, which we have heard about. But not just that, it is \nabout victims' rights, which any of us can be. It is about workers' \nrights, about a bias about campaign contributions. We will be setting \nthat record straight throughout this debate.\n  It is especially important for all to recognize a record says what \nsomeone will be and what decisions they will make about any one of us \nin this country in the future. That is what I dispute. That is what I \nwill discuss later today when I have more time to outline.\n  We can all agree that lovely people deserve opportunities, but when \nit comes to our courts and when it comes to making decisions about us, \nour family, about women, about children, about rape victims, about \nworkers, the many things that come before a court, a record is what we \nhave to look at and what we have to stand on.\n  I thank my colleague from New York for giving me an opportunity to \nrespond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will rebut something that my friend from \nVirginia, Senator Allen, said about Janice Rogers Brown. He said she \nwas in the mainstream. This is a woman who has served on the California \nSupreme Court that is made up of six Republicans and one Democrat. She \nhas dissented a third of the time because her Republican friends on \nthat court are not radical enough for her. Thirty-one times she stood \nalone on the side of a rapist, on the side of energy companies against \nthe consumers, against women who were seeking to get contraception. It \ngoes on and on--against workers. She said it was fine for Latinos to \nhave racial slurs used against them in the workplace.\n  This is a woman with an inspiring personal life story. But it is what \nshe has done to other people's lives that makes her far out of the \nmainstream.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this debate is not only about Priscilla \nOwen and whether she should become an appellate judge, but it is about \nsomething much more momentous. If the situation in the Senate were not \nso grave, there might be some humor in the fact my strict \nconstructionist Republican friends who daily claim to be against \nactivist judges are, through the nuclear option, engaging in the most \nactivist reading of the Constitution to seat an activist judge on the \nappellate court. That is breathtaking hypocrisy.\n  But we are more profound than that. We are on the precipice of a \ncrisis, a constitutional crisis. The checks and balances which have \nbeen at the core of this Republic are about to be evaporated by the \nnuclear option, the checks and balances which say if you get 51 percent \nof the vote you do not get your way 100 percent of the time. It is \namazing. It is almost a temper tantrum by those on the hard right. They \nwant their way every single time, and they will change the rules, break \nthe rules, misread the Constitution so they will get their way.\n  That is not becoming of the leadership of the Republican side of the \naisle, nor is it becoming of this Republic. That is what we call abuse \nof power.\n  There is, unfortunately, a whiff of extremism in the air. In place \nafter place, the groups that were way out of the mainstream with their \ndisproportionate influence on the White House and the Republican \nleadership in this Senate seem to push people to abuse power.\n  It happened in the Schiavo case, and there was a revulsion in \nAmerica. It happened with threats against judges, both made by some of \nmy colleagues in this body and certainly by some well-known activist \nreligious figures. It has happened on Social Security where there is an \nattempt to undo a very successful government program. And that is why \nthe popularity, the respect that this Republican leadership has in \nAmerica, goes down every day. I know, as chair of the DSCC, because I \nkeep an eye on those things.\n  I make a plea. It is to the seven or eight Republicans on that side \nof the aisle. Every one of them has told us they know the nuclear \noption is wrong. It is a plea to have the courage to stand up for what \nis right. There are many others of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who have already said they know the nuclear option is wrong, \nbut they say they cannot resist the pressure. I understand it. We have \nhad times on the Democratic side where groups on the left extreme have \nhad undue influence. But it is in yours and America's detriment and to \nour party's detriment.\n  We are on the precipice of a constitutional crisis. It rests on the \nshoulders of three or four men or women on the other side of the aisle. \nWe hope we will not fall into the abyss.\n  Judges are now under siege. Our Constitution is under attack. Our \nprecious system of checks and balances is under assault. Some of my \ncolleagues seem to have forgotten we in the Senate have a \nconstitutional role to play, and we will. The Founding Fathers did not \nintend us to march lockstep like lemmings behind every Presidential \nappointee no matter how many times he or she is put before the Senate. \nThe Founding Fathers, whom many of us like to cite, foresaw \ncollaboration between the President and the Senate in the seating of \njudges. The Founding Fathers expected, because of the advice and \nconsent clause, the President would be judicious, that he would talk to \nthe Senate about nominees.\n\n  This President has done none of that. No President has nominated \njudges more through an ideological spectrum than this President. When \nhe asks why he doesn't get cooperation from the Democrat side, he has \nreaped what he has sown. No consultation, no discussion, and nominees \nwho tend to be way over at the extreme.\n  As Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers about the importance of \nthe Senate's role in approving judicial nominees, the possibility of \nrejection of nominees would be a strong motive to use care in \nproposing. But this President, instead of taking that care that the \nFounding Fathers sought, has seen some of his nominees--a handful--\nrejected, and now instead of accepting that as a consequence of no \nconsultation and of nominating extreme judges,\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\nhe seeks to encourage the majority leader and others to change the \nrules in this hallowed institution.\n  Why are we at this crisis point? The bottom line is that no President \nin memory has taken so little care in the proposing of judges.\n  What about abuse of power? I will talk for a moment, before I talk \nabout Priscilla Owen, about the nuclear option. If there ever was \nsomething that signified an abuse of power, a changing of the rules in \nmidstream simply because you could not get your way on every judge, it \nis this nuclear option. There is now a desperate attempt on the other \nside of the aisle not to call it the nuclear option, but it was my \ncolleague from Mississippi, the former majority leader, who gave it \nthat name--with justification. You won't change the name. To call it \nthe constitutional option is hypocrisy. There is nothing in the \nConstitution that talks about filibuster or majority vote when it comes \nto judges in the Senate.\n  It is a nuclear option because it will vaporize whatever is left of \nbipartisanship and comity in the Senate.\n  Now, let me ask a question: How much power does the Republican \nleadership need? How much power is it entitled to? Does a 1- or 2-\npercent point victory in the last election, does a margin of five \nSenators give them the right to get their way all the time and then to \nchange the rules if they can't?\n  The American people are understanding this. There are only three \nbranches of Government. The Republican Party has a tight grip on all \nthree. Republicans control the Presidency, they control the House, they \ncontrol the Senate. They already have control of the courts.\n  As the chart shows, of all of our judicial circuits, only two have \nslight Democratic majorities. The sixth is even. And all the others \nhave Republican majorities.\n  The circuit courts, the courts of last resort, are overwhelmingly \nRepublican already in terms of their appointees. And on the new judges \nthey have been able to fill, they have gotten their way 95 percent of \nthe time. As one of my colleagues said, if your child came home and \nsaid they got a 95 on their test, would you pat them on the head and \nsay ``good job'' or would you say ``go change the rules, cheat until \nyou get 100 percent''? That is what the other side is doing.\n  Ninety-five percent should make this President very happy. And maybe \nit would if he was left to his own devices. But the group of hard-right \nextremists, who seem to have disproportionate sway, are not happy \nunless they have 100 percent.\n  Now, let me talk a little bit about calling it a ``constitutional \noption.'' The other side will, with a straight face, either tomorrow or \nthe next day, invoke our democracy's chief charter, the Constitution, \nin ruling that judicial filibusters are prohibited by the Constitution. \nThere is only one problem. There is nothing in the Constitution that \nsupports the nuclear option. There is nothing in the Constitution that \nrequires a majority vote for every judicial nominee. Republicans know \nthis.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, our majority leader, who got on the floor \nearlier today and said for 214 years there have not been filibusters of \njudges, has a very short memory. I asked him this morning, Did you not, \non March 8, 2000, vote in favor of a filibuster of Richard Paez to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals? Here is a copy of the vote. Voting no: \nFrist, Republican of Tennessee. Did he think it was unconstitutional \nthen? He said on the floor, in answer, Well, some are successful, some \nare not. I have never known the Constitution to say that something is \nunconstitutional if it fails and constitutional if it succeeds. When we \ntalk about attempted murder or robbery or larceny, it is still a crime.\n  So I would like to ask my colleague to answer during this debate, How \ncan he distinguish as unconstitutional our votes to block judges, and \nit is perfectly acceptable, 5 years ago, his vote to block a judge, or \nthe scores of votes by other Republicans in favor of filibusters over \nthe years, including those against Paez and Berzon and Fortas? Were \nthey unconstitutional? I do not think so.\n  Furthermore, have judges never been blocked? All the time. One out of \nevery five Supreme Court nominees did not make it to the Supreme Court. \nThat is part of the tradition of this country. Should the Senate have \nmajority say? No. Should we have the say the majority of the time? No. \nShould we have the say some of the time? Yes. And there is the balance. \nThe more a President consults, the more the President nominates \nmoderate nominees, the more likely his nominees will succeed. Bill \nClinton had a little trouble, but he consulted Orrin Hatch regularly. \nPatrick Leahy has not been consulted by the President at all.\n  Another interesting point. It seems the only people who seem to cling \nto the nuclear option are those in elected office who are susceptible \nto the power and sway of these extremist groups. Conservatives who are \nnot in public office, retired elected officials, commentators, \nhave repeatedly said the nuclear option is not constitutional.\n\n  How about George Will--hardly a liberal--one of the country's most \nforemost commentators. Here is what he said:\n\n       Some conservatives say the Constitution's framers ``knew \n     what supermajorities they wanted''--the Constitution requires \n     various supermajorities, for ratifying treaties, impeachment \n     convictions, etc.; therefore, other supermajority rules are \n     unconstitutional. But it stands--\n\n  Listen to this.\n\n       But it stands conservatism on its head to argue that what \n     the Constitution does not mandate is not permitted.\n\n  Of course. The people who advocate this are the greatest activists of \nall. And it is an unbelievable turnaround, an unbelievable act of \nhypocrisy, that all of a sudden activism, which means interpreting \nthings in the Constitution which are not in the writings of the \nConstitution, is OK when you want to get your way. It is wrong.\n  Now, let me talk a little bit about Priscilla Owen. She is the \nnominee before us today. This is the third time we have considered the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen. Each previous time she got an up-or-down \nvote. She did not get 60, but she sure got an up-or-down vote. \nEveryone's vote was on the record. This was not being done, what was \ndone in the Clinton years, which was not even letting judges come up \nfor a vote. Here we are again.\n  Why are we doing Priscilla Owen again? Because 95 percent is not good \nenough for the President or for the leadership here in the Senate. On \nthe merits, nothing has changed. There is no question she is immoderate \nand that she is a judicial activist. I continue to believe Justice Owen \nwill fail my litmus test, my only litmus test in terms of nominating \njudges; that is, will they interpret law, not make law? Will they not \nimpose their own views and have enough respect for the Constitution and \nthe laws of this land that they will not impose their own views?\n  Well, do not ask me. Ask the people who served with Justice Owen. \nThey believe that she, time and time again, cast aside decades of legal \nreasoning, miles of legislation, to impose her own views. If there was \never a judge who would substitute her own views for the law, it is \nJudge Owen. Her record is a paper trail of case after case where she \nthinks she knows better than hundreds of years of legal tradition.\n  In one case, In re Jane Doe, Judge Owen's dissent came under fire \nfrom her colleagues in the Texas Supreme Court. They referred to her \nlegal approach as an effort to ``usurp the legislative function.'' That \nwas a very conservative court, and they still said Justice Owen put her \nviews ahead of the law.\n  Even more troubling, of course, is what Attorney General Alberto \nGonzales said. He sat on the same court with Judge Owen. He wrote a \nseparate opinion in which he chastised the dissenting judges, including \nJustice Owen, for attempting to make law, not interpret the law. These \nare Judge Gonzales' words, not mine. He said that to construe the law \nas the dissent did ``would be an unconscionable act of judicial \nactivism.'' Those are not my words. Those are the words of the man the \nPresident has appointed as Attorney General.\n  In another case, Montgomery Independent School District v. Davis, the \nmajority ruled in favor of a teacher who had been wrongly dismissed, \nand the majority, including Judge Gonzales, wrote that:\n\n     the dissenting opinion's misconception . . . stems from its \n     disregard--\n\n  Not its misinterpretation; ``its disregard''--\n\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\n\n     of the [rules] the Legislature established.\n\n  In a third case, Texas Department of Transportation v. Able, Justice \nGonzales also took Justice Owen to task for her activism, indicating \nshe had misunderstood the plain intent of the State legislature.\n  The list goes on and on. And there is nothing to indicate she has \nbacked off from her activist tendencies.\n  As extreme as Justice Owen is, Justice Janice Rogers Brown is even \nmore so.\n  The things she has said are unbelievable. She is an activist judge, \nmore committed to advancing her own extreme beliefs and ideas than \nguaranteeing a fair shake for millions of Americans who would be \naffected by her decisions on the DC circuit. There was the Lochner case \nwhich threw out as unconstitutional a law that said bakery workers \ncould not work a certain number of hours. That was a New York law, so \nwe are not even dealing with federalism. It was decided in 1906 or \n1901, close to 100 years ago. If you go to law school, it is called the \nworst Supreme Court decision of the 20th century.\n  She said it was decided correctly. Judge Janice Rogers Brown believes \nthat if an employer wanted to employ a child for 80 hours in awful \nconditions, that would be that employer's constitutional right.\n  Justice Brown's views on economics make Justice Scalia look very \nliberal. She doesn't want to roll back the clock to the 1950s or even \nthe 1930s. She wants to go back to the 1800s. She has been nominated to \nthe most important court in the country when it comes to enforcing \nGovernment laws and rules--environmental, labor--and yet she abhors \nGovernment.\n  Here is what she once wrote:\n\n       Where government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates, and our ability to control our own \n     destiny atrophies.\n\n  Does the kind of person who thinks that way belong on any court of \nappeals, and particularly on the DC Court of Appeals? Absolutely not.\n  For those reasons, the American Bar Association gave her one of the \nlowest rankings any of this administration's circuit court judges have \never received.\n  We stand on the edge. This is an amazing time. I wake up in the \nmorning, sometimes with butterflies in my stomach, thinking the Senate \nmight actually attempt to do this. If there was ever a time where the \npower grab has been so harsh, so real, and so unyielding, it is now. It \nis not simply that we have a disagreement of ideas and we argue \nvehemently. It seems much more that the leadership on the other side \ncan't stand the fact that they don't always get their way and that they \nhave to change the rules to do it.\n  People who hate activist judges are becoming activist themselves in \nthe sense that they read into the Constitution things that are never \nthere. People who say that they respect bipartisanship are going to \nundo whatever is left of bipartisanship here in the Senate.\n  Amazingly enough, with all of the smoke pumped by the radical right's \nmedia machines, talk radio, the American people have a deep \nunderstanding. The only solace I have, as we are on the edge of this \ncrisis and the eve of a great vote in the Senate, is that the American \npeople understand what majority leader Frist is up to. They understand \nthis is a power grab. They understand this is a breaking of the rules. \nThey understand the checks and balances will go by the wayside. What \nwas good enough 4 years ago, votes on filibusters, is not acceptable \ntoday.\n  I believe the nuclear option, even if it should pass on the floor \nthis week or next week, will not stand, that the American people will \nunderstand what is attempting to be done, they will rise up and, \nwhether it is at the polls or just in the court of public opinion, \ncause the nuclear option to be undone.\n  That is the faith I have in the Government we have and the people who \nare governed. But let us not go through that. We will stop progress in \nthe Senate. We will ruin bipartisanship, whatever is left of it, and we \nwill be playing with fire when it comes to the constitutional checks \nand balances that are at the core of our Constitution and our Republic.\n  I will have plenty more to say in the upcoming weeks, but it is a \nmomentous time. I appeal once again to my colleagues: Think of what you \nare doing. Think of its consequences. Maybe we won't have to live with \nthis, the greatest undoing of the Constitution that this Senate has \nseen in decades.\n  I yield the remaining time to my colleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York. He \nserves as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts of the Judiciary Committee, and he more or \nless heads all of the hearings with respect to these judges. He has \ndone an excellent job. He is thorough. As everybody knows, he is a \nsmart and intelligent man. He has made a very eloquent statement. So I \nthank him.\n  Last week I came to the floor and discussed the nuclear option. I \nrecognize today that we are now faced with going down this path. I am \nconcerned that once begun, it is going to be hard, if not impossible, \nto reverse it.\n  I find it ironic in his statement the majority leader said:\n\n       All Members are encouraged to ensure that rhetoric in this \n     debate follows the rules and best traditions of the Senate.\n\n  That is exactly what this side of the aisle is fighting for--the \nrules and the traditions of the Senate. We are standing up to those in \nthe other party who want to break the rules and precedent of the \nSenate. So in reality, it is those of us on this side of the aisle who \nare asking the majority leader to follow all the rules and precedents \nof the Senate, not just the one he supports or any other group of \nMembers might support.\n  Some have argued this debate is too inside baseball or, more \nappropriately perhaps, too inside the beltway and that Americans don't \ncare about it. However, I believe that is wrong. To date, I have \nreceived about 16,000 phone calls, and they are running three to one in \nfavor of opposing the nuclear option. The reason is, people are \nbeginning to understand this debate is built on the very foundation of \nwhy we are here, why our democracy has been successful over 200 years, \nand why our Constitution is looked at as a model across the world in \nemergent democracies.\n  Let me try to explain, once again, why Senators take their role of \nadvise and consent so seriously and what this nuclear option will mean, \nnot only for the Senate and the judiciary but for our Constitution and \nour country.\n  First, Federal judges' decisions impact laws that affect our everyday \nlives--privacy protection, intellectual property, laws of commerce, \ncivil rights, environmental regulations, highway safety, product \nliability, the environment, retirement security. And those are just a \nfew examples. Who we confirm is important because their ability to \ninterpret basic law, based on the Constitution of the United States, is \ncritical to our functioning. Their independence to do that is critical.\n  Secondly, Federal judges enjoy lifetime appointments. They don't come \nand go with administrations, as do Cabinet Secretaries. They cannot be \nremoved from the bench, except in extremely rare circumstances. In \nfact, in our Government's over 200-year history, only 11 Federal judges \nhave been impeached and, of those, only 2 since 1936.\n  Thirdly, Federal judges are meant to be independent. The Founding \nFathers intentionally embedded language in the U.S. Constitution to \nprovide checks and balances. Inherent in our Government is conflict and \ncompromise, and that is the fundamental principle in the structure of \nour Government. The judiciary is meant to be an independent, \nnonpartisan third branch.\n  I think John Adams, in 1776, made it very clear on the point of \nchecks and balances and an independent judiciary, when he said:\n\n       The dignity and stability of government in all its \n     branches, the morals of the people and every blessing of \n     society, depends so much upon on upright and skillful \n     administration of justice, that the judicial power ought to \n     be distinct from both the legislative and executive, and \n     independent upon both, that so it may be a check upon both, \n     as both should be checked upon that . . . [The judges'] minds \n     should not be distracted with jarring interests; they should \n     not be dependent upon any man or body of men.\n\n  Now, that is the clearest statement of intent from our Founding \nFathers, that the judiciary should be and must be independent. That is \nwhat is being\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\neroded with the partisanship and with the nuclear option. The Senate \nwas meant to play an active role in the selection process. The \njudiciary was not solely to be determined by the executive branch. Last \nweek, I described how, in the Constitutional Convention, the first \neffort put forward was actually to have the Senate nominate and appoint \njudges. Then it was later on, with the consideration of others, changed \nto allow the President to nominate. But the explanation in the \nFederalist Papers is all centered around the Senate having the real \npower to confirm, and that power is not a rubberstamp.\n  Because of these fundamental concerns, for centuries there have been \nheated and important debates surrounding judicial nominations. Today, \nrather than utilizing and preserving the natural tension and conflict \nour Constitution created, some in the Republican Party want to \neviscerate and destroy that foundation. Blinded by political passion, \nsome are willing to unravel our Government's fundamental principle of \nchecks and balances to break the rules and discard Senate precedent.\n  The nuclear option, if successful, will turn the Senate into a body \nthat could have its rules broken at any time by a majority of Senators \nunhappy with any position taken by the minority. It begins with \njudicial nominations. Next will be executive appointments, and then \nlegislation.\n  A pocket card being passed around in support of the nuclear option \nstates this:\n\n       The majority continues to support the legislative \n     filibuster.\n\n  Yes, they do today, but what happens when they no longer support it \ntomorrow or the next day? If the nuclear option goes forward and they \nbreak Senate rules and throw out Senate precedent, then any time the \nmajority decides the minority should not have the right to filibuster, \nthe majority can simply break the rules again. Fifty-one votes are not \ntoo hard to get. Get the Vice President, have a close Senate, and you \nget it. That will be new precedent again in the Senate. So once done, \nit is very hard to undo. That is why precedent plays such a big part in \neverything we do because we recognize that once you change it, you open \nthat door for all time. It can never be shut again. If this is allowed \nto happen--if the Republican leadership insists on enforcing the \nnuclear option, the Senate becomes ipso facto the House of \nRepresentatives, where the majority rules supreme and the party in \npower can dominate and control the agenda with absolute power.\n  The Senate is meant to be different. In my talks, I often quote \nGeorge Washington and point out how the Senate and House are often \nreferred to as a cup of coffee and a saucer. The House is a cup of \ncoffee. You drink your coffee out of the cup. If it is too hot, you \npour it into the saucer--the Senate--and you cool it. The Senate is \nreally formed on the basis that no legislation is better than bad \nlegislation and that the debates and disagreements over judicial \nnominations ensures that the Senate confirms the best qualified \ncandidates.\n  So the Senate is meant to be a deliberative body, and the rights of \nthe minority, characterized by the filibuster, are purposely designed \nto be strong. Others describe the Senate as a giant bicycle wheel with \n100 spokes. If one Senator--one spoke--gets out of line, the wheel \nstops and, in fact, that is true. In our rules, any Senator can put a \nhold on a piece of legislation and essentially force the majority to go \nto a cloture vote--essentially, force a 60-vote necessity for any \nmatter to be brought to the floor. This distinguishes us from the \nHouse. Because we know it is such a strong right, we are very reluctant \nand very reserved in the use of that right. This is what has produced \ncomity in this House, the collegiality. Everybody knows if you put a \nhold on something too often, you are going to jeopardize things you \nwant. So what goes around comes around and comity, such as it may be, \nexists.\n  Now, when one party rules all three branches, that party rules \nsupreme. But now one party is saying that supreme rule is not enough, \nthat they must also completely eliminate the ability of the minority to \nhave any voice, any influence, any input.\n  This is not the Senate envisioned by our Founding Fathers. It is not \nthe Senate in which I have been proud to serve for the last 12 years. \nAnd it is not the Senate in which great men and women of both parties \nhave served with distinction for over 200 years. We often refer to the \nlongest filibuster in history, which was conducted by Senator Strom \nThurmond and lasted for more than 24 hours. That was an actual \nfilibuster, standing on the floor and orating, or asking the clerk to \nread the bill, or reading the telephone directory, and doing it hour \nafter hour after hour, sending the message that you are stopping \ndebate, that on the great wheel of comity one spoke is sticking out and \nstopping it. People listen because, unlike the House, debate and \ndiscussion has been important. It has been fundamental in our being, \nand our ability to stand up on the floor of the Senate and discuss \nissues of import before the world on television, for the Congressional \nRecord, for all of the people who watch on closed circuit television, \nbecomes a signal, I think, on Capitol Hill.\n\n  When Democrats were in the White House--I will talk for a moment on \nSenate procedure--Republicans used the filibuster and other procedural \ndelays to deny judicial nominees an up-or-down vote. So denying a \njudicial nominee an up-or-down vote is nothing new. It has been done \nover and over and over again. I speak as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee for 12 years, and I have seen it done over and over and over \nagain. So why suddenly is an up-or-down vote now the be all and end \nall?\n  Last administration, Republicans used the practice of blue slips or \nan anonymous hold, which I have just described, to allow a single \nSenator--not 41 Senators, but 1--to prevent a nomination from receiving \na vote in the Judiciary Committee, a 60-vote cloture vote on the floor, \nor an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate. This was a filibuster \nof one, and it can still take place within the Judiciary Committee.\n  The fact is, more than 60 judicial nominees suffered this fate during \nthe last administration. In other words, over 60 Clinton judges were \nfilibustered successfully by one Senator, often anonymous, often in \nsecret, no debate as to why. It was an effective blackball.\n  This is not tit-for-tat policy, but it is important to recall that \nSenate rules have been used throughout our history by both parties to \nimplement a strong Senate role and minority rights, even the right of \none Senator to block a nomination.\n  Republicans have argued that the nominations they blocked are \ndifferent because in the end, some, such as Richard Paez and Marsha \nBerzon, were confirmed. This ignores that it took over 4 years to \nconfirm both of them because of blue slips and holds.\n  In addition, if a party attempts to filibuster a nomination and a \nnominee is eventually confirmed, that does not mean it is not a \nfilibuster. Failure does not undo the effort. I pointed out earlier \nwhere, in 1881, President Hayes nominated a gentleman to the Supreme \nCourt. That was successfully filibustered throughout President Hayes' \nterm. When President Garfield then came into office, he renominated the \nindividual, and the Senate then confirmed that individual. But that \ndoes not negate the filibuster. It was the first recorded act of a \nfilibuster of a judicial nominee, and it, in fact, took place and was \nsuccessful for the length of President Hayes' term.\n  More importantly, while some of Clinton's nominations eventually \nbroke through the Republican pocket filibuster, 61 of President \nClinton's judicial nominations were not confirmed because of Republican \nopposition. Not only were they not confirmed, they were not given a \ncommittee vote in Judiciary. They were not given a cloture vote here or \nan up-or-down vote on the floor. So these are really crocodile tears.\n  Republicans have also argued that the reason the nuclear option is \nneeded now is because the Clinton nominees were not defeated by a \ncloture vote. In essence, because different procedural rules were used \nto defeat a nominee, it does not count.\n  On its face, this argument is absurd. To the nominee, whatever rule \nwas used, their confirmation failed and the result is the same: They \ndid not get a\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\nvote, and they are not sitting on the Federal bench.\n  As I said, 61 Clinton nominees, in the time I have sat on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee--so I have seen this firsthand--were pocket \nfilibustered by as little as one Senator in secret and, therefore, \nprovided no information about why their nomination was blocked. There \nwas no opportunity to address any concern or criticism about their \nrecord and qualifications.\n  Just to straighten out the record because I debated a Senator \nyesterday: 23 of these were circuit court nominees and 38 were district \ncourt nominees. In addition, unlike what some have argued, this \npractice was implemented throughout the Clinton administration when \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, not just in the last year or final \nmonths of the tenure of the President.\n  The reason I mention this is because there is sort of an informal \npractice in the Judiciary Committee--it is called the Thurmond rule--\nthat when a nominee is nominated in the fall of year of a Presidential \nelection, that nominee does not generally get heard. But I am not only \ntalking about nominees at the tail end; I am talking about nominees who \nwere nominated in each of the 6 years of the Clinton Administration in \nwhich the Republican party controlled the Senate.\n  The following is a list of President Clinton's judicial nominees who \nwere blocked:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Date nomination\n             Nominees               Court nominated to   first submitted\n                                                            to Senate\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Circuit Court\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCharles R.

Mr. President, the overwhelming question I have--and \nlet me ask everybody here--is the public interest better served by 41 \nSenators stating on the floor of the Senate why they are filibustering \na nominee, as Senator Schumer did, as others have done earlier, and the \nreasons hang out in public? Everybody can hear the reasons; they can be \nrefuted. There are reasons given with specificity. They are based on \nopinions, they are based on speeches, they are based on writings, and \nthey are discussed right on the floor in public. Or is the public \ninterest better served by one Senator, in secret, putting a hold on a \nnominee or blue-slipping the nominee and preventing that nominee from \never having a hearing, from ever having a markup, from ever having a \nvote in the Senate, and it is all done on the QT, no discussion, no \ndebate. It is, as I said, the epitome of blackballs that exists in the \nSenate.\n  All during the Clinton years, Republicans did not argue that checks \nand balances had gone too far. In fact, the opposite occurred. \nRepublicans went to the floor to defend their right to block \nnominations. Senator Hatch is a good friend of mine, but nonetheless \nhere is his 1994 statement about the filibuster:\n\n       It is one of the few tools that the minority has to protect \n     itself and those the minority represents.\n\n  That was on judges. That was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  In 1996, Senator Lott, then the leader, stated:\n\n       The reason for the lack of action on the backlog of Clinton \n     nominations--\n\n  That is an admission there were backlogs of Clinton nominations--\n\n     was his steadily ringing office phones saying ``No more \n     Clinton Federal judges.''\n\n  Also, in 1996, Senator Craig said:\n\n       There is a general feeling that no more nominations should \n     move. I think you'll see a progressive shutdown.\n\n  Now there are crocodile tears and people are upset because 41 of us--\nnot 1--41 want to debate in public. We have voted no on cloture because \nwe believe our views are strong enough, that our rationale is strong \nenough and substantive enough to face public scrutiny and warrant an \nextended debate in the true tradition of the Senate.\n  We may not all agree. Our country is based on a foundation that \nprotects the freedom to disagree, to debate, to require \ncompromise. Neither party will always be right when it comes to the \nbest policies for our country, and neither party will always be in \npower. So, as I said initially, it is important to put this political \nposturing in context. I believe filibusters should be far apart and \nfew, and should be reserved for the rare instances for judicial \nnominations that raise significant concerns.\n\n  I voted against cloture in my Senate career of 12 years on only 11 \njudicial nominations and voted to confirm 573. I believe judicial \nnominees must be treated fairly and evenhandedly. I also believe it is \nthe duty of the Senate to raise concerns or objections when there are \nlegitimate issues that need to be discussed.\n  Discharging our obligation to advise and consent is not an easy task, \nespecially when it involves making a choice to oppose a nomination. As \nI discussed earlier, I strongly believe the use of the blue slip and \nanonymous holds has been abused in previous Congresses. During the \nreorganization of the Senate in 2000, Senators Daschle and Leahy worked \nto make the process more fair and public. At that time, a blue slip was \nno longer allowed to be anonymous and instead became a public document. \nThis refining forced Senators opposed to a nominee to be held \naccountable for their positions. They could not hide behind a cloak of \nsecrecy. This step also wiped out many of the hurdles that had been \nused to defeat nominations, so many of the tools used by Republicans in \nthe past, and referred to as a way to draw distinctions with a public \ncloture vote, are no longer available.\n  Today the blue slip is still used. However, with each chairmanship, \nits effectiveness and its role has been modified. Each chair of the \nJudiciary Committee says they are going to adhere to the blue slip in a \ndifferent way. That is the anomaly in this process. One person in \nJudiciary decides what the rules are going to be. This is what we ought \nto change.\n  Recently, Senator Specter, for example, has indicated he will honor \nnegative blue slips. It is a piece of paper that Senators from a \nnominee's home state send in. If you do not send them in or if you say \nyou do not favor the nominee, that nominee does not proceed. So Senator \nSpecter has said he will honor negative blue slips when they are \napplied to district court nominees and that even one negative blue slip \nwill be considered dispositive. However, when it comes to circuit \ncourt, blue slips will be given great weight but will not be \ndispositive on a nomination.\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\n  Given that the meaning and effect of a blue slip has changed, and I \nsuspect will continue to change depending on which party controls the \nSenate and which party is in the White House, I believe the blue slip \nprocess should be eliminated altogether. In reality, its usefulness has \nalready been lost.\n  Instead, I have long supported the creation of a specific timeline \nfor how judicial nominations should be considered. Three months after \nnominations are submitted by the President, they should be given a \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee. In 6 months they should be given a \nvote in the committee. And in 9 months, floor action should be taken on \nthe nomination. But the filibuster should remain the basic right of \nthis institution. I believe implementing this timeframe would go a long \nway toward alleviating the tension that has plagued the consideration \nof judicial nominees.\n  I would like to spend a few moments, since I believe I have the time, \non one nominee. It is the nominee who comes from California. Of course \nI represent California. This is very hard for me to do, but I believe \nthis nominee clearly indicates the legitimacy of our position. I would \nlike to turn to the President's choice for a seat on the most powerful \nappellate court in the Nation, the DC Circuit, Janice Rogers Brown.\n  In the case of this particular nominee, out of all the nominations, \nJustice Brown, in my view, is the clearest cut. She has given numerous \nspeeches over the years that express an extreme ideology, I believe an \nout-of-the-mainstream ideology. In those speeches she has used stark \nhyperbole, startlingly vitriolic language. That has been surprising, \nespecially for a judge, let alone a State Supreme Court justice from my \nState. But statements alone would not be enough for me to oppose her \nnomination, because there are many nominees whose opinions I have \nstrongly disagreed with and voted to confirm. Jeffrey Sutton and Thomas \nGriffith immediately come to mind.\n  Rather, my concern is that these views expressed in Justice Brown's \nspeeches also drive her legal decisionmaking. On far too many occasions \nshe has issued legal opinions based on her personal political beliefs, \nrather than existing legal precedent. Let me give some instances.\n  In a speech to the Institute for Justice on August 12, 2000, Justice \nBrown stated this:\n\n       Today, senior citizens blithely cannibalize their \n     grandchildren because they have a right to get as much free \n     stuff as the political system will permit them to extract.\n\n  From the context of the speech, it is clear Justice Brown is \nreferring to Social Security and Medicare, two essential programs that \nprotect individuals in their retirement, and two programs that today's \nsenior citizens have been contributing to financially for decades.\n  Unfortunately, her legal decisions reflect the same visceral \nhostility toward the rights of America's seniors. Let me give you an \nexample.\n  In Stevenson v. Superior Court, Justice Brown wrote a dissenting \nopinion that would have changed California law to make it more \ndifficult for senior citizens to demonstrate age discrimination. A \nRepublican justice, writing for the majority of the California Supreme \nCourt, criticized Justice Brown's opinion and he stated this:\n\n       The dissent's real quarrel is not with our holding in this \n     case, [meaning the majority] but with this court's previous \n     decision . . . and even more fundamentally with the \n     legislature itself. . . . The dissent [of Justice Brown] \n     refuses to accept and scarcely acknowledges these holdings.\n\n  ``These holdings'' being the law of the State of California.\n  Justice Brown's open disdain toward Government is also disturbing, \nespecially in light of her nomination to the District of Columbia \nCircuit. Let me explain why this is so important. The DC Circuit is the \nmost prestigious and powerful appellate court below the Supreme Court \nbecause of its exclusive jurisdiction over critical Federal \nconstitutional rights and Government regulations. Given this exclusive \nrole, the judges serving on this court play a special role in \nevaluating Government actions.\n  Janice Brown's statements on the Federal Government raise serious \nconcerns about how she would perform on the DC Circuit if given a \nlifetime position. Let me illustrate.\n  At a 2000 Federalist Society event, Justice Brown stated:\n\n       Where government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates, and our ability to control our own \n     destiny atrophies. The result is: families under siege, war \n     in the streets, unapologetic expropriation of property, the \n     precipitous decline of the rule of law, the rapid rise of \n     corruption, the loss of civility and the triumph of deceit. \n     The result is a debased, debauched culture which finds moral \n     depravity entertaining and virtue contemptible.\n\n  We asked her about these statements in the Judiciary Committee. Her \nanswer was, ``Well, I write my own speeches.'' So these are her words. \nThese are her words, of somebody going on the DC Circuit with enormous \nhostility to virtually anything the Government would do, and saying the \nGovernment is responsible for the loss of civility, the triumph of \ndeceit.\n\n  Justice Brown's statements and actions demonstrate that she is an \nactivist judge with an unfortunate tendency to replace the law as \nwritten with her own extreme personal beliefs. This is not the kind of \njudge who should be on the nation's second most powerful court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will yield the floor, but if an opportunity comes \nup, I will ask to recover it again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are debating in the Senate today a \nvery important issue. It is an issue that we must deal with and one \nthat may take days of debate.\n  For a series of reasons, it has become more and more of interest to \nthe American people the nature and quality of judges that we appoint. \nThat has resulted in a serious concern about the role of courts, the \ncritical doctrine of separation of powers; that is, what judges do and \nwhat they should do and what their prerogatives are and what their \nresponsibilities are as a judge.\n  President Bush, in his campaigns both times, made absolutely clear \nthat he believed the judge should be a neutral arbiter, a fair referee \nand, as such, not have an agenda when they go on the bench. He has \nappointed and nominated judges that share that view. And they have been \ndoing splendid jobs--the judges that have been confirmed. He has not \nasked that they promote his agenda, his politics, his view of the \nsocial policies of America, he has simply asked that they do the jobs \nthey were appointed to do--that they serve in the judicial branch of \nour government.\n  It is true, however, that the American people have seen some things \nin the judicial branch that have troubled them. They have seen, for a \nnumber of years, two judges on the Supreme Court consistently dissent \nin death penalty cases. They don't like the death penalty so they \ndissent in cases that uphold its use. They declare, in every case they \nconsider, that the death penalty cruel and unusual, and therefore, \nprohibited by the Constitution of the United States. But they failed to \nnote that in that very same Constitution there are eight or more \nreferences to capital crimes, permitting the taking of a person's life \nwith due process of law, there are multiple references to the death \npenalty in the Constitution and I think it is important to note that \nevery State, at the time the Constitution was adopted, had a death \npenalty and virtually every country had one as well.\n  Therefore, it is inconceivable to me how a judge who would follow his \noath to obey the commands of the Constitution could ever interpret the \nphrase ``cruel and unusual''--certainly it was not unusual if it was \nthe law of every State in the Nation at that time and the Federal \nGovernment had laws supporting the death penalty. So we know that some \njudges continue to conclude that the death penalty is cruel and \nunusual. That is activism. They have allowed their personal opposition \nto the death penalty to solely drive them, and they have manipulated \nthe words of the Constitution to make it say something it plainly does \nnot say.\n  Now we are seeing cases of judicial activism on a whole raft of \nissues. We have seen the Pledge of Allegiance struck down by a Federal \ncourt. We have seen the erosion of rights of property protected by the \nfifth amendment that says you cannot take someone's property without \npaying them for it. We have had courts redefine the meaning of marriage \nunder the guise of interpreting a constitutional phrase that absolutely \nwas never ever intended to\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\naffect the definition of marriage. It was probably the last thing in \ntheir minds when the people ratified the Constitution.\n  We have had judges cite as authority proceedings in the European \nUnion, but it is our Constitution we ratified. It is our Constitution, \nnot some other. How can they define and make rulings based on opinions \nin Europe when they go against the very document that orchestrates and \norganizes our Government?\n  We have consent decrees in prisons and schools and mental health \nhospitals where Federal judges dominate whole Government agencies and \nstate legislatures for 30 years. We have had judges say you cannot have \na Christmas display because it violates the first amendment. And, we \nknow that jackpot verdicts are all too common.\n  The American people are concerned about these things. These things \nare bigger than Republican and Democrat, they go to the heart of the \nseparation of powers doctrine. President Bush was honest and direct, \nand many of the people he has nominated have had an objection to their \nnomination because, on occasion, they have written something or have \nmade a speech that indicates they share the view that a judge should \nshow restraint and not promote their own personal agenda from the \nbench.\n  That is the way it has been for 200 years. I remember when this \ndebate got kicked off, I saw ``Meet the Press,'' when Hodding Carter \nwas on it, and used to be on the staff of President Carter, and he \nsaid: Well, I have to admit we liberals are at the point we are asking \nthe courts to do for us that which we can no longer win at the ballot \nbox.\n  Too often that is what this is about. A lot of these issues that are \nbeing decided by courts and judges would never ever prevail at the \nballot box. They would not be passed by the Congress.\n  People say they are nice folks. They are smart people. If you \ncriticize a judge, you are doing something that is highly improper; you \nshould never criticize a judge. That is not the history of the \nRepublic. What the American people need to understand, I cannot \nemphasize this too much, the principle on these issues I have just \ntalked about is very deep. What we are suggesting is, and what is being \nimplicated here is, that unelected judges who are given a lifetime \nappointment by which they are independent and unaccountable to the \npublic, should not set social and political policy in this country.\n\n  Is that too much to ask? We have seen too much of that. It is being \ntaught in the law schools that the good judges are the ones that step \nout in a bold way and move the law forward to higher realms, they would \nsay. But have they forgotten that the people, if they wish to have a \ndeath penalty and it is consistent with a Constitution, their opinion \nmakes little difference? They have one vote in the election, as \neveryone else does. If their views do not get ratified, so what?\n  Some people say: Well, the courts had to act because the legislature \ndid not act. But when the legislature does not act, that is an act. \nThat is a decision, a decision not to change an existing law, and it \ndeserves respect.\n  Our judges are people who take their office on trust. We have some \nexceedingly fine ones and most do show discipline, but I do believe \nthis is a point in our history when the American people and the \nCongress need to decide together what we expect out of judges. Do we \nexpect them to be the avant-garde of social and political policy? Or do \nwe expect them to be faithful and true arbiters of legitimate disputes \nto interpret the law as they find it?\n  There is only one way, consistent with our Constitution and our \nhistory and our body politic, for our system to continue to work, and \nthat is that judges show restraint. That is what this debate is about. \nIt is not about Republicans. It is not about Democrats or such things.\n  One of the things that has occurred in this confirmation process, for \nnow nearly 20 years, has been the influence of outside hard-left \nactivist groups who have a clear agenda with regard to the Judiciary. \nThey know exactly what they want from the Judiciary, and they are \ndetermined to get it. They have banded together. They build dossiers on \nnominees. They systematically take out of context their comments and \ntheir statements and their positions. They release that to the public. \nFrequently, they have support from the major liberal news organizations \nin the country to the sensational charges they make and they sully the \nreputations of nominees who are good and fine nominees.\n  It is a very difficult to turn the tide on that. It is unfair. We \nwill talk about that some today. But we have to recognize this.\n  If I criticize my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I would \nsay this: Those people were not elected to the Senate. They have not \ntaken an oath to advise and consent and to do so honestly and with \nintellectual integrity. They did not do that. They are advocates. They \nraise money by trying to demonstrate to those who would contribute to \nthem that President Bush's nominees are extreme and out of the \nmainstream. They should not be calling the shots here. Frankly, my view \nis, too often they have. Too often they have taken nominees, and they \nhave smeared them up, muddied them up, and then our Senators have not \nstepped back and given them a fair shake. I do not mean that personally \nto my colleagues, but I think that is a fair observation. I believe too \noften that has occurred.\n  Two of the things that are typical of that can be seen in an ad now \nbeing run on television against Priscilla Owen--I don't know in how \nmany States--by People For the American Way. Let me remind you that \nJustice Priscilla Owen, from Texas, was given the highest possible \nrating by the American Bar Association. She finished at the top of her \nclass in law school. She made the highest possible score on the Texas \nbar exam. A lot of people take that exam. That is a big deal, in my \nopinion. She got 84 percent of the vote in her reelection. She had the \nsupport of every major newspaper in Texas, and many of them are not \nRepublican newspapers. She is a superb, magnificent nominee.\n  However, the People for the American Way TV ad wants you to believe \nthat she is an activist judge, even though we know that for her whole \ncareer her whole philosophy of law is that judges should follow the law \nand not legislate from the bench. That is her deepest abiding \nprinciple--be faithful to it and not depart from it, whether or not she \nagrees with it.\n  The People for the American Way cites as proof of her activism a \nfellow justice on that court, now the Attorney General of the United \nStates of America, Alberto Gonzales, who they say accused her of being \nan activist in an opinion he wrote. So they declare: Ah, she is an \nactivist. The President's own Attorney General said she is an activist. \nThat is simply not so.\n  Let me just talk about the facts of this opinion for a minute. We \nneed to drive this home because so far as I can tell that is the only \ncharge that has been made against her that amounts to anything at all \nthat has ever been consistently raised by those who oppose her \nnomination.\n  In the opinion the People for the American Way cites as their \nevidence, what happened was this--the Texas Supreme Court was \nevaluating the meaning of the Texas parental notification law on \nabortion for a teenager or a minor. Minors in Texas have to notify at \nleast one of their parents before they undergo the significant medical \nprocedure of an abortion, unless there is a bypass to the parental \nnotification requirement granted by a court. And minors are allowed to \nask for that judicial bypass for many reasons. This process allows them \nto set forth the reasons and not have to tell their parents that they \nare going to have an abortion.\n  Well, in this circumstance, a trial judge heard the case. He saw the \nchild who wanted to bypass and not tell her parents, and he concluded \nthat she did not meet the statutory requirements and should tell her \nparents. Lets be clear--the Texas parental notification requirement \ndoes not give the parents veto power, it does not mean they have to \n``consent.'' She could still have the abortion, just as long as she \ntold them, ``notified'' them, of what she was about to do. The reason \nto have this kind of law is simple--there is a serious concern that if \nyou cannot give a child an aspirin at school without parental \npermission, surely we ought not to be having doctors perform abortions \non children without at least having the parents notified of it.\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\n  That is what Texas voted to have as their law. The Supreme Court has \nupheld parental notification statuses as constitutional. So, in Texas, \nthere became a fuss over the meaning of the law and Justice Owen \nconcluded that the trial judge was correct in their decision that the \ngirl did not meet the requirements for parental notification and should \nnotify her parents before the abortion. Justice Owen dissented from the \nmain opinion and concluded that the trial judge was correct and the \nchild should notify her mama or daddy that she was going to have an \nabortion. Whereas, Judge Gonzales's opinion said that he had studied \nthe Texas statute and I have concluded that--it is not perfectly clear, \nbut I have concluded the legislature intended A and B. Therefore, if I \ndon't rule the other way, since I have concluded the legislature \nintended A and B, then I will be an activist even though I personally \nhate to see this child not tell her parents.\n  So, to help us clear up this matter, he came before the Judiciary \nCommittee, of which I am a member, and testified about this case. \nSenator Brownback, who is in the Chamber, asked him about it as \nAttorney General. And he was rock solid. He has written a letter saying \nhe was not referring to Justice Owen when he made that comment in his \nopinion about activism; certainly, did not mean to. He was referring to \nhis own self, that if he had concluded that the legislature meant these \nthings, then he was compelled to rule against the trial judge or he \nwould be labeling himself an activist. Justice Owen did not agree, she \nhad not concluded the same things about the legislation that Judge \nGonzalez had.\n  An SMU law professor wrote a beautiful letter on behalf of Justice \nOwen. She said:\n\n       I am pro-choice, absolutely, but I believe she followed the \n     law carefully. She was a scholar. She thought it through like \n     a judge should think it through, and, absolutely, this is not \n     evidence of activism and it, absolutely, should not be held \n     against her.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to know what the time agreement is and where we \nare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator has 43\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see Senator Brownback is in the \nChamber. I will finish within my 30 minutes. I believe he will be \nspeaking in the next 30 minutes; is that correct--or in that 40 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is an appropriate division of time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wish to share a little bit about Justice Janice \nRogers Brown. She grew up not too far from where I grew up in rural \nAlabama, in Greenville, AL. She, as a young African-American child, had \nparents who were sharecroppers. They had a tough life. She ended up \nmoving, as a teenager, to California, where she went through the school \nsystem there, did exceedingly well, went to UCLA Law School and \nachieved great success there, and eventually became a judge. It is \nterrific, the story of her life and her achievements.\n  She has served for 9 years now on the California Supreme Court. She \ndoes, every day on the California Supreme Court, the same kind of \nthings which President Bush has nominated her to do on the Court of \nAppeals here in DC. As such, she reviews the transcripts of the trials \nof cases conducted by trial judges under them to see if there was an \nerror in the conduct of that trial. The California Supreme Court does \nnot conduct trials. They do not make opinions. They review trials below \nthem to make sure they were conducted properly, that the judge followed \nthe law and did not commit errors.\n  I think she has been trained exceedingly well. As a member of the \nCalifornia Supreme Court she reads briefs. She listens to arguments by \ncounsel, and then writes opinions as they make those judgments. Those \nopinions should be unbiased and I believe hers have been and will \ncontinue to be. We need judges who write well and follow the law and \nrule consistent with the law. If you look at Justice Brown's career, I \ndo not think anyone can contend she has performed other than admirably \non the bench. She has written beautifully and thoughtfully. She \ngraduated from UCLA, one of the Nation's finest law schools.\n  In February of 2004, last year, the alumni of that not so \nconservative law school presented Justice Brown with an award for \npublic service. In recognizing her, her fellow UCLA alumni--the people \nwho know her--they did not condemn her for being some extremist. They \nsaid this:\n\n       Janice Rogers Brown is a role model for those born to \n     prejudice and disadvantage, and she has overcome adversity \n     and obstacles and, since 1996, has served as a member of the \n     California Supreme Court. The professional training she \n     received at UCLA Law School has permitted her, even now, when \n     decades remain to further enhance her career, to have already \n     a profound and revitalizing impact upon the integrity of \n     American jurisprudence.\n\n  I will repeat that:\n\n       She has even now been found to have already a profound and \n     revitalizing impact upon the integrity of American \n     jurisprudence.\n\n  I could not agree more. They go on to say this:\n\n       Despite her incredible intellect, work ethic, \n     determination, and resultant accomplishments, she remains \n     humble and approachable.\n\n  That is important in a judge. A lot of judges get to the point they \nthink they were anointed and not appointed, but she has been on the \nbench for 9 years, and they still say she keeps her perspective and \nremains approachable to all. That is not the Janice Rogers Brown you \nwill be hearing about from those who want to tar and feather her.\n  I will take the word of the people who know her, who have actually \nstudied her record, over the rhetoric of the interest groups who are \nnot the least bit interested in the integrity of the judiciary. They \nare interested in their agenda. From my observation, one of their \nguiding principles is that the ends justify the means.\n  After law school, Justice Brown served as a deputy legislative \ncounsel in California for 2 years. She then spent 8 years as a deputy \nattorney general in the office of the California Attorney General, \nwhere she wrote briefs and participated in oral arguments before \nappellate courts on behalf of the State's criminal appeals. So she \nlearned a lot about criminal law, and she prosecuted criminal cases in \ncourt and litigated a variety of civil issues. Her keen intellect and \nwork ethic made her a rising star on the California legal scene.\n  In 1994, then-Governor Pete Wilson tapped her as his legal affairs \nsecretary. Governor Pete Wilson came to Washington last week. For the \nmost part, he was here to affirm Justice Brown. He thinks she is a \nmagnificent nominee. He absolutely supports her. He said he couldn't be \nmore proud of her service on the court and that it was outrageous what \nthey were saying about this fine nominee's record.\n  She was then nominated and confirmed as an associate justice on the \nCalifornia Third District Court of Appeals. And in 1996, as a result of \nher superior performance on the appellate court, Governor Wilson \nelevated her to the California Supreme Court.\n  I ask to be notified after 30 minutes have been consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Since she was appointed to the Supreme Court, a couple \nthings have happened that provide confidence in her good performance.\n  During the 1998 election, she was on the ballot and had to win the \nmajority of the vote to stay on the bench. The people of California, \nwho didn't vote for President Bush and certainly are not a rightwing \nelectorate, voted to keep Justice Janice Rogers Brown on the court with \n76 percent of the vote. That is a big vote by any standard. Probably 20 \npercent of the people in California vote against anybody on the ballot. \nOther judges were on the ballot. She got a higher percentage of the \nvote than any of the other four judges on the ballot. That is an \naffirmation by the people of California.\n  In 2002, for example, Justice Brown's colleagues on the supreme court \nrelied on her to write the majority opinion for the court more times \nthan any other justice. What happens on a court, such as a supreme \ncourt, once the court votes on how a case should be decided, they \nappoint a member of the court to write the opinion. If you write the \nopinion, you have to be on the majority side. If some don't agree and \nthe majority agrees, then somebody writes the majority opinion for the \ncourt.\n  We have had the suggestion that this justice of the California \nSupreme Court\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\nis somehow out of the legal mainstream, but in 2002, more than any \nother justice on the court, she was called on to write the majority \nopinion. That speaks volumes for the fact that she is not out of the \nmainstream. And there are few courts in the United States more liberal \nthan the California Supreme Court.\n\n  Professor Gerald Ullman, who is a law professor in California, wrote \na beautiful letter supporting her. His statement sums up what we ought \nto think about as we consider this nomination. He said:\n\n       I don't always agree with her opinions.\n\n  And then he said this:\n\n       I have come to greatly admire her independence, her \n     tenacity, her intellect, and her wit. It is time to refocus \n     the judicial confirmation process on the personal qualities \n     of the candidates, rather than the hot button issues of the \n     past. We have no way of predicting where the hot buttons will \n     be in the years to come, and our goal should be to have \n     judges in place with a reverence for our Constitution who \n     will approach these issues with independence, an open mind, \n     and a lot of commonsense, a willingness to work hard, and an \n     ability to communicate clearly and effectively. Janice Rogers \n     Brown has demonstrated all these qualities in abundance.\n\n  Her colleagues support her. A bipartisan group of Justice Brown's \nformer judicial colleagues, including all of her colleagues on the \ncourt of appeals for the Third Circuit in California, have written in \nsupport of her nomination. Twelve current and former colleagues wrote a \nstrong letter to the committee stating:\n\n       Much has been written about Justice Brown's humble \n     beginnings, and the story of her rise to the California \n     Supreme Court is truly compelling. But that alone would not \n     be enough to gain our endorsement for a seat on the Federal \n     bench. We believe that Justice Brown is qualified because she \n     is a superb judge. We who have worked with her on a daily \n     basis know her to be an extremely intelligent, keenly \n     analytical, and a very hard worker. We know that she is a \n     jurist who applies the law without favor, without bias, and \n     with an even hand.\n\n  That was received by the committee October 16, 2003, when this \nprocess began.\n  Justice Owen and Justice Brown are both immensely qualified to serve \non the Federal bench. They deserve fair consideration by this body. \nThat should come in the form of an up-or-down vote, not a filibuster. I \ntrust we will have that soon. They certainly deserve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for \nhis presentation and his work on the Judiciary Committee since the time \nwe have both been in the Senate. He has served for some time and has \ndone an excellent job. He brings a lot of good sense to it. We are both \nvery familiar with Janice Rogers Brown and Justice Owen. They have been \nin front of us for years now. Priscilla Owen was in front of us when I \nwas last on the Judiciary Committee over 2 years ago. I can remember \nthat during her confirmation hearing, she gave a law school professor \ndissertation to almost every question that came up. She had the \nanswers. She responded directly to our colleagues. She is a brilliant \nlady, both on resume and in person.\n  Something you said earlier caught my attention, because it is what a \nlot of this battle is about. The left in America doesn't get this \nagenda through the legislative or executive branch, so they go through \nthe courts.\n  And that is really what we are fighting about now, it seems to me--\nyou have judges we are putting forward for confirmation who are strict \nconstructionists, meaning they will rule within the letter of the law \nof the Constitution. The left wants people who will be super \nlegislators, legislating from the bench. In your experience on the \nJudiciary Committee, have you heard that debate taking place, or is it \nalways pretty much underneath the water, you really don't see it? Have \nyou heard that debate rise up where people say, well, we cannot change \nthe marriage definition in the U.S. Congress or in the States, so we \nare going to do it through the courts?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This motive is not talked about regularly in an open \nway, but in a way it did become open. Shortly after Justice Owen was \nnominated, the Republicans lost a majority in the Senate. I was \nchairing at that time the Court Subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and that changed and Senator Schumer became chairman of the \ncommittee. He announced that all judges were basically driven by their \npolitics, and they all had ideologies, and that we ought to just \nconsider their politics when we are confirming them. We had a hearing \non the politics of ideology and how we should handle it. I thought the \nwitnesses were uniform, including Lloyd Cutler, counsel to Jimmy Carter \nand to President Clinton, in their rejection of that principle.\n  They all agreed that the classical American rule of law says that \njudges are to be nonpartisan, that they are referees and arbiters and \nobjective interpreters of the law, and it would undermine that \nprinciple to start treating them like politicians. So it was discussed \nin a way that was honest, actually, and I think the overwhelming result \nfrom the ABA and the witnesses was that considering politics during the \njudicial confirmation process would not be a good way to go.\n  I know Senator Brownback is aware that a lot of the groups that drive \nthe objections to these nominees are very agenda-driven groups, they \nare activists, and I think that is pretty obvious to anybody who is \nwatching.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, that has been my view of what has been \ntaking place recently. Individuals increasingly have said we cannot win \nthis legislative fight in the States or in the Congress, so we are \ngoing to take it to the courts. A judge who is a strict constructionist \nwould ask, is this within our purview under the Constitution? And if it \nis not, the case would be thrown out, rather than the judge saying that \nthe Constitution is an organic, living document, and I can look at this \nlaw imaginatively, how I want to, and then somehow find a way to reach \nthe conclusion I want.\n  To me, that is what the frustration of the public has been--that \nsomehow they are now thrown out of the process. They can vote for or \nagainst the Senator from Alabama or the Senator from Kansas or the \nSenator from New Hampshire or the Senator from Massachusetts on the \nbasis of a policy issue. But they don't have any right or ability to be \nable to contact a judge. Yet you have these massive issues that \ndirectly impact people regarding marriage and life. We have a bill up \nnow where a Federal court has said that the Congress has appropriated \nthis money and that is inappropriate and they must give these moneys \nout. Under the Constitution, the appropriation powers are clearly given \nto the Congress. The court is now stepping into that.\n  My question to my colleague would be, Where does this stop if you \ndon't start putting on judges who are judges rather than super \nlegislators? Where does it stop?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I could not agree more with the Senator. He stated that \nso beautifully and, I believe, so fairly. It is the real question here. \nAs you know--and I am not sure most of the people in our country have \nfully thought it through--once a judge says the Constitution means that \nmarriage should be redefined and every legislative finding to the \ncontrary is void, the only recourse the American people have is to try \nto pass a constitutional amendment that requires, as you know, a two-\nthirds vote of both Houses of Congress and three-fourths of the States. \nIt is a monumental task. And then if you criticize the judge for their \nruling, people say: Oh, you are violating the separation of powers. I \nthink when the courts tread into those areas and start imposing \npolitical views, they can only expect that there will be criticism in \nreturn.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would think they would expect criticism on that. But \nthat has been the built-up frustration, where people say the only way \nwe can go is to amend the actual Constitution in the process. I do not \nbelieve that is the right way for our democracy to be going. I \nappreciate my colleague from Alabama and his work on these issues. I \nbelieve that is really at the core of these matters.\n  Mr. President, I note that we have had a lot of debate on Priscilla \nOwen and Janice Rogers Brown. I don't think anyone who listens to any \nof this debate is unfamiliar with these two individuals. I am going to \ntalk some more, as well, about these individuals and answer some \nquestions and comments made from the other side about these two \nindividuals.\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\n  At the end of the day, we need to recognize what this is about. I \nbelieve President Bush responded to this well at his last press \nconference when he was asked: Why do you think the Senate Democrats are \nopposing your nominees? Do you think it is based on the religious \npreference of your nominees? Some of these are people of faith who have \nreligious conviction. He said: No, I think it is because they would \ninterpret the law rather than trying to rewrite the law, that these are \npeople who would stay within the construction of the law and the \nconstruction of the Constitution and not try to rewrite it.\n  I believe that is what really is at stake here. Are you going to have \na super legislative judiciary, or are you going to have one where it is \nthe role of a judiciary to determine what is constitutional within the \nframework of the Constitution, not what some sort of expansive living \ndocument reading of the Constitution would be? That really is the heart \nof the matter we are debating here today. It is a very live issue in \nfront of us right now.\n\n  I note to those who may be listening to these proceedings right now, \nlast week, a Federal judge in the State of Nebraska ruled that the \nState constitutional amendment that the people in Nebraska had passed \ndefining marriage as the union of a man and a woman--the people of \nNebraska passed a State constitutional amendment with 70 percent of the \nvote, which is a high mark in any election, saying, yes, we agree that \nthe union of a man and woman is the definition of marriage in Nebraska. \nA Federal court in Nebraska ruled that is not only unconstitutional \nunder several different provisions, but that civil unions must be \ngranted to people of the same gender. The Federal court is saying you \nmust give that.\n  So it is not just saying that the State of Nebraska is wrong and \ncannot define marriage, which we have left up to the States in the \nhistory of the Republic, but it is also saying that the U.S. \nConstitution, in some reading of it, actually requires the recognition \nof same-sex civil unions. Where was that ever written in the \nConstitution? Where was that ever considered in any sort of \nconstitutional debate? Why is that, at this point in time in our \nConstitution, seen as somehow in this organic document of where we are \ntoday?\n  I think we have had 17 States now directly vote on the issue of \nmarriage, and every one of them said marriage is the union of a man and \na woman. Now you have a Federal court that says, no, that is not \nallowable for States to determine. States in every place and every \nregion in the country have passed this when the people were allowed to \nvote. Now you see again the issue-setting of an activist judiciary \ngoing in and saying: We know what the people think and what the people \nvote on this, but we say different. You are going to create yet another \nfestering frustration among the people of America if the court starts \nwalking--and apparently it has--into this issue of the definition of \nmarriage. These are things, if properly left to legislative bodies to \ndetermine, look at and figure, wrestle with, and have elections about, \nwhich people can have an impact on and say, I think this should be a \ncertain way, and a determination is then made by the people. That has \nbeen left up to the people, and it should be.\n  When the court steps in and makes a new determination, makes a new \nruling on it, that is going to build to that festering. It happened in \n1973 in Roe v. Wade, where the Court discovers this right to privacy \nthat is a constitutional right to abortion, which cannot be limited in \nany means, by any State, by the Federal Government, by the Congress.\n  Prior to that period of time, it had been held valid, constitutional, \nand appropriate for States to regulate and to deal with this issue, so \nwe had different States ruling different ways prior to Roe v. Wade. \nThis is what would happen again if and when Roe v. Wade is overturned; \nthe States simply would then handle this issue as they did prior to \n1973. But once the Court discovers this constitutional right to privacy \nthat is interpreted to mean there is a right to abortion, the states \ncannot decide for themselves at all.\n  We are starting down the same path with marriage. We can look around \nthe country and ask: Why are people fired up about the judiciary? Why, \nduring the last election cycle, was the lead applause line for \nPresident Bush's rallies about appointing judges who will stay within \nthe laws rather than rewriting them?\n  The reason is people have this deep-felt frustration at how the \ncourts are coming at all of these opinions, so contrary to the feelings \nof the vast majority of people in the United States. And where is it \nwritten within the Constitution, if it is within the document, that we \nshould have a constitutional right to abortion? Bring it to this body, \nwith two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate, three-\nfourths of the States passing it. That is how you amend the \nConstitution, not by a majority vote of the Supreme Court. That is the \ndurable way we amend the Constitution and deal with it, instead of this \nbuilding up of frustrations to the point where people say: I have been \ndisenfranchised. I thought the people voted, that the people ruled, \nwithin the parameters of the Constitution.\n  Remember, the Constitution gives a broad swath of power to the people \nand limits government. That is the role of the Constitution. It gives \nbroad authority and power to the people and limits the role of the \ngovernment.\n  We have embarked today upon addressing this issue. Really what we are \nseeing take place now are these large plates pushing against each \nother. Political scientists for years have debated the issue of \nPresidential power taking away from legislative power. That has always \nbeen the debate over the years.\n  During a war, a President is stronger; the legislative body is \nconsidered weaker. Outside of war, it reverses and the legislature \nassumes more authority over the executive branch. And for years \npolitical scientists have debated this back and forth--who is gaining, \nwho is receding. Yet we have seen taking place now over the past 40 \nyears an ever-increasing encroachment of the judicial branch within \nthese purviews reserved under the Constitution for the legislative and \nthe executive branches.\n  I spoke of one just previously with my colleague from Alabama, and \nthat is the appropriation of money. In the Constitution, the \nappropriation of money is given to the legislative body. That is \nspecifically stated within the Constitution.\n  Jerry Solomon, a former Congressman from New York who passed away, \nobserved that a number of colleges in the United States were not \nallowing military recruiters to come on to their college campuses. He \nsaid they ought to at least have them come on to the campuses and have \ntheir voices heard. The colleges said no.\n  Congressman Solomon put forward an amendment that if a college \ndecides to bar military recruiters from its campus, that is its right, \nbut it then cannot receive certain Federal appropriations. The \namendment said if you are not going to let military recruiters on \ncampus, then we have the right to withhold these Federal funds. If you \nare not going to give them a chance at free speech, we think there is \nsome price to be paid with that.\n  It is the authority of the Congress to appropriate money. That was \ndone with the Solomon amendment. It passed by a majority vote. It \npassed by a majority vote in the Senate and was signed into law by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Now a Federal court says, no, Congress, you cannot do that. The money \nmust go to those colleges in spite of the Solomon amendment. How many \nplaces across the country are courts allocating money for States? These \nare specific authorities and powers reserved to the legislative body, \nand the reason is, the Founders, in all their wisdom, said legislators \nare elected by the people, and the allocation of money is one of the \nkey power for any governmental entity that should belong to the elected \nrepresentatives of the people. But now we have the courts continually \ntaking, taking, taking. The judiciary continues to come in to areas \nreserved for the executive and legislative branches, and so we come to \nwhere we are today: President Bush seeking to appoint judges, bright \njudges, well-qualified judges, balanced judges, ones who say the law \nshould be interpreted as to what the law is, not what they choose for \nit to be or what outside groups want it to be. The Constitution is what \nit is, and it is not something through which I can invent new rights, \nhowever much as I think they should be in the Constitution. If that \nright is\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\nto be, it should be passed by two-thirds of the House, two-thirds of \nthe Senate, three-fourths of the States, and then it becomes a \nconstitutional amendment, not by a majority vote at the Supreme Court.\n  This is what these judges generally stand for. It is what we should \nget the judiciary back to. And yet nominees who would do that are being \nblocked, they are being filibustered inappropriately.\n  Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown--we have a group of four judges \nwho collectively have been filibustered for a total of 13 years. It is \namazing that they would be filibustered for that period of time.\n  This is a key, defining moment for us as a country. Will the \njudiciary be the judiciary, or is it to continue to accumulate power \nand become more of a superlegislative body? That is much of the debate \nthat is in front of us today with the judges. That is taking place in \nthe form of Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, and several other \njudges. That remains the issue.\n  When a Supreme Court position comes open, will we appoint somebody \nwho will stay within the letter of the law of the Constitution or not? \nWill it require 60 votes to approve a Supreme Court judge, something \nthat is never required, or will it be a majority vote? Must we have a \nsupermajority?\n  If you want a supermajority to approve a Supreme Court judge, then \namend the Constitution to state that it requires a supermajority, like \nwe do with respect to treaties, what it takes to approve a treaty. The \nFounders did not say that. They said advise and consent. They did not \nsay a supermajority or two-thirds vote of the body. They said advise \nand consent. Do you anywhere interpret a supermajority vote to be \nrequired to approve a Supreme Court nominee? No, that is not within the \nreading and understanding of the document. But because this role of \njudges as legislators keeps coming back up, particularly from the left, \nit is going to continue to be pushed.\n  There have been a number of issues raised regarding the nominees. I \nnow want to address what has been raised.\n  It has been asserted that current Attorney General Alberto Gonzales \naccused Priscilla Owen of judicial activism. He is Attorney General of \nthe United States and was on the Texas Supreme Court with Justice Owen. \nI asked the Attorney General in his confirmation hearing for Attorney \nGeneral if that was something he had said about Priscilla Owen. He said \nno. He testified under oath that Justice Owen is a great judge he never \naccused of judicial activism. That is Alberto Gonzales, under oath, in \nfront of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate.\n  I think that should put that to sleep. He testified under oath that \nhe had never accused Justice Owen of engaging in judicial activism.\n  Justice Brown was accused of justice activism in supporting the \nLochner case. Again, I want to put that issue to rest. Indeed, Justice \nBrown has taken issue with the Lochner decision. This is considered a \njudicial activism case. She is being accused of supporting it, when in \nfact she actually stated in an opinion that:\n\n       The Lochner court was justly criticized for using the due \n     process clause as though it provided a blank check to alter \n     the meaning of the Constitution as written.\n\n  That is Justice Janice Rogers Brown, in a written opinion on Lochner. \nShe cannot be accused of this. Maybe her words in a speech are accused, \nsaying she is supportive of Lochner, but her actual stated written \nopinion says, no, that the Court was justly criticized for the Lochner \ncase. I think those are important things to put clearly in the record.\n  Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair how much time remains of my \nallocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to cover some of the ground on \nJanice Rogers Brown that is well known in this situation because she \nhas been in front of us so much, so long, but I think it bears \nrepeating. She was born to sharecroppers, came of age in the Jim Crow \nera, went to segregated schools. Do you know what motivated her to \nbecome a lawyer? It was her grandmother's stories of NAACP lawyer Fred \nGray, who defended Rosa Parks, and her experience as a child of the \nSouth.\n  When she was a teenager, Justice Brown's family moved to Sacramento, \nCA. She received her bachelor's degree in economics from California \nState in Sacramento in 1974 and her law degree from the UCLA School of \nLaw in 1977. These are all well-known matters.\n  I don't know if people know as well all of her public service, but \nthey probably cannot because it is so extensive. All but 2 years of her \n28 years in her legal career have been in public service. This is a \npublic servant of 26 years standing.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer or anybody listening, if you serve as a \npublic servant for 26 years in the State of California, how can you be \na radical conservative out of the mainstream judicial thought? Can that \nbe while you are serving for 26 years in public service in the State of \nCalifornia in various capacities? She began her career in 1977 and \nserved 2 years as a deputy legislative counsel in the California \nLegislative Counsel Bureau. From 1979 to 1987 she was deputy attorney \ngeneral in the office of the attorney general of California. Governor \nPete Wilson selected her to serve as his legal affairs secretary from \n1991 to 1994. She then served on the State court of appeals for 2 years \nbefore joining the California Supreme Court where she served with \ndistinction until 1996. Then she was involved in her community.\n  So we have 26 years of public service in the State of California. I \ndo not see how that person could be somebody out of the mainstream of \nthought and serve in so many capacities in that State. That seems to me \nto defy logic.\n  She has performed a lot of community service. She served as a member \nof the California Commission on the Status of African-American Males, \nfocused on ways to correct inequities in the treatment of African-\nAmerican males in employment and in the criminal justice and health \ncare systems. Is this out of the mainstream? She was a member of the \nGovernor's Child Support Task Force which reviewed and made \nrecommendations on how to improve California's child support system. \nOut of the mainstream? She was a member of the Community Learning \nAdvisory Board of the Rio Americano High School and developed a program \nto provide government service internships to high school students in \nSacramento. Out of the main stream? She taught Sunday school at the \nCordova Church of Christ for more than 10 years, just as former \nPresident Carter teaches Sunday school. Out of the mainstream?\n  Given the impressive range of her activities and legal and personal \nexperiences, it is no surprise that the President would nominate her. \nWhat is surprising is that she would be labeled somehow out of the \nmainstream. I think this is simply and demonstrably ridiculous. If \nJanice Rogers Brown is an extremist, the people of California, I guess, \nmust be so, too. In 2002 they overwhelmingly approved her in a \nretention election with 76 percent of the vote. Her support was more \nthan any other justice on the ballot in that election.\n  If Janice Rogers Brown is extremist, so, too, must be a bipartisan \ngroup of 15 California law professors who wrote to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in support of Janice Rogers Brown, knowing her to be:\n\n      . . . a person of high intellect, unquestionable integrity \n     and evenhandedness.\n\n  She is not out of the mainstream. She is extraordinarily qualified, \nand this is just an attempt to smear a good candidate.\n  I turn, finally, to one issue about the approval rate of court of \nappeals judges under President Bush. We heard a lot of numbers thrown \naround about judges and the number who have been approved by this \nadministration and what happened under the remainder of the Clinton \nyears administration. I want to put up one chart about this and talk \nbriefly about it.\n  We have a Republican President and a Republican Senate. I am \ndelighted. I think we are going to make good progress for the American \npeople and show progress in moving things forward. I want to go back to \ntwo other Democrats, two Democratic Presidents who had Democratic \nSenates under them, an appropriate comparison of apples and apples, and \nlook at the approval rate of circuit court judges. Remember you have \nfederal district court\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\njudges, circuit court judges, and then Supreme Court Justices. Circuit \ncourt and Supreme Court jurists are the ones who have the most latitude \non enforcement, interpretation, or rewriting of laws.\n  Look what we had under Democrat President Johnson, a Democrat \nPresident: 95 percent approval rate of circuit court judges. President \nCarter, Democrat President, Democrat Senate: 93 percent approval rate. \nPresident Bush, Republican President, Republican Senate: 67 percent \napproval rate of circuit court judges.\n  What changed during this period of time? I suppose some would say \nthey are nominating a different sort of nominees who are not qualified \nor outside the mainstream, but I think that argument has been put to \nrest. What you have taking place is the unprecedented use and threat of \nthe filibuster that has never been used before and is targeted at the \ncircuit court, not at the lower Federal court, the finders of fact at \nthe district court level, but at the appellate level so that continued \nbroad interpretation of laws by which some would seek to put their own \nviews more in, can continue to be expressed: 95, 93, 67.\n\n  Others will argue, What about the Clinton years? You have a \nRepublican Senate and a Democrat President. There are obviously \ndifferences of opinion that will occur during that period of time, more \nso than when you have a body that is of the same party. But even then, \nwe move forward large numbers of Clinton nominees. This is \nunprecedented, 67 percent, the falloff from what has taken place \nbecause of the use of the filibuster.\n  This needs to change back to where the filibuster is not used against \njudicial nominees. Actually, I encourage my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle not to use the filibuster on this so we can move \nforward with up-or-down votes and leave the institution intact, the way \nit has been for two centuries, where the filibuster is not used on the \nadvice and consent provisions of judges that is required. Filibuster \nmeans supermajority vote on circuit court or Supreme Court nominees. \nThat is not contemplated, it is not considered, it is not appropriate \nunder the Constitution.\n  It is time to move these judges on forward. We are going to have a \nrobust debate for the next several days about this. The issue \nunderlying that is really going to be about the role of the judiciary, \nwhether it is expansive in rewriting broadly laws and the Constitution, \nor if it is more strict constructionist, staying within the roles and \nboundaries of what the judiciary should be.\n  I offer to have the American people decide what role the judiciary \nhas, what role the United States Senate has on appointing people to the \njudiciary. I regret we are at this point. I regret this chart shows \nthis way. But nonetheless it is what it is. It is something that now we \nhave to deal with. It will be a robust debate, and I hope at the end of \nthe day what we will have is the approval of circuit court judges who \nare mainstream and who are consistent; the role of the judiciary being \nappropriate as it was designed by the Framers of the Constitution and \nthe Founders of the Republic and within the lines of the Republic. If \nthat is what we will get back to, their proper roles, the legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial branches, it will be a long time coming. But I \nthink it is important and it is worth doing.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it has always been a great privilege for \nme to come to the floor of the Senate and engage in debate. I graduated \nfrom a high school senior class of nine students--in the top five, by \nthe way. I come from a town of 350 people in the southwest ranching \ncorner of North Dakota. I think it is a great privilege to be here, and \na wonderful opportunity.\n  The reason the Senate is such an extraordinary opportunity--and I \nhave had the privilege to serve in both the House and the Senate--is \nthat the Senate is the place of debate, unlimited debate. Yes, there is \nthe opportunity for a filibuster in the Senate, but that is what forces \ncompromise in the Senate. Unlike the House, there is a forcing of \ncompromise, which is what makes Government work.\n  I have been listening to this discussion. It is quite remarkable. \nThis is a big issue. This is a serious issue. I have been listening \nattentively to the speakers. Our former colleague, the late Senator \nMoynihan, once said, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but \nthey are not entitled to their own set of facts. What is happening here \nis the continuation of the development of a book of fiction by the \nmajority side.\n  They come to us and say the filibuster with respect to judicial \nnominations is very unusual, it is unprecedented, it is \nunconstitutional. Total fiction. How can they say that with a straight \nface? At least you would think they would laugh from time to time about \nwhat they are trying to pull over the American people.\n  They have filibustered. They have delayed. They have blocked forever \njudicial nominations when there was a Democrat in the White House.\n  Let me read a few names: Snodgrass, Whitfield, Shurin, Bingler, \nGreer, Sundram, Stack, Wattley, Beaty, Rodriguez, Lasry, Klein, \nFreedberg, Norton. I could read 60 of these. These are the names of \nlifetime appointments to the bench the President sent down to this \nChamber in the 1990s, most of which never even got 1 day of hearings, \nnot 1 day of hearings. Some of them, by the way, were filibustered, but \nmost were not even given the courtesy of 1 day of hearings because the \nmajority party did not like them, and did not want them confirmed. So \nthey used their control of the Judiciary Committee to make sure they \nwere not confirmed. There were over 60 of them.\n  Now, the current President, President George W. Bush, has sent 218 \nnames for a lifetime appointment on the Federal bench. We have approved \n208. Yes, that is right, 218 names the President has sent and we have \napproved 208.\n  The Constitution says something about this. It is not what my \ncolleagues have described. They misread the Constitution. The \nConstitution provides a two-step process for putting someone on the \nFederal bench for a lifetime: One, the President nominates; and, two, \nthe Congress decides. That is called advice and consent. It is not the \nPresident who decides who goes on the Federal bench for a lifetime. It \nis a two-step process. The candidate for a lifetime appointment must \nsurvive both, must get a Presidential nomination and then must be \napproved by the Senate.\n  My colleagues say there is a requirement in the Constitution that \nthere be an up-or-down vote that you cannot filibuster. First, unlike \nmy colleagues on that side of the aisle, many of whom have voted for \nfilibusters--and I will not embarrass them by reading their names, but \nI could because they have voted for filibusters previously on judicial \nnominations. Unlike those circumstances, we have voted on all of these \njudges. The 10 who were not approved had a vote in the Senate on a \nmotion to proceed, on a motion to invoke cloture. It required 60 votes \nand they did not get the 60 votes so the nomination did not proceed.\n  The majority party is upset about that. They believe democracy is \none-party rule, the same party in the White House, the House, and the \nSenate. They want their way and if they do not get their way, they \nintend to violate the Senate rules to change the rules. They will not \nask the Parliamentarian when they make the motion. Why? Because they \nare wrong and they know it, and they will violate the rules of the \nSenate, so they put their person in the Presiding Officer's chair, the \nPresident of the Senate, and by 51 votes they will violate the rules of \nthe Senate for the first time in 200 years. Why? Because their nose is \nbent out of shape because they have not gotten every single judge on \nthe court they wanted. They have only gotten 208 out of 218.\n  Let me describe some I have opposed. I actually opposed one who was \nsent to us by President Bush who wrote that he believed a woman is \nsubservient to a man. I voted against that one. I guess I don't want \nsomeone on the Federal bench for a lifetime who believes a woman is \nsubservient to a man. One of the keenest, finest minds of the 18th \ncentury, but not someone suited to go to the Federal bench for a \nlifetime now, in my judgment. That person actually did get through the \nSenate, I regret to say.\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\n  Let me talk about a couple because the majority has brought them to \ntown recently and they have been on television. Let me describe the \nrecord of a couple of these nominees.\n  First let me talk about Janice Rogers Brown. She did not get the 60 \nvotes. Let me describe why. Ms. Brown, as described by the last \nspeaker, has a wonderful life story, but she has served at some great \nlength in the State of California, and her views are so far out of the \nmainstream that one wonders what would have persuaded the President to \nsend her name down.\n  Let me give an example. She believes zoning laws represent theft of \nproperty. Let me explain that to you. Zoning laws decide if you move \ninto a residential area and you have a house in a residential area and \nthe lot right next door to you is empty, you can have some confidence \nthey are not going to move a porn shop into that next lot. Or there is \nnot going to be a massage parlor in that next lot, or somebody is not \ngoing to bring an automobile salvage company and put it on the lot next \nto your house. Zoning laws. She thinks zoning laws are a theft of \nproperty.\n  Do Americans want someone who believes there ought not be zoning? Or \nif you decide you should not have a porn shop next to a school, you \nought to pay the person who owns the property in order to avoid having \nthe porn shop locate next to a school? Or a massage parlor next to the \nnursing home? That is so preposterous. What on Earth is that kind of \nthinking and why do we have a nomination of someone who thinks like \nthat?\n  That same nominee says, by the way, the Medicare Program and Social \nSecurity Program are the last vestiges of socialism, the last of the \nNew Deal socialistic impulses of our country, and says that these are \ncannibalizing from our grandchildren. That we are cannibalizing from \nour grandchildren because we have things such as Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  Am I pleased to oppose a nominee with those views? Of course I am. We \nhave a right in this Chamber and that right is in the Constitution to \nprevent someone such as that from going on the Federal bench. The \nmajority party says no, you do not have that right. They say they have \nwhat is called the constitutional option.\n  Let me ask, in the hours in which we debate this, if one Member of \nthe Senate, just one--I am not asking for five, three or two, just one \nmember of the Senate will come to the Chamber of the Senate with the \nConstitution in their pocket. Yes, you can put it in your pocket. It is \na rather small document. If you cannot read it, we will get remedial \nreading or have someone read it to you. Come down to the Senate and \ntell us where it says that the minority in the Senate does not have the \nright to invoke the rules of the Senate to prevent someone from going \non the bench for a lifetime? Where does it say that in the \nConstitution?\n  I was on a television program with one of my colleagues from the \nother side. That colleague was saying it is unconstitutional for us to \nfilibuster a court nominee. That very colleague has previously voted to \nfilibuster a court nominee. I wonder how they can stop from grinning--\nat least? I understand where a full-bellied laugh would not occur on \nthe Senate floor--but how can you avoid grinning when you stand up and \nperpetrate these fictions?\n  They know better.\n  Again, as my colleague, the late Senator Moynihan said, everyone is \nentitled to their opinion, but not everyone is entitled to their own \nset of facts. Let's at least deal with the truth in the Senate.\n  There is much we ought to do in the Senate. My colleagues on the \nfloor are colleagues most often who stand up and talk about the real \nissues. I am talking about Senator Kennedy and Senator Dayton and \nothers on the issues of jobs, the jobs going overseas at a record pace, \nhealth care, health care costs that are devastating to people and to \ntheir budgets and to businesses. Energy, the price of gasoline, the \nfact we are held hostage by the Saudis and Kuwaitis and Iraqis and \nVenezuelans for oil we put through our transportation system and \nthrough gasoline that we run through our fuel injectors, and yet is \nthere any discussion of that in the Senate? No, no, not at all. Not at \nall. This is an agenda driven outside this Chamber by interest groups \nthat have forgotten the Ninth Commandment. Yes, there were Ten \nCommandments, and the Ninth says: Thou shalt not bear false witness.\n\n  I ask my fellow citizens, turn on your television and see what they \nare running on television: advertisements coming from religious \norganizations that fundamentally misrepresent--and they know they \nmisrepresent--the facts with this issue. The Ninth Commandment says: \nThou shalt not bear false witness. The truth is this. The truth is, \nthat this Congress has a right to an equal voice in who spends a \nlifetime on a Federal bench. The truth is, we have cooperated to an \nextraordinary degree with this President. We have approved 208 Federal \njudges. Let me say, two of them are sitting on the Federal bench in \nNorth Dakota. I was proud to work for both of them. They are both \nRepublicans. I am a Democrat. I am pleased they are both on the Federal \nbench. I worked with the White House to get them there. I supported \nthem, as I have done with most of the nominees coming from this \nPresident.\n  But we have every right to decide, when this President sends us the \nname of a nominee so far outside the mainstream--and that is the case \nwith the two they are talking about now, one from Texas, one from \nCalifornia--we have a right to decide not to advance those names to \ngive them a lifetime appointment on the Federal bench.\n  To those who stand up on the floor of the Senate and say: Well, there \nhas never been a filibuster before--you know better than that. If they \nkeep doing it, I am going to come down and read the names of all of \nthem on the majority side that have voted for the filibuster. And I \nwill read the names of all 60 judges into the Record--I should not say \n60 judges--60 nominees the last President sent down here that, in many \ncases, did not even have the courtesy of a hearing.\n  This position is hypocrisy, and it needs to change. This so-called \nnuclear option is called ``nuclear,'' and it was coined by the majority \nparty. It is called ``nuclear'' because nuclear relates to almost total \ndestruction. And some of them are gleeful now that they are headed \ntoward a nuclear approach on the floor of the Senate.\n  This is a great institution. I am proud to be part of it. But this is \nnot a proud day. America's greatest moments are not found in \ncircumstances such as this. America's greatest mistakes are often \nwrapped in the zeal of excessive partisanship, and that is what we find \nhere. And America's greatest mistakes are almost always--almost \nalways--preceded by a moment, a split second, when it is possible to \nchange your mind and do the right thing.\n  That moment, that split second exists now for the majority leader and \nthose who feel as he does, that they ought to exercise the total \ndestructive option they call the nuclear option.\n  We ought to, in my judgment, work together. Mr. President, 208 of 218 \njudges means we have worked together and done the right thing. There \nare no apologies from this side for exercising our constitutional right \nto make sure we have men and women on the Federal bench whom we are \nproud of, who represent the mainstream of this country. We have done \nthat time and time and time again with President George W. Bush, and \nwill continue to do that. But we will not give up the right to exercise \nour responsibilities here on the floor of the Senate on these important \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time has expired. I believe the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts follows me today. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the Chair to remind me when I have \n10 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator currently has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota for the excellent presentation he made. As a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I remember the well over 60 nominees who were \ndenied the courtesy to be considered and to have a hearing and go to \nthe Senate and have a debate and discussion on the floor of the Senate.\n  I do not think any of us who are strongly opposed to what the Senator\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\nhas referred to as the nuclear option are interested just to retaliate \nagainst these Republican judges, the half a dozen or so who have been \nmentioned, debated, and discussed today, in return for the way the over \n60 nominees were treated under the previous administration. But it does \nrespond to the suggestions that have been made here on the floor that \nsomehow institutionally our friends on the other side have always been \nfor fairness in the consideration of these nominees and considerate of \nthe President in meeting his responsibility of advising the Senate.\n  I think many of us believe very deeply that if there are Members in \nthis body who, as a matter of conscience, feel strongly that those \nnominees or any nominee fails to be committed to the fundamental core \nvalues of the Constitution, that they ought to be able to speak to it, \nthey ought to be able to speak to it and not be muzzled, not be gagged, \nnot be silenced. That is the issue that is before the Senate now and \nwill be addressed in these next few days, and why it is enormously \nimportant for the country to pay attention to this debate and this \ndiscussion.\n  There is no breakdown in the judicial confirmation process. Democrats \nin this closely divided Senate have cooperated with the President on \nalmost all his nominations. The Senate has confirmed 208 of President \nBush's 218 nominees in the past 4 years, most of whom are not people we \nwould have chosen ourselves. Ninety-five percent have been confirmed.\n  Only a handful did not receive the broad, bipartisan support needed \nfor confirmation. Their records show they would roll back basic rights \nand protections. Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor, Priscilla Owen, \nand William Myers would erase much of the country's hard-fought \nprogress toward equality and opportunity. Their stated values--\nsubordinating the needs of families to the will of big business, \ndestroying environmental protections, and turning back the clock on \ncivil rights--are not mainstream values.\n  Democrats have, under the Senate's rules, declined to proceed on \nthose nominees to protect America from their radical views.\n  The President has renominated William Pryor for the 11th Circuit, \nwhich includes the States of Florida, Alabama, and Georgia. Mr. Pryor's \nrecord makes clear that his views are far outside the legal mainstream. \nMr. Pryor is no conservative. Instead, he has pushed a radical agenda \ncontrary to much of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence over the last 40 \nyears.\n  Mr. Pryor has fought aggressively to undermine Congress's power to \nprotect individual rights. He has tried to cut back on the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Clean \nWater Act. He has criticized the Voting Rights Act. He has been \ncontemptuously dismissive of claims of racial bias in the application \nof the death penalty. He has relentlessly advocated its use, even for \npersons with mental retardation. He has even ridiculed the Supreme \nCourt Justices, calling them ``nine octogenarian lawyers who happen to \nsit on the Supreme Court.'' He can't even get his facts right. Only 2 \nof the 9 Justices are 80 or older.\n  Mr. Pryor's opposition to basic protections for the rights of the \ndisabled is particularly troubling. In one case, Justice Scalia, for a \nunanimous Court--a unanimous Court--rejected his position that the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act does not apply to State prisons.\n  In another case, the Supreme Court rejected his view that provisions \nof the act ensuring that those with disabilities have access to public \nservices are unconstitutional.\n  In that case, a plaintiff who uses a wheelchair challenged the denial \nof access to a courthouse where he had to crawl up the stairs to reach \nthe courtroom. Mr. Pryor claimed that the Congress could not require \nStates to make public facilities accessible to the disabled. He said \nthat because the disabled have ``no absolute right'' to attend legal \nproceedings affecting their rights, denying them access to courthouses \ndoes not violate the principle of equal protection.\n  The Supreme Court also rejected his radical view that executing \nretarded persons is not cruel and unusual punishment. And later the \nEleventh Circuit court, a court dominated by conservative Republican \nappointees, unanimously rejected Mr. Pryor's attempt to evade the \nSupreme Court decision. He had tried to prevent a prisoner with an IQ \nof 65, who even the prosecution agreed was mentally retarded, from \nclaiming that he should not be executed.\n  On women's rights, Mr. Pryor has criticized constitutional \nprotections against gender discrimination. He dismissed as ``political \ncorrectness'' the Supreme Court's decision that a State-run military \nacademy could not deny admission to women because of stereotypes about \nhow women learn.\n  Mr. Pryor has an especially troubling record on voting rights. In a \n1997 statement to Congress, he opposed section 5 of the Voting Rights \nAct, an indispensable tool for assuring that all Americans have the \nright to vote regardless of race or ethnic background. He called this \nimportant law an ``affront to federalism'' and ``an expensive burden \nthat has far outlived its usefulness.''\n  In March, we commemorated the 40th anniversary of Bloody Sunday when \nMartin Luther King, Jr., Congressman John Lewis, and others were \nbrutally attacked on a peaceful march in Mr. Pryor's home State of \nAlabama in support of voting rights for all, regardless of race. Yet \nnow the administration wants our consent to a nominee who opposes the \nVoting Rights Act. There is too much at stake to risk confirming a \njudge who would turn back progress on protecting the right to vote.\n  It is no surprise that civil rights leaders oppose Mr. Pryor's \nnomination, including Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a leader in the Alabama \nmovement for voting rights, and many of Rev. C. T. Vivian's and many of \nDr. King's other close advisers and associates.\n  There can be no doubt that Mr. Pryor sees the Federal courts as a \nplace to advance his political agenda. When President Bush was elected \nin 2000, Mr. Pryor gave a speech praising his election as the ``last \nbest hope for federalism.'' He ended his speech with these words:\n\n     . . . a prayer for the next administration: Please God, no \n     more Souters.\n\n  In another speech he said he was thankful for the Bush v. Gore \ndecision:\n\n       I wanted Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the \n     judiciary and judicial selection so we can have no more \n     appointments like Justice Souter.\n\n  His call to politicize the Supreme Court shows that he views the \ncourts as places to make laws, not interpret them.\n  The real question is why, when there are so many qualified Republican \nattorneys in Alabama, the President would choose such a divisive \nnominee. Why pick one whose record raises so much doubt as to whether \nhe will be fair? Why pick one who can muster only a rating of \n``partially unqualified'' from the American Bar Association? The \nadministration has given us no good answers to these questions because \nthere are none. Mr. Pryor is clearly on the far fringe of legal \nthinking and not someone who should be given a lifetime appointment to \nthe court of appeals.\n  Of course, we oppose the attempt to break the Senate rules to put Mr. \nPryor on the court. That is what our Founding Fathers would have wanted \nus to do, not to act as a rubber stamp for the administration.\n  Priscilla Owen, whose nomination the Senate is debating today, is \nanother candidate on the far fringes of legal thinking. Her record \nraises equally grave concerns that she would try to remake the law. \nFour times the Senate has declined to confirm her because of concerns \nthat she won't deal fairly with a wide range of cases that can come \nbefore the Fifth Circuit, especially on issues of major concern to \nworkers, consumers, victims of discrimination, and women exercising \ntheir constitutional right. Yet the President chose to provoke a fight \nin the Senate by renominating her, among other plainly unacceptable \nnominees whom the Senate declined to confirm in the last Congress.\n\n  Nothing has changed since we last reviewed her record to make Justice \nOwen worthy of confirmation now. Her supporters argue that she is being \nopposed solely because of her hostility to women's constitutionally \nprotected right to choose. In fact, her nomination raises a wide range \nof major concerns because she so obviously fails to approach cases \nfairly and with an open mind.\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\n  As the San Antonio Express News has stated, her ``record demonstrates \na results-oriented streak that belies supporters' claims that she \nstrictly follows the law.''\n  It is not just Senate Democrats who question her judicial activism \nand willingness to ignore the law. Even newspapers that endorsed her \nfor the Texas Supreme Court now oppose her confirmation, after seeing \nhow poorly she served as judge.\n  The Houston Chronicle wrote:\n\n       Owen's judicial record shows less interest in impartially \n     interpreting the law than in pushing an agenda.\n\n  And that she, it continues, ``too often contorts rulings to conform \nto her particular conservative outlook.''\n  It noted that:\n\n       It's worth saying something that Owen is a regular \n     dissenter on a Texas Supreme Court made up mostly of other \n     conservative Republicans.\n\n  The Austin American Statesman, in their editorial, said Priscilla \nOwen ``is so conservative that she places herself out of the broad \nmainstream of jurisprudence'' and that she ``seems all too willing to \nbend the law to fit her views . . . ''\n  The San Antonio Express News said:\n\n       [W]hen a nominee has demonstrated a propensity to spin the \n     law to fit philosophical beliefs, it is the Senate's right--\n     and duty--to reject the nominee.\n\n  These are the San Antonio Express News, the Austin American \nStatesman, and the Houston Chronicle.\n  Her colleagues on the conservative Texas Supreme Court have \nrepeatedly described her in the same way. They state that Justice Owen \nputs her own views above the law, even when the law is crystal clear.\n  Her former colleague on the Texas Supreme Court, our Attorney General \nAlberto Gonzales, has said she was guilty of ``an unconscionable act of \njudicial activism.'' This is what the current Attorney General of the \nUnited States said when he was on the supreme court: Justice Owen's \nopinion was ``an unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n  Justice Gonzales's statement that her position in this case was ``an \nunconscionable act of judicial activism'' was not a random remark. Not \nonce, not twice, but numerous times Justice Gonzales and his other \ncolleagues on the Texas Supreme Court have noted that Priscilla Owen \nignores the law to reach her desired result.\n  In one case, Justice Gonzales held the Texas law clearly required \nmanufacturers to be responsible to retailers who sell their products if \nthose products are defective. He wrote that Justice Owen's dissenting \nopinion would judicially amend the statute to let manufacturers off the \nhook.\n  In 2000, Justice Gonzales and a majority of the Texas Supreme Court \nupheld a jury award holding the Texas Department of Transportation and \nthe local transit authority responsible for a deadly auto accident. He \nexplained that the result was required by the plain meaning of the \nTexas law. Owen dissented, claiming that Texas should be immune from \nthese suits. Justice Gonzales wrote that she misread the law, which he \nsaid was clear and unequivocal.\n  In another case, Justice Gonzales joined the court's majority that \ncriticized Justice Owen for disregarding the procedural limitations in \nthe statute and taking a position even more extreme than had been \nargued by the defendant.\n  In another case in 2000, landowners claimed a Texas law exempted them \nfrom local water quality regulations. The court's majority ruled the \nlaw was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to \nprivate individuals. Justice Owen dissented and sided with the large \nlandowners, including contributors to her campaign. Justice Gonzales \njoined a majority opinion criticizing her, stating that most of her \nopinion was nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric, which merits no \nresponse.\n  Justice Gonzales also wrote an opinion holding that an innocent \nspouse could recover insurance proceeds when her coinsured spouse \nintentionally set fire to their insured home. Justice Owen joined a \ndissent that would have denied the coverage of the spouse on the theory \nthat the arsonist might somehow benefit from the court's decision. \nJustice Gonzales's majority opinion stated that her argument was based \non a ``theoretical possibility'' that would never happen in the real \nworld, and that violated the plain language of the insurance policy.\n  In still another case, Justice Owen joined a partial dissent that \nwould have limited the basic right to jury trials. The dissent was \ncriticized by the other judges as a ``judicial sleight of hand'' to \nbypass the Texas constitution.\n  Priscilla Owen is one of the most frequent dissenters on the \nconservative Texas Supreme Court in cases involving basic protections \nfor workers, consumers, and victims of discrimination. That court is \ndominated by Republican appointees, and is known for frequently ruling \nagainst plaintiffs. Yet, when the Court rules in favor of plaintiffs, \nJustice Owen usually dissents, taking the side of the powerful over \nindividual rights.\n  She has limited the rights of minors in medical malpractice cases. \nShe has tried to cut back on people's right to relief when insurance \ncompany claims are unreasonably denied, even in cases of bad faith. Her \nfrequent dissents show a pattern of limiting remedies for workers, \nconsumers, and victims of discrimination or personal injury.\n  She dissented in a case interpreting a key Texas civil rights law \nthat protects against discrimination based on age, race, gender, \nreligion, ethnic background, and disability. Justice Owen's opinion \nwould have required employees to prove discrimination was the only \nreason for the actions taken against them--even though the law clearly \nstates that workers need only prove that discrimination was one of the \nmotivating factors. Justice Owen's view would have changed the plain \nmeaning of the law to make it nearly impossible for victims of \ndiscrimination to prevail in civil rights cases.\n  She joined an opinion that would have reversed a jury award to a \nwoman whose insurance company had denied her claim for coverage of \nheart surgery bills. Many other such cases could be cited.\n  Justice Owen also dissented in a case involving three women who \nsought relief for intentional infliction of emotional distress on the \njob because of constant humiliating and abusive behavior by their \nsupervisor.\n  The supervisor harassed and intimidated employees by the daily use of \nprofanity; by screaming and cursing at employees; by charging at \nemployees and physically threatening them; and by humiliating \nemployees, including making an employee stand in front of him in his \noffice for as long as thirty minutes while he stared at her. The \nemployees he harassed suffered from severe emotional distress, tension, \nnervousness, anxiety, depression, loss of appetite, inability to sleep, \ncrying spells and uncontrollable emotional outbursts as a result of his \nso-called supervision. They sought medical and psychological help \nbecause of their distress.\n  Eight Justices on the Texas court agreed that the actions, viewed as \na whole, were extreme and outrageous enough to justify the jury's \nverdict of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Justice Owen \nwrote a separate opinion, stating that while she agreed that there was \nevidence to support the women's case, she thought most of it was \n``legally insufficient to support the verdict.''\n  Justice Owen's record is particularly troubling in light of the \nimportant issues that come before the Fifth Circuit, which is also one \nof the most racially and ethnically diverse Circuits, with a large \nnumber of low-income workers, Latinos, and African-Americans. It is \nparticularly vital that judges on the court are fair to workers, \nvictims of discrimination, and those who suffer personal injuries.\n  Some have said that those who raise questions about Justice Owen's \nrecord are somehow smearing her personally. That's untrue and unfair. \nEach of us has a responsibility to review her record and to take \nseriously the problems we find.\n  That means taking seriously the rights of persons like Ralf Toennies, \nwho was fired at age 55, and found that Justice Owen wanted to impose \nobstacles to his age discrimination claim that were nowhere in the \nstatute. We must take seriously the rights of the women employees \ncriticized by Justice Owen for their testimony on workplace harassment \nin the emotional distress\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\ncase. We can't ignore the rights of the millions of families who live \nin the Fifth Circuit States of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n  Finally, Justice Owen's supporters have also suggested that she \nshould be confirmed to the Court of Appeals because Texas voters \nelected her to their Supreme Court.\n  Obviously, there is a huge difference between State judges who must \nsubmit to local elections to keep their positions and Federal judges \nwho are lifetime appointees, and are not meant to respond to popular \nopinion. If we confirm Justice Owen to the Fifth Circuit, she will \nserve for life. So our responsibility as Senators is very different. \nThe record of each nominee for a Federal judgeship is carefully \nconsidered by Senators from all 50 States.\n  Likewise, the fact that she received a high rating from the American \nBar Association or did well on the bar exam does not erase her \ndisturbing record. Priscilla Owen's record raises major questions about \nher commitment to the basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution to \nall our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few moments now to go over with the \nSenate some of the rules that are going to have to be broken by the \nmajority in order to try to change the rules of the Senate.\n  I want to review very quickly what we are faced with here. I will \ngive two examples of individuals who I think failed to meet the \nstandard for approval in the Senate, that they have a commitment to the \ncore values of the Constitution. We have just seen examples and \nstatements and comments from both individuals and from newspapers and \nother sources that I think established convincingly these individuals \ndo not have that kind of core commitment required and should not be \ngiven lifetime appointments.\n  Neither the Constitution, nor Senate rules, nor Senate precedents, \nnor American history provide any justification for the majority \nleader's attempt to selectively nullify the use of the filibuster to \npush through these radical nominees. Equally important, neither the \nConstitution, nor the rules, nor precedent, nor history provide any \npermissible means for a bare majority of the Senate to take that \nradical step without breaking or ignoring clear provisions of \napplicable Senate rules and unquestioned precedents.\n  Here are some of the rules and precedents the executive will have to \nask its allies in the Senate to break or ignore in order to turn the \nSenate into a rubberstamp for the nominations:\n  First, they will have to see that the Vice President himself is \npresiding over the Senate so that no real Senator needs to endure the \nembarrassment of publicly violating Senate rules and precedent and \noverriding the Senate Parliamentarian the way our Presiding Officer \nwill have to do.\n  Next, they will have to break paragraph 1 of rule V, which requires 1 \nday's specific written notice if a Senator intends to try to suspend or \nchange any rule.\n  Then they will have to break paragraph 2 of rule V, which provides \nthat the Senate rules remain in force from Congress to Congress, unless \nthey are changed in accordance with the existing rules.\n  Then they will have to break paragraph 2 of rule XXII, which requires \na motion, signed by 16 Senators, a 2-day wait, and a three-fifths vote \nto close debate on the nomination itself.\n  They will also have to break rule XXII's requirement of a petition, a \nwait, and a two-thirds vote to stop debate on a rules change.\n  Then, since they pretend to be proceeding on a constitutional basis, \nthey will have to break the invariable rule of practice that \nconstitutional issues must not be decided by the Presiding Officer, but \nmust be referred by the Presiding Officer to the entire Senate for full \ndebate and decision.\n  Throughout the process, they will have to ignore or intentionally \ngive incorrect answers to proper parliamentary inquiries which, if \nanswered in good faith and in accordance with the expert advice of the \nParliamentarian, would make clear that they are breaking the rules.\n  Eventually, when their repeated rule-breaking is called into \nquestion, they will blatantly, and in dire violation of the norms and \nmutuality of the Senate, try to ignore the minority leader and other \nSenators who are seeking recognition to make lawful motions or pose \nlegitimate inquiries or make proper objections.\n  By this time, all pretense of comity, all sense of mutual respect and \nfairness, all of the normal courtesies that allow the Senate to proceed \nexpeditiously on any business at all will have been destroyed by the \npreemptive Republican nuclear strike on the floor.\n  To accomplish their goal by using a bare majority vote to escape the \nrule requiring 60 votes to cut off debate, those participating in this \ncharade will, even before the vote, already have terminated the normal \nfunctioning of the Senate. They will have broken the Senate compact of \ncomity and will have launched a preemptive nuclear war. The battle \nbegins when the perpetrators openly, intentionally, and repeatedly \nbreak clear rules and precedents of the Senate, refuse to follow the \nadvice of the Parliamentarian, and commit the unpardonable sin of \nrefusing to recognize the minority leader.\n  Their hollow defenses to all these points demonstrate the weakness of \ntheir case.\n  They claim that ``we are only breaking the rules with respect to \njudicial nominations. We promise not to do so on other nominations or \non legislation.'' No one seriously believes that. Having used the \nnuclear option to salvage a handful of activist judges, they will not \nhesitate to use it to salvage some bill vital to the credit card \nindustry, oil industry, pharmaceutical industry, Wall Street, or any \nother special interest. In other words, the Senate majority will always \nbe able to get its way, and the Senate our Founders created will no \nlonger exist. It will be an echo chamber to the House, where the \ntyranny of the majority is so rampant today.\n  One of the greatest privileges of my life is serving the people of \nMassachusetts in the Senate. I am reminded every day of my obligation \nto speak up for them and fight for their concerns, their hopes, and \ntheir values in this Chamber. Many brave leaders from Massachusetts \nhave held the seat I hold today in the Senate. This seat was held by \nJohn Quincy Adams, who went on to become the sixth President and was a \ngreat champion of free speech. He debated three Supreme Court nominees \nand voted to confirm them all. He refused to be silenced.\n  Charles Sumner was the Senate's leading opponent of slavery. He was \nbeaten to within an inch of his life for speaking up for his \nconvictions. It took him 3 years to recover from the injuries and \nreturn to the Senate to speak out against slavery once again. He \ndebated 11 Supreme Court nominees and voted for 10 of them. He refused \nto be silenced.\n  Daniel Webster was one of our Nation's greatest orators and the \narchitect of the Great Compromise of 1850. He spoke up for a united \nAmerica with the words ``liberty and union, now and forever, one and \ninseparable.'' You can hear his words ringing through these halls even \nnow. He debated 12 Supreme Court nominations; he voted to approve 8 and \nopposed 4. He refused to be silenced.\n  Henry Cabot Lodge, the Republican, opposed President Wilson's efforts \nto join the League of Nations. He was the leading Republican voice on \nforeign policy in his time. He debated 20 Supreme Court nominees, voted \nfor 18, and he opposed 2. He refused to be silenced.\n  John Kennedy not only was a champion for working men and women in \nMassachusetts, but he also battled intolerance, injustice, and poverty \nduring his time in the Senate. He debated and supported four Supreme \nCourt nominees. He, too, refused to be silenced.\n  These great Senators are remembered and respected in our history \nbecause they spoke up for their convictions. They were not intimidated. \nThey did not back down from their beliefs. They were not muzzled. They \nwere not gagged. They would not be silenced. And it will be a sad day \nfor our democracy if the voices of our Nation's elected representatives \ncan no longer be heard.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to my friend and colleague, \nthe Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\n  The Book of Proverbs teaches:\n\n       Do not boast of tomorrow, for you do not know what the day \n     will bring.\n\n  In the play ``Heracles,'' the great playwright Euripides wrote:\n\n       All is change; all yields its place and goes.\n\n  And the Greek philosopher Heraclitus said:\n\n       Change alone is unchanging.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to bear the constancy of change in mind as they \nconsider the proposal to break the rules to change the rules of the \nSenate. Many in the Senate's current majority seem bent on doing that. \nThey seem quite certain that they shall retain the Senate majority for \nquite some time thereafter.\n  But as Bertrand Russell said:\n\n       Most of the greatest evils that man has inflicted upon man \n     have come from people feeling quite certain about something, \n     which, in fact, was false.\n\n  My colleagues do not need to strain their memories to recall changes \nin the control of the Senate. Most recently, the Senate changed from \nDemocratic to Republican control as a result of the 2002 election. \nDemocrats did control the Senate throughout the sixties and the \nseventies, but since then the Senate has governed under six separate \nperiods of one party's control. The Senate switched from Democratic to \nRepublican control in 1980, back to Democratic control in 1986, back to \nRepublican control in 1994, back to Democratic control in 2001, and \nback to Republican control again in 2002.\n  Similarly, some in the Senate can remember the decade after World War \nII. The Senate switched from Democratic to Republican control in 1946, \nback to Democratic control in 1948, back to Republican control in 1952, \nand then back to Democratic control again in 1954. Senators who served \nfrom 1945 to 1955, a mere 10 years, served under five separate periods \nof one party's majority control.\n  One cannot always see that change is coming, but change comes \nnonetheless. For example, in November 1994, Washington saw one of the \nmost sweeping changes in power in Congress of recent memory. Very few \nsaw that coming. The majority in the House and the Senate changed from \nDemocratic to Republican.\n  It is by no means easy to see that change coming. In March of 1994, \njust several months before the election, voters told the Gallup poll \nthat they were going to vote Democratic by a ratio of 50 percent \nDemocratic to 41 percent Republican. That same month, March of 1994, \nvoters told the ABC News poll that they were going to vote Democratic \nby a ratio of 50 percent Democratic to 34 percent Republican. As late \nas September of 1994, voters told the ABC News poll that they were \ngoing to vote Democratic by a ratio of 50 percent Democratic to 44 \npercent Republican. On the first Tuesday in November 1994, however, \nmore than 52 percent of voters voted Republican for Congress. Democrats \nlost 53 seats in the House and 7 seats in the Senate.\n  In 1980, the Senate changed hands from Democratic to Republican \ncontrol, but in August of 1980, voters in States with a Senate election \ntold the ABC News-Louis Harris poll that they would vote for Democrats \nfor the Senate by a margin of 47 percent for Democrats and 45 percent \nfor Republicans. And on the first Tuesday in November 1980, Democrats \nlost 12 seats in the Senate.\n  In November 2002, the voters gave the Republican Party victory in the \nSenate. But my colleagues in the majority would do well to remember.\n  After a victorious campaign, Roman generals used to be rewarded with \na triumph--a triumphant parade through the streets of Rome. Citizens \nacclaimed them like gods. But tradition tells us that behind the \ngeneral on his chariot stood a slave who whispered: Remember that you \nare mortal.\n  In the ceremony of a Pope's elevation, they used to intone: Sic \ntransit gloria mundi: ``So the glory of this world away.'' At that very \nmoment, they would burn a handful of flax. The burning flax would \nsymbolize how transitory the power in this world is.\n  In an address in Milwaukee in 1859, Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n       It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wisemen to \n     invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should \n     be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They \n     presented him with the words: ``And this, too, shall pass \n     away.'' How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of \n     pride! How consoling in the depths of affliction!\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to remember that this Senate \nmajority, too, shall pass away. This truth may console us in the \nminority, should the majority choose to break the rules to change the \nrules. But better still, better still would it be if the truth of \nconstant change would chasten the current majority into abiding by the \nrules that protect Senators when they are in the majority and when they \nare in the minority alike.\n  We should protect the rules to protect minority rights, for no one \ncan ``know what the day will bring.''\n  We should protect the rules that protect minority rights, for ``all \nyield [their] place and go.''\n  And we should protect the rules that protect minority rights, for it \nis true of majority control, as it is true of all things, that ``change \nalone is unchanging.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of time on our side. \nI understand we have an order to go to recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous agreement, the majority \ncontrols the next 60 minutes. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Are we in morning business or are we prepared to \nproceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on nominations.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Let me start by asking, what is the pending business \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination of Priscilla Owen to be U.S. \nCircuit Judge.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would like to take some time to \ndiscuss the nominations of two nominees, actually, to the Federal Court \nof Appeals. First, Justice Priscilla Owen of the Supreme Court of the \nState of Texas to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit, and then Justice Janice Rogers Brown of the Supreme Court of \nCalifornia to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia, along with why we need to move forward to a fair up-or-down \nvote on the nominations.\n  I would like to start with Judge Priscilla Owen.\n  Justice Owen's qualifications to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court are \nreadily apparent to anyone who looks at her background and experience. \nSpeaking to her in person--as I did 2 years ago, shortly after I came \nover to the Senate--only reinforces her obvious capabilities as a \njudge.\n  Justice Owen graduated cum laude from Baylor Law School and then \nproceeded to earn the highest score on the Texas Bar exam that year.\n  She practiced law for 17 years and became a partner with Andrews & \nKurth, a highly respected law firm in Texas, before being elected to \nthe Supreme Court of Texas in 1994.\n  Before I talk any more about Justice Owen's qualifications as a \njudge, I want to speak briefly about Priscilla Owen and the kind of \nperson she is. Priscilla Owen has spent much of her life devoting time \nand energy in service of her community. She serves on the board of \nTexas Hearing & Service Dogs, and is a\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\nmember of St. Barnabas Episcopal Mission in Austin, TX, where she \nteaches Sunday school and serves as the head of the altar guild.\n  Having been a Sunday school teacher myself, and having grown up in \nthe Episcopal Church--and my mother was the head of the altar guild for \nseveral decades--I know how much work that involved from a civic and \nreligious standpoint.\n  She has worked to ensure that all citizens are provided access to \njustice as the court's representative on the Texas Supreme Court \nMediation Task Force and to various statewide committees regarding \nlegal services to the poor and pro bono legal services.\n  She was part of a committee that successfully encouraged the Texas \nlegislature to provide millions of additional dollars per year for \nlegal services for the poor.\n  Justice Owen is a member of the Gender Bias Reform Implementation \nCommittee and the Judicial Efficiency Committee Task Force on Staff \nDiversity.\n  She was instrumental in organizing Family Law 2000 to educate parents \nabout the effect of divorce and to lessen the negative impacts on \nchildren.\n  Justice Priscilla Owen was elected by the people of Texas, the second \nmost populous State in this great country, to its highest court, the \nSupreme Court of Texas, where she serves today. In her last reelection \nin the year 2000, she won 84 percent of the vote and had the \nendorsement of every major newspaper in Texas.\n  Yet, there are still people who want the United States Senate to \nreject her nomination to the Federal bench because she is supposedly \nout of the mainstream in her legal reasoning. Out of the mainstream? \nThe people of Texas obviously don't think she's out of the mainstream. \nIn fact, I submit to you that in Texas and in the Fifth Circuit \noverall, she represents the mainstream of legal thought.\n  I would imagine my friends on the other side of the aisle would agree \nwith me that the American Bar Association is an organization considered \nby many to be well within the mainstream of legal thinking in this \ncountry. The ABA rated Justice Owen as ``Well Qualified'' for the Fifth \nCircuit--this is its highest rating, often called the ``gold standard'' \nand indicating the best possible qualifications to serve on the Federal \nbench. By their opposition to Justice Owens confirmation, my colleagues \non the other side seem to be telling the ABA: ``Don't bother with your \nrating; it just doesn't matter to us.''\n  Even though they used to refer to a well qualified rating as the \n``golden standard'' for judicial nominees, now it seems this is just \nnot about qualifications.\n  A judicial nominee's qualifications should matter most, and that \nnominee's qualifications should be the sole criterion for approving or \nblocking a nomination.\n  The focus should be on these candidates and their legal knowledge and \nexperience. It should not be reduced to partisan battles over politics \nor ideology. The essential principle for picking a Federal judge should \nbe their commitment to the law. We need judges who put the law before \npersonal philosophy, ideology, or politics. That is what separates the \njudiciary from the legislative branch.\n  Senators should not inject politics into the process, and nominees \nshould keep their politics out of the process as well.\n  The comments of some of my Democrat colleagues underscore that this \ndebate is not about whether Priscilla Owen is well qualified as a \njudge. Her record reflects it, the ABA acknowledges it, and so do many \nof my colleagues on the other side. For example, consider these \ncomments:\n  Senator Durbin on September 5, 2002:\n\n       There is no dispute that Justice Owen is a woman of \n     intellectual capacity and academic accomplishment.\n\n  Senator Feinstein on July 23, 2002:\n\n       Justice Owen comes to us with a distinguished record and \n     with the recommendations of many respected individuals within \n     her State of Texas . . . [She is] personable, intelligent, \n     and well spoken. It is clear to me that Justice Owen knows \n     the law.\n\n  Senator Kennedy on September 5, 2002:\n\n       Justice Owen is an intelligent jurist.\n\n  Senator Kohl on May 1, 2003:\n\n       We all recognize her legal talents.\n\n  And Senator Schumer on July 23, 2002:\n\n       I don't think there is any question about your legal \n     excellence. You have had a distinguished academic and \n     professional career . . . I think anyone who has listened \n     even to 10 minutes of this hearing today has no doubt about \n     the excellence in terms of the quality of your legal \n     knowledge and your intelligence, your articulateness, et \n     cetera.\n\n  I take my colleagues at their words. These comments are true and \ngenuine. With that in mind and knowing that Justice Owen has the \nendorsement of the ABA as ``well qualified,'' since she was reelected \nwith 84 percent of the vote in her home State, how can anyone try to \nsay she is out of the mainstream? Why is it wrong to simply give her a \nfair up-or-down vote to see whether a majority of Senators believes she \nis qualified for this position?\n  Let me remind Members again that the Fifth Circuit seat to which she \nhas been nominated has been designated as a judicial emergency by the \nJudicial Conference of the United States. The judges down in the Fifth \nCircuit need some relief. Dockets are getting backlogged. Cases are \nbeing delayed and not moving as they should. People who live in the \nFifth Circuit need some relief.\n  Last week, on May 9, we marked the fourth anniversary of Justice \nOwen's nomination to the Fifth Circuit bench. Obstructing a nominee of \nthe caliber of Priscilla Owen to a seat characterized as a judicial \nemergency is wrong. We cannot afford to drag this process out any \nfurther. Now is no time for obstructing the nomination of an eminently \nqualified jurist, one the American Bar Association has unanimously \nrated as ``well qualified,'' for confirmation to this Fifth Circuit \nseat. Let's get beyond the politics and confirm this nominee. I urge my \ncolleagues to give Priscilla Owen a fair up-or-down vote on her \nnomination to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I now will move on to discuss another nominee being considered by the \nSenate, Justice Janice Rogers Brown, who the President has nominated to \nsit on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  Since 1996, Janice Rogers Brown has been an associate justice for the \nSupreme Court of California, our country's most populous State. Justice \nBrown was initially appointed to the California high court by then-\nGovernor Pete Wilson. She was reelected to the California Supreme Court \nin 1998 by the citizens of California, at which time she received 76 \npercent of the vote in favor of her reelection.\n\n  Prior to her service on the California Supreme Court, Justice Brown \nserved for 2 years as a State appellate judge in California. Before \nthat, she served as legal affairs secretary for Governor Wilson. For \nall but 2 of the past 24 years, Justice Brown has dedicated her career \nto work in public service positions.\n  Despite this background of public service and accomplishment, Justice \nBrown, unfortunately, has become the target of liberal interest groups \nwho claim she is out of the mainstream of legal thinking. Those who \noppose confirmation of these two fine State supreme court justices, \nJanice Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen, apparently have no regard for \nthe people of our two most populous States, California and Texas, the \npeople who know these judges much better than anyone in this room or \nthis body.\n  I submit again, in California, our Nation's most populous and one of \nour more diverse States, reelection of Justice Brown was 76 percent of \nthe vote. That proves she is regarded as in the mainstream of legal \nthought.\n  Justice Brown rose from her early years as a child of sharecropper \nparents in the State of Alabama in the 1950s, one of the more difficult \ntimes in the history of our country for minorities, to sit on the \nhighest court in the State of California. With a 76 percent reelection \ntally, it is obvious that a lot of people like Janice Rogers Brown. But \nnevertheless, Justice Brown has overcome adversity through her life and \nnow she is facing it in her nomination to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  It is a core fundamental principle of the American judicial system \nthat justice is blind. The people can get a fair hearing regardless of \nwho they are, where they come from, or what they look like. Surely, \nnominees to the Federal bench deserve the same rights to a fair hearing \nas any of us.\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\n  Americans have a right to know where their Senators stand. Americans \nhave a right to hold their Senators accountable. If a Senator opposes \nany nominees, he or she should vote against them, but they should vote. \nThey should not hide behind Senate rules and parliamentary loopholes to \nblock a vote. Our Nation's legal system is more important than, and \nshould be above, petty partisan politics. There is never any reason \nunder any circumstances that either political party should stall the \ncourts from doing their necessary work just for political gain. As \nAmericans, we deserve a fair, functioning legal system that is \nresponsive to the law and not to some special interest group.\n  We already have too much politics in America. We already have too \nmuch politics in our legal system. While it is an unfortunate truth \nthat partisan politics infects Washington, it has no place in our \ncourts, it has no place in the verdicts delivered by our Federal \njudges, and it has no place in the confirmation process. We need the \nmost qualified judges, not those who know how to work their way through \nthe political system. It is and must always be a core fundamental \nprinciple of the American judicial system that people can get a fair \nhearing. Surely nominees to the Federal bench deserve the same rights \nto a fair hearing as any of us. The confirmation of judges should not \nbe about ideology or partisanship. We need to adhere to a consistent \nprocess of investigation and decisionmaking that upholds the \nindependent nature of our judicial system. Nominees should be judged by \ntheir qualifications, nothing less and nothing more. Once the \ninvestigation is done, nominees deserve an up-or-down vote.\n  Just as the Senate has been granted by the Constitution the right of \nadvice and consent, the Constitution has also bestowed on them the \nresponsibility to decide yes or no. If the nominee is found wanting, a \n``no'' vote should be cast. But the permanent indecision and passing \nthe buck serves no one. The essential principle in picking a Federal \njudge should be their understanding and commitment to the law. We need \njudges who put the law before personal philosophy, personal ideology, \nand, certainly, personal politics. That is what separates and protects \nan independent judiciary system from the mere politicized legislative \nbranch.\n  When it comes to confirming judges, the primary criteria should be \njudicial and legal competence. The men and women who make up the \nFederal judiciary should be the best people available for the job, \nexperienced, knowledgeable, and well versed in the law. Their job is \ntoo important to be determined by any single issue or political litmus \ntest.\n  I hope at the end of this debate, whether it ends tonight, whether it \nends tomorrow, whether it ends next week, that we can come together in \na bipartisan way to look these two judges in the eye and say: We are \ngoing to give you an up-or-down vote. I think you are qualified and I \nwill vote yes, or I think you are not qualified and I will vote no. \nThat is our obligation. That is our duty. That is the direction in \nwhich we must move.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, once again, I rise to speak on behalf of \nthe nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I am very honored to do so. As we all know, the debate over \nthis nomination will take place within the context of a historic \nconstitutional struggle over the President's right to obtain an up-or-\ndown vote for his judicial nominees.\n  In all seven of these cases--in all seven--each of them has \nbipartisan up-or-down majority support. All we ask is they get a vote.\n  Now, that will be resolved soon enough, but we should not forget that \nthis is a fight worth having because this campaign of ongoing \nobstruction is depriving us of good and needed judges such as Priscilla \nOwen. We should not forget that in the end this debate is about the \nindividual nominees and their qualifications for service on the Federal \nbench. This is a debate about Justice Priscilla Owen, and I am proud to \nsupport her.\n  Because Justice Owen's nomination has never come up for an up-or-down \nvote, I have had 4 years to consider this nomination and to get to know \nher personally, and to further familiarize myself with her record on \nand off the bench. The passage of time has only strengthened my \nconviction that she is wholly deserving of a seat on the Federal bench. \nShe is a woman of real accomplishments, and the State of Texas is \njustifiably proud of her. I am proud of her. I am confident that if she \nis ever given the vote she deserves, she will do our country proud as a \nFederal circuit court of appeals judge.\n  In her years as a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, Priscilla Owen \nhas demonstrated the cautious, impartial mind and the willingness to \nlisten that we seek from our judges in this country. Both her private \npractice--where she became one of the first to break through the \n``glass ceiling'' for women, became a major partner in one of the major \nlaw firms in the country, after being first in her class in law school, \nfirst on the bar examination, with the highest grade there--and her \nactions on the bench provide examples of the honor and dignity that an \nindividual can bring to the practice of law.\n  Finally, she has comported herself with confidence and \nprofessionalism in the face of exaggerations and unfair complaints \nlodged against her by interest groups--the outside, leftwing interest \ngroups--committed to her defeat. The people of Texas have recognized \nthese attributes in Judge Owen and rewarded her twice by electing her \nand reelecting her to the Texas Supreme Court. In fact, she was \nreelected with 84 percent of the vote. Yet some try to characterize her \nas somehow outside of the mainstream.\n  How can they justify that? For 4 long years now, her nomination has \nlanguished as a result of a deliberate and systematic strategy to deny \nup-or-down votes to the President's majority-supported nominees. They \nclaim nominees such as Justice Owen are extremists and conservative \nactivists. Her record does not support these assertions, and I commend \nthe President for renominating this eminently qualified jurist. In \ncontrast to the false charge that she is an extremist--and I might add, \nhow can she be an extremist and have the highest approval of the \nAmerican Bar Association, certainly not a conservative group? So in \ncontrast to the false charge that she is an extremist, the fact is \nPriscilla Owen is one of those relatively few nominees who received a \nunanimously well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association, \nthe highest rating possible.\n  I am under no illusions here. The Senate is a unique, deliberative \ninstitution where the opportunity for serious debate must be vigilantly \nprotected. Unfortunately, it seems likely that not many are going to \nhave their minds changed by this debate. I hope the newly elected \nMembers of the Senate will pay close attention to the facts surrounding \nthe nomination of Priscilla Owen.\n  The Senate already knows Justice Owen quite well. We have spent \nliterally hundreds of hours discussing her nomination. Many Senators \nhave probably made up their minds. But for many people, this inside-\nthe-beltway dispute is just now starting to draw attention. Only now, \nas this debate is coming to a head, is it the leading story on the \nnetwork nightly news. Therefore, it is as much for the American people \ntuning into this debate as it is for my colleagues here that I want to \naddress a handful of the unfair charges being made against her. And we \nhave heard them here on the floor today.\n  Justice Owen graduated first in her class from Baylor Law School. She \nreceived the highest score on the State bar exam. She went on to become \na partner in the prestigious firm of Andrews & Kurth.\n  She was admitted to practice before various State and Federal courts. \nShe is a member of the American Law Institute, a prestigious \norganization; the American Judicature Society, the American Bar \nAssociation, and a fellow of the American and Houston Bar Foundations. \nIn short, she possesses all the attributes and membership in \ntraditional legal organizations that are recognized by all of us, and \nthese organizations place her firmly in the mainstream of all American \nlawyers and of American jurisprudence.\n\n  Committed to the principle of equal justice for all, she participated \non the\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\ncommittee that successfully encouraged the Texas legislature to enact \nlegislation resulting in millions of dollars per year in additional \nfunds for providers of legal services to the poor. Does that sound like \nan extremist?\n  This is the resume of somebody fully within the mainstream of our \nlegal community. It is not the resume of a radical or an extremist, as \nhas been portrayed by some in this body on the other side. It is the \nresume of a successful attorney who went on to serve the public as a \njustice on the Texas Supreme Court.\n  She carried these mainstream professional habits, honed in private \npractice, with her into her career as a judge on the Texas Supreme \nCourt. It is worth reconsidering what she had to say before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee during her first confirmation hearing way back on \nJuly 1, 2002. In her opening statement, she referred to the four \nprinciples that guide her decisionmaking as a judge. I am quoting her \nhere.\n  Now, these are her four rules she lives by.\n\n       No. 1: Always remember that the people that come into my \n     court are real people with real problems.\n       No. 2: When it is a statute that is before me, I must \n     enforce it as you in the Congress or in the State \n     legislature, as the case may be, have written it, unless it \n     is unconstitutional.\n       No. 3: I must strictly follow United States Supreme Court \n     precedent.\n       No. 4: Judges must be independent, both from public opinion \n     and from the parties and lawyers who appear before them.\n\n  That is a statement of Justice Priscilla Owen before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on July 21, 2002. This is hardly radical stuff. In \nfact, I would wager a vast majority of the American people agree with \nthose principles.\n  Yet to listen to those committed to stonewalling this nomination--she \nhas now been waiting 4 years for this vote--you would walk away with a \nvery different impression, if you listened to them. I have been \ndebating judicial nominations for a long time--all 29 years of my \nservice in the Senate--but these most recent attacks are novel ones. \nThe insistence on denying Justice Owen and other nominees up-or-down \nvotes is part of a larger story dating back over 20 years now.\n  In those earlier debates, some committed to an activist judiciary \nused to wear the label ``judicial activist'' proudly on their sleeves. \nOver time, however, they have come to understand that the American \npeople like their judges interpreting rather than making the laws. \nJudges should behave as judges, not junior auxiliaries to the \nlegislative branch. So now they charge conservative nominees with being \nactivists as well.\n  This is the principle charge against Justice Owen. The American \npeople are going to have to make up their own minds on this, but to me \nit is very clear that argument does not hold any water. Look at her \nrecord. Look at those who are behind her. Look at all the Democrats who \nhave supported her.\n  The abortion rights lobbyists focus their attention on a series of \nJustice Owen's opinions in cases involving the Texas parental \nnotification statute. It is worth noting that contrary to the wishes of \na vast majority of Americans, and the Supreme Court, groups such as the \nNational Abortion Rights Action League oppose even these modest popular \nrestrictions on abortion rights, that are supported by 80 percent of \nthe American people. The reality is it is Justice Owen, not these \ngroups, who is in the mainstream. The groups are the ones who are \noutside of the mainstream.\n  By the way, these are far-left Democratic Party groups that are far \noutside the mainstream in their interpretation. Anybody who disagrees \nwith them on anything is ``outside of the mainstream'' or \n``extremist.'' Unfortunately, some of our colleagues parrot what they \nsay and what they tell them to say.\n\n  In Texas, the law requires that a minor notify her parents of her \ndecision to have an abortion. That is what the law of Texas says. This \nis common in many States. Such statutes receive broad bipartisan \nsupport. I have mentioned 80 percent of the American people support \nthese types of statutes. Yet, in their wisdom, the Texas legislature \nprovided an opportunity for a judicial bypass of this notification of \nparents requirement in certain circumstances.\n  Judge Owen has been vilified in her dissent in the case of In re Doe \nI where she had to interpret the State's requirement that a minor \nseeking a judicial bypass of the notification of parents requirement \ndemonstrate sufficient maturity to get the bypass. A fair reading of \nthat opinion shows you Justice Owen made a reasonable interpretation of \nthe Texas law.\n  The other day it was reported that Nancy Keenan, the president of the \nabortion advocacy group the National Abortion Rights Advocacy League, \nsaid she is committed to keeping what she called ``out of touch \ntheological activists'' off the bench. I can only hope this talking \npoint was not aimed at Justice Owen's decision, which is certainly well \nwithin the mainstream and supported by 80 percent of the American \npeople. If so, her point misses the point entirely. Sadly, it seems \nthat the deliberate misreading of Justice Owen's opinion may be for the \nsole purpose of raising ill-founded doubts against Justice Owen and \nother qualified nominees.\n  Priscilla Owen only interpreted the law to require that a minor \nseeking an abortion fully understand the importance of the choice she \nis making and be mature enough to make that choice. I thought these \ngroups were in favor of supporting the right to make an informed \nchoice. When it comes to Justice Owen, I guess it is easier to unfairly \ntar her as an anti-abortion activist.\n  This is a false charge, and it is contrary to the laws of many States \nand other laws as well. Yet some interest groups keep feeding this same \nmisleading information to journalists around the country. Just last \nnight, the evening news on one of the major networks reported as fact \nthe patently false charge that Attorney General Gonzales called Justice \nOwen a judicial activist when he was her colleague on the Texas Supreme \nCourt. This charge was made again this morning by the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. Think about that. They know this claim is fiction, \nbut they nonetheless continue to launch it as though people should \nbelieve it, even though it is fiction.\n  Attorney General Gonzales confirmed this under oath--he was not \ncriticizing Justice Owen--in his January 6, 2005, confirmation hearing, \nand it is clear to anyone who bothers to read the opinions that he \nnever referred to Owen or any other judge on the Texas Supreme Court as \na judicial activist. He was basically referring to himself. He felt if \nhe didn't rule the way he did, he would be a judicial activist. He \ndidn't make any criticism of her. But to read the newspapers and to \nhear the television broadcasters and to listen to our colleagues on the \nother side, they completely distort what Attorney General Gonzales \nsays. As a matter of fact, Attorney General Gonzales was one of the \nstrongest supporters of Priscilla Owen because she is a terrific \njustice, as he knows because he served side by side with her on the \nTexas Supreme Court.\n  In the end, I am happy to have this debate. The American people know \njudicial activism when they see it. Just last week a Federal judge in \nNebraska invalidated a State constitutional amendment preserving \ntraditional marriage in that State. If that opinion is upheld, that \nwill bind every State in the Union under the full faith and credit \nclause. Talk about activism.\n  But I am sure that my colleagues on the other side will find that \nthat judge was in the judicial mainstream or the mainstream of American \njurisprudence. If they want to argue that Justice Owen's interpretation \nof a popular parental notification statute is an activist one, I will \nbe here to debate that all day long. I might add that parents, in many \nof the cases, who are concerned about their daughters, ought to have at \nleast the privilege of being in a position to help their daughters \nthrough those trying times. That is what the courts and the statutes \nhave said. That is what any reasonable person would say. Yet they brand \nPriscilla Owen as an extremist.\n  Why didn't the American Bar Association do that? Why did the American \nBar Association give her the highest possible rating that you can get? \nDuring the Clinton years that was the gold standard, the absolute gold \nstandard. Why isn't it the gold standard today? Why is this really \nterrific person being called a judicial activist, outside of the\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\nmainstream, and an extremist? It is awful.\n  Those opposed to Justice Owen ignore the host of decisions in which \nshe protected workers, consumers, the environment, crime victims, and \nthe poor--as though she didn't care about people. There is a host of \ndecisions where she has shown great care for people. They select \nindividual things and then distort them. It makes you wonder what their \nobjection to this nominee really is. It is clear they are not really \ninterested in having a serious debate on the merits of Justice Owen's \nnomination. For whatever reason, they are dead set on not having her on \nthe Federal bench.\n\n  We are going to hear her described as an out-of-control activist. \nThat couldn't be further from the truth. The senior Senator from \nMassachusetts has called her and others of the President's nominees \nNeanderthals. Come on here. This is supposed to be a sophisticated \nbody. These are decent people. She was supported by virtually everybody \nin the State of Texas in her last reelection--84 percent of the vote--\nevery bar association president and former president, 15 of them, every \nmajor editorial board. And we know they are not generally in favor of \nRepublicans, but they all supported her.\n  She was first in her law school class, best bar exam in the State, \npartner in a major law firm, broke through the glass ceiling. She is a \nsitting justice on the Texas Supreme Court, reelected by an enormous \nmajority, unanimously well-qualified rating from the American Bar \nAssociation. And she is a Neanderthal? Give me a break.\n  That is how far these debates have deteriorated over the years, \nespecially when you find a moderate to conservative woman such as \nPriscilla Owen or a moderate to conservative African-American justice \nlike Janice Rogers Brown.\n  Janice Rogers Brown, think about it--sharecropper's daughter, worked \nher way through college and law school as a single mother, went on to \nhold three of the highest positions in California State Government, \nState counsel to the Governor of the State of California, then-Governor \nPete Wilson, nominated her for the Supreme Court of California. She \nwrites the majority of the majority opinions on that liberal court. In \nother words, she is writing for all the of judges on that court in the \nmajority opinions. She is a terrific human being. Her problem is she is \na conservative African-American jurist, approved by the American Bar \nAssociation. And they call her an extremist.\n  We have had negotiations here where they were willing to throw these \ntwo women, Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown, off the cliff in \nfavor of three or four men, white males, all of whom deserved being \nconfirmed themselves. I thought they were all bad and extremist, \naccording to them. Why would they allow any of them to go through? Then \nagain, if they are not, why haven't they voted for them and why have \nthey filibustered?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me acknowledge that the \nsenior Senator from Utah is so much more knowledgeable on all these \nissues than most of the rest of us--certainly much more than I am. He \nhas been on the committee and has chaired the Judiciary Committee. He \nknows these things. He is an attorney. I am none of the above. I chair \na committee called Environment and Public Works. But I think it is \nimportant for those of us who are not living this every day to express \nourselves because we have just as strong feelings, even though we don't \nwork with this on a daily basis.\n  Mr. President, what is the question pending before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination of Priscilla Owen to be U.S. \ncircuit judge.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today, I want to enter into this debate, \nas we have so many times, on these judicial nominees, including Justice \nPriscilla Owen and Justice Janice Rogers Brown, both of whom are highly \nqualified.\n  Priscilla Owen was nominated by President Bush to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit, a seat that has been designated a \njudicial emergency by the Judicial Conference of the United States. \nThat means we have to fill the seat. She has served on the Texas \nSupreme Court since 1994 and was endorsed for reelection by every major \nTexas newspaper. She practiced commercial litigation for 17 years. She \nreceived her undergraduate degree from Baylor University and graduated \nthird in her class from Baylor Law School in 1977. The American Bar \nAssociation has unanimously rated Justice Owen as ``well-qualified,'' \nthe highest possible rating. She is the first nominee considered well-\nqualified by the ABA to be denied a floor vote by the Democrats.\n  Priscilla Owen even has significant bipartisan support from three \nformer Democrat judges on the Texas Supreme Court and a bipartisan \ngroup of 15 past presidents of the State Bar Association of Texas. \nJustice Owen has served the legal field in many capacities. She was \nliaison to the Texas Supreme Court's mediation task force and on \nstatewide committees on providing legal services to the poor and pro \nbono legal services. She has always been very sensitive to the poor.\n  Justice Owen organized a group called Family Law 2000, which warns \nparents about the difficulties children face when parents go through a \ndivorce.\n  Similarly, President Bush has nominated Justice Brown to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the DC Circuit. This morning, I was at the White \nHouse. As I came back, I walked by that district court office and \nthought very much at that time about Justice Brown. She currently \nserves as an associate justice on the California Supreme Court, a \nposition she has held since 1996. She is the first African-American \nwoman to serve on California's highest court and was retained with 76 \npercent of the statewide vote in her last election.\n  It is kind of interesting that they use the term ``out of the \nmainstream'' quite often. Yet here is someone who got 76 percent of the \nvote in a statewide election. Justice Owen actually got 84 percent. I \ndon't think anybody in this body has been able to gain those \nmajorities.\n  Justice Brown was the daughter of a sharecropper. She was born in \nGreenville, AL, in 1949. She grew up attending segregated schools \nduring the practice of Jim Crow policies in the South. Her family moved \nto Sacramento, CA, when she was in her teens, and she later received \nher B.A. in economics from California State, and earned her J.D. from \nUCLA School of Law in 1977.\n  She has participated in a variety of statewide and community \norganizations dedicated to improving the quality of life for all \ncitizens of California.\n  For example, she has served as a member of the California Commission \non the Status of African-American Males, as a member of the Governor's \nChild Support Task Force, and as a member of the Community Learning \nAdvisory Board of the Rio Americano High School.\n  Two weeks ago, my colleague in the other Chamber, Congressman Dan \nLungren of California--he is a Congressman I served with for many years \nwhen I was in the other body, and he went on to be the Attorney General \nfrom the State of California. He spoke of his professional experience \nwith Justice Brown. I really think it is important to go back to people \nwho have served with them at the grassroots level. He was in State \ngovernment with her in the early 1990s. Congressman Lungren said:\n\n        . . . It is my observation that in the absence of the \n     opportunity to be voted up or down, to be subjected to a \n     debate on the floor of the United States Senate in the \n     context of such a consideration, that in fact the Janice \n     Rogers Brown that I know in the State of California . . . is \n     not the person that I hear discussed, the person that I hear \n     characterized, or the person that I see presented in the \n     press and other places.\n       When I was elected the attorney general in the State of \n     California and took office in January of 1991, I asked a \n     number of people who had previously served in the attorney \n     general's Office for recommendations of people who should \n     serve at the top level of the department of justice in my \n     administration. Her name (Justice Brown) was always offered \n     by those who had experience in that office.\n       During the confirmation hearings that we had, I had the \n     opportunity to review the opinions that she had written while \n     on the appellate court. Interestingly enough, every single \n     member of the appellate court on which she served recommended \n     her confirmation to the California supreme court. I recall at \n     the time that the chief justice of the California supreme \n     court, Justice Ron George, surprised the public hearing that \n     we had by actually putting on the table every\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\n     single written opinion that she had done and advising \n     everybody there that he had read every opinion that she had \n     written at that point in time, not once but twice, and \n     rendering his opinion that she was well qualified to serve on \n     the California supreme court.\n\n  Further quoting:\n\n       If you look at her opinions, they are the opinions of \n     someone who understands what I believe jurists ought to \n     understand, that their obligation is to interpret the law, \n     not make the law.\n\n  He concluded his statement by saying:\n\n       My point this evening is a simple one. That which we are \n     observing in the Senate is denying the American people an \n     opportunity to review the nominees of the President of the \n     United States. It is my belief that Janice Brown should be \n     presented to the United States Senate for consideration. She \n     is an American story. From the humblest background, she has \n     risen to the highest court in the most populous State in the \n     Nation. She subscribes to a judicial philosophy considered \n     radical in some circles, that the text of the Constitution \n     actually means something. She holds to a consistent \n     enforcement of individual rights that is not result oriented.\n       In my judgment, these are the qualities of a true jurist \n     and is why she should be confirmed to sit on the DC Circuit \n     Court of Appeals and, at the very least, that her story be \n     told in open debate on the floor of the United States Senate \n     in the context of the consideration of her nomination by the \n     whole body.\n\n  That is what we are attempting to do today. This is a debate that \ncould quickly be brought to an end by a simple up-or-down vote. We \noffered the minority as much time as they wanted to debate these \nnominees, as long as an up-or-down vote would follow. But this hasn't \nhappened.\n  As a matter of fact, at least seven of my colleagues from the other \nside of the aisle have actually stated the same thing--that nominees \ndeserve an up-or-down vote regarding previous nominees, and they all \nreceived an up-or-down vote. The same people now that are objecting to \nan up-or-down vote are the ones who stood up and said we think they \nshould have an up-or-down vote previously. Somehow that has changed \nfrom the 1990s, and they don't want that.\n  Let me remind them that Senator Durbin said this on September 28, \n1998: We should vote the person up or down. That is all we want.\n  Senator Feinstein, on September 16, 1999, said a nominee is entitled \nto a vote. Vote them up or down.\n  Again, Senator Feinstein, a month later, said in October of 1999:\n\n       Our institutional integrity requires an up-or-down vote.\n\n  That is what we are talking about, our institutional integrity. I \nagree with Senator Feinstein from 1999.\n  On March 7, 2000, Senator Kennedy said:\n\n       The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court said, ``The \n     Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry, \n     it should vote him up or down, which is exactly what I would \n     like.\n\n  Senator Lautenberg said:\n\n       Talking about the fairness in the system and how it is \n     equitable for a minority to restrict the majority view, why \n     can we not have a straight up-or-down vote?\n\n  That was on June 21, 1995.\n  Senator Leahy, who actually chaired that committee, said:\n\n       When President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the U.S. \n     Supreme Court, I was the first Member of the Senate to \n     declare my opposition to his nomination. I did not believe \n     that Clarence Thomas was qualified to serve on the Court. \n     Even with strong reservations, I felt that Judge Thomas \n     deserved an up-or-down vote.\n\n  Again, 4 years later, Senator Leahy said:\n\n        . . . I also took the floor on occasion to oppose \n     filibusters to hold them up and believe that we should have a \n     vote up or down.\n\n  Senator Lincoln said:\n\n       It's my hope that we'll take the necessary steps to give \n     these men and these women especially the up-or-down vote that \n     they deserve.\n\n  That was in the year 2000.\n  Senator Sarbanes said:\n\n       It is not whether you let the President have his nominees \n     confirmed. You will not even let them be considered . . . \n     with an up-or-down vote.\n\n  I could go on and on. In fact, I did the other day. I went over so \nmany of these people who are demanding an up-or-down vote. Not only are \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle holding up these qualified \njudges by not allowing an up-or-down vote, I also believe they are \ndiscriminating against people of faith.\n  I will reiterate a quote from an article in the L.A. Times that I \nread on the floor in April regarding the filibuster of qualified \nnominees, such as Justices Owen and Brown. It states, and I am quoting \nnow the L.A. Times which has never been accused of being a Republican \nnewspaper:\n\n       These are confusing days in Washington. Born-again \n     conservative Christians who strongly want to see President \n     Bush's judicial nominees voted on are leading the charge \n     against the Senate filibuster, and liberal Democrats are \n     born-again believers in that reactionary, obstructionist \n     legislative tactic. Practically every big-name liberal \n     senator you can think of derided the filibuster a decade ago \n     and now sees the error of his or her ways and will go to \n     amusing lengths to try to convince you that the change of \n     heart is explained by something deeper than the mere \n     difference between being in the majority and being in the \n     minority.\n\n  I know that both Justice Brown and Justice Owen are active members of \nchurches and are distinguished women of faith.\n  Justice Brown has taught adult Sunday school at her church for more \nthan 10 years, and Justice Owen teaches Sunday school and is the head \nof the altar guild at her church.\n  One has to ask the question, Have we come to the point in America \nwhere Sunday school teachers are disqualified by the strength of their \nfaith and the boldness of their beliefs?\n  The Bible urges us, like Justices Brown and Owen, to be bold in our \nfaith. I Timothy 3:13 says:\n\n       For they that have used the office of a deacon well \n     purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in \n     the faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n\n  Hebrews 4:16 says:\n\n       Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that \n     we may obtain mercy. . . .\n\n  I agree with Justice Brown, as she recently told an audience, that \npeople of faith were embroiled in a war against secular humanists who \nthreatened to divorce America from its religious roots, according to a \nnewspaper quoted in an April 26, L.A. Times article.\n  One example of this attack is our parental notification and consent \nlaws which require girls under 18 who are seeking an abortion to either \nnotify or obtain permission--either notify or obtain permission--from \none or both of her parents. Many States have such laws. However, there \nare many instances where these protective laws have been struck down by \nliberal judges who are bypassing the law and legislating from the \nbench.\n  For example, on August 5, 1997, the California Supreme Court issued \nits decision in American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren. The court \nheld that the 1987 statute requiring minors seeking abortion to obtain \nparental consent or judicial authorization violates the California \nConstitution's explicit right to privacy.\n  This is outrageous. Parents have a right to know what their children \nare doing. Children who are not old enough to vote or drink, why should \nthey be old enough to have an abortion without at least telling their \nparents? We are not talking about getting permission, we are talking \nabout notifying them.\n  In another case, Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, the Supreme Court \nheld that statutes, which allow a parent or guardian to absolutely \nprohibit an abortion to be performed on a minor child, were \nunconstitutional.\n  There are a number of such cases. The whole point is this is \noutrageous.\n  We keep hearing people say these two justices are out of mainstream \nAmerica, and I suggest to you, Mr. President, that it is the \nindividuals who are making the accusations who are out of the \nmainstream. It was not long ago that they did polling on all these \ntraditional values, and it would seem to me that the traditional values \nare in the mainstream. It is the liberals who are opposing \nthese nominations who are out of the mainstream.\n\n  To give an example, by 85 to 15 percent, Americans say religion is \nvery or fairly important in their lives. Only 15 percent say it is \nunimportant.\n  In the case of Government should help faith-based initiatives to help \nthe poor, 72 percent of Americans agree. On the issue of whether \nviolent attackers of pregnant women who kill the baby should be \nprosecuted for killing the baby, 84 percent say yes. That is \nmainstream.\n  On the issue of whether children should be allowed to pray in school, \n78 percent of Americas agree.\n  And 73 percent of Americans favor a law requiring women under the age \nof\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\n18 to get parental consent for any abortion. Democrats are with the 24 \npercent who oppose it.\n  That is mainstream America, Mr. President. Also, 74 percent oppose \nremoving all references to God from oaths of public office--74 \npercent--and 91 percent of Americans want to keep the phrase ``under \nGod'' in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  Those who are opposing them are on the other side of these issues. I \nsuggest this all averages to over 78 percent of the American people \nbelieve these issues, and that is clearly the will of the American \npeople. That is mainstream. That is what our Founding Fathers talked \nabout when they founded this great country, this one Nation under God.\n  We have said it over and over again. I see the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada is here to speak. I agree with all the liberal Democratic \nSenators who in the 1990s said: All we want is an up-or-down vote; that \nis all we are asking today. They got theirs, now we deserve ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the issue of judicial \nnominees, their confirmation process and whether nominees should \nreceive an up-or-down vote.\n  We are currently discussing Justice Priscilla Owen and her nomination \nto the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. There has been a lot said about \nthis nominee. Her qualifications have been enumerated on the Senate \nfloor. We have heard that she was elected with 84 percent of the vote \nin Texas. This is a very large percentage that represents overwhelming \nsupport in her home State of Texas.\n  My Democrat colleagues have questioned her position on the issue of \nparental notification. As my friend and colleague from the State of \nOklahoma talked about, parental notification is supported by nearly 80 \npercent of the American people.\n  Before a school nurse gives a child an aspirin, the school will ask \nfor the parent's permission. When it comes to an abortion, which is a \nsurgical procedure, abortion providers do not want to be held to the \nsame standard. The vast majority of the American people believe that a \nparent should be notified before a surgical procedure, like an \nabortion, is performed on a child.\n  The parental notification cases that Priscilla Owen has heard while \nserving on the Texas Supreme Court all involved a lower court decision \nthat the child should tell a parent about her desire to have an \nabortion. So in many of these cases, Justice Owen was upholding the \ndetermination of the lower court judge who had directly listened to the \ntestimony of the minor who wanted an abortion.\n  In these cases, there was disagreement among the justices on the \nTexas Supreme Court, but in cases where she voted in favor of parental \nnotice, her determination was the same as the lower court. It was very \nreasonable. Anybody could look at that and say this is a reasonable \nperson.\n  When we review the record of a judicial nominee, when we review their \nopinions, we should ask ``does that judge follow the law?'' We ask ``is \nthis judge well reasoned?'' We ask ``did they look at the facts?'' \nAnybody who has reviewed Priscilla Owen's record and her opinions would \nconclude that she has a good temperament. They would conclude that she \nwas not making law but was interpreting the law according to the way \nthe Texas Legislature had intended. In cases involving parental \nnotification, they would conclude that she had faithfully applied the \nlaw.\n  In addition to discussing Justice Owen's nomination, I also want to \naddress the confirmation process as a whole. In the past, whether it \nwas Judge Robert Bork or Clarence Thomas, Republicans were unhappy with \nthe treatment that some nominees of Republican President's received. \nThe reputation of Judge Bork and Justice Thomas had been attacked. \nThese fine men were vilified. Republicans felt that those nominees were \ntreated unfairly in committee and then on the floor.\n  When President Clinton was President, some of his nominees were \nlikewise mistreated. The committee process was used to delay hearings \nor to bottle up nominees. In most cases though, those nominees were \neventually given an up or down vote. We have heard the other side \ncomplain about the delays that President Clinton's nominees \nexperienced. I believe that the Senate ought to fix that.\n  I think it is damaging to our system of government to deny any \nnominee an up or down vote. The Senate should, whether someone is \nnominated to serve as a judge or in the administration at an agency or \ndepartment, provide each nominee with an up or down vote. The Senate \nshould reject this delaying tactic which denies a nominee a timely up-\nor-down vote in committee and on the Senate floor. We ought to fix the \nwhole process.\n  Unfortunately, both Republicans and Democrats have been escalating \nthe fight over nominees for years. As I pointed out before, many \nRepublicans felt that Judge Bork was mistreated. In response, President \nClinton's nominees were too. What one side does, the other side will \nratchet it up to the next level when they come into power. We can't \nkeep doing that. Neither side is going to win if we continue on this \npath. But the American system of government and the American people \nwill surely lose. Good people will no longer be willing to serve in the \nadministration or in positions on the bench if we can't put an end to \nthis. No American is going to want to have their name put up for a \nposition if they are promised to be treated so horribly.\n  My home State of Nevada is part of the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. A few years ago, Nevada had an opening on the Ninth Circuit. I \nspoke with several people, people who would have been well-qualified as \na candidate. I asked if they would be interested if I put their name \nforward? I consider it a great honor to be on the appellate court. The \ncommon feedback: ``Why would I want to put in my name and go through \nthat process given all that you have to go through?''\n  My fear is that we are discouraging the very type of people who \nshould apply for these positions from doing so. We need the absolute \nbest legal minds to serve on the appeals courts and Supreme Court that \nwe can possibly get. It should be an honor to serve there. We should \nnot do anything to dishonor those positions with the political farce \nthat we have going on in the Senate.\n  The Democrats have accused Republicans of wanting to change the \nrules. The rules changed 2 years ago. And it was the Senate Democrats \nthat changed the rules with a partisan filibuster. A partisan \nfilibuster was never done in the history of the Senate before 2003, \nnever. Search the history books, it is very clear. The two cases \nDemocrats bring up were not partisan filibusters. The one case about \nAbe Fortas, that was clear, he had engaged in objectionable practices \nwhile serving as an associate justice on the Supreme Court and was \nopposed by many Senators in both parties. He was not opposed on a party \nline basis. It was clear to President Johnson that his nominee did not \nhave the votes to be confirmed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  What we call the constitutional option--is an effort to reestablish \nthe tradition of what the Senate has always done. The minority is \ncorrect that filibusters were allowed under the rules. But the people \nwho considered them in the past, the majority of Senators, said it \nwould do too much damage to the institution to actually carry out those \nfilibusters. So, in a bipartisan fashion in the past, before the \nDemocrats led the current filibusters, Senators got together and said: \nWe will go ahead and have up-or-down votes on these nominees.\n  I believe, for the future of this institution and for the future of \nbringing good people to the judiciary, we need to fix this process once \nand for all. Whether it is a Republican President or a Democrat \nPresident and whether Republicans or Democrats are in control of the \nSenate, regardless of which party is in charge, good people should have \nan up-or-down vote in a timely fashion in committee as well as on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I hope we can join across the aisle and fix this. I actually thought \nwe should have fixed it last year before the Presidential election. I \ntried to extend my hand across the aisle last year and say to \nDemocrats: We don't know who is going to win the Presidential election, \nso let's put something in place now so that the filibuster will not \ncontinue after the 2004 elections.\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\n  I don't think it should matter whether it is a Republican President \nor Democrat President sending nominees up here. It is OK to vote \nagainst them, but I don't believe that only 40 Senators of one party \nshould be able to choose who is on the bench.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will conclude very briefly with this. \nFor the good of our country, for the balance of powers, we need to end \nthis process of filibustering good people. These good people deserve an \nup-or-down vote. It is only fair. Let's join together in a bipartisan \nfashion to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority now controls 90 minutes.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, ``how a minority, reaching majority, \nseizing authority, hates the minority'' is attributed by the Library of \nCongress to a Leonard Robinson, in 1968. So I guess there is a \nhistorical precedent for the attitudes of the majority in the Senate \ntoday. The minority is treated often with contempt and disdain. \nPresiding Officers read their mail or sign photos while our Members \nspeak on the Senate floor. Democratic conferees are excluded from the \ncommittee meetings. Our Democratic Senate leader is again smeared and \ntargeted as an obstructionist. For what? For leading the minority \nparty's lawful and proper dissent to the policies and practices of the \nmajority, as though the expression of dissent on the floor of the \nSenate were improper or un-American or, now we are even being told, un-\nChristian, when, in fact, it is the intolerance of dissent that is \nimproper, undemocratic, and the charges that political or policy \ndisagreements here are actions ``against people of faith'' are the \nslurs of charlatans.\n  We are at this brink because during President Bush's first term, our \nDemocratic caucus blocked approval of 10 of the President's judicial \nnominees, while 208 of his nominees were confirmed. That is a 95-\npercent approval rate. Ninety-five percent of President Bush's judicial \nnominees were confirmed by the Senate, but that is not good enough for \nthis majority and this President. Nothing less than 100 percent is \nacceptable. It has to be their way all the time.\n  A President who said he was going to change the tone in Washington, \npromote bipartisanship, encourage democracy, does just the opposite. He \ndemands congressional submission, insists on his way always, denounces \nand tries to destroy whoever disagrees with him.\n  I am astonished that the Senate Republican leadership has flip-\nflopped just because the President is now Republican instead of \nDemocratic. Republicans were in the majority in the Senate for the last \n6 years of President Bill Clinton's two terms, and they certainly did \nnot champion their now precious principle of an up-or-down vote for the \nfull Senate for each of his judicial nominees. To the contrary, they \nthemselves prevented--or condoned others preventing--69 of President \nClinton's judicial nominees from a vote by the full Senate. Many were \ndenied confirmation hearings. Sometimes one Senator singlehandedly \nblocked judicial nominations. They received no votes by the Senate, not \nby part of the Senate, not by all of the Senate, not once, not ever, \nnot this year, not next year, not in 4 years, not ever--69 judicial \nnominations. Republican leaders not only defended their actions to deny \nconfirmation votes to Clinton nominees, they bragged about it.\n\n  Here are some of the statements they made at the time:\n\n       The confirmation process is not a numbers game and I will \n     not compromise the Senate's advise and consent function \n     simply because the White House has sent us nominees that are \n     either not qualified or controversial.\n\n  Another:\n\n       So we are not abusing our advise and consent power. As a \n     matter of fact, I don't think we have been aggressive enough \n     in utilizing it to ensure that nominees to the Federal bench \n     are mainstream nominees. Do I have any apologies? Only one, I \n     probably moved too many judicial nominations already. When I \n     go around my State or around the country the last thing I \n     hear people clamoring for is more lifetime tenured Federal \n     judges.\n\n  Regarding the use of the filibuster, Republican leaders were equally \nemphatic:\n\n       It is very important that one faction or one party not be \n     able to ride roughshod over the minority and impose its will. \n     The Senate is not the House.\n\n  The filibuster is one of the few tools the minority has to protect \nitself and those the minority represents. Clearly, what distinguishes \nthe Senate as a legislative body is unlimited debate, a traditional \naspect that most Senators have felt very important for 200 years. The \nonly way to protect minority views in the Senate is through extended \ndebate.\n  Their judicial blocking tactics are right, but ours are wrong. Their \nuse of the filibuster is good, and ours is bad. How convenient. How \nself-serving. And how wrong.\n  It is bad enough that the Senate Republican leadership wants to \nchange the Senate rules to suit their purposes and disregard 214 years \nof bipartisan institutional wisdom which understood and cared about the \nproper role of the Senate in our carefully designed system of checks \nand balances. As James Madison, one of our Constitution's principal \narchitects, said during the Constitutional Convention in 1787:\n\n       In order to judge the form to be given to the Senate, take \n     a view of the ends to be served by it. First, to protect the \n     people against the rulers. Second, to protect the people \n     against the transient impressions which they themselves must \n     be led.\n\n  It is bad enough the Republican leadership wants to weaken the \nSenate's historic role and present responsibility. But what is even \nworse, much worse, is that they evidently intend to violate the \nprocedures and disregard the rules by which the Senate can properly \nchange one of its existing rules. They are going to use their own new \nand unprecedented procedure and disregard a ruling of the professional \nparliamentarian that their procedure violates Senate rules.\n  A senior Republican aide was quoted in today's Washington Post that \nSenator Frist does not plan to consult the Senate Parliamentarian at \nthe time the nuclear option is deployed. The Parliamentarian ``has \nnothing to do with this. He is a staffer and we don't have to ask his \nopinion.''\n  Of course they don't because they are going to throw out the existing \nSenate rules that they do not like and make up new rules that they do \nlike. Then they are going to ask the Presiding Officer, one of their \nown, to rule in their favor and then all vote to ratify what they have \njust done, even though it is wrong, and they know it is wrong.\n  They can't change a wrong into a right with a vote. They cannot \ndisguise a shameful abuse of power by calling it a constitutional \noption. There is nothing constitutional about violating Senate rules, \nthere is nothing American about violating Senate rules, and there is \nnothing senatorial about violating Senate rules.\n  In my career, I have learned to be effective in politics you have to \nbecome a realist. To remain effective, you have to remain an idealist. \nWhen I came to the Senate almost 4\\1/2\\ years ago, I was both realistic \nand idealistic. I knew that the legislative process brings out the best \nand the worst in people. But I thought the Senate would inspire more of \nthe best. That the 1,863 men and women who had preceded me into this \ninstitution, many of them the best, the brightest, and the wisest of \ntheir generations, I thought their collective wisdom embodied in the \nSenate's rules and procedures would elevate our individual conduct and \nour collective actions and protect us and, more importantly, protect \nthe American people from the missteps or the misguided attempts of one \nSenator, of a minority, or even of a majority.\n  My faith in the uplifting effect of the Senate was perhaps wrong or, \nrather, it was right until now. Now we are at the brink of desecrating \nthis great institution. It will be a disgrace and a desecration if the \nRepublican leaders of the Senate disregard longstanding Senate rules \nand substitute their own new rules and if a majority of Senators vote \nto approve this wrongdoing.\n  Everyone here should know whatever their honest differences of \nopinion about Justice Owen, unilaterally breaking rules because you do \nnot like them or because you will not get your way by following them, \nis wrong. It is terribly wrong.\n  Now, why would the Senate's Republican leadership do this to the \ninstitution? To prove what, to whom? This\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\nweek's Congressional Quarterly reports that the Senate majority leader \ntold a group of conservative activists questioning his resolve to \ninvoke the nuclear option:\n\n       Remember, before I came here I used to cut people's hearts \n     out.\n\n  That is a very revealing statement. Not ``saved'' hearts or \n``mended'' hearts, but cut them out.\n  This ploy will cut out the Senate's heart of integrity. Why do it? \nFrom much of what I have read, this is being set up as a presidential \npurity test. I respect the majority leader's right to run for \nPresident. I respect that absolutely. I wish that it would not involve \nthe institution of the Senate.\n  According to the executive director of the American Conservative \nUnion, if he--the majority leader--aspires to the 2008 Republican \nPresidential nomination, it is a test he has to pass. This is pass-\nfail. He does not get a grade here. He cannot get a C for effort. He \nneeds to deliver on this.\n  So this is not a constitutional option. It is a campaign opportunity, \nexcept that Senate leaders are supposed to deliver the Senate from \nthis, from the President--any President--demanding that every one of \nhis nominees be approved by a submissive body, the Senate; from \npolitical zealots and ideological fanatics demanding we give up our \nrole and our responsibility so they can fulfill their delusional \nrantings of how Federal judges cause everything they cannot tolerate. \nBecause there is no doubt about it, getting 218 judges, instead of 208 \njudges, is just their beginning. And then, by God, those judges had \nbetter decide every case just right for them or it is ``impeach, impale \nor eliminate.''\n  Self-anointed evangelist James Dobson--recently, on a national \ntelevised rally appeared with the Senate Republican leader--has called \nthe United States Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy the ``most \ndangerous man in America,'' and he has demanded he be impeached, along \nwith Justices O'Connor, Ginsburg, Souter, Breyer, and Stevens, that is, \nsix of the nine members of the Supreme Court that he wants to impeach; \na Court he has compared to Nazism and to the Ku Klux Klan.\n  Not to be outdone, and this is a contest of extreme, incendiary, \nvitriolic hysterics, the director of Operation Rescue has alleged that \nthe courts of this land have become a tool in the hands of the devil, \nby which the culture of death has found access.\n  Pat Robertson has written that the out-of-control judiciary is the \nmost serious threat America has faced in nearly 400 years of history, \nmore serious than al-Qaida, more serious than Nazi Germany and Japan, \nmore serious than the Civil War.\n  Don Feder of Vision America claims:\n\n       Liberal judges have declared unholy war on us, and unless \n     Christians fight back their faith, family, and freedom will \n     be lost.\n\n  He also promised that whatever prominent Republican was willing to \ntake the lead on the issue of judicial reform and impeachment will \nprobably have the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.\n  Not one to miss such an opportunity, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay \ndeclared that the judiciary has ``run amok,'' and poses a threat to \nself-government. He threatens Congress must take action to rein in the \njudiciary and that such actions must be more than rhetoric.\n  And remember, before he came here, he used to exterminate things. So \nthe threat of a congressional leader in running amok to take action \nagainst Federal judges must be taken as ominously as he undoubtedly \nintended it to be.\n  God's will and Jesus's word are hijacked by false prophets like James \nDobson and Pat Robertson. The independence of Federal judges is \nthreatened by Tom DeLay. Now the integrity of the Senate's rules and \nprocedures may be violated. And these are the men who want to run our \ncountry. They want to dictate who is elected, decide who will be \nappointed, and even determine who is on God's side, who is not.\n  Well, if ever--if ever--there were a need for 51 profiles in courage \nin the Senate, it is now, to save this Senate from those who would \nsavage it for their own gain. The world will note and long remember \nwhat we do here, and we will be judged--as we should--whether we acted \nso that, as Abraham Lincoln said, government of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people shall not perish on this Earth or here in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have been traveling around my State, \nlike many of my colleagues have. When I travel around, people keep \nstopping me and asking me: Why should I hear about the judges you are \ndebating back in Washington DC? Whether I am in Spokane talking to \nconstituents at a town meeting or in a grocery store on Saturday or \ntalking to family members at home, they all want to know what we are \ntalking about and why this debate matters in their lives.\n  Well, my answer to those constituents, whether it is someone in a \ngrocery store or just chatting with someone or a family member, is that \nwe are here for a very important reason; that is, to fight for basic \nAmerican values, values all of us hold dear. I tell them we are \nfighting for the rights of minorities so all of us have an opportunity \nfor a voice and a seat at the table. I tell them we are fighting for \nthe constitutional principles that were given to the Senate 200 years \nago.\n  Today, in the Senate, unfortunately, those values are under attack. \nWhat we see in their continuing rush for power is that some here on the \nother side want to turn this great institution simply into a \nrubberstamp for the current administration. Nowhere is that more clear \nto me than with the nomination that is in front of us tonight, and that \nis of Judge Priscilla Owen.\n  Senator Frist said the other day that the only argument he has heard \nagainst Justice Owen is on parental consent. I happen to agree with \nSenator Frist that her views and her decisions on this subject are very \nimportant, but if he has not heard the arguments against Justice Owen, \nI think he has not been listening enough.\n  On everything from parental consent to victims' rights, to workers' \nrights, to bias towards her campaign contributors, Justice Owen is too \nfar out of the mainstream. Her radical views make a lifetime \nappointment inappropriate by this body. Let me take just a few minutes \nto talk about some of those important objections.\n  In Read v. Scott Fetzer Company, a 1998 case, Justice Owen ruled that \na rape victim--a rape victim--could not collect civil damages against a \nvacuum cleaner company that employed an in-home dealer who raped her \nwhile he was demonstrating the company's product even though the \ncompany had failed to check his references, and if they had, they would \nhave found out he had harassed women at his other jobs and previously \nbeen formally charged and fired for inappropriate sexual conduct with a \nchild. But Justice Owen ruled that rape victim could not collect civil \ndamages against that company.\n  I believe it is pretty clear that Justice Owen does not protect \nvictims' rights.\n  In another case, in GTE Southwest, Incorporated v. Bruce, a 1990 \ncase, Justice Owen sided with an employer whom the majority in that \ncase ruled inflicted intentional emotional distress on employees when \nhe subjected them to ``constant humiliating and abusive behavior,'' \nincluding the use of harsh vulgarities, infliction of physical and \nverbal terror, frequent assaults, and physical humiliation. Justice \nOwen wrote her own opinion to make sure it was clear she thought the \nshocking behavior was not enough to support a verdict for the workers.\n\n  It is clear to me that Justice Owen will not protect workers' rights \nand should not be promoted to a lifetime appointment by this body.\n  Justice Owen's record shows she has consistently put huge \ncorporations ahead of people. She took campaign contributions from \ncompanies including Enron and Halliburton, and then she issued rulings \nin their favor. Many of her campaign contributions came from a small \ngroup of special business interests that advanced very clear \nanticonsumer and anti-choice agendas. Critically, her record has shown \nthat\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\nher donors enjoy greater success before her than before the majority of \nthe court. Again, it is very clear to me that Justice Owen will not \nprotect the rights of the people against these huge special interests \nand is not deserving of being promoted to a lifetime appointment by \nthis body.\n  But you do not have to just listen to me. Listen to what some of her \ncolleagues on the Texas Supreme Court said about her decisions.\n  In FM Properties v. City of Austin, the majority called her dissent \n``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric.''\n  In the case of In re Jane Doe III, Justice Enoch wrote specifically \nto rebuke Owen for misconstruing the legislature's definition of the \nsort of abuse that may occur when parents are notified of a minor's \nintent to have an abortion, saying:\n\n       abuse is abuse; it is neither to be trifled with nor its \n     severity to be second guessed.\n\n  And finally, as has been stated by my colleagues on the floor of the \nSenate, now-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, then an Owen colleague, \ncriticized her, not once, not twice, but 10 times in his rulings and \ncalled one of her interpretations of a parental consent law an \n``unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n  Unfortunately, this nomination is before us. This is the type of \nactivist judge we are being asked to give a lifetime appointment. By \nstripping the Senate of its constitutional role, we are seeing the \neffort to pack the courts with radical judges, push an extreme agenda, \nand leave millions of Americans behind.\n  That is why I say to my constituents, whether they walk up to me in a \ngrocery store or it is one of my family members or somebody I am \ntalking to in Spokane or Yakima or Vancouver or Bellingham, the debate \nwe are having is critically important. For the people we promote to \nlifetime appointments, we need to know they will be fair and evenhanded \nand that they will protect the rights of Americans no matter where they \nlive. That is why this fight is important, and that is why my \ncolleagues are here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I see my colleague from Illinois is on the floor. I know he is here \nto speak as well. I yield time to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington who \nhas been on the floor today addressing some of the major issues we are \nconsidering. This is an historic debate. Although there are few people \ngathered on the Senate floor, many people across Capitol Hill and \nacross the Nation are following this debate. This is the first time in \nthe history of the Senate where there is an attempt being made to \nchange one of the most fundamental rules and one of the most \nfundamental values of this institution. To think how many Senators have \ncome and gone in the history of this body--the number is fewer than \n1,900 in total--In all of that time, no Senator has been so bold as to \nstand up and do what we understand the majority leader is likely to do \nvery soon, the so-called nuclear option.\n  Why in the history of this Chamber has no Senator ever done this? \nBecause, frankly, it strikes at the heart of this institution. It goes \nto the value of the Senate in our Constitution. When the Constitution \nwas written, the Senate was created as a different place. I served in \nthe House of Representatives for 14 years. I was proud of that service, \nenjoyed it, and value the House of Representatives and its role. But it \nis a different chamber.\n  The Senate was created so the minority would always have a voice. \nThink about it. There are two Senators from every State, large or \nsmall. Think of the rules of the Senate from the beginning which said: \nNo matter who you are, what Senator you may be, you can take to this \nfloor and do as I am doing at this moment, begin a debate which cannot \nbe closed down unless an extraordinary majority of the Senate makes \nthat decision.\n  Senator Frist, now the Republican majority leader, has decided it is \ntime to change that 200-year tradition, to change the rules of the \nSenate in the middle of the game. By this change, he will change a \nrelationship between the Senate and the President. That is a bold move. \nIt is a move we should think about very seriously. He will have Vice \nPresident Cheney in the chair, but that is no surprise. Every President \nand every Vice President wants more power. That is the nature of our \nGovernment. But the Founding Fathers understood that, not just as a \nhuman impulse but a political impulse. They said: The way we will \nrestrain too much power in the Presidency is to have checks and \nbalances, to give to other branches of Government--the judiciary and \nthe legislative branch--an opportunity to check the power of the \nPresident. We think about that today, and the rules of the Senate were \npart of those checks and balances.\n  A President can't appoint a judge to a lifetime appointment without \nthe advice and consent of the Senate. In other words, the President's \npower is limited by the power of the Senate to advise and consent. The \nwords were carefully chosen. The Senate wasn't directed to always \napprove the President's nominees. The President submits the nominees \nand the Senate, as a separate institution of Government, makes the \ndecision as to whether those nominees will go forward. That is a \nlimitation on the President's power.\n  This President, when we take a look at the record of how many judges \nhe has submitted and how many have been approved, has done quite well \nfor himself. This is the score for President Bush since he has been \nelected President: 208 of his judicial nominees have been approved, and \nonly 10 have not. More than 95 percent of this President's nominees \nhave been approved by the Senate.\n  How far back do you have to go to find another President with a \nbatting record this good? Twenty-five years. This President has done \nbetter than any President in the last 25 years in having his judicial \nnominees approved. But from President Bush's point of view, from Vice \nPresident Cheney's point of view, it is not good enough. He wants them \nall. He wants every single one of them, without dissent, without \ndisagreement, without debate in the Senate. He wants them all.\n  Should every President have that power? I don't think so. Republican \nor Democrat, Presidents have to know they can go too far. They can make \nbad decisions, decisions which take America down a path that is not \nright. And they should know they will be held accountable for making \nthose decisions. They should know they can come up with the names of \nnominees who are not good people for lifetime appointments and that \nwhen they come to the Senate, the Senate will review them and may say \nno. It is that check and balance which makes the difference.\n  One of the central arguments that has been made over and over again \nabout triggering the nuclear option, which Senator Frist is preparing \nto do, is the assertion that the Senate has never denied a judicial \nnominee with majority support an up-or-down vote. That argument is \nplain wrong and it is misleading. President Clinton had 61 judicial \nnominees who never received an up-or-down vote. I know. I was here. I \nwatched it. I watched it as Senator Orrin Hatch and the Judiciary \nCommittee buried these nominees, refused to even give them a hearing. \nAn up-or-down vote? They didn't get close to even an invitation to \nWashington. Nominated by the President, they were ignored and rejected \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee. Now we have these pious \npronouncements that every judicial nominee deserves an up-or-down vote. \nI don't know if it is the water in Washington, water out of the Potomac \nRiver. It seems to create political amnesia among those who serve in \nthe Senate. Some of the same Senators on the Republican side who have \ncome to the floor and said every nominee deserves an up-or-down vote \nwere the Senators who were stopping the nominees of President Clinton \nwithout so much as a hearing.\n\n  ``We want fairness.'' They sure didn't want fairness when it came to \nthat President and his nominees.\n  I am sure the vast majority of them, probably all of them, would have \nhad majority support, had they received an up-or-down vote. But they \nwere stopped in committee. I know it. I used to go and plead for judges \nfrom Illinois nominated by President Clinton. I can recall Senators--\nand I won't name names; I could--who just told me no. We are not going \nto let President Clinton fill these courts. We are hoping he will be \ngone soon, and we will put a Republican President in. We will take\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\ncare of those vacancies. We have some people we want to put on those \nspots. The fairness of an up-or-down vote wasn't the case around here \nat all. It was fundamentally unfair.\n  The Republicans exercised their filibusters, these pocket \nfilibusters, against 61 nominees from President Clinton's White House \nwho never received a vote in the Judiciary Committee. And the myth of \nthe up-or-down vote is also demonstrated by looking at the history of \nSupreme Court nominations.\n  Norman Ornstein is well recognized on Capitol Hill, a thoughtful man. \nHe pointed out today in an article in a newspaper known as Roll Call \nthat there have been 154 nominations in our Nation's history to the \nSupreme Court. Of that 154, 23 never received an up-or-down vote; 1 out \nof 7 of the Supreme Court nominees never received an up-or-down vote. \nWhat a weak argument from the other side.\n  Not only does history argue they are wrong, their memories should \nargue they are wrong. They didn't offer an up-or-down vote to those \nnominees from President Clinton.\n  Let's talk about this particular circuit. Let's talk about what \nhappened here in the context of the Priscilla Owen nomination for the \nFifth Circuit. Justice Owen is the only judicial nominee ever nominated \nby the President on two occasions after being rejected by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Never before has a judicial nominee received a \nnegative vote in committee and been confirmed by the Senate. The \nRepublican leadership speaks at great length about the unprecedented \nmaneuvers of Democrats, but their strategy on this nominee is a first. \nSurely Justice Owen and Charles Pickering, the former embattled nominee \nto the Fifth Circuit, are not the only people qualified to serve on \nthat circuit. It is a circuit that covers the States of Texas, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi. This is an area of roughly 30 million \npeople. It is amazing to me that President Bush and his fine people in \nthe White House couldn't find another name to bring to us for that \nimportant court.\n  Justice Owen has been given two confirmation hearings, something \nwhich 61 Clinton nominees never had a chance to receive. Three of \nPresident Clinton's nominees for the very same circuit were denied even \na single hearing. Let's take a look at these nominees.\n  Enrique Moreno, an accomplished trial attorney, nominated on \nSeptember 16, 1999, by President Clinton to fill a vacancy in the Fifth \nCircuit. No hearing. No committee vote. No floor vote. Certainly, no \nup-or-down vote. I would hope that my friends on the Republican side \nwould scratch their heads and search their memories and remember \nEnrique Moreno when they say every nominee is entitled to an up-or-down \nvote. He was found qualified. He was turned down to keep the vacancy, \nin the hopes of the Senate Republicans, that a Republican President \nwould come along to fill it.\n\n  Let's look at another nominee in the same circuit. Jorge Rangel, a \nlaw firm partner, a former Texas district court judge, was nominated \nJuly 24, 1997. No hearing. No committee vote. No floor vote. This \nqualified man languished for months, waiting for his chance for even a \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee. But the Senate Republicans \nsaid, no; this wasn't about filling a vacancy. It was about keeping a \nvacancy so they, in the hopes of the next election, could fill it.\n  Finally, look at Alston Johnson. He was in a major law firm, \nnominated April 22, 1999, by President Clinton. He was renominated in \n2001. He never received a hearing when Senator Hatch was chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. He never received a committee vote. Certainly, \nhe had no up-or-down floor vote. Why? To keep the vacancy alive for \nPriscilla Owen, in the hopes that someday there would be a Republican \nPresident who could fill it.\n  The Judiciary Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch, denied each of these \nnominees a vote and a hearing. Now the Republicans want to reap the \nbenefits of their delay tactics. But they don't come to this with clean \nhands. This vacancy exists today because three people were treated very \npoorly. They never received the benefit of the hearing that Priscilla \nhad. They never had the committee vote that Priscilla Owen had. They \nwere not debated on the floor. They say she should be confirmed because \nshe has a ``well-qualified'' rating by the American Bar Association. \nLet me tell you, it is an argument of convenience. The nominees I just \nmentioned--Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Alston Johnson--all had \nratings of ``well-qualified''. But their nominations were buried by \nSenator Hatch. So this ``good housekeeping seal of approval,'' the ABA \nrating, meant nothing to the Senate Republicans when it came to the \nClinton nominees.\n  Much has been said today on the floor about Justice Owen's record in \npreventing pregnant minors in Texas from receiving abortions through a \nprocess known as a ``judicial bypass.'' What is that all about? Most \nStates, in writing laws, say when it comes to a minor seeking an \nabortion, there can be extraordinary circumstances when parental \nconsent is not appropriate. We can think about those. There are victims \nof incest. You would not expect the victim to go to the family member \nwho perpetrated that crime for permission for an abortion. So they \ncreate a process where those victims, with the help of an advocate, can \ngo to court and say to the court: My circumstances are unusual. I \nshould be treated differently and given a different opportunity.\n  We have heard the comment made by then-Texas Supreme Court justice, \nand now our Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales. When Priscilla Owen \nissued an opinion in the case involving judicial bypass, he said--\nAttorney General Gonzales--that her dissenting position in this case:\n\n       It would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism.\n\n  That is the Attorney General of the United States commenting on the \nrecord of Priscilla Owen, who the administration is now propounding to \nfill this vacancy.\n  Make no mistake, the vote on this nominee, Priscilla Owen, is not a \nreferendum on the contentious issue of abortion. I don't oppose her \nbecause we differ on abortion rights. In fact, we have confirmed 208 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees, over 95 percent. Trust me, the vast \nmajority of them do not share my view on the issue of abortion. But \nthat is not the test, nor should it be. We expect President Bush to \nnominate people who have a position on abortion that may differ from \nmine. That doesn't disqualify anybody. That is why 95 percent of his \nnominees have been approved, despite those differences.\n  In my view, the Owen nomination is not just about abortion. I oppose \nher because I don't believe she has taken an evenhanded or moderate \napproach to applying the law. What distinguishes this nominee, \nPriscilla Owen, from other judges being confirmed is that she has \nrepeatedly demonstrated her unwillingness to apply statutes and court \ndecisions faithfully--on the issue of abortion and many other issues.\n  There is no dispute that Justice Owen is a woman of intellectual \ncapacity and academic accomplishment. The question before the Senate, \nhowever, is whether she exhibits the balance and freedom from rigid \nideology that must be the bedrock of a strong Federal judiciary. The \nanswer, regrettably, is no.\n  Although the Senate is once again a house divided, concerns about \nJustice Owen cross party lines. Those who know her the best, including \ncolleagues on the Republican-dominated Texas Supreme Court, have \nrepeatedly questioned the soundness of her logic, her judgment, and her \nlegal reasoning during her 10 years on that court.\n\n  Consider some of the published comments of her colleagues on the \nTexas Supreme Court.\n  In the case of FM Properties v. City of Austin, Justice Owen \ndissented in favor of a large landowner which sought to write its own \nwater quality regulations. The court majority wrote:\n\n       Most of Justice Owen's dissent is nothing more than \n     inflammatory rhetoric and thus merits no response.\n\n  That was the majority of the Texas Supreme Court. Think about it. \nAttorney General Gonzales says she has taken part in unconscionable \nacts of judicial activism. The majority of her Texas Supreme Court says \nher dissent is nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric in this case.\n  Then look at her dissenting opinion in the case of Fitzgerald v. \nAdvanced Spine Fixation Systems, in favor of limiting liability for \nmanufacturers who made harmful products that injured innocent people. \nWhat they said\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\nwas that her dissent would in essence ``judicially amend the statute to \nadd an exception not implicitly contained in the language of the \nstatute.'' To put it in layman's terms, she is not being a judge, she \nis being a legislator and is writing law.\n  According to the majority, her dissent in a case involving the Texas \nopen records law, City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News here is what \nthe majority of the court said about this nominee, Priscilla Owen:\n\n       Effectively writes out the . . . Act's provisions and \n     ignores its purpose to provide the public ``at all times to \n     complete information about the affairs of government and the \n     official acts of public officials and employees.''\n\n  According to six justices, including three appointed by George W. \nBush when he was Governor of the State, Justice Owen's dissenting \nopinion in Montgomery Independent School District v. Davis is guilty of \n``ignoring credibility issues and essentially stepping into the shoes \nof the fact-finder to reach a specific result.''\n  In other words, she is picking and choosing the evidence without \ntreating it fairly. Who said that? Six justices on her own Texas \nSupreme Court. Three of them were appointed by George W. Bush. Her \ncolleagues said that Owen's dissent, in this case against a teacher who \nwas unfairly fired ``not only disregards the procedural limitations in \nthe statute but takes a position even more extreme than that argued for \nby the [school] board.''\n  Judges can and should have lively debate over how to interpret the \nlaw. Senator Cornyn, our colleague from Texas, tried to assure us that \njudges in Texas always talk this way. But Justice Owen's tenure on the \nTexas Supreme Court is remarkable for both the frequency and intensity \nwith which her fellow Republicans on the court have criticized her for \nexceeding the bounds of honest disagreement. These are Republican \nfellow justices carping, not Democrats. They are fellow justices, \nappointed by Governor George W. Bush and others.\n  According to those who served with her and know her best, she has \noften been guilty of ignoring plain law, distorting legislative \nhistory, and engaging in extreme judicial activism.\n  All too often during her judicial career, Justice Owen has favored \nmanufacturers over consumers, large corporations over individual \nemployees, insurance companies over claimants, and judge-made law over \njury verdicts. This pattern is consistent with her State court campaign \npromises. But it ill suits a person seeking a lifetime appointment to \nthe Federal bench who promises to be fair and balanced.\n  Let me mention one example, a case I asked Justice Owen about at her \nhearing in 2002, Provident American Insurance Company v. Castaneda. \nJustice Owen, writing for a divided court, ruled in favor of an \ninsurance company that tried to find anything in its policy to avoid \npaying for critical surgery for a young woman named Denise Castaneda.\n  Denise suffered from hemolytic spherocytosis, a genetic condition \ncausing misshapen blood cells, and she needed to have her spleen and \ngallbladder removed. Denise's parents obtained preapproval for the \nsurgery, yet Justice Owen allowed the insurance company to deny \ncoverage, in clear bad faith of their contractual obligation.\n  One of her colleagues on the court who disagreed with her in this \ncase, Justice Raul Gonzalez, said Justice Owen's opinion ``ignores \nimportant evidence that supports the judgment . . . and resolves all \nconflicts in the evidence against the verdict [for the family that was \ndenied coverage].''\n  Justice Raul Gonzalez concluded:\n       If the evidence of this case is not good enough to affirm \n     judgment, I do not know what character or quantity of \n     evidence would ever satisfy the Court in this kind of case.\n  Nor is it easy to satisfy Justice Owen in the judicial bypass cases. \nHer tortured reasoning in cases involving the Texas parental \nnotification law exhibits the same inclination by Justice Owen for \njudicial activism I discussed earlier.\n  I am alarmed by her attempt to force young women seeking a legal \njudicial bypass under Texas law to demonstrate that they considered \nreligious issues in their decision whether they were to have an \nabortion. This religious awareness test has no support in Supreme Court \ncase law. She may view it as something to be added to the law. It is \nnot the law. And when judges go beyond the clear limits of the law, \nthey are writing the law, and that is not their responsibility.\n  Justice Owen told the Judiciary Committee she would not be an \nactivist, that she would merely follow the law. That is a safe answer. \nWe hear it from every nominee. But when it comes to the issue of \nabortion, the law is not well settled. One study shows that of 32 \ncircuit court cases applying the 1992 case Planned Parenthood of \nSoutheastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, only 15 of those cases were decided \nby unanimous panels. So in a majority of the cases, judges viewing \nidentical facts and laws reached different conclusions.\n  Priscilla Owen is a member and officer of the Federalist Society. If \nyou have never heard of it, this is the secret handshake at the White \nHouse. If you are a member of the Federalist Society, you are much more \nlikely to progress, to have a chance to serve for a lifetime on the \nbench. I have tried, as nominees would come before the Judiciary \nCommittee, to ask them: What is the Federalist Society? Why is it so \nimportant that resumes for would-be judges be checked by the Federalist \nSociety for the Bush White House to consider you?\n  I asked Priscilla Owen if she agreed with the Federalist Society's \npublished mission statement which says:\n\n       Law schools and the legal profession are currently strongly \n     dominated by a form of orthodox liberal ideology which \n     advocates a centralized and uniform society.\n\n  Here is her response:\n\n       I am unfamiliar with this mission statement . . . I have no \n     knowledge of its origin or its context.\n\n  She ducked the question. I can only conclude that she does not find \nthat mission statement repugnant. She joined the Federalist Society, \nand that is the viewpoint.\n  It is a small organization. Fewer than 1 percent of lawyers across \nAmerica are members of this Federalist Society. Yet over one-third of \nPresident Bush's circuit court nominees are members of the Federalist \nSociety. If you do not have a Federalist Society secret handshake, \nthen, frankly, you may not even have a chance to be considered \nseriously by the Bush White House.\n  When it comes to nominees to the appellate court, the White House has \nmade political ideology a core consideration. President Bush did not \ntake office with a mandate to appoint these kinds of judges. He lost \nthe popular vote in his first election, won the electoral vote by a \ndecision of the Supreme Court, and came back in this last election and \nwon by virtue of one State. Had Ohio gone the other way, he would not \nbe President today. What kind of mandate is that for rewriting the \ncourts and the laws that they consider?\n\n  The Nation needs more judicial nominees who reflect the moderate \nviews of the majority of Americans and who have widespread bipartisan \nsupport. Priscilla Owen is not one of them. I do not believe this \nnominee should receive a lifetime appointment, and I do not believe she \nis worth a constitutional confrontation.\n  Today we had a gathering on the steps of the Senate of Democrats \nserving in the House and the Senate. We were glad that our colleagues \nfrom the House came over to support us in this debate on the nuclear \noption. They do not have the constitutional responsibility of \nconfirming nominees to the court, but they understand a little bit \nabout debate.\n  Sadly, in the House of Representatives since I left, debate has \nvirtually come to a standstill. Efforts are being made to close down \ndebate, close down amendments. The House meets 2 or 3 days a week, if \nthey are lucky, and goes home accomplishing very little except the most \nbasic political agenda. What a far cry from the House of \nRepresentatives in which I served. We used to go on days, sometimes \nweeks, on critically important issues such as the spread of nuclear \nweapons around the world. They were hotly contested debates. There were \namendments that passed by a vote or two where we never knew the outcome \nwhen we cast our vote. It does not happen anymore. The House of \nRepresentatives has shut down debate, by and large, and when they get \nto a rollcall vote that is very close, they will keep the rollcall vote \nopen for hours, twisting the arms of\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\nCongressmen to vote the way the leadership wants them to.\n  That is what is happening in the House. Sadly, that is what happens \nwhen a group is in power for too long. They forget the heritage of the \ninstitution they are serving. All that counts is winning, and they will \nwin at any cost.\n  That is what is happening in this debate. There are forces in the \nSenate that want to win at any cost, but the cost of the nuclear option \nis too high. The cost of the nuclear option means we will turn our back \non a 200-year-plus tradition. We will turn our back on extended debate \nand filibuster so this President can have more power.\n  You wonder if 6 Republicans out of 55 are troubled by this. That is \nwhat it comes down to. If 6 Republicans believe this President has gone \ntoo far, that is the end of the debate on the nuclear option--6 out of \n55. It is possible it could reach that point where six come forward. I \ncertainly hope they do. They will be remembered. Those six Republicans \nwho step forward and basically say the President is asking for too much \npower, those six Republicans who say the special interest groups that \nare pushing this agenda so the President will have every single \njudicial nominee, those six Republicans will be remembered. They will \nhave stood up for the institution.\n  It will not be popular. In some places I am sure they are going to be \nroundly criticized, and they may pay a political price. But we would \nlike to think--most of us do--that at that moment in time when we are \ntested to do the right thing, even if it is not popular, we will do it. \nI certainly hold myself to that standard. Sometimes I meet it, \nsometimes I fail.\n  For those who are considering that today, I say to them there has \nnever been a more important constitutional debate in the Senate in \nmodern memory. Robert C. Byrd, the Senator from West Virginia, comes to \nthe floor every day and carries our Constitution with him in his \npocket. He has written a two- or three-volume history of the Senate. He \nknows this institution better than anybody.\n  I have listened to Senator Byrd, and I have measured the intensity of \nhis feeling about this debate. It is hard for anyone to describe what \nthis means to Senator Byrd. He believes what is at stake here is not \njust a vote on a judge. What is at stake here is the future of the \nSenate, the role of the issues, such as checks and balances, and I \nagree with him.\n  My colleagues made an argument that we have to go through these \njudicial nominees and approve them because we face judicial \nemergencies. Let me read what Senator Frist, the Republican majority \nleader, said on May 9:\n\n       Now, 12 of the 16 court of appeals vacancies have been \n     officially declared judicial emergencies. The Department of \n     Justice tells us the delay caused by these vacancies is \n     complicating their ability to prosecute criminals. The \n     Department also reports--\n\n  According to Senator Frist--\n\n     that due to the delay in deciding immigration appeals, it \n     cannot quickly deport illegal aliens who are convicted \n     murderers, rapists, and child molesters.\n\n  That was Senator Frist's quote on May 9, waving the bloody shirt that \nif we do not move quickly on judicial nominees, it will leave vacancies \nthat allow these criminals on the street.\n  Facts do not support what Senator Frist said. In fact, you have to go \nback to 1996 to find a lower number of judicial emergencies. Think \nabout this. In 1994, there were 67 judicial emergencies, meaning \nvacancies that badly needed to be filled. That, of course, was during \nthe Clinton years, when many of the Republicans were not holding \nhearings and insisting we didn't need to fill vacancies. Today the \nnumber of judicial emergencies is 18. What a dramatic difference.\n  I think it is clear. There are fewer judicial emergencies now than \nthere have been in the last 9 or 10 years. For any Senator to come to \nthe floor and argue that we are creating a situation where criminals \nare roaming all over the streets--where were these same critics during \nthe Clinton years when there were many more judicial emergencies and \nthey were turning down the Clinton nominees, denying them even an \nopportunity for a hearing?\n  I think this debate is going to test us--in terms of the future of \nthe Senate, in terms of our adherence to our oaths to protect and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.\n  Janice Rogers Brown is also a nominee who will likely follow \nPriscilla Owen to the floor. She, too, has been considered not only in \ncommittee but also on the floor, and she will have her nomination \nsubmitted for us to consider again.\n  She, of course, is looking for appointment to the second highest \ncourt in the land, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. I have heard my \ncolleagues, Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein, from Judge Janice \nRogers Brown's home State of California, describe some of the things \nshe has said during the course of serving as a judge. To say she is out \nof the mainstream is an understatement. She is so far out of the \nmainstream on her positions that you find it interesting that, of all \nof the conservative Republican attorneys and judges in America, this is \nthe best the White House can do, to send us someone who has such a \nradical agenda that she now wants to bring to the second highest court \nin the land. And that is what we are up against.\n  There are some who argue, Why don't you just step aside? Let these \njudges come through. I hope it doesn't come to that. But I hope it does \ncome to a point that we make it clear the nuclear option is over. I \nbelieve Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, has said and I \nbelieve that we will conscientiously review every single nominee. The \nPresident can expect to continue to receive 95-percent approval, unless \nhe changes the way he nominates judges--maybe even better in the \nfuture. But for us to change the rules of the Senate may give this \nPresident a temporary victory. It may have some special interest groups \ncalling Senator Frist, the Republican majority leader, congratulating \nhim. But, frankly, it will not be a day of celebration for those who \nvalue the Constitution and the traditions of the Senate.\n  At this point I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to join \nmy colleagues to talk about the Senate's deliberations on some of our \nadministration's judicial nominations. It is very clear to me this is a \ndebate about basic American values. In drafting the Constitution, the \nFramers wanted the Senate to provide advice and consent on nominees who \ncame before us to ensure that these very rights and values were \nprotected. I believe as a Senator I have a responsibility to stand up \nfor those values on behalf of my constituents from my home State of \nWashington.\n  Many activists today are complaining that certain Senators are \nattacking religious or conservative values. I must argue that it is \nothers, not Democratic Senators, who are exercising their rights, who \nare pursuing a nomination strategy that attacks the basic values that \nwere outlined in our Constitution.\n  Our democracy values debate. It values discussion. Our democracy \nvalues the importance of checks and balances. Our democracy values an \nindependent judiciary. But with this nuclear option and the rhetorical \nassault that is being launched at Democratic Senators by activists \naround the country, we now see those values under attack. The nuclear \noption is an assault on the American people and many of the things we \nhold dear. It is an attempt to impose on the country, through lifetime \nappointments, the extreme values held by a few at the cost of many. It \nis the tyranny of the majority personified. Confirming these nominees \nby becoming a rubberstamp for the administration would be an affront to \nthe 200-year-old system we have in place, a system of checks and \nbalances. At the same time I have to say it would be an affront to the \nvalues I promised to defend when I came to the Senate.\n\n  It is not always easy. Building and maintaining a democracy is not \neasy. But our system and the rights and the values it holds dear are \nthe envy of the world. In fact, the entire world looks at us as a model \nfor government. It is our values they look to. We have to protect them, \nnot only for us but for other fledgling democracies around the world.\n  I returned recently from a bipartisan trip we took to Israel, Iraq, \nGeorgia, and Ukraine, where we saw up close leaders who are working \nvery hard to\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\nwrite constitutions, to write laws, to write policies. They were \nworking hard, all of them, to assure that even those who did not vote \nin the majority in their country would have a voice.\n  The challenges were varied in every country we went to. They faced \neverything from protecting against terrorists to, in some cases, \ncharging for electricity for the first time, to, in other cases, \nreforming corrupt institutions. But making sure that democracies \nsurvive means having debates, it means bringing people to the table, \nand it means making tough decisions. But in each case, the importance \nof not disenfranchising any group within that country was an important \npart of making sure that democracy worked.\n  So how we in this country accomplish the goal of sustaining a strong \ndemocracy and ensuring people--all people--participation is extremely \nimportant.\n  Elections are the foundation of our democracy. They actually \ndetermine the direction of our country. But an election loss doesn't \nmean you lose your voice or you lose your place at the table. Making \nsure we all have a seat at the table is increasingly important to keep \nour democracy strong. That is why those of us on this side are fighting \nso hard to keep our voice, to have a seat at the table.\n  Recently we have heard a lot from the other side about attacks on \nfaith and values. In fact, some are trying to say our motive in this \ndebate is somehow antifaith. I have to argue that just the opposite \nappears to me to be true. We have faith in our values, we have faith in \nAmerican values, and we have faith that those values can and must be \nupheld.\n  This is not an ideological battle between Republicans and Democrats, \nit is about keeping faith with the values and ideals our country stands \nfor. Having values and having faith in those values requires--requires \nthat we make sure those without a voice are listened to. Speaking up \nfor those in poverty to make sure they are fed is a faith-based value. \nMaking sure there is equal opportunity and justice for the least among \nus is a faith-based value. Fighting for human rights, taking care of \nthe environment, are faith-based values.\n  To now say those of us who stick up for minority rights are antifaith \nis frightening and, frankly, it is wrong. I hope those who have decided \nto make this into some kind of faith/antifaith debate will reconsider. \nThis debate should be about democracy. It should be about the \nprotection of an independent judiciary. And certainly it is a debate \nabout the rights of minorities.\n  Our system of Government, of checks and balances, and our values, are \nunder attack today by this very transparent grab for power. They are, \nwith their words and potential actions, attempting now to dismantle \nthis system despite the clear intent of the Framers and the weight of \nhistory and precedent. They think they know better, and I think not.\n  Today, it is fashionable for some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to disparage what they call activist judges. But this \npower grab, this nuclear option reveals the true motivation. There are \nthose who want activists on the bench to interpret the law in a way I \nbelieve undermines important American values.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to stand up and say no to extreme \nnominees. But to know that, you do not need to listen to me. Just look \nback at the great Founders of this democracy. The Framers, in those \namazing years when our country was founded, took very great care in \ncreating this new democracy. They wrote into the Constitution the \nSenate's role in the nomination process. They wrote into the \nConstitution and spoke about protecting the minority against the \ntyranny of the majority and their words ring true today.\n  James Madison, in his famous Federalist No. 10, warned against the \nsuperior force of an overbearing majority or, as he called it, a \ndangerous vice.\n  He said:\n\n       The friend of popular governments never finds himself so \n     much alarmed for their character and faith as when he \n     contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice.\n\n  Years prior, John Adams wrote in 1776 on the specific need for an \nindependent judiciary and checks and balance. He said:\n\n       The dignity and stability of government in all its \n     branches, the morals of the people and every blessing of \n     society depends so much on an upright and skillful \n     administration of justice that the judicial power ought to be \n     distinct from both the legislative and executive and \n     independent upon both so that it may be a check upon both as \n     both should be checks upon that. The Judges therefore should \n     always be men of learning and experience in the laws, of \n     exemplary morals, great patience, calmness, coolness and \n     attention. Their minds should not be distracted with jarring \n     interests; they should not be dependent on any man or body of \n     men.\n\n  I have to shudder at the thought of what some of the great thinkers, \nthe great Founders of our democracy, would say to this attempted abuse \nof power. Frankly, one of the best interpretations of the thoughts was \noffered to this Senate by Robert Caro, the great Senate historian. He \nwrote a letter in 2003 and he talked about the need for the Senate to \nmaintain its history and its traditions despite popular pressures of \nthe day and of the important role that debate and dissension plays in \nany discussion of judicial nominations. In particular, he wrote of his \nconcern for the preservation of Senate tradition in the face of \nattempted changes by a majority run wild.\n  He said, in part:\n\n       In short, two centuries of history rebut any suggestion \n     that either the language or intent of the Constitution \n     prohibits or counsels against the use of extended debate to \n     resist presidential authority. To the contrary, the nation's \n     Founders depended on the Senate's members to stand up to a \n     popular and powerful president. In the case of judicial \n     appointments, the Founders specifically mandated the Senate \n     to play an active role providing both advice and consent to \n     the President. That shared authority was basic to the balance \n     of powers among the branches.\n       I am . . . attempting to say as strongly as I can that in \n     considering any modification Senators should realize they are \n     dealing not with the particular dispute of the moment, but \n     with the fundamental character of the Senate of the United \n     States, and with the deeper issue of the balance of power \n     between majority and minority rights.\n\n  Protection of minority rights has been a fundamental principle since \nthe infancy of this democracy. It should not--in fact, it cannot--be \nlaid to rest in this Chamber with this debate.\n  I know there are a lot of people wondering why the Senate is spending \nso much time talking about Senate rules and judicial nominations. They \nare wondering why I am talking about nominees and quoting Madison and \nAdams. They are wondering what this means to them.\n  I make it clear: This debate is about whether we want a clean, \nhealthy environment and the ability to enforce our laws to protect it \nfairly. This debate is about whether we want to protect essential \nrights and liberties. This debate is about whether we want free and \nopen government. This debate is about preserving equal protection under \nthe law. This debate is about whether we want to preserve the \nindependent judiciary, whether we want to defend the Constitution, and \nwhether we will stand up for the values of the American public.\n  I believe these values are too precious to abdicate. Trusting in \nthem, we will not let Republicans trample our rights and those of \nmillions of Americans who we are here to represent. We will stand and \nsay yes to democracy, yes to an independent judiciary, yes to minority \nrights, and no to this unbelievable abuse of power.\n  I see my colleague from New York is here, and I know he has time \ntonight, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I compliment my friend and \ncolleague from the great State of Washington for her outstanding \nremarks and leadership on this issue. She knows, because of her \nexperience and her compassion and humanity, what this nuclear option \nwould mean to this Senate. I thank the Senator for her leadership.\n  Mr. President, there are so many things to say here. The idea of \nblowing up the Senate, literally, almost, at least in terms of the \nrules, at least in terms of comity, and at least in terms of \nbipartisanship, all because 10 judges have not been approved, is just \nappalling.\n  I mentioned earlier today, it seems like a temper tantrum if we do \nnot get our way on every single one, say the hard-right groups, we will \nshow them they cannot stop us on anything. That is how ideologues \nthink. That is how\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\npeople who are so sure they have the message from God or from somebody \nelse, that they know better than everyone else, that is how they think. \nThey cannot tolerate the fact that some of these judges, a small \nhandful, have been held up.\n  We can tell in the debate today where the enthusiasm and the passion \nis. There is a weariness on the other side of the aisle. My guess is \nthat more than half of those on the other side, if it were a secret \nballot, would vote against the nuclear option. They know it is wrong. \nTen have said to me: I am under tremendous pressure; I have to vote for \nit. The reason the majority leader has not called for a vote is because \nof the courageous handful who have resisted the pressure. Four of them \nhave told me of the pressure on them.\n  We used to hear about these groups influencing things. Does anyone \nhave any doubt that if not for the small groups, some dealing with \nsocial issues because they think America has been torn away from them, \nsome deal with economic issues--they hate the fact that the commerce \nclause actually can protect workers. Their idea is that self-made \nbusinessman should not pay taxes, should be able to discriminate, \nshould be able to pollute the air and water.\n  Janice Rogers Brown basically stands for the philosophy of the 1890s \nand said over and over again that we should go back to the days when if \nyou had a lot of money and power, you could do whatever you wanted. It \nis an abnegation of history, of the knowledge we have learned. It is an \nabnegation of the free market principles are the best principles.\n  But we have learned over the years they need some tempering and some \nmoderation. That is why we do not have the booms and busts that \ncharacterized America from 1870 to 1935. That is why people live \nbetter. Not because corporate America did good for them. They did do \nsome good, and they do more good now. It was through unionization, \nthrough government rules that we transformed America from a nation of a \nvery few rich, a small middle class, and a whole lot of poor people, \ninto an America that had more rich people, a large--gigantic, thank \nGod--middle class, and still too many poor people but fewer poor \npeople.\n  But Janice Rogers Brown believes all government regulation is wrong. \nShe believes the New Deal was a socialist revolution that had to be \nundone. Do mainstream conservatives believe that? Is it any wonder even \nthe Chamber of Commerce is against the nuclear option? No.\n  There are so many points I wish to make, and fortunately it seems we \nwill have a lot of time to make these points. I will focus on something \nthat has not been focused on before, and that is this idea of an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  First, we have had votes. Yes, the other side has needed 60 to \nprevail on the small number of judges we have chosen to filibuster. \nYes, certainly there has not been a removal of cloture, but the bottom \nline is we have had votes, unlike when Bill Clinton was President and \n60 judges were pushed aside and not given a vote.\n  The other point of the up-or-down vote is let 51 votes decide, let's \neach come to our own decision as we weigh the judges.\n  Let me show the independence of the decisions that have been made by \nthose on the other side.\n  This is a compilation of all the votes taken by Republican Members of \nthe Senate for every one of President Bush's court of appeals nominees. \nThere have been 45. How many times has any Republican voted against any \n1 of those 45 at any single vote? If, of course, we were all coming to \nan independent decision, do you think there would be 100, 200, 300 out \nof the 2,700-some-odd votes cast? You would think so. Independent \nthinking, let's have an up-or-down vote. Here is what it is: 2,703 to \n1. Let me repeat that because it is astounding: 2,703 ``yes'' votes by \nRepublicans for court of appeals nominees--45 of them--and 1 vote \nagainst.\n  Now, how is that? First, people ask, Well, who is the one vote? Why \ndid one person, at one point, dissent from the marching lockstep to \napprove every single nominee the President has proposed? Well, I will \ntell you who it was. It was Trent Lott, the former majority leader. On \nwhat judge? On Judge Roger Gregory, who was nominated by Bill Clinton \nto be the first Black man to sit on the Fourth Circuit, which has a \nlarge black population. It is Virginia, North Carolina, South \nCarolina--I am not sure if it has Georgia in it or not; I think not \nGeorgia.\n  And when President Bush renominated him, Trent Lott voted against \nhim, maybe to help his friend, Jesse Helms, who blocked every nominee \nand certainly every African-American nominee on the Fourth Circuit. \nThat is it. That is Trent Lott right there on Roger Gregory. Trent Lott \non every other nominee, every other Republican Senator on every \nnominee: 100 percent of the time they voted for the President's \nnominee.\n  So this idea that we are a deliberative body, and we are going to \nlook at each person on the merits, I heard our majority leader say: \nLet's look. Do you know what this means? Do you know what this spells, \nthese numbers? R-U-B-B-E-R-S-T-A-M-P. This Senate, under Republican \nleadership, has become a complete rubber stamp to anyone the President \nnominates. Did maybe one of those nominees strike a single Member of \nthe other side as going too far on a single issue? Did maybe one of \nthose nominees do something that merited they not be on the bench? Did \nmaybe one of those nominees not show judicial temperament? I guess not. \nRubber stamp: 2,703 to 1. Once was there a dissent, only once, and on \nRoger Gregory, the first African-American nominee to the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  So what is happening here is very simple. The hard-right groups, way \nout of the mainstream, not Chambers of Commerce or mainstream churches, \nbut the hard-right groups, as I said, either some who believe, almost \nin a theocratic way, that their faith--a beautiful thing--should \ndictate not just their politics but everyone's politics, and some, from \nan economic point of view, who do not believe there should be any \nFederal Government involvement in regulating our industries, our \ncommerce, et cetera--these groups are ideologues. They are so certain \nthey are right.\n  They have some following in this body, but it is not even a majority \nof the Republican side of the aisle. And they certainly do not \nrepresent the majority view of any Americans in any single State. But \nthey have a lot of sway. And until this nuclear option debate occurred, \nthey had very little opposition. People did not know what was going on. \nAnd now, of course, this debate allows us to expose the lie.\n  Let me say another thing about this idea. One out of every five \nSupreme Court nominees who was nominated by a President in our history \nnever made it to the Supreme Court. The very first nominee, Mr. \nRutledge, nominated by George Washington, was rejected by the Senate, \nin a Senate that had, I believe it was, eight of the Founding Fathers. \nEight of the twenty-two people who voted in the Senate had actually \nsigned the Constitution, defining them as Founding Fathers. Did they \nhave votes like this? Of course not because the Founding Fathers, in \nthis Constitution, wanted advice and consent. They say in the \nFederalist Papers, they wanted the President to come to the Senate and \ndebate and discuss.\n  Has any Democrat been asked? Has Patrick Leahy, our ranking member of \nJudiciary, been asked about who should be nominees in these courts? Has \nthere been a give-and-take the way Bill Clinton regularly called Orrin \nHatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee? There is a story, I do not \nknow if it is apocryphal, that Orrin Hatch said: You can't get this guy \nfor the Supreme Court. You can't get this guy, but Breyer will get \nthrough. And President Clinton nominated Breyer. Did Stephen Breyer \nhave Orrin Hatch's exact political beliefs? No. Did he have Bill \nClinton's exact ones? No. It was a compromise. That is what the \nConstitution intended.\n  But when a President nominates judges through an ideological \nspectrum, when he chooses not moderates, and not even mainstream \nconservatives, but people who are way over--way over--we have \nsafeguards. One of those safeguards is the filibuster. It says to the \nPresident: If you go really far out and do not consult and do not trade \noff, you can run into trouble.\n  Well, George Bush did not consult. He did what he said in the \ncampaign,\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\nthat he was going to nominate ideologues. He said: I am going to \nnominate judges in the mold of Scalia and Thomas. There probably should \nbe a few Scalias on our courts. They should not be a majority. And Bush \nnominates a majority. And he is now sowing what he has reaped--or \nreaping what he has sown. I come from New York City. We do not have \nthat much agriculture, although I am trying to help the farmers \nupstate.\n  So that is the problem. This is not the Democrats' problem. This is \nthe way the President has functioned in terms of judicial appointments. \nThis is the way the Republican Senate, to a person, has been a rubber \nstamp without giving any independent judgment.\n  This is the way the Founding Fathers wanted we Democrats and the \nSenate as a whole to act. And that is what we are doing.\n  And then, when they do not get their way--quite naturally, we did \nwhat we are doing--they throw a temper tantrum. They say: We have to \nhave all 100 percent. I want to repeat this because this was said by \nsomeone--I do not remember who--but I think it is worth saying. If your \nchild, your son or daughter, came home and got 95 percent on a test, 95 \npercent, what would most parents do? They would pat him or her on the \nhead and say: Great job, Johnny. Great job, Jane. Maybe try to do a \nlittle better, but you have done great. I am proud of you.\n  When President Bush gets the 95 percent, he does not do that. \nPresident Bush would advise--what he is doing, in effect, is saying to \nJohnny or Jane: You only got 95 percent?\n  This is not what President Bush does. It is what the far-right groups \ndo, the hard-line far right. Only 95 percent? Break the rules and get \n100 percent. What parent would tell their child that? Yet that is what \nthese narrowminded groups are saying. And wildly enough, the majority \nleader and most--and thank God, not yet all--of his caucus is agreeing. \nBreak the rules, change the whole balance of power and checks and \nbalances in this great Senate and great country so we don't have 95 \npercent, but 100 percent.\n  What is it that is motivating them? Some say it is a nomination on \nthe Supreme Court that might be coming up, that they can't stand the \nfact that Democrats might filibuster. I can tell you, if the President \nnominates someone who is a mainstream person, who will interpret the \nlaw, not make the law, there won't be a filibuster.\n  They say: Well, they will have to agree with the Democrats on \neverything. Bunk. I haven't voted for all 208. I probably voted for \nabout 195. I guarantee you, of those 195, I didn't agree with the views \nof many. No litmus test have I. I voted for an overwhelming majority \nwho were pro-life even though I am pro-choice. I voted for an \noverwhelming majority who probably want to cut back on Government \nactivity in areas that I would not cut back. But at least there was a \ngood-faith effort by these nominees, at least as I interviewed them, \nbeing ranking Democrat on the Courts Subcommittee, to interpret the \nlaw, not to make the law.\n  There are some the President nominated you can't tolerate, that are \nunpalatable. I debated Senator Hatch on the Wolf Blitzer show. He keeps \nbringing up the old saw: You are opposing Janice Rogers Brown because \nyou can't stand having an African-American conservative.\n  They said that about Pryor in terms of being a Catholic and about \nPickering in terms of being a Baptist. It is a cheap argument. I don't \ncare about the race, creed, color, or religion of a nominee. If that \nnominee believes the New Deal was a socialist revolution, if that \nnominee believes the case the Supreme Court decided that said wage and \nhour laws were unconstitutional was decided correctly in 1906, even \nthough it was overturned, I will oppose that nominee. That person \nshould not be on the second most important court in the land. No way. \nWe are doing what the Founding Fathers wanted us to do. We are doing \nthe right thing.\n  One other point, and it relates to this hallowed document--the \nConstitution. In the 1960s and 1970s, one of the main bugaboos of the \nconservative movement was that the courts were going too far. They \ncalled them activist judges. They believed--from the left side, not \nfrom the right side--that these judges were making law, not \ninterpreting the law. And there are cases where they were right. I \nremember being in college and being surprised as I studied some of the \ncases that the Supreme Court would do this.\n  So they created a counterreaction. Ronald Reagan nominated \nconservative judges, not as conservative as George Bush's, but the \nbench had largely been appointed by moderates, whether it be Kennedy, \nJohnson, Nixon, Ford, or Carter. So when Reagan came in and began to \nsprinkle some conservatives in there, people didn't make too much of a \nfuss, especially at the courts of appeal level.\n  The point I am making is this: So they didn't like activist judges, \njudges who would sort of read the Constitution and divine what was in \nit. And they had a movement that said: You only read the Constitution \nin terms of the words. If it doesn't say it in the Constitution, you \ndon't do it.\n  I defy any Republican who says they don't believe in activist judges \nto find the words ``filibuster,'' ``up-or-down vote,'' ``majority \nrule,'' when it comes to the Senate. I would say that anyone who is now \nsaying the Constitution says there cannot be a filibuster is being just \nas activist in their interpretation of the Constitution as the judges \nthey condemned in the 1960s and 1970s.\n  I thank the Chair for the courtesy and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY, Mr. President, 3 years ago I first considered the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen to be a judge on the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. After reviewing her record, hearing \nher testimony and evaluating her answers I voted against her \nconfirmation and explained at length the strong case against \nconfirmation of this nomination. Nothing about her record or the \nreasons that led me then to vote against confirmation has changed since \nthen. Unlike the consideration of the nomination of William Myers, on \nwhich the Judiciary Committee held another hearing this year before \nseeking reconsideration, there has been no effort to supplement the \nrecord on this nomination. Justice Owen's record failed to justify a \nfavorable reporting of the nomination in 2002 and was inadequate to \ngain the consent of the Senate during the last 2 years.\n  In 2001, Justice Owen was nominated to fill a vacancy that had by \nthat time existed for more than 4 years, since January 1997. In the \nintervening 5 years, President Clinton nominated Jorge Rangel, a \ndistinguished Hispanic attorney from Corpus Christi, to fill that \nvacancy. Despite his qualifications, and his unanimous rating of well \nqualified by the ABA, Mr. Rangel never received a hearing from the \nJudiciary Committee, and his nomination was returned to the President \nwithout Senate action at the end of 1998, after a fruitless wait of 15 \nmonths.\n  On September 16, 1999, President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno, \nanother outstanding Hispanic attorney, to fill that same vacancy. Mr. \nMoreno did not receive a hearing on his nomination either--over a span \nof more than 17 months. President Bush withdrew the nomination of \nEnrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit and later sent Justice Owen's name \nin its place. It was not until May of 2002, at a hearing presided over \nby Senator Schumer, that the Judiciary Committee heard from any of \nPresident Clinton's three unsuccessful nominees to the Fifth Circuit. \nAt that time, Mr. Moreno and Mr. Rangel, joined by a number of other \nClinton nominees, testified about their treatment by the Republican \nmajority. Thus, Justice Owen's was the third nomination to this vacancy \nand the first to be accorded a hearing before the committee.\n  In fact, when the Judiciary Committee held its hearing on the \nnomination of Judge Edith Clement to the Fifth Circuit in 2001, during \nthe most recent period of Democratic control of the Senate, it was the \nfirst hearing on a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 years. By contrast, \nJustice Owen was the third nomination to the Fifth Circuit on which the \nJudiciary Committee held a hearing in less than 1 year. In spite of the \ntreatment by the former Republican majority of so many moderate \njudicial nominees of the previous President, we proceeded in July of \n2001--as I said that we would--with a hearing on Justice Owen.\n  Justice Owen is one of among 20 Texas nominees who were considered\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nby the Judiciary Committee while I was chairman. That included nine \ndistrict court judges, four United States Attorneys, three United \nStates Marshals, and three executive branch appointees from Texas who \nmoved swiftly through the Judiciary Committee.\n  When Justice Owen was initially nominated, the President changed the \nconfirmation process from that used by Republican and Democratic \nPresidents for more than 50 years. That resulted in her ABA peer review \nnot being received until later that summer. As a result of a Republican \nobjection to the Democratic leadership's request to retain all judicial \nnominations pending before the Senate through the August recess in \n2001, the initial nomination of Justice Owen was required by Senate \nrules to be returned to the President without action. The Committee \nnonetheless took the unprecedented action of proceeding during the \nAugust recess to hold two hearings involving judicial nominations, \nincluding a nominee to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n  In my efforts to accommodate a number of Republican Senators--\nincluding the Republican leader, the Judiciary committee's ranking \nmember, and at least four other Republican members of the committee--I \nscheduled hearings for nominees out of the order in which they were \nreceived that year, in accordance with longstanding practice of the \ncommittee.\n  As I consistently indicated, and as any chairman can explain, less \ncontroversial nominations are easier to consider and are, by and large, \nable to be scheduled sooner than more controversial nominations. This \nis especially important in the circumstances that existed at the time \nof the change in majority in 2001. At that time we faced what \nRepublicans have now admitted had become a vacancy crisis in the \nFederal courts. From January 1995, when the Republican majority assumed \ncontrol of the confirmation process in the Senate, until the shift in \nmajority, vacancies rose from 65 to 110 and vacancies on the courts of \nappeals more than doubled from 16 to 33. I thought it important to make \nas much progress as quickly as we could in the time available to us \nthat year, and we did. In fact, through the end of President Bush's \nfirst term, we saw those 110 vacancies plummet to 27, the lowest \nvacancy rate since the Reagan administration.\n  The responsibility to advise and consent on the President's nominees \nis one that I take seriously and that the Judiciary Committee takes \nseriously. Justice Owen's nomination to the court of appeals has been \ngiven a fair hearing and a fair process before the Judiciary Committee. \nI thank all members of the committee for being fair. Those who had \nconcerns had the opportunity to raise them and heard the nominee's \nresponse, in private meetings, at her public hearing and in written \nfollow-up questions.\n  I would particularly like to commend Senator Feinstein, who chaired \nthe hearing for Justice Owen, for managing that hearing so fairly and \nevenhandedly. It was a long day, where nearly every Senator who is a \nmember of the Committee came to question Justice Owen, and Senator \nFeinstein handled it with patience and equanimity.\n\n  After that hearing, I brought Justice Owen's nomination up for a \nvote, and following an open debate where her opponents discussed her \nrecord and their objections on the merits, the nomination was rejected. \nHer nomination was fully and openly debated, and it was rejected. That \nfair treatment stands in sharp contrast to the way Republicans had \ntreated President Clinton's nominees, including several to the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  That should have ended things right there. But looking back, we now \nsee that this nomination is emblematic of the ways the White House and \nSenate Republicans will trample on precedent and do whatever is \nnecessary in order to get every last nominee of this President's \nconfirmed, no matter how extreme he or she may be. Priscilla Owen's \nnomination was the first judicial nomination ever to be resubmitted \nafter already being debated, voted upon and rejected by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  When the Senate majority shifted, Republicans reconsidered this \nnomination and sent it to the Senate on a straight, party-line vote. \nNever before had a President resubmitted a circuit court nominee \nalready rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee, for the same \nvacancy. And until Senator Hatch gave Justice Owen a second hearing in \n2003, never before had the Judiciary Committee rejected its own \ndecision on such a nominee and granted a second hearing. And at that \nsecond hearing we did not learn much more than the obvious fact that, \ngiven some time, Justice Owen was able to enlist the help of the \ntalented lawyers working at the White House and the Department of \nJustice to come up with some new justifications for her record of \nactivism. We learned that given six months to reconsider the severe \ncriticism directed at her by her Republican colleagues, she still \nadmitted no error. Mostly, we learned that the objections expressed \noriginally by the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee were sincerely \nheld when they were made, and no less valid after a second hearing. \nNothing Justice Owen said about her record--indeed, nothing anyone else \ntried to explain about her record--was able to actually change her \nrecord. That was true then, and that is true today.\n  Senators who opposed this nomination did so because Priscilla Owen's \nrecord shows her to be an ends-oriented activist judge. I have \npreviously explained my conclusions about Justice Owen's record, but I \nwill summarize my objections again today.\n  The first area of concern to me is Justice Owen's extremism even \namong a conservative Supreme Court of Texas. The conservative \nRepublican majority of the Texas Supreme Court has gone out of its way \nto criticize Justice Owen and the dissents she joined in ways that are \nhighly unusual, and in ways which highlight her ends-oriented activism. \nA number of Texas Supreme Court Justices have pointed out how far from \nthe language of statute she strays in her attempts to push the law \nbeyond what the legislature intended.\n  One example is the majority opinion in Weiner v. Wasson, 900 S.W.2d \n316, Tex. 1995. In this case, Justice Owen wrote a dissent advocating a \nruling against a medical malpractice plaintiff injured while he was \nstill a teenager. The issue was the constitutionality of a State law \nrequiring minors to file medical malpractice actions before reaching \nthe age of majority, or risk being outside the statute of limitations. \nOf interest is the majority's discussion of the importance of abiding \nby a prior Texas Supreme Court decision unanimously striking down a \nprevious version of the statute. In what reads as a lecture to the \ndissent, then-Justice John Cornyn explains on behalf of the majority:\n\n       Generally, we adhere to our precedents for reasons of \n     efficiency, fairness, and legitimacy. First, if we did not \n     follow our own decisions, no issue could ever be considered \n     resolved. The potential volume of speculative relitigation \n     under such circumstances alone ought to persuade us that \n     stare decisis is a sound policy. Secondly, we should give due \n     consideration to the settled expectations of litigants like \n     Emmanuel Wasson, who have justifiably relied on the \n     principles articulated in [the previous case]. . . . Finally, \n     under our form of government, the legitimacy of the judiciary \n     rests in large part upon a stable and predictable \n     decisionmaking process that differs dramatically from that \n     properly employed by the political branches of government.\n\n  According to the conservative majority on the Texas Supreme Court, \nJustice Owen went out of her way to ignore precedent and would have \nruled for the defendants. The conservative Republican majority, in \ncontrast to Justice Owen, followed precedent and the doctrine of stare \ndecisis. A clear example of Justice Owen's judicial activism.\n  In Montgomery Independent School District v. Davis, 34 S.W. 3d 559, \nTex. 2000, Justice Owen wrote another dissent which drew fire from a \nconservative Republican majority--this time for her disregard for \nlegislative language. In a challenge by a teacher who did not receive \nreappointment to her position, the majority found that the school board \nhad exceeded its authority when it disregarded the Texas Education Code \nand tried to overrule a hearing examiner's decision on the matter. \nJustice Owen's dissent advocated for an interpretation contrary to the \nlanguage of the applicable statute. The majority, which included \nAlberto Gonzales and two other appointees of then-Governor Bush, was \nquite explicit\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nabout its view that Justice Owen's position disregarded the law:\n\n       The dissenting opinion misconceives the hearing examiner's \n     role in the . . . process by stating that the hearing \n     examiner `refused' to make findings on the evidence the Board \n     relies on to support its additional findings. As we explained \n     above, nothing in the statute requires the hearing examiner \n     to make findings on matters of which he is unpersuaded. . . .\n\n  The majority also noted that:\n\n       The dissenting opinion's misconception of the hearing \n     examiner's role stems from its disregard of the procedural \n     elements the Legislature established in subchapter F to \n     ensure that the hearing-examiner process is fair and \n     efficient for both teachers and school boards. The \n     Legislature maintained local control by giving school boards \n     alone the option to choose the hearing-examiner process in \n     nonrenewal proceedings. . . . By resolving conflicts in \n     disputed evidence, ignoring credibility issues, and \n     essentially stepping into the shoes of the factfinder to \n     reach a specific result, the dissenting opinion not only \n     disregards the procedural limitations in the statute but \n     takes a position even more extreme than that argued for by \n     the board.\n\n  Another clear example of Justice Owen's judicial activism.\n  Collins v. Ison-Newsome, 73 S.W.3d 178, Tex. 2001, is yet another \ncase where a dissent, joined by Justice Owen, was roundly criticized by \nthe Republican majority of the Texas Supreme Court. The Court cogently \nstated the legal basis for its conclusion that it had no jurisdiction \nto decide the matter before it, and as in other opinions where Justice \nOwen was in dissent, took time to explicitly criticize the dissent's \npositions as contrary to the clear letter of the law.\n  At issue was whether the Supreme Court had the proper ``conflicts \njurisdiction'' to hear the interlocutory appeal of school officials \nbeing sued for defamation. The majority explained that it did not \nbecause published lower court decisions do not create the necessary \nconflict between themselves. The arguments put forth by the dissent, in \nwhich Justice Owen joined, offended the majority, and they made their \nviews known, writing:\n\n       The dissenting opinion agrees that ``because this is an \n     interlocutory appeal . . . this Court's jurisdiction is \n     limited,'' but then argues for the exact opposite proposition \n     . . . This argument defies the Legislature's clear and \n     express limits on our jurisdiction. . . . The author of the \n     dissenting opinion has written previously that we should take \n     a broader approach to the conflicts-jurisdiction standard. \n     But a majority of the Court continues to abide by the \n     Legislature's clear limits on our interlocutory-appeal \n     jurisdiction.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       [T]he dissenting opinion's reading of Government Code sec. \n     22.225(c) conflates conflicts jurisdiction with dissent \n     jurisdiction, thereby erasing any distinction between these \n     two separate bases for jurisdiction. The Legislature \n     identified them as distinct bases for jurisdiction in \n     sections 22.001(a)(1) and (a)(2), and section 22.225(c) \n     refers specifically to the two separate provisionsn of \n     section 22.001(a) providing for conflicts and dissent \n     jurisdiction. . . . [W]e cannot simply ignore the legislative \n     limits on our jurisdiction, and not even Petitioners argue \n     that we should do so on this basis.\n\n  Again, Justice Owen joined a dissent that the Republican majority \ndescribed as defiant of legislative intent and in disregard of \nlegislatively drawn limits. Yet another clear example of Justice Owen's \njudicial activism.\n  Some of the most striking examples of criticism of Justice Owen's \nwritings, or the dissents and concurrences she joins, come in a series \nof parental notification cases heard in 2000. They include:\n  In In re Jane Doe 1, 19 S.W.3d 346, Tex. 2000, where the majority \nincluded an extremely unusual section explaining its view of the proper \nrole of judges, admonishing the dissent, joined by Justice Owen, for \ngoing beyond its duty to interpret the law in an attempt to fashion \npolicy.\n  Giving a pointed critique of the dissenters, the majority explained \nthat, ``In reaching the decision to grant Jane Doe's application, we \nhave put aside our personal viewpoints and endeavored to do our job as \njudges--that is, to interpret and apply the Legislature's will as it \nhas been expressed in the statute.''\n  In a separate concurrence, Justice Alberto Gonzales wrote that to \nconstrue the law as the dissent did, ``would be an unconscionable act \nof judicial activism.''\n  A conservative Republican colleague of Justice Owen's, pointing \nsquarely to her judicial activism.\n  In In re Jane Doe 3, 19 S.W. 3d 300, Tex. 2000, Justice Enoch writes \nspecifically to rebuke Justice Owen and her follow dissenters for \nmisconstruing the legislature's definition of the sort of abuse that \nmay occur when parents are notified of a minor's intent to have an \nabortion, saying, ``abuse is abuse; it is neither to be trifled with \nnor its severity to be second guessed.''\n  In one case that is perhaps the exception that proves the rule, \nJustice Owen wrote a majority that was bitterly criticized by the \ndissent for its activism. In In re City of Georgetown, 53 S.W. 3d 328, \nTex. 2001, Justice Owen wrote a majority opinion finding that the city \ndid not have to give the Austin American-Statesman a report prepared by \na consulting expert in connection with pending and anticipated \nlitigation because such information was expressly made confidential \nunder other law namely, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  The dissent is extremely critical of Justice Owen's opinion, citing \nthe Texas law's strong preference for disclosure and liberal \nconstruction. Accusing her of activism, Justice Abbott, joined by Chief \nJustice Phillips and Justice Baker, notes that the legislature, \n``expressly identified eighteen categories of information that are \n'public information' and that must be disclosed upon request . . . \n[sec. (a)] The Legislature attempted to safeguard its policy of open \nrecords by adding subsection (b), which limits courts' encroachment on \nits legislatively established policy decisions.'' The dissent further \nprotests:\n\n     [b]ut if this Court has the power to broaden by judicial rule \n     the categories of information that are ``confidential under \n     other law,'' then subsection (b) is eviscerated from the \n     statute. By determining what information falls outside \n     subsection (a)'s scope, this Court may evade the mandates of \n     subsection (b) and order information withheld whenever it \n     sees fit. This not only contradicts the spirit and language \n     of subsection (b), it guts it.\n\n  Finally, the opinion concluded by asserting that Justice Owen's \ninterpretation, ``abandons strict construction and rewrites the statute \nto eliminate subsection (b)'s restrictions.''\n  Yet again, her colleagues on the Texas court, citing Justice Owen's \njudicial activism.\n  These examples, together with the unusually harsh language directed \nat Justice Owen's position by the majority in the Doe cases, show a \njudge out of step with the conservative Republican majority of the \nTexas Supreme Court, a majority not afraid to explain the danger of her \nactivist views.\n  I am also greatly concerned about Justice Owen's record of ends-\noriented decision making as a Justice on the Texas Supreme Court. As \none reads case after case, particularly those in which she was the sole \ndissenter or dissented with the extreme right wing of the Court, her \npattern of activism becomes clear. Her legal views in so many cases \ninvolving statutory interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with the \nplain meaning of the statute, the legislative intent, or the majority's \ninterpretation, leading to the conclusion that she sets out to justify \nsome pre-conceived idea of what the law ought to mean. This is not an \nappropriate way for a judge to make decisions. This is a judge whose \nrecord reflects that she is willing and sometimes eager to make law \nfrom the bench.\n  Justice Owen's activism and extremism is noteworthy in a variety of \ncases, including those dealing with business interests, malpractice, \naccess to public information, employment discrimination and Texas \nSupreme Court jurisdiction, in which she writes against individual \nplaintiffs time and time again, in seeming contradiction of the law as \nwritten.\n  One of the cases where this trend is evident is FM Properties v. City \nof Austin, 22 S.W. 3d 868, Tex. 1998. I asked Justice Owen about this \n1998 environmental case at her hearing. In her dissent from a 6-3 \nruling, in which Justice Alberto Gonzales was among the majority, \nJustice Owen showed her willingness to rule in favor of large private \nlandowners against the clear public interest in maintaining a fair \nregulatory process and clean water. Her dissent, which the majority \ncharacterized as ``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric,'' was an \nattempt to favor big landowners.\n  In this case, the Texas Supreme Court found that a section of the \nTexas\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\nWater Code allowing certain private owners of large tracts of land to \ncreate ``water quality zones,'' and write their own water quality \nregulations and plans, violated the Texas Constitution because it \nimproperly delegated legislative power to private entities. The Court \nfound that the Water Code section gave the private landowners, \n``legislative duties and powers, the exercise of which may adversely \naffect public interests, including the constitutionally-protected \npublic interest in water quality.'' The Court also found that certain \naspects of the Code and the factors surrounding its implementation \nweighed against the delegation of power, including the lack of \nmeaningful government review, the lack of adequate representation of \ncitizens affected by the private owners' actions, the breadth of the \ndelegation, and the big landowners' obvious interest in maximizing \ntheir own profits and minimizing their own costs.\n  The majority offered a strong opinion, detailing its legal reasoning \nand explaining the dangers of offering too much legislative power to \nprivate entities. By contrast, in her dissent, Justice Owen argued \nthat, ``[w]hile the Constitution certainly permits the Legislature to \nenact laws that preserve and conserve the State's natural resources, \nthere is nothing in the Constitution that requires the Legislature to \nexercise that power in any particular manner,'' ignoring entirely the \npossibility of an unconstitutional delegation of power. Her view \nstrongly favored large business interests to the clear detriment of the \npublic interest, and against the persuasive legal arguments of a \nmajority of the Court.\n  When I asked her about this case at her hearing, I found her answer \nperplexing. In a way that she did not argue in her written dissent, at \nher hearing Justice Owen attempted to cast the FM Properties case not \nas, ``a fight between and City of Austin and big business, but in all \nhonesty, . . . really a fight about . . . the State of Texas versus the \nCity of Austin.'' In the written dissent however, she began by stating \nthe, ``importance of this case to private property rights and the \nseparation of powers between the judicial and legislative branches . . \n.'', and went on to decry the Court's decision as one that, ``will \nimpair all manner of property rights.'' 22 S.W. 3d at 889. At the time \nshe wrote her dissent, Justice Owen was certainly clear about the \nmeaning of this case--property rights for corporations.\n  Another case that concerned me is GTE Southwest, Inc. v. Bruce, 990 \nS.W.2d 605, where Justice Owen wrote in favor of GTE in a lawsuit by \nemployees for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The rest of \nthe Court held that three employees subjected to what the majority \ncharacterized as ``constant humiliating and abusive behavior of their \nsupervisor'' were entitled to the jury verdict in their favor. Despite \nthe Court's recitation of an exhaustive list of sickening behavior by \nthe supervisor, and its clear application of Texas law to those facts, \nJustice Owen wrote a concurring opinion to explain her difference of \nopinion on the key legal issue in the case--whether the behavior in \nevidence met the legal standard for intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress.\n  Justice Owen contended that the conduct was not, as the standard \nrequires, ``so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to \ngo beyond all possible bounds of decency . . .'' The majority opinion \nshows Justice Owen's concurrence advocating an inexplicable point of \nview that ignores the facts in evidence in order to reach a \npredetermined outcome in the corporation's favor.\n\n  Justice Owen's recitation of facts in her concurrence significantly \nminimizes the evidence as presented by the majority. Among the kinds of \nbehavior to which the employees were subjected--according to the \nmajority opinion--are: Upon his arrival the supervisor, ``began \nregularly using the harshest vulgarity . . . continued to use the word \n``f----''\nand ``motherf----r'' frequently when speaking with the employees . . . \nrepeatedly physically and verbally threatened and terrorized them . . . \nwould frequently assault each of the employees by physically charging \nat them . . . come up fast . . . and get up over (the employee) . . . \nand yell and scream in her face . . . called (an employee) into his \noffice every day and . . . have her stand in front of him, sometimes \nfor as long as thirty minutes, while (the supervisor) simply stared at \nher . . . made (an employee) get on her hands and knees and clean the \nspots (on the carpet) while he stood over her yelling.'' Justice Owen \ndid not believe that such conduct was outrageous or outside the bounds \nof decency under state law.\n  At her hearing, in answer to Senator Edwards's questions about this \ncase, Justice Owen again gave an explanation not to be found in her \nwritten views. She told him that she agreed with the majority's \nholding, and wrote separately only to make sure that future litigants \nwould not be confused and think that out of context, any one of the \noutrages suffered by the plaintiffs would not support a judgment. \nLooking again at her dissent, I do not see why, if that was what she \ntruly intended, she did not say so in language plain enough to be \nunderstood, or why she thought it necessary to write and say it in the \nfirst place. It is a somewhat curious distinction to make--to advocate \nthat in a tort case a judge should write a separate concurrence to \nexplain which part of the plaintiff's case, standing alone, would not \nsupport a finding of liability. Neither her written concurrence, nor \nher answers in explanation after the fact, is satisfactory explanation \nof her position in this case.\n  In City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News, 22 S.W. 3d 351, Tex. 2000, \nJustice Owen dissented from a majority opinion and, again, it is \ndifficult to justify her views other than as being based on a desire to \nreach a particular outcome. The majority upheld a decision giving the \nnewspaper access to a document outlining the reasons why the city's \nfinance director was going to be fired. Justice Owen made two \narguments: that because the document was considered a draft it was not \nsubject to disclosure, and that the document was exempt from disclosure \nbecause it was part of policy making. Both of these exceptions were so \nlarge as to swallow the rule requiring disclosure. The majority rightly \npoints out that if Justice Owen's views prevailed, almost any document \ncould be labeled draft to shield it from public view. Moreover, to call \na personnel decision a part of policy making is such an expansive \ninterpretation it would leave little that would not be ``policy.''\n  Quantum Chemical v. Toennies, 47 S.W. 3d 473, Tex. 2001, is another \ntroubling case where Justice Owen joined a dissent advocating an \nactivist interpretation of a clearly written statute. In this age \ndiscrimination suit brought under the Texas civil rights statute, the \nrelevant parts of which were modeled on Title VII of the federal Civil \nRights Act--and its amendments--the appeal to the Texas Supreme Court \ncentered on the standard of causation necessary for a finding for the \nplaintiff. The plaintiff argued, and the five justices in the majority \nagreed, that the plain meaning of the statute must be followed, and \nthat the plaintiff could prove an unlawful employment practice by \nshowing that discrimination was ``a motivating factor.'' The employer \ncorporation argued, and Justices Hecht and Owen agreed, that the plain \nmeaning could be discarded in favor of a more tortured and unnecessary \nreading of the statute, and that the plaintiff must show that \ndiscrimination was ``the motivating factor,'' in order to recover \ndamages.\n  The portion of Title VII on which the majority relies for its \ninterpretation was part of Congress's 1991 fix to the United States \nSupreme Court's opinion in the Price Waterhouse case, which held that \nan employer could avoid liability if the plaintiff could not show \ndiscrimination was ``the'' motivating factor. Congress's fix, in \nSection 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, does not specify whether \nthe motivating factor standard applies to both sorts of discrimination \ncases, the so-called ``mixed motive'' cases as well as the ``pretext'' \ncases.\n  The Texas majority concluded that they must rely on the plain \nlanguage of the statute as amended, which could not be any clearer that \nunder Title VII discrimination can be shown to be ``a'' motivating \nfactor. Justice Owen joined Justice Hecht in claiming that federal case \nlaw is clear (in favor of their view), and opted for a reading of the \nstatute that would turn it into its polar opposite, forcing plaintiffs \ninto just the situation legislators were trying to avoid. This example \nof Justice\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\nOwen's desire to change the law from the bench, instead of interpret \nit, fits President Bush's definition of activism to a ``T''.\n  Justice Owen has also demonstrated her tendency toward ends-oriented \ndecision making quite clearly in a series of dissents and concurrences \nin cases involving a Texas law providing for a judicial bypass of \nparental notification requirements for minors seeking abortions.\n  The most striking example is Justice Owen's expression of \ndisagreement with the majority's decision on key legal issues in Doe 1. \nShe strongly disagreed with the majority's holding on what a minor \nwould have to show in order to establish that she was, as the statute \nrequires, ``sufficiently well informed'' to make the decision on her \nown. While the conservative Republican majority laid out a well-\nreasoned test for this element of the law, based on the plain meaning \nof the statute and well-cited case law, Justice Owen inserted elements \nfound in neither authority. Specifically, Justice Owen insisted that \nthe majority's requirement that the minor be ``aware of the emotional \nand psychological aspects of undergoing an abortion'' was not \nsufficient and that among other requirements with no basis in the law, \nshe, ``would require . . . [that the minor] should . . . indicate to \nthe court that she is aware of and has considered that there are \nphilosophic, social, moral, and religious arguments that can be brought \nto bear when considering abortion.'' In re Jane Doe 1, 19 S.W.3d 249, \n256, Tex. 2000.\n\n  In her written concurrence, Justice Owen indicated, through legal \ncitation, that support for this proposition could be found in a \nparticular page of the Supreme Court's opinion in Planned Parenthood v. \nCasey. However, when one looks at that portion of the Casey decision, \none finds no mention of requiring a minor to acknowledge religious or \nmoral arguments. The passage talks instead about the ability of a State \nto ``enact rules and regulations designed to encourage her to know that \nthere are philosophic and social arguments of great weight that can be \nbrought to bear.'' Justice Owen's reliance on this portion of a United \nStates Supreme Court opinion to rewrite Texas law was simply wrong.\n  As she did in answer to questions about a couple of other cases at \nher hearing, Justice Owen tried to explain away this problem with an \nafter-the-fact justification. She told Senator Cantwell that the \nreference to religion was not to be found in Casey after all, but in \nanother U.S. Supreme Court case, H.L. v. Matheson. She explained that \nin ``Matheson they talk about that for some people it raises profound \nmoral and religious concerns, and they're talking about the \ndesirability or the State's interest in these kinds of considerations \nin making an informed decision.'' Transcript at 172. But again, on \nreading Matheson, one sees that the only mention of religion comes in a \nquotation meant to explain why the parents of the minor are due \nnotification, not about the contours of what the government may require \nsomeone to prove to show she was fully well informed. Her reliance on \nMatheson for her proposed rewrite of the law is just as faulty as her \nreliance on Casey. Neither one supports her reading of the law. She \nsimply tries a little bit of legal smoke and mirrors to make it appear \nas if they did. This is the sort of ends-oriented decision making that \ndestroys the belief of a citizen in a fair legal system. And most \ntroubling of all was her indication to Senator Feinstein that she still \nviews her dissents in the Doe cases as the proper reading and \nconstruction of the Texas statute.\n  At her second, unprecedented hearing in 2003, Justice Owen and her \ndefenders tried hard to recast her record and others' criticism of it. \nI went to that hearing, I listened to her testimony, and I read her \nwritten answers, many newly formulated, that attempt to explain away \nher very disturbing opinions in the Texas parental notification cases. \nBut her record is still her record, and the record is clear. She did \nnot satisfactorily explain why she infused the words of the Texas \nlegislature with so much more meaning than she can be sure they \nintended. She adequately describes the precedents of the Supreme Court \nof the United States, to be sure, but she simply did not justify the \nleaps in logic and plain meaning she attempted in those decisions.\n  I read her responses to Senator Hatch's remarks at that second \nhearing, where he attempted to explain away cases about which I had \nexpressed concern at her first hearing. For example, I heard him \nexplain the opinion she wrote in F.M. Properties v. City of Austin. I \nread how he recharacterized the dispute in an effort to make it sound \ninnocuous, just a struggle between two jurisdictions over some \nunimportant regulations. I know how, through a choreographed exchange \nof leading questions and short answers, they tried to respond to my \nquestion from the original hearing, which was never really answered, \nabout why Justice Owen thought it was proper for the legislature to \ngrant large corporate landowners the power to regulate themselves. I \nremained unconvinced. The majority in this case, which invalidated a \nstate statute favoring corporations, did not describe the case or the \nissues as Senator Hatch and Justice Owen did. A fair reading of the \ncase shows no evidence of a struggle between governments. This is all \nan attempt at after-the-fact, revisionist justification where there \nreally is none to be found.\n  Justice Owen and Chairman Hatch's explanation of the case also lacked \neven the weakest effort at rebutting the criticism of her by the F.M. \nProperties majority. In its opinion, the six justice majority said, and \nI am quoting, that Justice Owen's dissent was ``nothing more than \ninflammatory rhetoric.'' They explained why her legal objections were \nmistaken, saying that no matter what the state legislature had the \npower to do on its own, it was simply unconstitutional to give the big \nlandowners the power they were given. No talk of the City of Austin v. \nthe State of Texas. Just the facts.\n  Likewise, the few explanations offered for the many other examples of \nthe times her Republican colleagues criticized her were unavailing. The \ntortured reading of Justice Gonzales' remarks in the Doe case were \nunconvincing. He clearly said that to construe the law in the way that \nJustice Owen's dissent construed the law would be activism. Any other \ninterpretation is just not credible.\n  And no reasons were offered for why her then-colleague, now ours, \nJustice Cornyn, thought it necessary to explain the principle of stare \ndecisis to her in his opinion in Weiner v. Wasson. Or why in Montgomery \nIndependent School District v. Davis, the majority criticized her for \nher disregard for legislative language, saying that, ``the dissenting \nopinion misconceives the hearing examiner's role in the . . . \nprocess,'' which it said stemmed from, ``its disregard of the \nprocedural elements the Legislature established . . . to ensure that \nthe hearing-examiner process is fair and efficient for both teachers \nand school boards.'' Or why, in Collins v. Ison-Newsome, a dissent \njoined by Justice Owen was so roundly criticized by the Republican \nmajority, which said the dissent agrees with one proposition but then \n``argues for the exact opposite proposition . . . [defying] the \nLegislature's clear and express limits on our jurisdiction.''\n  I have said it before, but I am forced to say it again. These \nexamples, together with the unusually harsh language directed at \nJustice Owen's position by the majority in the Doe cases, show a judge \nout of step with the conservative Republican majority of the Texas \nSupreme Court, a majority not afraid to explain the danger of her \nactivist views. No good explanation was offered for these critical \nstatements last year, and no good explanation was offered two weeks \nago. Politically motivated rationalizations do not negate the plain \nlanguage used to describe her activism at the time.\n  When he nominated Priscilla Owen, President Bush said that his \nstandard for judging judicial nominees would be that they ``share a \ncommitment to follow and apply the law, not to make law from the \nbench.'' He said he is against judicial activism. Yet he has appointed \njudicial activists like Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown.\n  Under President Bush's own standards, Justice Owen's record of ends-\noriented judicial activism does not qualify her for a lifetime \nappointment to the Federal bench.\n  The President has often spoken of judicial activism without \nacknowledging\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\nthat ends-oriented decision-making can come easily to extreme \nideological nominees. In the case of Priscilla Owen, we see a perfect \nexample of such an approach to the law, and I cannot support it. The \noath taken by federal judges affirms their commitment to ``administer \njustice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and \nto the rich.'' No one who enters a federal courtroom should have to \nwonder whether he or she will be fairly heard by the judge.\n  Justice Priscilla Owen's record of judicial activism and ends-\noriented decision making leaves me with grave doubt about her ability \nto be a fair judge. The President says he opposes putting judicial \nactivists on the Federal bench, yet Justice Priscilla Owen \nunquestionably is a judicial activist. I cannot vote to confirm her for \nthis appointment to one of the highest courts in the land.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what is the matter pending before the \nSenate at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination of Priscilla Owen.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about what \nwe have heard on the Senate floor today. The Presiding Officer and I \nare new Members to the Senate. We were not here as this struggle began. \nI must say, I am pretty deeply saddened by the misstatements of fact, \nthe innuendo, the half-truths we have heard on the Senate floor today. \nI also am somewhat saddened by the fact that the Constitution is spoken \nabout in such light terms. Because what the Constitution says is that, \nin fact, the Senate sets its own rules and the Senate can change its \nown rules. The first 100 years in this body, there was not a \nfilibuster, and that filibuster has gone through multiple changes \nduring the course of Senate history.\n  I pride myself on not being partisan on either the Democratic or the \nRepublican side. I am a partisan for ideas, for freedom, for liberty. I \nam also a partisan for truth. I believe, as we shave that truth, we do \na disservice not only to this body, but we also do a disservice to the \ncountry.\n  Another principle I am trying to live by is the principle of \nreconciliation. As we go forward in this debate, it is important for \nthe American people to truly understand what the history is in this \ndebate. At the beginning of the Congress, the majority, whether it be \nDemocrat or Republican in any Congress, whoever is in control, has a \nright to set up the rules.\n  Those rules were set up in this Congress with one provision--that an \nexception be made on the very issue we are talking about today. Why was \nthat exception put there? That exception was put there in an attempt to \nwork out the differences over the things that have happened in the past \nso we would not come to this point in time. I believe the majority \nleader, although maligned today on the floor, has made a great and \nhonest effort to work a compromise in the matter before us.\n  I also believe what has happened in the past in terms of judges not \ncoming out of committee probably has been inappropriate. That is not a \npartisan issue either. It has happened on both sides. As a matter of \nfact, there are appellate judges now being held up by Democratic \nSenators because they disagree on their nomination to come through the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  As a member of the committee and a nonlawyer on the Judiciary \nCommittee, it is becoming plain to me to see the importance of the \nprocedure within the committee.\n  Having said that, the Constitution gives the right to the President \nto appoint, under the advice and consent of the Senate. The debate is \nabout whether we will take a vote.\n  President Bush's appellate court nominees have the lowest acceptance \nrate of any of the last four Presidents.\n  Is that because the nominees are extreme? Or is there some other \nreason why we are in this mess that we find ourselves in? I really \nbelieve it is about the question: where do Supreme Court judges come \nfrom? They come from the appellate courts most often. And whether or \nnot we allow people--good, honest people--to put their names forward \nand come before this body and have true advice and consent is a \nquestion we are going to have to solve in the next couple of weeks.\n  There are lots of ways of solving it. One is doing what Senator Byrd \ndid four times in his history as leader of this body--a change in the \nrules by majority vote because the majority has the majority. That is \nnot a constitutional option; that is a Byrd option. That is an option \nvested in the power of the Senate under the Constitution to control the \nrules of the Senate.\n  Another little bit of history. Twenty-five years ago, the filibuster \nwas eliminated on the Budget and Reconciliation Act. The Congress \ndidn't fall apart. Under Senator Byrd's changes of the rules, the \nSenate did not fall apart. So the issue really is about whether or not \nthe majority has the power to control the rules in the Senate. And the \ndebate also is about whether or not we are going to have an up or down, \na fair vote on judges--just like we should have a debate on whether we \nshould have a process change in the Judiciary Committee for those \njudges who are appointed by any President to come through.\n  I said in my campaign for this office that conservative and liberal \nwasn't a test for me for judges. The foundation and principles of our \ncountry, and proof of excellence in the study of and acting on the law \nshould be the requirements. We had the unfortunate example today--this \nweek--of a Federal judge in Nebraska negating a marriage law that \ndefined marriage as between a man and a woman--an appointed judge \ndeciding for the rest of us--it could very well decide for all 50 \nStates--whether or not we are going to recognize marriage as between a \nman and a woman. We have heard Priscilla Owen's name linked several \ntimes because of her decisions--there were 13 or 14 decisions that came \nbefore the Texas Supreme Court on judicial review of a minor's access \nto an abortion without parental notification--not consent, but \nnotification.\n  In the one case that they bring up and misquote Attorney General \nGonzales on, she in fact did what the law said to do. The federal \nappellate court is not entitled, nor is the Supreme Court of Texas, to \nreview the findings of fact. The finder of fact is the original court. \nThey cannot make decisions on that. So she dissented on that basis. \nJudge Gonzales' statement was about whether or not he could go along \nwith that in terms of what would be applied to him in terms of judicial \nactivism. He has since said under oath that in no way, or at any time, \ndid he accuse Priscilla Owen of being a judicial activist.\n  Let's talk about activism. I want to relate a story that happened to \nme about 6 years ago. I was in Stigler, OK, having a townhall meeting. \nA father walked in, 35 years of age, with tears running down his cheek. \nIn his hand, he had a brown paper sack, and he interrupted this meeting \nbetween me and about 60 people. His question to me was: ``Dr. Coburn, \nhow is it that this sack could be given to my 12-year old daughter?'' \nOf course, I didn't know what was in the sack. What was in the sack was \nbirth control pills, condoms, and spermicide. The very fact that his \ndaughter could be treated in a clinic without his permission for \ncontraceptives came about through judicial activism. The fact is that \n80 to 85 percent of the people in this country find that wrong. Yet, it \ncannot be turned around. The fact is that 80 percent of the people in \nthis country believe that marriage is defined as that union between a \nman and a woman, and a Federal judge--not looking at the Constitution--\nnot looking at precedent, actually makes that change.\n  So it is a battle about ideas. Priscilla Owen recognizes what the law \nis. She has stated uniformly that she will follow the precedents set \nbefore the court. But we have gotten to where we are in terms of the \nissues that inflame and insight so much polarization in this body and \nthroughout the country because we have not had people following the \nlaw, but in fact we have had judicial activism.\n  I congratulate President Bush for sending these nominees to the \nSenate floor. I have interviewed Priscilla Owen. Her history, her \nrecommendations, her ratings are far in excess of superior. So why \nwould this wonderful woman, who has dedicated her life to the less \nfortunate, to families, to reinstituting and strengthening marriage, to \nmaking sure people who didn't\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\nhave legal aid had it, why is she being so lambasted, so maligned \nbecause of her beliefs? The beliefs she has are what 80 percent of the \npeople in this country have, but she doesn't fit with the beliefs of \nthe elite liberal sect in this country.\n  So it is a battle of ideas. It is a battle that will shape the future \nof our courts. How is it that a woman of such stature will have the \nstrength to withstand for 4 years--she has put everything about her, \nevery aspect of her personal life, her public life, her judicial career \nout front and has stood strong to continue to take the abuse and \nmaligning language that comes her way. Why would somebody do that? It \nis because she believes in this country. She believes in the \nfoundational principles that our colleague from New York held up in the \nConstitution. She has sworn and believes in that Constitution. She has \nthe courage to know that the fight for our children, for our parents to \ncontrol the future for our children, is worth the fight.\n  I would like to spend a minute going over some poll numbers with the \nAmerican public on the very issue of whether or not a minor child ought \nto have parental involvement in a major procedure such as an abortion.\n  Having delivered over 4,000 babies, having handled every complication \nof pregnancy that is known, I am very familiar with these issues.\n  There are five polls I would like to put in the Record. I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      POLLS ON REQUIRING PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN MINORS' ABORTIONS\n                            [March 23, 2005]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Favor        Oppose\n                     Polls                       (percent)    (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n``Do you favor or oppose requiring parental              75           18\n notification before a minor could get an\n abortion?''

One is a March 2-7, 2005, poll from Quinnipiac \nUniversity:\n\n       Do you favor or oppose requiring parental notification \n     before a minor could get an abortion?\n\n  That is notification. Seventy-five percent of the people in this \ncountry agree with that. It is not an extreme position when 75 percent \nof our fellow Americans think that is right--think that in fact we \ndon't give up rights to our children until they are emancipated and are \nadults.\n\n       Next, do you favor or oppose each of the following \n     proposals: A law requiring women under 18 to get parental \n     consent for any abortion?\n\n  That is not notification, that is consent. That is a CNN/USA Today/\nGallup poll, January 10, 2003.\n  Seventy-three percent favor parents being involved in the health care \nof their children and major decisions that will affect their future.\n\n       Do you favor or oppose requiring that one parent of a girl \n     who is under 18 years of age be notified before an abortion \n     is performed on the girl?\n\n  Eighty-three percent favor the parent being notified. That is a \nWirthlin Worldwide poll.\n\n       Should girls under the age of 18 be required to get the \n     consent of at least one parent before having an abortion?\n\n  That is a Los Angeles Times poll. Eighty-two percent believe that.\n  What is described as extreme is mainline to the American public. What \nwe have is a battle for ideas, a battle under which the future of our \ncountry will follow.\n  The word ``activist'' in reference to judges is a word that is wildly \nused. It is almost amusing that we hear it from one side of the Senate \nto the other side of the Senate. What is activism on one side is not \nactivism on the other. What is activism to the minority is not activism \nto the majority.\n  What is activism? Activism is reaching into the law and the \nprecedents of law and creating something that was not there before. \nActivism is intentionally misinterpreting statutes to produce a \npolitical gain. I will go back to the child and the father, 35 years of \nage, screaming at the depths of his heartache as to how in our country \nwe have gotten to the point where a judge can decide ahead of the \nSenate, ahead of the House, ahead of both bodies and the President, \nwhat will happen to our minor children. That is what this debate is \nabout.\n  Priscilla Owen exemplifies the values that the American people hold, \nbut she also exemplifies the values of the greatest jurists of our \ntime: a strict adherence to the law, a love of the law, and a \nwillingness to sacrifice her life and her career and her personal \nreputation to go through this process.\n  Senator Ensign, the Senator from Nevada, made a very good point a \nmoment ago, and I think it bears repeating. How many people will not \nput their name up in the future who are eminently qualified, have great \njudicial history, will have great recommendations from the American Bar \nAssociation but do not want to have to go through the half-truths, the \ninnuendos, and the slurring of character that occurs, to come before \nthis body?\n  My hope is that before we come to the Byrd option or a change in the \nrules, that cooler heads will decide that we will not filibuster judges \nin the future, and we will not block nominations at the committee. That \nis reasonable. We do not have to do that. A President should have his \nnominees voted on. If they come to the committee and they do not have a \nrecommendation, they should still come to the floor, or if they have a \nrecommendation they not be approved, they should still come to the \nfloor, or if they have a recommendation they be approved, they should \nstill come to the floor. But it is fair for a President to have a vote \non their nominations.\n  We have seen this President's numbers on appointments. That is right. \nWhy has he had so many people appointed? Because he has nominated great \njurists, and could they have filibustered others, they would have. The \nironic part is that they say that Priscilla Owen is ``not qualified.'' \nHowever, in the negotiations leading up to the point we find ourselves, \nthe offer has been made that we can pick two out of any four of the \npeople who are on the queue to come before this body and let those two \ngo through and two be thrown away. If that is the case, if any two will \ndo, then they are obviously qualified. If they are acceptable under a \ndeal, then they are obviously qualified.\n  The argument against qualification, the activist charges do not hold \nwater. What does hold water is the fact that these individuals who \nstand in the mainstream of American thought, values, and ideals will be \nappellate judges and that someday maybe have an appointment or a \nnomination for a Supreme Court judgeship. That holds water. We have to \ndecide in the Senate whether or not we are going to allow the process \nof filibustering judicial nominations to continue.

Mr. President, at a time when the importance of the \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration is highlighted by concerns over the \nsafety of pharmaceuticals, it would be foolish to move forward with \nimportation policies that would circumvent the safety regulations of \nthe FDA. I want to take this opportunity to highlight a recent \ninternational Internet pharma-trafficking network that was shut down in \nPhiladelphia, which I strongly believe provides a very accurate, and \ndisturbing, window on what exactly a prescription drug importation \nscheme would mean for Americans.\n  On April 20, 2005, the Department of Justice announced the unsealing \nof an indictment returned by a Federal grand jury on April 6, 2005. The \nindictment chronicled how the ``Bansal Organization'' used the Internet \nto fill orders for pharmaceuticals. In turn, this crime ring \nfacilitated millions of un-prescribed pills coming into the United \nStates--of which the bio-efficacy and the safety have yet to be \ndetermined--to consumers who only needed a credit card. These drugs \nincluded potentially dangerous narcotics, such as codine and Valium, \ndrugs that can cause serious harm if not taken under a physician's \nsupervision, and which have been highlighted repeatedly as drugs that \npose special concerns as we debate possible importation.\n  Stretching from America to countries such as India, Antigua, and \nSingapore, officials estimate that this international conspiracy \nprovided $20 million worth of un-prescribed drugs to hundreds of \nthousands of people worldwide--most if not all of whom had no idea \nwhere their drugs originated. This drug scam exemplifies how the \nInternet can be a door to an unregulated world of just about any kind \nof pharmaceutical--including counterfeits and potentially dangerous \nnarcotics. This is particularly concerning given the growing ease at \nwhich prescription drugs can be purchased over the Internet.\n  At the heart of the debate on foreign importation of prescription \ndrugs is the concern over the cost of prescription drugs. Often \nproponents claim that importation would allow Americans access to other \ncountries' drugs at a cheaper price, despite thorough analysis by the \nU.S. Health and Human Services Task Force on Prescription Drug \nImportation. The HHS Task Force reported that any associated cost \nsavings with importation would be negated by the costs associated with \nconstructing and attempting to safely maintain such a system, and \nultimately concluded what both past and current Administrations have \nfound: the safety of imported drugs purchased by individuals, via the \nInternet or other means, cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, generic \nprescription drugs in America are on average 50 percent less than their \nforeign counterparts. This holds true in the case of the ``Bansal \nOrganization,'' in which the vast majority of the trafficked drugs were \nsold at prices higher than what a consumer would have paid at a \nlegitimate pharmacy. The safety of the American drug supply should not \nbe sacrificed for supposed savings. Those that continue to purport that \nimportation would provide cheaper drugs are misleading the American \npeople, and as a result putting their health and lives at risk.\n  Importation will not equate to cheaper drugs for Americans, but it \nwill lead to an explosion of opportunities for counterfeiters to take \nadvantage of the American people by compromising the safety of our drug \nsupply. Many individuals, both patients and healthcare professionals, \nwho testified during the HHS Task Force's proceedings expressed \nsignificant concerns that importation would compromise the integrity of \nthe American drug supply by creating a vehicle through which terrorists \ncould easily introduce harmful agents in the United States. Recall that \nin 1982, seven Americans died after ingesting Tylenol laced with \ncyanide. More recently, in July 2003 members of a Florida-based drug-\ncounterfeiting ring who sold and diluted counterfeited drugs were \nindicted, and 18 million tablets of counterfeit Lipitor were recalled \nafter evidence revealed that this popular anti-cholesterol drug had \nbeen manufactured overseas and repackaged in the United States to hide \nthe deception. Importation would provide for any of these acts to be \ncommitted on a larger, exponentially more devastating, national scale. \nTo put this in perspective, in 2003, 69 million prescriptions were \nwritten for Lipitor in the United States alone.\n  The ``Bansal Organization'' bust is but the latest in a series of \nillicit pharmaceutical trafficking scams, which are extremely \nlucrative, and which our law enforcement officials are already \nstruggling to combat on a daily basis. Why would we elect to open the \ndoor to importation when we know that doing so will create infinite \nopportunities to compromise the safety of our drug supply?\n  As we continue to debate the best ways to ensure that Americans have \naccess to the highest quality, affordable prescription drugs, I would \ncaution my colleagues that importation is not the answer. It would be \nunconscionable to facilitate in any way the dangerous shortcuts \nutilized in the Philadelphia drug scam--shortcuts that circumvent the \nessential ongoing patient relationship with physicians and other \nlicensed professionals trained to monitor potential medication \ninteractions and side effects that can lead to serious injury and/or \ndeath.\n  Congress should uphold the strong regulatory standards on drug safety \nthat exist today, and not open our borders to prescription drugs from a \nworld of unknown sources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/18/senate-section/article/S5433-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5433-S5434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VICARIOUS LIABILITY REFORM\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, being mindful of yesterday's passage of \nSAFETEA, I rise to speak to an issue that was not addressed in the \nSenate bill. This is an area of the legal system needing reform that \naffects interstate commerce in the transportation sector--vicarious \nliability. These types of laws exist in only a handful of States where \nnonnegligent owners of rented and leased vehicles are liable for the \nactions of vehicle operators.\n  Although a vehicle renting or leasing company may take every \nprecaution to ensure that a vehicle is in optimal operating condition \nand meets every safety standard, these companies can still be subject \nto costly lawsuits due to the actions of the vehicle's operator, over \nwhich the company has no control. Under these laws, leasing or rental \ncompanies can be liable simply because they are the owner of the \nvehicle.\n  Though only a few States enforce laws that threaten nonnegligent \ncompanies with unlimited vicarious liability, they affect consumers and \nbusinesses from all 50 States. Vicarious liability means higher \nconsumer costs in acquiring vehicles and buying insurance and means \nhigher commercial costs for the transportation of goods. Left \nunreformed, these laws could have a devastating, effect on an \nincreasing number of small businesses that have done nothing wrong.\n  The House acted in H.R. 3 to address these unfair laws by creating a \nuniform standard to exclude nonnegligent vehicle renting and leasing \ncompanies from liability for the actions of a customer operating a safe \nvehicle. Under this provision, States would continue to determine the \nlevel of compensation available for accident victims by setting minimum \ninsurance coverage requirements for every vehicle. Vicarious liability \nreform would not protect companies that have been negligent in\n\n[[Page S5434]]\n\ntheir renting or leasing practices or in the care of the vehicle. This \nprovision is a common sense reform that holds vehicle operators \naccountable for their own actions and does not unfairly punish owners \nwho have done nothing wrong.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate bill does not contain this important \nreform. I urge my colleagues. to consider the merits of this provision \nand retain the House-passed language in the conference bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/18/senate-section/article/S5434-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT\n\n\n                             I-49 and I-69\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter of great \nimportance to my State, one that I hear about every time I go home. \nEconomic development and job creation is something that every Arkansan \nis concerned about. One surefire way to generate economic development \nand create jobs is through highway construction. The U.S. DOT estimates \nthat for every $1 billion of investment in highways, 47,500 jobs are \ncreated, but the benefits go far beyond that. It does Arkansans no good \nto have good health care, education, and jobs if they don't have the \nroads to get there. Furthermore, business investors do not want to \nplace their companies anywhere that does not have ready access to \ninterstate roads.\n  My State is in the process of building two new interstates that would \njumpstart economic growth, relieve congestion, and provide two \nadditional freight corridors between our two largest trading partners.\n  Future Interstate 49 connects Canada with New Orleans and would \nprovide the only north-south corridor within 300 miles, cutting through \nKansas City, MO and Western Arkansas. 1-49 is extremely important to \nArkansas, as it traverses the fastest growing part of my State, which \nis home to Wal-Mart, Tyson's, JB Hunt Transportation, and numerous \nother transportation companies. The potential for freight movement \nalong this corridor is enormous. However, the State of Arkansas has \nlacked the funds to make significant progress along the most expensive \npart of the corridor.\n  Future Interstate 69 connects Canada with Mexico through Michigan, \nIndiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas. It also \nhas enormous potential for freight movement, but it also cuts across \nthe poorest region of my State where economic development is vitally \nimportant to the future of local communities. The amount of jobs a \nproject such as I-69 would create has the potential to lift these areas \nout of poverty.\n  During debate on the highway bill, I have requested amounts that \nwould provide Arkansas with a sufficient amount of money to make \nsignificant progress on these two extremely important roadways.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to first commend the Senator for his continued \nwork on transportation issues. He is a real leader in this area and I \nappreciate his hard work on behalf of the State of Arkansas. I am aware \nof the Senator's requests and I understand the importance of these \nprojects to Arkansas and the country. My colleague has been very \npersistent and we have worked hard to include a formula in the bill \nthat provides a significant increase in funding to Arkansas so that the \nState may be able to accomplish this task. Specifically, Arkansas \nstands to gain over $550 million over the 5 years of this bill, a 30 \npercent increase from the levels they received under TEA-21. Would this \namount be sufficient to make progress on the two important interstates \nSenator Pryor has mentioned?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator from Montana for his question. My \nunderstanding is that this amount would be enough to make substantial \nprogress on both projects until the next reauthorization. However, \nsince this bill does not include references to specific projects, the \ndifficulty would be to make sure these projects did indeed receive a \nlarge portion of this increase. Since the increases are largely through \napportioned programs to the State, could my State use the increases to \nfund these interstate projects?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct that the bill in the Senate does \nnot have specific funding for projects. However, it is up to the State \nof Arkansas to make the decision on how to spend this increase in \nfunding and the additional money to the State can certainly be used to \nmake progress on these projects. I would expect that many States would \nconsider projects such as the ones described in Arkansas that are \nnationally significant. It would be up to the State to set those \npriorities and move forward. I believe the projects in Arkansas, both \n1-49 and 1-69, are in various stages of development and construction. \nIt is my understanding that both projects are eligible for Federal \nfunding under this reauthorization bill we have written.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank Senator Baucus for his hard work as a manager of \nthis bill and the ranking member of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Subcommittee of EPW and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, and I compliment him for this strong bill he has helped put \ntogether. The Senator always listens to my concerns, and I appreciate \nhis willingness to include such robust funding for my home State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/18/senate-section/article/S5434-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DESIRE TO WITHDRAW S.J.

Last week, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sent his \nbase closure recommendations to the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission. I am deeply disappointed with his decision to include \nEllsworth Air Force Base. This recommendation is short-sighted and \nharmful to our national security. I am confident that the BRAC \nCommission will recognize the invaluable contribution that Ellsworth \nmakes to the defense of our homeland and will support removing it from \nthe list.\n  Ellsworth is one of only two bases in the country where the B-1 is \nstationed. In the past decade, the B-1 has been invaluable to our \nnational defense and it is truly the backbone of our bomber fleet. B-1 \ncrews stationed at Ellsworth have flown missions in Kosovo, \nAfghanistan, and Iraq. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, B-1s were \nintegral in liberating Iraq by dropping more than half the satellite \nguided munitions on critical targets including command and control \nfacilities, bunkers, and surface-to-air missile sites.\n  In addition, Ellsworth is strategically located and has excellent \naccess to B-1 training ranges. It is not threatened by urban \nencroachment or congested air space and has strong community support. \nDuring the past decade, I have used my position on the Military \nConstruction Appropriations subcommittee to help direct funding to \nEllsworth for critical upgrades including a new base operations \nbuilding, a B-1 training facility, and military housing that ranks \namongst the best in the country. Given its ideal location, as well as \nthe long-term investment in the base's infrastructure, Ellsworth is \ncapable of expanding and accepting new missions.\n  I emphatically disagree with the Secretary's recommendation to close \nEllsworth, and I am eager to work with the Ellsworth Task Force, and \nthe entire South Dakota Congressional delegation, to ensure Ellsworth \nremains a vital part of our national defense. Ellsworth is a premier \ninstallation that has proven it can be a competitive military base for \ndecades to come.\n  To that end, I am cosponsoring legislation that will postpone this \nround of base closures. At a time when we are engaged in two military \nconflicts, as well as rotating soldiers back to the U.S. from overseas \ninstallations, we should not be closing bases at home. Simultaneously \nclosing domestic and\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\noverseas bases will irrevocably damage our ability to defend against \nthreats at home and abroad.\n  This bill will delay this round of domestic base closures until the \nrecommendations offered by the Overseas Basing Commission report has \nbeen reviewed by the Department of Defense. In addition, the bill would \nprohibit this round of base closures from commencing until combat units \ncurrently deployed to Iraq have returned home and the Pentagon \ncompletes the quadrennial defense review. I firmly believe that these \nare reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure we do not irreversibly \nimpair our national defense.\n  The entire State of South Dakota is proud of Ellsworth and the men \nand women stationed there for their role in keeping America safe. We \nare confident that the commission will see the military value of \nEllsworth and will support removing it from the base closure list.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/18/senate-section/article/S5435-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            HONORING SOUTH DAKOTA AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \ntwo American Legion Auxiliary units in South Dakota for the wonderful \nservices they provide to their communities. I point to Unit 230 Pike-\nHuska American Legion Auxiliary Post of Aurora, and Unit 74 of \nBrookings as fine units whose efforts are worthy of recognition.\n  In April of 2005, Unit 230 in Aurora sponsored an Election Forum \ndesigned to introduce voters to the four candidates running for Aurora \nCity Council. The meeting enabled the community to not only meet the \ncandidates, but also learn about their positions on various issues.\n  Additionally, Aurora Unit 230 joined with Brookings Unit 74 to \nfulfill ``The Dictionary Project.'' Since Aurora school children are \nbussed to the three schools in the Brookings School District, the two \nunits collaborated by purchasing and hand delivering 206 dictionaries, \none to each third grade student in the Brookings district. Upon \nreceiving the dictionary, each student signed it, thus establishing it \nas his or hers to keep. ``The Dictionary Project'' was so successful \nthat the Auxiliary plans to continue this generous program each year.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor the American Legion \nAuxiliary Unit 230 and Unit 74 for their outstanding service. Their \ncommitment to encouraging voter awareness and helping our young people \nin their pursuit of knowledge is admirable. I strongly commend their \nhard work and dedication, and I am very pleased that their efforts are \nbeing publicly recognized and celebrated. It is with great honor that I \nshare their impressive commitment to civic duty with my \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/18/senate-section/article/S5435-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CIVIC EDUCATION IN ACTION\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \noutstanding efforts of a group of young Idahoans from Madison High \nSchool in Rexburg, ID. These young men and women came to Washington, \nD.C., to represent my State in the national finals of the ``We the \nPeople: the Citizen and the Constitution'' program. They represented \nIdaho well and are a tribute to our State's youth.\n  The national finals include a mock congressional hearing which gives \nthe students the opportunity to translate their specialized learning in \nhistory, social studies, government and civics into action. As they use \ntheir newly-gained knowledge of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights \nto examine, counter and defend issues facing America today, they come \nto appreciate the timeless nature of this great document. This \nexperience gives students the opportunity to apply civic values to \nreal-life challenges and will serve them in whatever they choose to do \nafter they graduate from high school.\n  Idaho can be proud of the growth of civic virtue in these young \npeople. As they look beyond themselves to the realm of the public good, \nIdaho and America will benefit as these individuals develop into \nresponsible, intelligent citizens who practice discernment in judgment \nin matters of concern to our State and Nation. In the future, these \nstudent citizens will be more inclined to exhibit leadership faithful \nto the ideals upon which our country was built and consonant with the \nnotions of liberty, freedom, justice and rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/18/senate-section/article/S5435-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING STEVE SINTON\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nSteve Sinton of Shandon, CA, on winning the American Farmland Trust's \n2005 Steward of the Land Award. This award recognizes Steve for his \nlifelong commitment to conservation and sound stewardship practices. He \nis the ninth American farmer to win this award, and I am pleased to \npraise his efforts and achievements today.\n  Created in 1997 in honor of farmer and conservationist Peggy McGrath \nRockefeller, the American Farmland Trust gives the Steward of the Land \nAward each year to a farmer or farm family in the United States who has \nshown outstanding leadership at the national, State, and local levels \nin protecting farmland and caring for the environment. This award \nrecognizes ranchers such as Steve and helps raise awareness about the \npublic benefits of good stewardship and the importance of conserving \nland for future generations.\n  Through his work on his own land and throughout the State of \nCalifornia, Steve Sinton has epitomized the spirit of this award \nthrough his dedication to protecting our country's farmlands and \nranchlands, understanding how critical they are to supporting our local \ncommunities, sustaining our Nation's food supply, and preserving clean \nwater and wildlife habitat.\n  A fourth generation California rancher, Steve and his wife Jane \nmanage 18,000 acres of ranchland and 125 acres of vineyards where they \nutilize a variety of innovative practices to promote sustainability and \nprotect the environment. He effectively works with local governments to \nprotect ranch and farmlands, and Steve and his family have also played \nan important role in providing habitat for the reintroduction of the \nCalifornia condor on their land, including essential nesting grounds.\n  But Steve's efforts go far beyond his own family's farm. Steve helped \nform the California Rangeland Trust in 1998 where he was elected to \nserve as the founding chairman. With his leadership, the Rangeland \nTrust has protected over 170,000 acres of ranchland. Steve has also \nserved as vice-chairman of the California Cattlemen's Association Land \nUse Committee, where his dedication and leadership galvanized support \namong the ranching community for agricultural conservation and \nconservation practices.\n  A look at Steve's family history makes clear why he works so hard for \nfarmland preservation and takes these efforts so seriously. Steve's \nfamily came to San Luis Obispo County in 1874 and bought the family \nfarm the following year, meaning that Steve's family has been ranching \nin the county for 130 years. Steve grew up on the family ranch and \nattended my alma mater, Stanford University, before heading to the \nUniversity of Colorado School of Law. After five years with the \nCalifornia Department of Water Resources in Sacramento, CA, Steve \nreturned to San Luis Obispo County to help manage the family's ranches \nand continue his private water law practice. In addition to all this, \nSteve also has been active in his community, working with numerous \norganizations, coaching sports, and serving on the Shandon School Board \nfor fifteen years.\n  As a U.S. Senator representing the State of California, I \ncongratulate Steve on winning this award and thank him for his many \nyears of service to our State.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for the purchase of hearing aids; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp millions of Americans enjoy the gift of sound. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators Gordon Smith, Olympia J. Snowe, Mark Dayton, and Tom \nHarkin, who I know care as deeply about these issues as I do.\n  Hearing loss is one of the most common and widespread health problems \naffecting Americans today. In fact, thirty-three babies are born each \nday with hearing loss, making deafuess the most common birth defect in \nAmerica. According to the National Council on Aging, as many as 70 \npercent of our elderly experience hearing loss. All told, 31.5 million \nAmericans currently suffer from some form of hearing loss.\n  The good news is that 95 percent of individuals with hearing loss can \nbe successfully treated with hearing aids. Unfortunately, however, only \n22 percent of Americans suffering from hearing loss can afford to use \nthis technology. In other words, over 24 million Americans will live \nwithout sound because they cannot afford treatment.\n  That is why we are introducing the Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit \nAct.\n  This legislation provides help to those who need it most, our \nchildren and seniors, by providing a tax credit of up to $500, once \nevery 5 years, toward the purchase of any ``qualified hearing aid'' as \ndefined by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n  Hearing aids are not just portals to sound, but portals to success in \nschool, business, and life. That is why a number of diverse \norganizations, including the Hearing Industries Association, Self Help \nfor Hard of Hearing People, the International Hearing Society, the Deaf \nand Hard of Hearing Alliance, American Speech-Language-Hearing \nAssociation, and the American Academy of Audiology support the Hearing \nAid Assistance Tax Credit Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Hearing loss may be one of the most common health problems in the \nUnited States, but it doesn't have to be. We can tackle the problem \nhead on with the Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues this Congress to approve \nthis commonsense solution to a serious problem.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Deaf and Hard of Hearing Alliance: A Coalition of \n           Consumer and Professional Organizations,\n                                                     May 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Norm Coleman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coleman: We, the undersigned, representing \n     both consumer and health professional organizations of the \n     Deaf and Hard of Hearing Alliance (DHHA), write to express \n     our strong support for the ``Hearing Aid Assistance Tax \n     Credit Act'' you are introducing in the Senate today. While \n     we support and encourage more comprehensive solutions, we \n     believe your legislation can aid some who presently have no \n     options but to pay out of pocket for these essential devices.\n       Enactment of your legislation will provide a tax credit of \n     up to $500 per hearing aid, available once every five years, \n     towards the purchase of a hearing aid(s) for individuals age \n     55 and over, or those purchasing a hearing aid for a \n     dependent.\n       As you have pointed out with the introduction of this bill, \n     special tax treatment would improve access to hearing aids \n     since only 22 percent of Americans who could benefit from \n     hearing aids currently use them. Approximately 1 million \n     children under the age of 18 and nearly 10 million Americans \n     over the age of 54 have a diagnosed hearing loss but are not \n     currently using a hearing aid.\n       The expense of the hearing aid is an important factor why \n     Americans with hearing loss go without these devices. Some 40 \n     percent of individuals with hearing loss have incomes of less \n     than $30,000 per year. Nearly 30 percent of those with \n     hearing loss cite financial constraints as a core reason they \n     do not use hearing aids. In 2002, the average cost for a \n     hearing aid was over $1,400, and almost two-thirds of \n     individuals with hearing loss require two devices, thereby \n     increasing the average out of pocket expense to over $2,800. \n     The new tax credit you propose will assist many who might \n     otherwise do without and have limited options.\n       Hearing aids are presently not covered under Medicare, or \n     under the vast majority of state mandated benefits. In fact, \n     71.4% of hearing aid purchases do not involve third party \n     payments, placing the entire burden of the hearing aid \n     purchase on the consumer.\n       The need is real. Hearing loss affects 2-3 infants per \n     1,000 births. For adults, hearing loss usually occurs more \n     gradually, but increases dramatically with age. Ten million \n     older Americans experience age-related hearing loss. For \n     workers, noise induced hearing loss is the second most self-\n     reported occupational injury. Ten million young adults and \n     working aged Americans have noise-induced hearing loss.\n       Enactment of your bill will make a difference in the lives \n     of some people with hearing loss. Currently 1.28 million \n     Americans of all ages purchase hearing aids each year, with \n     many individuals requiring two devices, bringing the total \n     number of hearing aids purchased across all age groups to \n     approximately 2 million. This number has remained constant \n     over recent years. While the legislation is not intended to \n     cover the full cost of hearing aids, it will provide some \n     measure of financial assistance to the groups who are in need \n     of these devices but are unable to afford them.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue. We \n     look forward to working with you to seek enactment of your \n     legislation during the 109th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf & Hard of \n           Hearing (AGBell), American Academy of Audiology (AAA), \n           American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), \n           Conference of Educational Administrators of Schools and \n           Programs for the Deaf (CEASD), Cued Language Network of \n           America (CLNA), Media Access Group at WGBH.\n         National Association of the Deaf (NAD), National Court \n           Reporters Association (NCRA), National Cued Speech \n           Association (NCSA), Self Help for Hard of Hearing \n           People (SHHH), Telecommunications for the Deaf, Inc. \n           (TDI), TECHUnit.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 17, 2005.\n     Hon. Norm Coleman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coleman: The American Speech-Language-Hearing \n     Association (ASHA) commends you for your continued leadership \n     on behalf of the estimated 28 million American children and \n     adults with hearing loss by introducing legislation to \n     provide assistance to those purchasing hearing aids. The \n     Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act will provide financial \n     assistance to those who need hearing aids, but are unable to \n     afford them. This bill will provide much needed assistance to \n     those adults over 55 years of age and families with children \n     who experience hearing loss.\n       Studies indicate that when children with hearing loss \n     receive early intervention and treatment with devices such as \n     hearing aids, their speech and language development improves \n     dramatically, making the need for special education services \n     less likely and costly. Research has also shown that the \n     quality of life greatly improves for elderly individuals who \n     use hearing aids.\n       On behalf of the 118,000 audiologists, speech-language \n     pathologists, and hearing, speech, and language scientists \n     qualified to meet the needs of the estimated 49 million (or 1 \n     in 6) children and adults in the United States with \n     communication disorders, we thank you for introducing this \n     important piece of legislation and look forward to working \n     with you and your staff.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dolores E. Battle,\n       President, American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                International Hearing Society,\n\n                                        Livonia, MI, May 16, 2005.\n     Hon. Norm Coleman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coleman: On behalf of the International \n     Hearing Society (IHS), I write to enthusiastically endorse \n     the Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act. IHS represents the \n     vast majority of traditional hearing aid dispensers (hearing \n     aid specialists) in the United States. Hearing aid \n     specialists are licensed in 49 states (and registered in \n     Colorado) specifically to provide hearing health services. \n     Our members test hearing; select, fit and dispense hearing \n     aids; and provide hearing rehabilitation and counseling \n     services. Hearing aid specialists dispense approximately one-\n     half of all hearing aids in this country.\n       IHS is deeply appreciative of your interest in improving \n     access to hearing health care. Only approximately 20% of \n     those who could benefit from amplification actually utilize \n     hearing aids. Allowing a credit against tax for the purchase \n     of hearing aids would likely promote access to this effective \n     but dramatically underutilized device.\n       We look forward to working together to promote the nation's \n     hearing health, a vital component of overall health and well-\n     being. Please contact me or our Washington Counsel Karen S. \n     Sealander of McDermott Will & Emery with questions or for \n     further information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Harlan S. Cato,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S5439]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                     May 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Norm Coleman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.,\n       Dear Senator Coleman: On behalf of the Hearing Industries \n     Association (HTA) and the individuals with hearing loss \n     served by our members, I want to thank you for introducing \n     the Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act, and offer HIA's \n     strong endorsement and support for this worthwhile \n     legislation.\n       The Hearing Industries Association (HIA) is dedicated to \n     providing information about, promoting the use of, and \n     enhancing access to amplification devices in the United \n     States. These devices include externally worn hearing aids, \n     implantable hearing aids (cochlear, middle ear and brain \n     stem) and an array of assistive listening devices (both \n     personal and public area communication systems used in \n     auditoriums, theaters, classrooms and public buildings). Our \n     members work with the medical community and hearing aid \n     professionals to treat hearing loss in children and adults, \n     and we have seen firsthand the dramatic benefit that hearing \n     aids can provide in terms of greater safety, increased \n     ability to communicate, and an overall significantly enhanced \n     quality of life.\n       For the 31.5 million Americans who have some degree of \n     hearing loss, the vast majority (95%) can be treated with \n     hearing aids. Yet only 20% of those with hearing loss use \n     hearing aids, while a full 30% cite financial constraints as \n     the reason they do not use hearing aids. This modest bill \n     would help countless older adults and children who need \n     hearing aids, but simply cannot afford them. The benefits, in \n     terms of reduced special education costs for children, as \n     well as reduced injuries and psychological and mental \n     disorders associated with hearing loss in older adults, are \n     immense.\n       Again, on behalf of HIA and the individuals with hearing \n     loss whom we serve, we applaud your leadership in introducing \n     the Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act, and look forward \n     to working with you to pass the bill in the 109th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Carole Rogin,\n     Hearing Industries Association.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Coleman: On behalf of Self Help for Hard of \n     Hearing People, the Nation's largest consumer group for \n     people with hearing loss, we would like to express our \n     support of the Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act.\n       More than 28 million Americans at all stages of life have \n     some form of hearing loss. If left untreated, hearing loss \n     can severely reduce the quality of one's personal and \n     professional life. A landmark study conducted by the National \n     Council on Aging (NCOA) concluded that hearing loss was \n     associated with, among other things: depression, impaired \n     memory, social isolation and reduced general health. For \n     infants and children left untreated, the cost to schools for \n     special education and other programs can exceed $420,000, \n     with additional lifetime costs of $1 million in lost wages \n     and other health complications, according to a respected 1995 \n     study published in the International Journal of Pediatric \n     Otorhinolaryngology.\n       While fully 95 percent of individuals with hearing loss \n     could be successfully treated with hearing aids, only 22 \n     percent currently use them, according to the largest national \n     consumer survey on hearing loss in America. Almost \\1/3\\ of \n     the individuals surveyed cite financial constraints as a core \n     reason they do not use hearing aids, which is not surprising \n     since hearing aids are not covered under Medicare, or under \n     the vast majority of state mandated benefits. In fact, over \n     71 percent of all hearing aid purchases involve no third \n     party payments, thereby placing the entire burden of the \n     purchase on the consumer.\n       The Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act offers a \n     practical, low cost, and common sense solution to help older \n     individuals who may not otherwise be able to afford to \n     purchase a hearing aid, or those purchasing a hearing aid for \n     their child. The bill is not intended to cover the full cost \n     of hearing aids, but would simply provide some measure of \n     financial assistance to the populations who are most in need \n     of these devices but may not be able to afford them: those \n     approaching or in retirement, and families with children.\n       This bipartisan initiative is endorsed by virtually the \n     entire spectrum of organizations and consumer groups within \n     the hearing health community. We view this legislation as an \n     effective and responsible means to encourage individuals to \n     treat their hearing loss in order to maintain or improve \n     quality of life.\n       We are pleased to offer you our support.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                                 Terry Portis,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Self Help for Hard of Hearing People.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Academy of Audiology,\n\n                                         Reston, VA, May 17, 2005.\n     Hon. Norm Coleman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coleman: The American Academy of Audiology, \n     the largest organization of audiologists representing over \n     9,700 audiologists, commends you on your leadership on \n     hearing health care issues and championing policies that \n     benefit individuals with hearing loss.\n       The Academy supports the Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit \n     Act which would provide a tax credit of up to $500 per \n     hearing aid, available once every five years, towards the \n     purchase of a hearing aid(s) for individuals age 55 and over, \n     or those purchasing a hearing aid for a dependent. As you \n     have pointed out with the introduction of this bill, special \n     tax treatment would improve access to hearing aids since only \n     22 percent of Americans who could benefit from hearing aids \n     currently use them. Approximately, 1 million children under \n     the age of 18 and nearly 10 million Americans over the age of \n     54 have a diagnosed hearing loss but are not currently using \n     a hearing aid.\n       Hearing aids are presently not covered under Medicare, or \n     under the vast majority of state mandated benefits. In fact, \n     71.4 percent of hearing aid purchases do not involve third \n     party payments, placing the entire burden of the hearing aid \n     purchase on the patient/consumer. This legislation is a \n     beginning step to helping some individuals with this expense \n     and raises the awareness of the impact that hearing loss has \n     on today's society.\n       In addition, the Academy endorses the Hearing Health \n     Accessibility Act (S. 277) to provide Medicare beneficiaries \n     with the option of going to an audiologist or a physician for \n     hearing and balance diagnostic tests. Direct access would \n     improve Medicare beneficiaries' access to hearing care \n     without diminishing the important role of medical doctors, or \n     expanding the scope of practice for audiology. The Academy \n     urges you to support this legislation as well.\n       The Academy appreciates the opportunity to work with you to \n     promote these important initiatives in the 109th Congress. \n     Again, we thank you for your leadership in introducing the \n     Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act and for your dedication \n     to the needs of individuals with hearing loss and the health \n     care professionals providing the services they need to fully \n     function in society.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Richard E.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve \nstroke prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the month of May is Stroke Awareness \nMonth, and it is a privilege to join Senators Cochran, Warner, \nCantwell, Collins, and Dayton in introducing the Stroke Treatment and \nOngoing Prevention Act of 2005. The STOP Stroke Act is a vital step in \nbuilding a national network of effective care to diagnose and quickly \ntreat victims of stroke and improve the quality of care for stroke \npatients across America.\n  For over 20 years, stroke has been the third leading cause of death \nin our country, affecting about 700,000 Americans a year and killing \napproximately 163,000 a year. Every 45 seconds, another American \nsuffers a stroke. Every 3 minutes, another American dies. Few families \ntoday are untouched by this cruel, debilitating, and often fatal \ndisease that strikes indiscriminately, and robs us of our loved ones. \nEven for those who survive, a stroke can have devastating consequences. \nOver half of all survivors are left with a disability.\n  Prompt treatment with clot-dissolving drugs within three hours of a \nstroke can dramatically improve these outcomes. Yet, only 2-3 percent \nof all stroke patients are treated with such a drug within those \ncrucial first three hours. Few Americans recognize the symptoms of \nstroke, and crucial hours are often lost before a patient receives \ntreatment. Emergency room staffs are often not trained to recognize and \nmanage the symptoms, which further adds to the delay in treatment. \nPatients at hospitals with primary stroke centers have nearly five \ntimes greater chance of receiving clot-dissolving drugs.\n  Modern medicine is generating new scientific advances that increase \nthe chance of survival and at least partial or even full recovery \nfollowing a stroke. Physicians are learning to manage strokes more \neffectively, and they are also learning how to prevent them in the \nfirst place.\n  But science doesn't save lives and protect health by itself. We need \nto do more to bring new discoveries to the patient and new awareness to \nthe public. That means educating as many people as possible about the \nwarning signs of stroke, so that they know enough to seek medical \nattention. It means training doctors and nurses in the best techniques \nof care. It means finding better ways to treat victims as quickly and \nas effectively as possible--so that they have the best chance of full \nrecovery.\n  Our bill provides grants to States to implement statewide systems of \nstroke care that will give health professionals the equipment and \ntraining they need to treat this disorder. It also establishes a \ncontinuing education program to make sure that medical professionals \nare well trained and well aware of the newest treatments and prevention \nstrategies. The initial point of contact between a stroke patient and \nmedical care is usually an emergency medical technician. Grants under \nthis bill may be used to train these personnel to provide more \neffective care to stroke patients in the crucial first few moments \nafter an attack.\n\n  The bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nconduct a national media campaign to inform the public about the \nsymptoms of stroke, so that more patients can recognize the symptoms \nand receive prompt medical care. The bill also authorizes the Secretary \nof HHS, acting through CDC, to operate the Paul Coverdell National \nAcute Stroke Registry, which will collect data about the care of stroke \npatients and assist in the development of more effective treatments.\n  The bill also provides new resources for states to improve the \nstandard of care for stroke patients in hospitals, and to increase the \nquality of care in rural hospitals through improvements in \ntelemedicine.\n  On Monday, the Wall Street Journal published an excellent article on \nthe inadequate treatment that stroke patients often encounter when \nambulances bring them to hospitals with staffs not trained in the early \ntreatment of stroke or lacking the needed equipment to intervene early. \nOver twenty years ago, the survival of trauma victims was very much \ndependent on whether the ambulance took them to a hospital with a \ntrauma care center, or to a hospital not equipped to treat traumatic \ninjury. Congress passed the Trauma Care Systems Planning and \nDevelopment Act of 1990 that revolutionized the treatment for accident \nvictims. Now in 2005, it is long past time to see that state of the art \ncare is made available to stroke patients as quickly as possible.\n  Stroke is a national tragedy that leaves no American community \nunscarred. Fortunately, if the right steps are taken during the brief \nwindow of time available, effective treatment can make all the \ndifference between healthy survival and disability or death. We need to \ndo all we can to see that those precious few hours are not wasted. The \nSTOP Stroke Act is a significant step in reaching that goal. May is \nStroke Awareness Month, and I urge Congress to act quickly on this \nlegislation, and give stroke victims a far better chance for full \nrecovery.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of a Wall Street Journal \narticle of May 9 on this issue be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 9, 2005]\n\n            Stroke Victims Are Often Taken to Wrong Hospital\n\n                         (By Thomas M. Burton)\n\n       Christina Mei suffered a stroke just before noon on Sept. \n     2, 2001. Within eight minutes, an ambulance arrived. Her \n     medical fate may have been sealed by where the ambulance took \n     her.\n       Ms. Mei's stroke, caused by a clot blocking blood flow to \n     her brain, occurred while she was driving with her family \n     south of San Francisco. Her car swerved, but she was able to \n     pull over before slumping at the wheel. Paramedics saw the \n     classic signs of a stroke: The 45-year-old driver couldn't \n     speak or move the right side of her body.\n       Had Ms. Mei's stroke occurred a few miles to the south, she \n     probably would have been taken to Stanford University Medical \n     Center, one of the world's top stroke hospitals. There, a \n     neurologist almost certainly would have seen her quickly and \n     administered an intravenous drug to dissolve the clot. \n     Stanford was 17 miles away, across a county line.\n       But paramedics, following county ambulance rules that \n     stress proximity, took her 13 miles north, to Kaiser \n     Permanente's South San Francisco Medical Center. There, \n     despite her sudden inability to talk or walk and her facial \n     droop, an emergency-room doctor concluded she was suffering \n     from depression and stress. It was six hours before a \n     neurologist saw her, and she never got the intravenous clot-\n     dissolving drug.\n       In a legal action brought against Kaiser on Ms. Mei's \n     behalf, an arbitrator found that her care had been negligent, \n     and in some aspects ``incomprehensible.'' Today, Ms. Mei \n     can't dress herself and walks unsteadily, says her lawyer, \n     Richard C. Bennett. The fingers on her right hand are curled \n     closed, and she has had to give up her main avocations: \n     calligraphy, ceramics and other types of art. Kaiser declined \n     to comment beyond saying that it settled the case under \n     confidential terms ``based on some concerns raised in the \n     litigation.''\n       Stroke is the nation's No. 1 cause of disability and No. 3 \n     cause of death, killing 164,000 people a year. But far too \n     many stroke victims, like Ms. Mel, get inadequate care thanks \n     to deficient medical training and outdated ambulance rules \n     that don't send patients to the best stroke hospitals.\n       Over the past decade, American medicine has learned how to \n     save stroke patients' lives and keep them out of nursing \n     homes. New techniques offer a better chance of complete \n     recovery by dissolving blood clots and treating even more \n     lethal strokes caused by burst blood vessels in the brain. \n     But few patients receive this kind of treatment because most \n     hospitals lack specialized staff and knowledge, stroke \n     experts say. State and county rules generally require \n     paramedics to take stroke patients to the nearest emergency \n     room, regardless of that hospital's level of expertise with \n     stroke.\n       Stroke care is positioned roughly where trauma care was a \n     quarter-century ago. By 1975, surgeons expert at treating \n     victims of car crashes and other major accidents realized \n     that taking severely injured patients to the nearest \n     emergency room could mean death. So the surgeons led a push \n     to make selected regional hospitals into specialized trauma \n     centers and to overhaul ambulance protocols so that \n     paramedics would speed the most severely injured to those \n     centers. Now, in many areas of the U.S., accident victims go \n     quickly to a trauma center, and trauma specialists say this \n     change has saved lives and lessened disability.\n       Eighty percent or more of the 700,000 stokes that Americans \n     suffer annually are ``ischemic,'' meaning they are caused by \n     blockage of an artery feeding the brain, usually a blood \n     clot. Most of the rest are ``hemorrhagic'' strokes, resulting \n     from burst blood vessels in or near the brain. Although they \n     have different causes, both result in brain tissue dying \n     by the minute.\n       Several factors have combined to prevent improvement in \n     stroke care. In some areas, hospitals have resisted movement \n     toward a system of specialized stroke centers because \n     nondesignated institutions could lose business, according to \n     neurologists who favor the\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\n     changes. In addition, stroke treatment has lacked an \n     organized lobby to galvanize popular and political interest \n     in the ailment.\n\n\n                            doctor ignorance\n\n       A big reason for the backwardness of much stroke treatment \n     is that many doctors know little about it. Even emergency \n     physicians and internists likely to see stroke victims tend \n     to receive scant neurology training in their internships and \n     residencies according to stroke specialists.\n       ``Surprisingly, you could go through your entire internal \n     medicine rotation without training in neurology, and in \n     emergency medicine it hasn't been emphasized,'' says James C. \n     Grotta, director of the stroke program at the University of \n     Texas Health Science Center at Houston.\n       Many hospitals don't have a neurologist ready to deal with \n     emergencies. As a result, strokes aren't treated urgently \n     there, even though short delays increase chance of severe \n     disability or death. Even if doctors do react quickly, recent \n     research has shown that many aren't sure what treatment to \n     provide.\n       For example, a survey published in 2000 in the journal \n     Stroke showed that 66 percent of hospitals in North Carolina \n     lacked any protocol for treating stroke. About 82 percent \n     couldn't rapidly identify patients with acute stroke.\n       As with other life-threatening conditions, stroke patients \n     are better off going where doctors have had a lot of practice \n     addressing their ailment. A seven-year analysis of surgery in \n     New York state in the 1990s showed that patients with \n     ruptured blood vessels in the brain were more than twice as \n     likely to die--16% versus 7%--in hospitals doing few such \n     operations, compared with those doing them regularly. A \n     national study published last year in the Journal of \n     Neurosurgery showed a similar disparity.\n       Another major shortcoming of most stroke treatment, \n     according to many neurologists, is the failure to use the \n     genetically engineered clot-dissolving drug known as tPA. \n     Short for tissue plasminogen activator, tPA, which is made by \n     Genentech Inc., has been shown to be a powerful treatment \n     that can lessen disability for many patients. A study \n     published in 2004 in The Lancet, a prominent medical journal, \n     showed that the chances of returning to normal are about \n     three times greater among patients getting tPA in the first \n     90 minutes after suffering a stroke, even after accounting \n     for tPA's potential side effect of cerebral bleeding that can \n     cause death. But several recent medical-journal articles have \n     found that nationally, only 2% to 3% of strokes caused by \n     clots are treated with tPA, which has no competitor on the \n     market.\n       Some authors of studies supporting the use of tPA have had \n     consultant or other financial relationships with Genentech. \n     Skeptics of the drug point to these ties and stress tPA's \n     side-effect danger. But among stroke neurologists, there is a \n     strong consensus that the drug is effective.\n       One reason why many patients don't receive tPA is that they \n     arrive at the hospital more than three hours after a stroke, \n     the time period during which intravenous tPA should be given. \n     But many hospitals and doctors don't use tPA at all, even \n     though it has been available in the U.S. since 1996. The \n     dissolving agent's relatively high cost--$2,000 or more per \n     patient--is a barrier. Medicare pays hospital a flat \n     reimbursement of about $6,700 for stroke treatment, \n     regardless of whether tPA is used.\n\n\n                           airport emergency\n\n       Glender Shelton of Houston had an ischemic stroke caused by \n     a clot at Los Angeles International Airport on Dec. 30, 2003. \n     In full view of other holiday travelers, Ms. Shelton, then \n     66, slumped over, and an ambulance was called. It was 4:45 \n     p.m.\n       By 5:55 p.m., she arrived at what now is called Centinela \n     Freeman Regional Medical Center, four miles away in Marina \n     del Rey. Hospital records show that doctors thought Ms. \n     Shelton had suffered an ``acute stroke.'' But she didn't get \n     a CT scan, a recommended initial step, until 9 p.m. By then, \n     she was already outside the three-hour window for safely \n     administering intravenous tPA. Records also say she didn't \n     receive the drug ``due to unavailability of neurologist until \n     after the patient had been outside the three-hour time \n     window.''\n       Ms. Shelton's daughter, Sandi Shaw, was until recently \n     nurse-manager of the prestigious stroke unit at the \n     University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Ms. \n     Shaw says that at her unit, her mother would have had a CT \n     scan within five minutes of arriving, and tPA probably would \n     have been administered 30 or 35 minutes after that.\n       Today, according to her daughter, Ms. Shelton often can't \n     come up with words or relatives' names, can't take care of \n     her finances, and can't follow certain basic commands in \n     neurological tests.\n       Kent Shoji, an emergency-room doctor at Centinela Freeman \n     who handled Ms. Shelton's case, says, ``She was a possible \n     candidate for tPA,'' but a CT scan was required first. ``The \n     order was put in for a CT scan,'' Dr. Shoji says, ``I can't \n     answer why it took so long.''\n       A Centinela Freeman spokeswoman says, ``We did not have 24/\n     7 coverage with our CT scan, and we had to call, a technician \n     to come in. That's pretty common with a community hospital.'' \n     The hospital has since been acquired by a larger health \n     system and now does have 24-hour CT capability.\n\n\n                         `Parochial Interests'\n\n       A hospital-accrediting group has begun designating \n     hospitals as stroke centers, but that is only part of what is \n     needed, stroke experts assert. They say hospitals typically \n     have to come together to create local political momentum to \n     change state or county rules to that ambulances actually take \n     stroke patients to stroke centers, not the nearest ER. New \n     York, Maryland and Massachusetts are moving toward creating \n     stroke-care systems, and Florida recently passed a law \n     creating stroke centers. But in many places, short-term \n     economic interests impede change, some doctors say.\n       ``There are still very parochial interests by hospitals and \n     physicians to keep patients locally even if they're not \n     equipped to handle them,'' says neurosurgeon Robert A. \n     Solomon of New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia. \n     ``Hospitals don't want to give up patients.''\n       The University of California at San Diego runs one of the \n     leading stroke hospitals in the country. It and others in the \n     area that are well prepared to treat stroke patients have \n     sought for a decade to set up a regional system, but there \n     has been little progress, says Patrick D. Lyden, UCSD's chief \n     of neurology, ``Some hospitals are resisting losing stroke \n     business,'' he says. ``We have the same political crap as in \n     most communities. Paramedics still take people to the local \n     ER.''\n       Among the opponents of the stroke-center concept during the \n     1990s was Richard Stennes, the ER director at Paradise Valley \n     Hospital south of San Diego. In various public debates, Dr. \n     Stennes recalls, he argued that many apparent stroke patients \n     would be siphoned away from community hospitals even if they \n     didn't turn out to have strokes. Also, he argued that tPA \n     might cause more injury than it prevents. And then there was \n     the economic issue: ``Those hospitals without all the \n     equipment and stroke experts,'' he says, ``would be concerned \n     about all the patients going to a stroke center and taking \n     the patients away from us.'' Dr. Stennes has since retired.\n       ``All hospitals and clinicians try to deliver the right \n     care to patients, especially those with urgent medical \n     needs,'' says Nancy E. Foster, vice president for quality of \n     the American Hospital Association, which represents both \n     large and small hospitals. ``Community hospitals may be \n     equally good at delivering stroke care, and it would be \n     important for patients to know how well prepared their local \n     hospital is.''\n       Stroke experts aren't proposing that every hospital needs \n     to specialize in stroke care but instead that in every \n     population center there should be at least one that does. In \n     Atlanta, Emory University's neuro-intensive care unit \n     illustrates the special skills that make for top care. Owen \n     B. Samuels, director of the unit, estimates that 20% to 30% \n     of patients it treats received poor initial medical care \n     before arriving at Emory, jeopardizing their futures or even \n     lives. Brain hemorrhages, for example, are commonly \n     misdiagnosed, even in patients who repeatedly showed up at \n     emergency rooms with unusually severe headaches, Dr. Samuels \n     says.\n       The Emory unit has 30 staff members, including two neuro-\n     critical care doctors and five nurse practitioners. A team is \n     on duty 24 hours a day. The unit handles about two dozen \n     patients most days, keeping the staff busy. On the ward, \n     nearly all patients are unconscious or sedated, so it's \n     eerily silent. Patients generally need to rest their brains \n     as they recover from stroke or surgery.\n       After a hemorrhagic stroke, blood pressure in the cranium \n     builds as blood continues to seep out of the ruptured vessel. \n     Pressure can be deadly, cutting off oxygen to the brain. Or \n     escaped blood can cause a ``vasospasm,'' days after the \n     original stroke, in which the brain reacts violently to \n     seeped-out blood. In the worst case, the brain herniates, or \n     squeezes out the base of the skull, causing death. To avoid \n     this, nurses at Emory constantly monitor brain pressure and \n     temperatures. They put in drain lines. They infuse medicines \n     to dehydrate, depressurize and stop bleeding.\n       Since Emory launched the neuro-intensive unit seven years \n     ago, 42% of patients with hemorrhagic strokes have become \n     well enough to go home, compared with 27% before. Fewer need \n     rehabilitation--31% versus 40%--and the death rate is down.\n       Damica Townsend-Head, 33, gave the Emory team a scare. \n     After surgery last fall for a hemorrhagic stroke, her brain \n     swelling was ``really out of control,'' Dr. Samuels says, \n     raising questions about whether she would survive. The staff \n     put a ``cooling catheter'' into a blood vessel, which allowed \n     the circulation of ice water to bring down the temperature in \n     her blood and brain. They intentionally dehydrated her brain \n     to lower pressure. A month later, she woke up and recovered \n     with minimal disability. She still walks with a cane and \n     tires easily, but her speech is normal and she hopes to \n     return soon to work. ``I consider her what we're in \n     business for,'' Dr. Samuels says.\n\n\n                            public awareness\n\n       The public's low awareness of stroke symptoms--and the need \n     to respond immediately--can also hinder proper care. Ischemic \n     strokes, those caused by clots or other artery blockage, \n     cause symptoms such as muscle weakness or paralysis on one \n     side, slurred speech, facial droop, severe dizziness, \n     unstable gait and vision loss. People with this kind of \n     stroke are sometimes mistaken for being drunk. In addition to \n     intense head\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\n     pain, a hemorrhagic stroke often leads to nausea, vomiting or \n     loss of balance or consciousness. Still, many people with \n     some of these symptoms merely go to bed in hopes of improving \n     overnight, doctors say. Instead, they should go immediately \n     to a hospital and demand a CT scan as a first diagnostic \n     step.\n       The well-funded American Heart Association, established in \n     1924, has made many people aware of heart attack symptoms and \n     thereby saved many lives. In contrast, the American Stroke \n     Association was started only in 1998 as a subsidiary of the \n     heart association. The stroke association spent $162 million \n     last year out of the heart association's $561 million overall \n     budget.\n       Justin Zivin, another University of California at San Diego \n     stroke expert, says the stroke association ``is a terribly \n     ineffective bunch. When it comes to actual public education, \n     I haven't seen anything.''\n       The stroke association counters that it is buying \n     television and radio ads promoting awareness, similar to ones \n     produced in 2003 and 2004. The group also sponsors research \n     and education, including an annual international stroke-\n     medicine conference.\n       It's not just the general public that fails to recognize \n     stroke symptoms. Often, emergency-room doctors and nurses \n     don't either. Gretchen Thiele of suburban Detroit began \n     having horrible headaches last May, for the first time in her \n     life. ``She wasn't one to complain, but she said, `I can't \n     even lift my head off the pillow.' '' recalls her daughter, \n     Erika Mazero. Ms. Thiele, 57, nearly passed out from the pain \n     one night and suffered blurred vision. When the pain recurred \n     in the morning, she went to the emergency room at nearby St. \n     Joseph's Mercy of Macomb Hospital. Ms. Mazero says that \n     during the six hours her mother spent there, she was given a \n     CT scan, but not a spinal tap, which could definitively have \n     shown she had a leaking brain aneurysm, meaning a ballooned \n     and weakened artery in her brain. After the CT, Ms. Thiele \n     was given a muscle relaxant and pain medicine and sent home, \n     her daughter says.\n       Two months later, the blood vessel burst. Neurosurgeons at \n     William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., did emergency \n     surgery, but Ms. Thiele suffered massive bleeding and died. \n     Ali Bydon, one of the neurosurgeons at Beaumont, says a CT \n     scan often is inadequate and that her condition could have \n     been detected earlier with a spinal tap, also called a lumbar \n     puncture. ``Had she had a lumbar puncture and perhaps an \n     operation earlier, it might have saved her life,'' says Dr. \n     Bydon. ``In general, a person who tells you, `I usually don't \n     get headaches, and this is the worst headache of my life,' is \n     something that should alarm you.''\n       In addition, he says Ms. Thiele ``absolutely'' was \n     experiencing smaller-scale bleeding in May that foreshadowed \n     a more serious rupture. If doctors identify this kind of \n     bleeding early, he says, chances of death are ``minimal.'' \n     But when a rupture occurs, he says, ``25% of patients \n     never make it to the hospital, 25% die in the hospital and \n     25% are severely disabled.''\n       A St. Joseph's hospital spokeswoman says the hospital has \n     ``very aggressive standards for treatment, and we met this \n     standard.'' declining to elaborate.\n\n\n                            determined nurse\n\n       Paramedics did the right thing after Chuck Toeniskoetter's \n     stroke, but only because of some extraordinary intervention. \n     Mr. Toeniskoetter, then 55, was on a ski trip, Dec. 23, 2000, \n     at Bear Valley, near Los Angeles. He had just finished a run \n     at 3:30 p.m. when, in the snowmobile shop, he began slurring \n     his words and nearly fell over. Kathy Snyder, the nurse in \n     the ski area's first-aid room quickly diagnosed stroke. She \n     called a helicopter and an ambulance.\n       Ms. Snyder says she knew the closest hospital with a stroke \n     team was Sutter Roseville Medical Center in Roseville, CA. \n     The helicopter pilot was planning to take Mr. Toeniskoetter \n     to a closer ER, but Ms. Snyder says she stood on the \n     helicopter runners, demanding the patient go to Sutter. The \n     pilot eventually relented. Mr. Toeniskoetter went to Sutter, \n     where he promptly received tPA. Today, he has no disability \n     and is back running a real estate-development business in the \n     San Jose area. ``Trauma patients go to trauma centers, not \n     the nearest hospital,'' he says. ``Stroke victims, too, \n     require a real specialized sort of care.''\n       One-third of all strokes are suffered by people under 60, \n     and hemorrhagic strokes in particular often strike young \n     adults and children. Vance Bowers of Orlando, Fla., was 9 \n     when he woke up screaming that his eyes hurt, shortly after 1 \n     a.m. on Jan. 8, 2001. Malformed blood vessels in his brain \n     were bleeding. He was in a coma by the time an ambulance \n     delivered him at 1:57 a.m. to the nearest emergency room, at \n     Florida Hospital East Orlando.\n       Emergency-room doctors soon realized Vance had a \n     hemorrhagic stroke. But neurosurgery isn't performed at that \n     hospital. A sister hospital 14 minutes away by ambulance, \n     Florida Hospital Orlando, did have neurosurgical capability. \n     But in part because of administrative tangles, Vance didn't \n     get to the second hospital until 4:37 a.m., more than two \n     hours after his arrival. Surgery began at 6:18 a.m. ``This \n     delay may have cost this young man the possibility of a \n     functional survival,'' Paul D. Sawin, the neurosurgeon who \n     operated on Vance, said in a letter to the hospitals' joint \n     administration.\n       Florida Hospital, an emergency-medicine group and an ER \n     doctor recently agreed to settle a lawsuit filed against them \n     in Orange County, Fla., Circuit Court by the Bowers family. \n     The defendants agreed to pay a total of $800,000, court \n     records show. Monica Reed, senior medical officer of the \n     hospital, says the care Vance received was ``stellar'' and \n     that any delays weren't medically significant. Vance's \n     stroke, not the care he received, caused his injuries, she \n     said.\n       Vance, now 13, survived but is mentally handicapped and \n     suffers daily seizures, his mother, Brenda Bowers, says. Once \n     a star baseball player, he goes by wheelchair to a class for \n     disabled children. He speaks very slowly but not in a way \n     that many people can understand. ``He remembers playing \n     baseball with all of his friends,'' his mother says but they \n     rarely come around any more. ``He really misses all that.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1065. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to extend \nchild care eligibility for children of members of the Armed Forces who \ndie in the line of duty; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I rise with my distinguished \ncolleague from New York, Senator Clinton, to introduce legislation that \nwill provide a surviving spouse with two years of child care \neligibility on any military instillation or Federal facility with a \nchild care center. The legislation was inspired by our work on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. In February the committee held an \nimportant hearing on improving survivor benefits and the government's \nrole in helping survivors cope with the loss of a loved one. All too \noften surviving spouses are forced to make difficult, life changing \ndecisions alone. Both Senator Clinton and I are determined to provide \nas much help as possible to those who must bear the burden of loss, \nparticularly those with young children. By providing two years of child \ncare eligibility, our goal is to ensure that a surviving spouse has the \ntime and tools necessary to make a healthy adjustment to life after the \nservicemember's death. Many decisions face survivors, most importantly, \nhow to make a living. Often that means having to re-enter the work \nforce after years of being a working mother. The question of how to \nadequately care for young children while trying to find employment or \nrestart a career should not be an issue. Further, we have expanded this \neligibility to include access to child care centers in other Federal \nfacilities. This will aide surviving spouses with children if they are \nin the process of relocating to an area of the country without a \nmilitary base nearby, but in the proximity of a local Federal building. \nI am honored that Senator Clinton is working with me on this \nlegislation and I encourage my colleagues to support this important \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Alexander, Mr. DeWine, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. \n        Frist):\n  S. 1066. A bill to authorize the States (and subdivisions thereof), \nthe District of Columbia, territories, and possessions of the United \nStates to provide certain tax incentives to any person for economic \ndevelopment purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Economic \nDevelopment Act of 2005 to authorize States to provide tax incentives \nfor economic development purposes.\n  This legislation is crucial to preserve tax incentives as an \nimportant tool for State and local governments to promote economic \ndevelopment in the wake of last year's decision by the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals in Cuno v. DaimlerChrysler.\n  In its decision in Cuno, the Sixth Circuit struck down Ohio's \nmanufacturing machinery and equipment tax credit, which I helped enact \nwhile I was Governor of Ohio, on grounds that it violated the \n``dormant'' Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The court ruled \nthat the tax incentive violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution because it granted preferential tax treatment to companies \nthat invest within the State rather than in other States.\n  The Cuno decision has had severe repercussions across the country. \nThe decision immediately cast doubt on the constitutionality of tax \nincentives presently offered by all fifty States. As\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\na result, States and businesses have been reluctant to go forward with \nnew projects that depend on the availability of tax incentives out of \nconcern that the Cuno decision may be used to invalidate those \nincentives. This legal uncertainty has worsened an already challenging \neconomic environment. Furthermore, the decision threatens to undermine \nfederalism by dramatically restricting the ability of States to craft \ntheir tax codes to promote economic development in the manner they \ndetermine is best. If left standing, this decision will handcuff the \nStates in the Sixth Circuit, as well as States in other circuits where \nthe court chooses to follow Cuno, in their efforts to promote economic \ngrowth and create jobs. Additionally, it will cripple their ability to \ncompete internationally. In today's competitive economic environment, \nwe can not afford to unilaterally discard the use of tax incentive to \nattract business to this country. As a former Governor who had to \ncompete against Japan, Canada, China and Europe for new business \nprojects, I know just how important a role tax incentives can play in \nattracting new businesses. I can assure you that our competitors are \ncertainly not going to stop using tax incentives. Neither should we.\n  Fortunately, the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to \ndetermine which State actions violate the Commerce Clause. The purpose \nof the Economic Development Act of 2005 is therefore to have Congress \noverride the decision in Cuno by authorizing States to provide tax \nincentives for economic development purposes. The legislation would \nremove the legal uncertainty surrounding tax incentives created by the \nCuno decision and preserve the States' power to design their tax codes \nto promote economic development.\n  The history of the tax incentive struck down in Cuno demonstrates the \nimportant role tax incentives can play in promoting economic \ndevelopment. When I was Governor of Ohio, at my request and as part of \nmy jobs incentive package, the Ohio Legislature enacted the \nmanufacturing machinery and equipment tax incentive to encourage \nbusinesses to expand their operations in Ohio and to help draw new \nbusinesses to Ohio. It worked. Between 1993 and 1997, Ohio was ranked \nnumber one in the Nation by Site Selection and Industrial Development \nmagazine three times for highest number of new facilities, expanded \nfacilities, and new manufacturing plants. Since the program's \ninception, businesses have been eligible to claim a total of $2 billion \nin credits toward $34 billion in new equipment investments.\n  Currently, this incentive is part of an incentive package being \noffered to automobile manufacturer DaimlerChrysler in support of its \nplans for a $200 million expansion of their Jeep plant. The ruling by \nthe Sixth Circuit in Cuno, however, puts that expansion in jeopardy and \nthreatens to undermine Ohio's competitiveness in attracting new \nbusinesses.\n  In the Cuno decision, the Sixth Circuit ruled that the manufacturing \nmachinery and equipment tax incentive, given by Ohio to DaimlerChrysler \nas part of its incentive package, violated the Commerce Clause of the \nU.S. Constitution because it discriminated against interstate \ncommerce by granting preferential tax treatment to companies that \nexpanded within the State rather than in other States.\n\n  The Cuno decision is troubling for several reasons. First, I believe \nthe Sixth Circuit failed to appreciate the need for States to condition \nthe availability of certain tax incentives on the undertaking of the \nspecified economic activity within a State. In the case of the \nmanufacturing machinery and equipment tax incentive, Ohio needed to \nlimit the availability of the tax incentive to the investments \nundertaken in the State. Otherwise, Ohio would have been giving \ncompanies a tax incentive for activity that did not benefit the State. \nIn other words, Ohio would have been effectively subsidizing investment \nin other States. We all know that in economics there is no free lunch \nand States should not be forced to provide a free lunch when they \nchoose to give tax incentives. If Ohio or any other State is willing to \nforego tax revenue, it should be allowed to receive something in \nreturn, namely investment or other economic activity in the State. \nAccordingly, Ohio's tax incentive did not discriminate against \ninterstate commerce. It merely required companies, if they chose to \ntake advantage of the incentive, to undertake the investment in Ohio, \nthe same State that would be foregoing tax revenue to provide the \nincentive.\n  There is also a little legal fiction present in the Cuno decision. \nThe court states that Ohio could have provided a direct subsidy to \ncompanies that undertook investment in the State. Because Ohio decided \nto structure the program as a tax credit, however, the court said that \nit ran afoul of the Commerce Clause. I do not see how a direct subsidy \ndoes not violate the dormant Commerce Clause, but a tax credit does. \nThey are economically the same.\n  If left standing, the Cuno decision will have a particularly \ndetrimental effect on the U.S. manufacturing sector. From rising energy \nand health care costs to frivolous lawsuits and unfair international \ntrade practices, the U.S. manufacturing sector and the hard working men \nand women who drive it are getting squeezed from all sides. Despite all \nthey are up against, it's a testament to their ability and \ndetermination that they are still the most productive manufacturers in \nthe world. This Sixth Circuit decision, however, is a new roadblock \nthat threatens to take away one of the most effective and efficient \nmeans for assisting manufacturers who want to create new jobs here in \nAmerica. The Economic Development Act of 2005 will make sure that \nmanufacturers don't lose key tax incentives just when such incentives \nare needed the most.\n  The Cuno decision also sets a bad precedent that, if not checked, \ncould upset our carefully balanced federal system. One of the most \ningenious aspects of the U.S. Constitution is that it leaves a great \ndeal of power with the States. It gives the States flexibility to \ndevise their own solutions and, in the process, fosters innovation in \ngovernment. Thus, the States are the laboratories of our democracy and \nan innovation they have developed to help create jobs and prosperity \nare programs that encourage new growth through tax incentives for \ntraining, job creation, and investment in new plants and equipment. The \navailability of tax incentives was critical to our success in Ohio and \nin being number one in new plant construction and expansion. Because \nOhio had the ability to devise tax incentives that fit its economic \ndevelopment needs, we were able to create thousands of new jobs. My \nlegislation will guarantee that the States remain our engines of \ninnovation.\n  This legislation is something that Congress should have done a long \ntime ago. The courts are not well-suited to making the often complex \npolicy decisions regarding whether a tax incentive truly discriminates \nagainst interstate commerce and hinders the creation of a national \nmarket, or whether a tax incentive actually fosters innovation and job \ngrowth. Such decisions necessarily involve a careful weighing of \ncompeting and often mutually exclusive interests, and therefore should \nbe made by Congress. Moreover, judicial decisions often fail to provide \nbright lines on which incentives run afoul of the dormant Commerce \nClause, injecting uncertainty about the validity of certain tax \nincentives that makes businesses weary of relying on them and reduce \ntheir effectiveness. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has called its \ndormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence a ``quagmire.'' Hence, it is time \nthat Congress provide some clear rules on the treatment of tax \nincentives under the Commerce Clause.\n  As Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter stated nearly a half-\ncentury ago:\n\n       At best, this Court can only act negatively; it can \n     determine whether a specific state tax is imposed in \n     violation of the Commerce Clause. Such decisions must \n     necessarily depend on the application of rough and ready \n     legal concepts. We cannot make a detailed inquiry into the \n     incidence of diverse economic burdens in order to \n     determine the extent to which such burdens conflict with \n     the necessities of national economic life. Neither can we \n     devise appropriate standards for dividing up national \n     revenue on the basis of more or less abstract principles \n     of constitutional law, which cannot be responsive to the \n     subtleties of the interrelated economies of Nation and \n     State.\n       The problem calls for solution by devising a congressional \n     policy. Congress alone can provide for a full and thorough \n     canvassing of the multitudinous and intricate factors which \n     compose the problem of the taxing\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\n     freedom of the States and the needed limits on such state \n     taxing power. Congressional committees can make studies and \n     give the claims of the individual States adequate hearing \n     before the ultimate legislative formulation of policy is made \n     by the representatives of all the States. . . . Congress \n     alone can formulate policies founded upon economic realities. \n     . . .\n\n  The Economic Development Act of 2005 is a good first step toward \nproviding the prudent and carefully considered legislation that Justice \nFrankfurter urged the Congress to pass nearly a half century ago.\n  At its core, the Economic Development Act of 2005 recognizes that \ndecisions should be made, if possible, at the State and local level. \nStates make and should make decisions about the programs and services \nthey want to provide with their tax dollars, not the least of which are \neconomic development programs. Highway funding, education funding, \nwelfare funding, and funding for seniors programs all vary from state \nto state because State legislatures, acting on behalf of their \ncitizens, make choices and set priorities. This has allowed government \npolicy to reflect the diversity of interests in our great republic and \nresults in better and more responsive government. Accordingly, states \nshould be allowed to prioritize economic development in an effort to \ncreate jobs and prosperity for their citizens, and, yes, attract \nbusiness from outside their State. If States choose to use tax \nincentives to promote economic development, then that is not a \nviolation of the interstate commerce clause, that's simply their \nchoice. It is called federalism, and it should not be thwarted by the \ncourts.\n  There are a couple of points about this legislation that I would like \nto discuss. First, this legislation is carefully crafted to protect the \nmost common and benign forms of tax incentives, but not to authorize \nthose tax incentives that truly discriminate against interstate \ncommerce. I believe this bill strikes the right balance between \nprotecting States' tax rights and preserving long-established \nprotections against truly discriminatory State tax practices. Second, \nthis legislation does not invalidate any tax incentives. It only \nauthorizes tax incentives. Any tax incentive not covered by the \nlegislation's authorization is simply subject to the traditional \ndormant Commerce Clause review by the courts. Third, this legislation \ndoes not require any state to provide tax incentives. Although I had \nsuccess using tax incentives to foster economic growth in Ohio while I \nwas Governor, I recognize that some states have concerns about whether \nand how to offer tax incentives and therefore believe it should be left \nto the states to resolve these concerns.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is being co-sponsored by all of \nthe Senators representing States in the Sixth Circuit. We all realize \nthat the right of states to make their own decisions about the programs \nand services they offer within their boundaries is their own and should \nnot be taken away. Moreover, if the Supreme Court fails to review the \nCuno decision, then our States, the States in the Sixth Circuit, will \nbe at a competitive disadvantage in attracting businesses against other \nstates which are not affected by the Cuno decision and can offer tax \nincentives.\n  The bill has also been endorsed by Governor Bob Taft of Ohio, the \nNational Governors Association, the National League of Cities, the \nNational Association of Counties, the National Conference of Mayors and \nthe Federation of Tax Administrators, as well as by broad-based \nbusiness coalitions and the Teamsters.\n  I am hopeful that the seriousness of this issue, and the severity of \nthe ruling's possible ramifications, will allow us to see quick and \npositive consideration of my bill. The States are in a crisis mode \nbecause of this ruling. In Ohio, as I'm sure is the case across the \ncountry, many important projects have been put on hold as we await the \ncourt's further action.\n  The challenges that manufacturers and workers face today are daunting \nbut surmountable. The last thing we need, however, is an artificial \nlegal hurdle that threatens to trip us up. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Economic Development Act of 2005 so that we can preserve \nthe ability of the States to foster economic development and help put \nour economy, and especially our manufacturing industries, back on the \nroad to recovery and prosperity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1066\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the health of Americans and reduce health \ncare costs by reorienting the Nation's health care system toward \nprevention, wellness, and self care; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for more than a decade, I have spoken out \nabout the need to fundamentally reorient our approach to health care in \nAmerica--to reorient it towards prevention, wellness and self care.\n  I don't think you'll find too many people who would argue with the \nstatement that if you get sick, the best place in the world to get the \ncare you need is here in America. We have the best trained, highest-\nskilled health professionals in the world. We have cutting-edge, state-\nof-the-art equipment and technology. We have world-class health care \nfacilities and research institutions.\n  But, when it comes to helping people stay healthy and stay out of the \nhospital, we fall woefully short. In the U.S., we spend in excess of \n$1.8 trillion a year on health care. Fully 75 percent of that total is \naccounted for by chronic diseases--things like heart disease, cancer, \nand diabetes. And what these diseases have in common is that--in so \nmany cases--they are preventable.\n  In the United States, we fail to make an up-front investment in \nprevention. So we end up spending hundreds of billions on \nhospitalization, treatment, and disability. This is foolish--and, \nclearly, it is unsustainable. In fact, I've long said that we don't \nhave a health care system here in America, we have a ``sick care'' \nsystem. And it is costing us dearly both in terms of health care costs \nand premature deaths.\n  Consider the cost of major chronic diseases--diseases that, as I \nsaid, are so often preventable.\n  For starters the annual cost of obesity is $117 billion. For \ncardiovascular disease is about $352 billion. For diabetes it's $132 \nbillion. For smoking it's more than $75 billion. And for mental illness \nit's $150 billion; indeed, major depression is the leading cause of \ndisability in the United States.\n  Now, if I bought a new car, drove that car off the lot, and never \nmaintained it--never checked the oil, never checked the transmission \nfluid, never got it tuned up--you'd think I was crazy, not to mention \ngrossly irresponsible. The common-sense principle with an automobile \nis: ``I pay a little now to keep the car maintained, or I pay a whole \nlot later.''\n  Well, it's the same with our national health priorities. Right now, \nour health care system is in a downward spiral. We are not paying a \nlittle now; so we are paying a whole lot later.\n  For example, we are failing to address the nation's growing obesity \nepidemic. Today 65 percent of our population is overweight or obese. \nObesity is associated with numerous health problems and increased risks \nof diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and several types of cancer, to \nname just a few.\n  Another contributing factor to our health crisis is tobacco. We don't \nhear as much about the dangers of tobacco use, today, as we used to. \nThat's because there is a perception that we've turned the corner--that \nwe've done all that we need to do. But that perception is not accurate. \nIn 2002, 46 million American adults regularly smoked cigarettes--that \n26 percent of our population. Nearly 40 percent of college-aged \nstudents smoke. What this means is that after decades of education and \nefforts to stop tobacco use, more than one in every four Americans is \nstill addicted to nicotine and smoking.\n  Mental health is another enormous challenge that we are grossly \nneglecting. Mental health and chronic disease are intertwined. They can \ntrigger one another. It is about time we stop separating the mind and \nbody when discussing health. Prevention and mental health promotion \nprograms should be integrated into our schools, workplaces, and \ncommunities along with physical health screenings and education. \nSurely, at the outset of the 21st century, it's time to move beyond the \nlingering shame and stigma that often attend mental health.\n  Seventy percent of all deaths in the U.S. are now linked to chronic \nconditions such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. In so many \ncases, these chronic diseases are caused by poor nutrition, physical \ninactivity, tobacco use, and untreated mental illness. This is \nunacceptable.\n  After many months of meetings and discussions with Iowans and experts \nacross the nation, today I am re-introducing comprehensive legislation \ndesigned to transform America's ``sick care'' system into a true health \ncare system--one that emphasizes prevention and health promotion.\n  I am calling this bill the HeLP America Act, with HeLP as an acronym \nfor Healthy Lifestyles and Prevention. The aim is to give individuals \nand communities the information and tools they need to take charge of \ntheir own health.\n  Because if we are serious about getting control of health-care costs \nand health-insurance premiums, then we must give people access to \npreventive care . . . and we must give people the tools they need to \nstay healthy and stay out of the hospital.\n  This will take a sustained commitment from government, schools, \ncommunities, employers, health officials, and the tobacco and food \nindustries. But a sustained effort can have a huge payoff--for \nindividuals and families, for employers, for society, for government \nbudgets, and for the economy at large.\n  As I said, the HeLP America Act is comprehensive legislation. It a \nvery complex, multifaceted bill. But, this afternoon, I'd just like to \noutline the bill's major elements:\n  The first component addresses healthy kids and schools. Prevention \nand the development of a healthy habits and lifestyles must begin in \nthe early years, with our children. Unfortunately, today, we are \nheading in exactly the wrong direction. More and more children all \nacross America are suffering from poor nutrition, physical inactivity, \nmental health issues, and tobacco use.\n  For example, just since the 1980s, the rates of obesity have doubled \nin children and tripled in teens. Even more alarming is the fact that a \ngrowing number of children are experiencing what used to be thought of \nprimarily as adult health problems. Almost two-thirds--60 percent--of \noverweight children have at least one cardiovascular disease risk \nfactor. Recent studies of children have shown that increasing weight, \ngreater salt consumption from fast food, and poor eating habits have \ncontributed to the rise in blood pressure, higher cholesterol levels, \nand a shockingly rapid increase in adult-onset diabetes.\n  The HeLP America Act will more than double funding for the successful \nPEP program, which promotes health and physical education programs in \nour public schools. I find it disturbing that more than one third of \nyoungsters in grades 9 through 12 do not regularly engage in adequate \nphysical activity. This is a shame, because studies show that regular \nphysical activity boosts self-esteem and improves health.\n  The HeLP America Act will also expand the Harkin Fruit and Vegetable \nProgram to provide more free fresh fruits and vegetables in more public \nschools. The bill will also encourage give schools incentives to create \nhealthier environments, including goals for nutrition education and \nphysical activity.\n  The HeLP America Act would also establish a grant program to provide \nmental health screenings and prevention programs in schools, along with \ntraining for school staff to help them recognize children exhibiting \nearly warning signs. It will improve access to mental health services \nfor students and their families.\n  New to the HeLP Act this year is a strong focus on breastfeeding \npromotion. Sound nutrition begins the moment a baby is born and there \nis a vast body of scientific evidence that shows beyond a shadow of a \ndoubt that mom's milk is the ideal form of nutrition to promote child \nhealth. But in the U.S. we don't do enough to encourage breastfeeding. \nThe HeLP America Act seeks to remove some of those barriers and to \nencourage new mothers to breastfeed.\n  The second broad component of the HeLP American Act addresses Healthy \nCommunities and Workplaces. For example, the bill aims to create a \nhealthier workforce by providing tax\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\ncredits to businesses that offer wellness programs and health club \nmemberships. Studies show that, on average, every $1.00 that is \ninvested in workplace wellness returns $3.00 in savings on health \ncosts, absences from work, and so on.\n  At a field hearing in Iowa last year, I heard from Mr. Lynn Olson, \nCEO of Ottumwa Regional Health Center. The Center offers a \ncomprehensive wellness program for its employees, including reduced \nhealth insurance premiums for those employees who meet individual \nhealth goals. The Center has seen tremendous savings from their \ninvestment in health promotion.\n  My bill also creates a grant program for communities, encouraging \nthem to develop localized plans to promote healthier lifestyles. For \nexample, we want to support efforts like those going on in Webster \nCounty and Mason City, IA, where mall walking programs have been \nexpanded into community-wide initiatives to promote wellness.\n  At the same time, the bill provides new incentives for the \nconstruction of bike paths and sidewalks to encourage more physical \nactivity, especially walking. It is shocking that, today, roughly one-\nquarter of walking trips take place on roads without sidewalks or \nshoulders. And bike lanes are available for only about 5 percent of \nbike trips.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been a longstanding advocate for the \nrights of people with disabilities. So I have given special attention \nto health-promotion programs and activities that include this \npopulation. I just mentioned the bill's incentives to create bike lanes \nand sidewalks on newly constructed roads. This will make a big \ndifference to people with disabilities, who often are forced to travel \nin the street alongside cars because there are no sidewalks or bike \nlanes available for wheelchairs.\n  The Centers for Disease Control has funded a program called Living \nWell with a Disability, which has actually decreased secondary \nconditions and led to improved health for participants. The program is \nan eight-session workshop that teaches individuals with disabilities \nhow to change their nutrition and level of physical activity. The \nprogram not only increases healthy activities for people with \ndisabilities, but has also led to a 10 percent decline in the cost for \nmedical services, particularly emergency-room care and hospital stays.\n  In addition, my bill includes a Working Well with a Disability \nprogram, which will build partnerships between employers and vocational \nrehabilitation offices with the aim of developing wellness programs in \nthe workplace.\n  Mr. President, the third component of the HeLP America Act addresses \nResponsible Marketing and Consumer Awareness. Having accurate, readily \navailable information about the nutritional value of the foods we eat \nis the first step toward improving overall nutrition. Unfortunately, \nbecause of all the gimmicks and hype that marketers use to entice us to \nbuy their products, determining the nutritional value of the foods we \nbuy can be problematic--especially in restaurants. This is why the HeLP \nAmerica bill proposes to extend the nutritional labeling requirements \nof the National Labeling and Education Act, which currently covers the \nvast majority of retail foods, to restaurants foods as well, which were \nexempted from the NLEA when it first passed.\n  The marketing of junk food--especially to kids--is out of control. It \nwas estimated that junk food marketers, alone, spent $15 billion in \n2002 promoting their fare. And, I don't have to tell you, they are not \nadvertising broccoli and apples. No, the majority of these ads are for \ncandy and fast food--foods that are high in sugar, salt, fat, and \ncalories.\n  Children--especially those under 8 years of age--do not always have \nthe ability to distinguish fact from fiction. The number of TV ads that \nkids see over the course of their childhood has doubled from 20,000 to \n40,000. The sad thing is that, way back in the 1970s, the Federal Trade \nCommission recommended banning TV advertising to kids. And what was \nCongress's response? We made it even harder for the FTC to regulate \nadvertising for children than it is to regulate advertising for adults. \nMy bill will restore the authority of the FTC to regulate marketing to \nkids, and it encourages the FTC to do so.\n  The fourth component of the HeLP American Act addresses \nReimbursements for Prevention Services. Right now, our medical system \nis setup to pay doctors to perform a $20,000 gastric bypass instead of \noffering advice on how to avoid such risky procedures. The bill will \nreimburse and reward physicians for practicing prevention and \nscreenings. It will also expand Medicare coverage to pay for counseling \nfor nutrition and physical activity, mental health screenings, and \nsmoking-cessation programs. It also would establish a demonstration \nproject in the Medicare program, long overdue in my opinion, under \nwhich we can learn how best to use our health care dollars to prevent \nchronic diseases rather than just manage them once they've occurred. \nFrankly, it's a little embarrassing that we haven't done this before.\n  Finally, let me point out that the HeLP America Act will be paid for \nby creating a new National Health Promotion Trust Fund paid for through \npenalties on tobacco companies that fail to cut smoking rates among \nchildren, by ending the taxpayer subsidy of tobacco advertising, and \nalso by reinstating the top income tax rates for wealthy Americans.\n  It's time for the Senate to lead America in a new direction. We need \na new health care paradigm--a prevention paradigm.\n  Some will argue that avoiding obesity and preventable disease is \nstrictly a matter of personal responsibility. Well, we all agree that \nindividuals should act responsibly. I'm all for personal \nresponsibility. But I also believe in government responsibility. \nGovernment has a responsibility to ensure that people have the \ninformation and tools and incentives they need to take charge of their \nhealth. And that is what the HeLP America Act is all about.\n  Of course, this description of my bill just scratches the surface. \nThe HeLP America Act is comprehensive. It is ambitious. And I fully \nexpect an uphill fight in some quarters of Congress.\n  But just as with the Americans with Disabilities Act 14 years ago, I \nam committed to doing whatever it takes--and for as long as it takes--\nto pass this critically needed legislation.\n  It's time to heed the Golden Rule of Holes, which says: When you are \nin a hole, stop digging. Well, we have dug one whopper of a hole by \nfailing to emphasize prevention and wellness. And it's time to stop \ndigging.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Domenici, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lott, Ms. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 1075. A bill to postpone the 2005 round of defense base closure \nand realignment; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \ndelay the implementation of the 2005 round of the Defense Base Closure \nand Realignment report issued by the Department of Defense on May 13, \n2005. The bill would postpone the execution of any decisions \nrecommended in the report until certain anticipated events, having \npotentially large or unforeseen implications for our military force \nstructure, have occurred, and both the department and Congress have had \na chance to fully study the effects such events will have on our base \nrequirements.\n  The bill identifies three principal actions that must occur before \nimplementation of BRAC 2005. First, there must be a complete analysis \nand consideration of the recommendations of the Commission on Review of \nOverseas Military Structures. The overseas base commission has itself \ncalled upon the Department of Defense to ``slow down and take a \nbreath'' before moving forward on basing decisions without knowing \nexactly where units will be returned and if those installations are \nprepared or equipped to support units that will return from garrisons \nin Europe, consisting of approximately 70,000 personnel.\n  Second, BRAC should not occur while this country is engaged in a \nmajor war and rotational deployments are still ongoing. We have seen \nenough disruption of both military and civilian institutions due to the \nlogistical strain brought about by these constant rotations of units \nand personnel to Iraq and Afghanistan without, at the same time, \ninitiating numerous base closures and the multiple transfer of units \nand missions from base to base. This is simply too much to ask of our \nmilitary, our communities and the families of our\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\nservicemen and women, already stretched and over-taxed. And frankly, \nour efforts right now must be devoted to winning the global war on \nterrorism, not packing up and moving units around the country.\n\n  Our bill would delay implementation of BRAC until the Secretary of \nDefense determines that substantially all major combat units and assets \nhave been returned from deployment in the Iraq theater of operations, \nwhenever that might occur.\n  Third, to review or implement the BRAC recommendations without having \nthe benefit of either the Commission or Congress studying the \nQuadrennial Defense Review, due in 2006, and its long-term planning \nrecommendations seems counter-intuitive and completely out of logical \nsequence. Therefore, the bill requires that Congress receive the QDR \nand have an opportunity to study its planning recommendations as one of \nthe conditions before implementing BRAC 2005.\n  Fourth and Fifth: BRAC should not go forward until the implementation \nand development by the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security of \nthe National Maritime Security Strategy; and the completion and \nimplementation of Secretary of Defense's Homeland Defense and Civil \nSupport Directive--only now being drafted. These two planning \nstrategies should be key considerations before beginning any BRAC \nprocess.\n  Finally, once all these conditions have been met, the Secretary of \nDefense must submit to Congress, not later than one year after the \noccurrence of the last of these conditions, a report that assesses the \nrelevant factors and recommendations identified by the Commission on \nReview of Overseas Base Structure; the return of our thousands of \ntroops deployed in overseas garrisons that will return to domestic \nbases because of either overseas base reduction or the end of our \ndeployments in the war; and, any relevant factors identified by the QDR \nthat would impact, modify, negate or open to reconsideration any of the \nrecommendations submitted by the Secretary of Defense for BRAC 2005.\n  This proposed delay only seems logical and fair. There is no need to \nrush into decisions, that in a few years from now, could turn out to be \ncolossal mistakes. We can't afford to go back and rebuild installations \nor relocate high-cost support infrastructure at various points in this \ncountry once those installations have been closed or stripped of their \nvaluable capacity to support critical missions.

Res. 145\n\n       Whereas the mission of the National Safety Council is to \n     educate and influence society to adopt safety, health, and \n     environmental policies, practices, and procedures that \n     prevent and mitigate human suffering and economic losses \n     arising from preventable causes;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council works to protect lives \n     and promote health with innovative programs;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council, founded in 1913, is \n     celebrating its 92nd anniversary in 2005 as the premier \n     source of safety and health information, education, and \n     training in the United States;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council was congressionally \n     chartered in 1953, and is celebrating its 52nd anniversary in \n     2005 as a congressionally chartered organization;\n       Whereas even with advancements in safety that create a \n     safer environment for the people of the United States, such \n     as new legislation and improvements in technology, the \n     unintentional-injury death toll is still unacceptable;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council has demonstrated \n     leadership in educating the Nation in the prevention of \n     injuries and deaths to senior citizens as a result of falls;\n       Whereas citizens deserve a solution to nationwide safety \n     and health threats;\n       Whereas such a solution requires the cooperation of all \n     levels of government, as well as the general public;\n       Whereas the summer season, traditionally a time of \n     increased unintentional-injury fatalities, is an appropriate \n     time to focus attention on both the problem and the solution \n     to such safety and health threats; and\n       Whereas the theme of ``National Safety Month'' for 2005 is \n     ``Safety: Where We Live, Work, and Play'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2005 as ``National Safety Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     month with appropriate ceremonies and activities that promote \n     acknowledgment, gratitude, and respect for the advances of \n     the National Safety Council and its mission.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Feinstein to \nsubmit a resolution to designate June 2005 as ``National Safety \nMonth.'' This year, the National Safety Council has selected ``Safety: \nWhere We Live, Work, and Play'' as the theme for National Safety Month.\n  Public safety in our homes, communities, workplace, and on our roads \nand highways is a vital challenge that we must constantly address. \nAccording to\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\nthe National Safety Council, more than 20 million Americans suffer \ndisabling injuries and 100,000 people die from their injuries each \nyear. In the United States, nearly 43,000 people die each year from \nmotor vehicle crashes, making auto fatalities the number one killer of \nthose between the ages of 4 and 34. Many of these deaths and injuries \ncan be prevented with proper education and precautionary measures.\n  The goal of National Safety Month is to raise public awareness of \nsafety and prevention in hopes of reducing these deaths and injuries. \nJune also is an appropriate month to focus our efforts on public safety \nsince the summer season is traditionally a time of increased \nunintentional injuries and fatalities. Throughout the month, the \nNational Safety Council and other safety organizations will urge \nbusinesses to increase their standards of safety in the workplace and \nprovide information to individuals regarding injury prevention in \nhomes, communities, and on roads and highways. I look forward to \nworking with other members of the Senate and House and the safety \norganizations to help educate the public on the importance of injury \nprevention, so that we can reach our goal of saving more lives.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein for her support of this resolution and for \nher continued dedication to public safety. I would also like to thank \nthe National Safety Council and congratulate them as the Council \ncelebrates its 92nd anniversary in 2005, as a leading source of safety \nand health information, education, and training in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/18/senate-section/article/S5449-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 146--RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ERUPTION \n                          OF MOUNT ST.

Res. 146\n\n       Whereas, on May 18, 1980, at 8:32 a.m. Pacific Daylight \n     Time, the volcano of Mount St. Helens erupted, changing its \n     elevation from 9,677 feet to 8,363 feet;\n       Whereas the eruption was triggered by an earthquake of \n     magnitude 5.1 approximately 1 mile beneath the volcano;\n       Whereas the lateral blast covered an area approximately 230 \n     square miles and reached as far as 17 miles northwest of the \n     crater;\n       Whereas the velocity of the blast was estimated to be at \n     least 300 miles per hour;\n       Whereas the pyroclastic flows covered 6 square miles, \n     reached temperatures of 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, and moved \n     at speeds between 50 and 80 miles per hour;\n       Whereas, as a result of the eruption, over 4,000,000,000 \n     board-feet of timber was blown down, which is enough material \n     to build about 150,000 homes;\n       Whereas volcanic ash clouded the sky above eastern \n     Washington, reached the east coast of the United States in 3 \n     days, and eventually circled the globe in 15 days;\n       Whereas the eruption claimed the lives of 57 people; and\n       Whereas tens of thousands of animals perished: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 25th Anniversary of the eruption of \n     Mount St. Helens on May 18, 2005;\n       (2) acknowledges the importance of monitoring all 169 \n     volcanoes in the United States and its territories;\n       (3) recognizes the invaluable work of the Department of the \n     Interior, the United States Geological Survey, the United \n     States Forest Service, the Directorate of Emergency \n     Preparedness and Response of the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and the Cascade Volcano Observatory in monitoring \n     the activities of Mount St. Helens;\n       (4) acknowledges the progress in science that has led to a \n     more comprehensive understanding of volcanology, seismology, \n     and plate tectonics, thus enhancing the ability to predict \n     volcanic activity and eruptions; and\n       (5) supports monitoring volcanoes and helping to develop \n     emergency response plans to ensure that the people and \n     communities of the United States are safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/18/senate-section/article/S5450-7", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5450-S5451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL INTERNET SAFETY MONTH\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to consideration of S. Res. 147 which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 147) designating June 2005 as \n     National Internet Safety Month.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution \ndesignating June 2005 as National Internet Safety Month. I am pleased \nto have Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Craig, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, \nMr. Allen, and Mrs. Feinstein join me in submitting this resolution.\n  The Internet has become one of the most significant advances in the \ntwentieth century and, as a result, it affects people's lives in a \npositive manner each day. However, this technology presents dangers \nthat need to be brought to the attention of all Americans.\n  Never before has the problem of online predatory behavior been more \nof a concern. Consider the pervasiveness of Internet access by children \nand the rapid increase in Internet crime and predatory behavior. Never \nbefore have powerful educational solutions--like\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\nInternet safety curricula for grades kindergarten through 12, youth \nempowerment Internet safety campaigns and community-based Internet \nsafety awareness presentations with the formation of community action \nteams--been more critical and readily at hand. It is imperative that \nevery community in every State be made aware of the increase in \nInternet-based criminal activity so that all Americans may learn about \nthe Internet safety strategies which will help them to keep their \nchildren safe from victimization.\n  Consider the facts: In the United States, more than 90 percent of \nchildren in grades 5 through 12 now use computers and have Internet \naccess. Twenty-six percent of children in that age group are online for \nmore than 5 hours a week and 12 percent spend more time online than \nthey do with their friends.\n  An alarming statistic is that 39 percent of youths in grades 5 \nthrough 12 in the United States admit giving out their personal \ninformation, such as their name, age and gender over the Internet. \nFurthermore, 12 percent of students in the same age group have been \nasked by a stranger on the Internet to meet face to face. \nUnfortunately, 11.5 percent of students in this age group have actually \nmet face to face with a stranger they met on the Internet.\n  Most disturbing are the patterns of Internet crimes against children. \nIn 1996, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was involved in 113 cases \ninvolving Internet crimes against children. In 2001, the FBI opened \n1,541 cases against people suspected of using the Internet to commit \ncrimes involving child pornography or abuse. The U.S. Customs Service \nnow places the number of Web sites offering child pornography at more \nthan 100,000. Moreover, there was a 345 percent increase in the \nproduction of these sites just between February 2001 and July 2001, \naccording to a recent study.\n  Now is the time for America to focus its attention on supporting \nInternet safety, especially bearing in mind that children will soon be \non summer vacation and will subsequently spend more time online. Recent \nInternet crime trends indicate a call to action as it pertains to \nnational Internet safety awareness at all levels.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 147) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and, in \norder to place the bills on the calendar under the provisions of rule \nXIV, I object to my own request, all en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bills will receive their second reading on the next legislative \nday.\n\n\n                                s. 1062\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has now been 8 long years since the \nNation's hardworking men and women had an increase in the minimum wage. \nThe essence of the American dream is that if people work hard and play \nby the rules they can succeed in life and support their families. But \nfor millions of hardworking Americans earning the minimum wage, that \ndream has become a cruel hoax. An American who works full time, year-\nround at the current minimum wage of $5.15 an hour earns $10,700 a \nyear--$5,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. The minimum \nwage is too low.\n  Today Congressman George Miller and I are introducing the Fair \nMinimum Wage Act of 2005 to raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour in \nthree steps over the next 2 years. This increase will directly raise \nthe pay of\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\nseven and a half million workers, and indirectly benefit eight million \nmore. Sixty-one percent of the beneficiaries are women, and one-third \nof those women are mothers. More than a third are people of color.\n  Two new reports emphasize the urgency of this increase for millions \nof low-wage Americans and their families. The Children's Defense Fund \nreports that a single parent working full time at the current minimum \nwage earns enough to cover only 40 percent of the cost of raising two \nchildren. Nearly 10 million children live in households that would \nbenefit from the increase we are proposing.\n  A report from the Center for Economic Policy Research shows that \nminimum wage jobs are not just entry-level jobs for teenagers, contrary \nto what we often hear from opponents of the minimum wage. A third of \nminimum wage earners from ages 25 to 54 will still be earning the \nminimum wage 3 years later. Only 40 percent of them will have moved out \nof the low-wage workforce 3 years later.\n  No matter how hard they work, minimum wage workers are forced each \nday to make impossible choices--between paying the rent and buying \ngroceries, or between paying the heating bill and buying clothes. These \nhardworking Americans have earned a raise and they deserve a raise. No \none who works for a living should have to live in poverty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/18/senate-section/article/S5452-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 19, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
