Mr. President, I welcome everyone back from the \nPresident's Day recess. I suspect the weather outside today makes our \ndistinguished President pro tempore homesick for his home, Alaska.\n  As we communicated over the last week, today, in just a few minutes, \nwe will begin debate on the bankruptcy bill, S. 256, the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The chairman and \nranking member are here to begin the opening remarks. Other Members \nwill want to speak, I am sure, this afternoon.\n  Our agreement provides for debate only today. Therefore, as \npreviously announced, we will have no rollcall votes today. We do have \nseveral speakers. I don't expect a lengthy session today. I ask my \ncolleagues to come to the Chamber to make opening statements and keep \nthe afternoon full. I want people to make sure they have that \nopportunity to speak today, but do not expect a lengthy session because \nof the weather.\n  We expect to begin the amendment process on the bill tomorrow. I \nencourage Members to notify their respective cloakrooms if they intend \nto offer amendments to this bill. I had the opportunity to talk to the \nDemocratic leader over the recess, as well, and we both agreed we would \nencourage our caucuses to bring those amendments forward to the ranking \nmember and the chairman so they can be addressed in an efficient and \neffective way. I expect we will make progress on amendments during \ntomorrow's session, although it is unlikely we will vote before the \npolicy luncheons. I ask the chairman to consider having a vote shortly \nafter the 2:15 reconvening tomorrow if at all possible.\n  I understand we are just beginning today, but I encourage the \namendment process to begin in the morning. Hopefully, we can debate \namendments in the morning.\n  I thank everyone for their assistance on this snowy Monday and look \nforward to a very constructive legislative period over the next several \nweeks. I will say more on the bankruptcy bill tomorrow morning.\n  Let me say how pleased I am we are moving forward in considering this \nbill that many people have looked at for longer than 7 years. Over the \nlast 7 years we have passed this bill, or a bill very similar to it, \nrepeatedly, again and again, both in the House and in the Senate.\n  The reason we have been able to pass the bill is that both sides of \nthe aisle recognize the current system is calling for reform. Personal \nbankruptcies are skyrocketing and wealthy debtors are walking away from \ndebts they can repay. This abuse is hurting everyone, not just the \ncreditor they owe, but it hurts all who ultimately pay higher fees in \nprices to cover the loss.\n  With that, I yield the floor as we begin debate on S. 256, the \nBankruptcy\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\nAbuse and Prevention Consumer Protection Act of 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/28/senate-section/article/S1726-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1726-S1788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    BANKRUPTCY ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2005\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in my capacity as chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague \nfrom Vermont, the ranking member, in beginning the debate on this very \nimportant legislation.\n  At the outset, I congratulate Senator Grassley for the work he has \ndone over the past decade, and also former chairman, Senator Hatch, for \nthe outstanding job he has done. I thank Senator Hatch especially for \nfilling in for me a week ago Thursday on the executive session when the \ncommittee took up the bill and reported it to the Senate.\n  I thank both Republicans and Democrats on the committee for \nwithholding amendments until the floor.\n  We had one very extensive hearing. I know there was an interest in \nhaving more hearings, but the reality is this issue has been debated \nand has been heard. There is a very comprehensive idea on both sides as \nto the underlying merits of the bill.\n  It is important to note that going back to the 105th Congress the \nSenate passed a similar bill by a vote of 97 to 1, and subsequently \nvoted to proceed to conference by a vote of 94 to 2. The Senate again \ntook up a similar bill in the 106th Congress and passed legislation \nagain by a wide margin, 83 to 14. The House also passed legislation \nduring the 106th Congress, but President Clinton resorted to a pocket \nveto, so the bill was not enacted. The Senate took up the bill again in \nthe 107th Congress but never reached agreement with the House on \ncertain language. So here we are today with reform legislation that \nseeks to protect the interests of the debtors, honest Americans, who \nneed relief from bankruptcy, and still address those who take advantage \nof the bankruptcy laws.\n  Bankruptcy is obviously a necessary tool for many people who find \nthey simply are not able to repay their debts. Indeed, the vast \nmajority of bankruptcy filers have nothing with which to pay their \ncreditors. They file for bankruptcy as a last resort. And for them \nbankruptcy will continue to provide a fresh start.\n  Unfortunately, at the same time, there are some who use bankruptcy as \na means of avoiding debts they have the ability to pay. Some bankruptcy \nfilers have the ability to pay a significant portion of their debts, \nbut the current bankruptcy system, which presumes that most people are \nacting honestly, does not require them to do so. At a recent Judiciary \nCommittee hearing on the bill, the expert testimony was that up to 10 \npercent of people who file for bankruptcy have the ability to pay for \nat least part of their debts.\n  The consequence of having people avoid their debts when they can pay \nfor them has resulted in having these obligations absorbed by other \npeople in the commercial system. The estimate is that there are some \n$44 billion in debts discharged annually. There has been an enormous \nincrease in the filings. In recent years, annual bankruptcy filings \nhave exceeded 1.6 million for the first time in history. They more than \ndoubled in the 1980s and again doubled from 1990 to the year 2003.\n  This legislation is an effort to achieve some balance, balance to see \nto it that people who genuinely need bankruptcy and cannot pay their \ndebts are able to get the relief in bankruptcy, and at the same time \nlooking at many practices which are in need of reform.\n  For example, this legislation will require high-income debtors who \nhave the ability to repay some of their debts to do so. The heart of \nthis bill is a means test. It requires the bankruptcy trustee to \nexamine the income and expenses of high-income debtors and determine \nwhether they have the ability to pay something toward their debts. If \nso, they must complete a chapter 13 reorganization plan, which requires \nthat they repay part of their debts over time before they can have the \nrest discharged.\n\n  The legislation will also bring to an end other abuses that occur \nunder the current bankruptcy system. For example, it closes the \n``mansion loophole,'' which allows opportunistic debtors to avoid \npaying their creditors by buying a house in a State with an unlimited \nor extremely generous homestead exemption, and then declaring \nbankruptcy. It extends the statute of limitations for fraudulent use of \nthe homestead exemption to 10 years.\n  Another provision prevents debtors from purchasing large amounts of \nluxury goods on credit and then filing for bankruptcy to have that debt \ndischarged. Other provisions will discourage debtors from repeatedly \nfiling for bankruptcy, and then invoking the automatic stay to avoid \nrepaying their creditors.\n  The legislation also aims at ensuring that debtors cannot escape \ntheir spousal and child support obligations by filing for bankruptcy. \nThat is, of course, a very important item, with dodging child support \nand spousal support being a matter of an enormous problem nationwide. \nChapter 13 debtors cannot have a repayment plan approved or their debts \ndischarged until they are current on their spousal and child support \nobligations.\n  The legislation will further improve the bankruptcy process for small \nbusinesses and enhance bankruptcy protections for family farmers as \nwell as family fishermen. Small businesses that can restructure will \nstill be able to obtain a fresh start. However, for the many small \nbusinesses that will never survive a protracted bankruptcy, the bill \nimposes deadlines to keep cases\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\nfrom languishing and creditors from waiting indefinitely.\n  In addition, the bill makes it easier for family farmers to obtain \nbankruptcy protection under Chapter 12, a form of bankruptcy that takes \naccount of the unique concerns of farmers. And, for the first time, \nfamily fishermen will also be able to file for Chapter 12 bankruptcy.\n  Further, the bill contains protections aimed at helping consumers \navoid excessive debt and bankruptcy. It requires credit card companies \nto warn their cardholders that making the minimum payment on a credit \ncard balance can significantly increase the time it takes to pay off \nthe balance. Many credit card practices are extremely deceptive. Credit \ncard companies must also provide certain disclosures in credit card \nsolicitations, including clear indications when an advertised interest \nrate is merely introductory--again, a practice which is very deceptive. \nSo the bill is aimed at preventing the little guy from being misled, \nwhich leads him into bankruptcy.\n  The legislation further provides that creditors make certain \ndisclosures before debtors can reaffirm their debts so that debtors \nfully understand the implications of signing a reaffirmation \nagreement--a technical matter. The legislation requires that debtors \nreceive credit counseling before filing for bankruptcy so they can \nunderstand the consequences of filing and are aware of the alternatives \nto bankruptcy. A little knowledge there can go a long way.\n  At the outset, I want to acknowledge that there are many low-income \npeople who will not be able to repay any of their debts. The means test \nwill not affect those people. If they are below the median income for \ntheir State, the means test will not apply. However, for those who are \nabove the median income, there will be a balance so those who can \nafford to do so must repay part of their debts, to help prevent the $44 \nbillion in discharged debts from burdening other honest Americans, and \npart of the commercial system will not be saddled with those \nobligations.\n  In analyzing this legislation, it is my concern to ensure that it is \nfair to the ``little guy,'' the working men and women who need \nbankruptcy as a last resort and who do not abuse the system.\n  We had a lively debate in the hearing in the Judiciary Committee. We \nhad a lively hearing. I know there are many amendments which will be \noffered, and I will have an open mind in considering these amendments \nas we work through the process. It is a very complicated bill. But it \nhas been analyzed and reanalyzed. Again, it attempts to strike a \nbalance so that the person who needs the discharge in bankruptcy will \nbe able to obtain it, but those who game the system will not be able to \ndo so.\n  Let me reiterate the comments of the majority leader in urging \nSenators who have opening statements to come to the floor to offer \nthose opening statements. It will be the objective of Senator Leahy, \nthe ranking member, and myself to try to move through to amendments. It \nis anticipated there will be amendments.\n  We have a very active calendar ahead of us. One of the items on the \nJudiciary Committee agenda that we are moving forward on is asbestos \nlegislation, an issue of tremendous importance, where many Americans \nare dying from mesothelioma and other deadly ailments from exposure to \nasbestos, who collect nothing because the companies are bankrupt. Some \n74 companies have gone bankrupt, and more are in the process. I filed a \ndraft discussion bill. There have been very extensive negotiations with \nRepublicans and Democrats, and we are anxious to move ahead. We will be \ntaking that issue up on the executive calendar of the Judiciary \nCommittee on Thursday. But I mention that to underscore the importance \nof moving ahead on this legislation because there will be, doubtless, \nmany amendments, and the sooner they are offered, the sooner we can \ncome to grips with the substance of the bill.\n  At this time, I yield to my distinguished ranking member, Senator \nLeahy.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, for his opening \nstatement. I know he has worked hard on this matter.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Vermont, and the \ndistinguished President pro tempore have noted that it is spitting snow \noutside. Unfortunately, some think this is a time for panic. They \nshould go to Alaska. They should go to Vermont. They should go over to \nthe mountains of Pennsylvania.\n  I say to the President pro tempore, you heard me mention not so long \nago that I was back home in Vermont. I was listening to the news, and \nalmost as an afterthought they said: By the way, we should have a \ndusting of snow tonight; No more than 3 to 5 inches. Down here, of \ncourse, everything comes to a screeching halt.\n  Why I bring this up I have no idea, except that when watching TV \ncrews going out begging to get one shot of a snowflake, I say: Go to \nAlaska. Go to Vermont. We will show them what real weather is.\n  Today, we are beginning debate on the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and \nConsumer Protection Act of 2005--a big title for S. 256. But it is an \nimportant debate. It is the first time in 4 years the Senate has \ndebated bankruptcy reform legislation. I hope it is going to be a fair \nand informed and beneficial debate that will improve this bipartisan \nbill and help us enact bankruptcy reform into law.\n  Both the chairman and I have worked very hard with Senators on our \nsides of the aisle. We have tried to move this legislation forward. But \nwe know that bankruptcy is a complex area of law. It has many competing \npublic policy interests between debtors and creditors and even among \ncompeting creditors.\n  The very complex and competing interests involved in achieving fair \nreforms of our bankruptcy system demand that we work in a bipartisan \nmanner throughout the legislative process.\n  I mentioned that 4 years ago we debated this issue. I mentioned that \nbecause today our Nation has an entirely different face than it did \nthen. We have endured the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We \nhave immersed ourselves in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We have \nwitnessed a parade of financial misdeeds--more than misdeeds, financial \nthefts and skulduggery by major U.S. corporations. We have even watched \nas pension programs, and the promises of the pension programs, were \nshortchanged by nearly $100 billion. All these factors have only \ndeepened the financial woes of an already struggling economy. So when \nwe debate this issue today we are discussing real life today, not what \nit was in 2001.\n  I think for this legislation to be appropriate and fair, the key \nprovisions have to be carefully examined. If necessary, they have to be \nmodernized, they have to be amended.\n  Earlier this month, our committee held a bipartisan hearing on \nbankruptcy reform legislation. As I said, that was our first hearing in \n4 years. It was an informed discussion. A week later, the Judiciary \nCommittee held its first markup on bankruptcy legislation in 4 years. \nDuring that meeting, we considered 11 amendments, 5 of which were \naccepted.\n  They improved the bill. In fact, they were accepted unanimously. I am \nparticularly pleased the committee accepted the Leahy-Grassley \namendment that clarifies that any judgment, order, or settlement \nagreement for violation of securities fraud law after the filing of a \nbankruptcy case is nondischargeable. In other words, if you want to \ndefraud somebody in securities, if you want to pull some of these big \nfraud actions we have seen in the past few years, you are not going to \nescape the consequences by bankruptcy.\n  During consideration of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Senator \nGrassley and I worked together to amend the Bankruptcy Code to make \njudgments and settlements based on security law violations \nnondischargeable. We wanted to protect the victims' ability to recoup \ntheir losses and hold wrongdoers accountable for their actions. This \nchange in the law was based on a Judiciary Committee amendment that \nSenator Grassley and I introduced to my corporate fraud legislation, S. \n2010, the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act that was \nunanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee. It was later adopted \nas a floor amendment by a vote of 99 to nothing in 2002.\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\n  Recently a bankruptcy court wrongly interpreted the new law by \nfinding that a securities fraud judgment, order, or settlement must be \nin existence at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed to be \nnondischargeable. That was never intended. This court precedent could \nresult in future courts discharging securities frauds judgments, \norders, or settlements that are entered into after a debtor files for \nbankruptcy.\n  To give you an idea of what a get-out-of-jail-free card this is, an \nEnron executive could avoid paying his securities fraud judgment by \nfiling for bankruptcy where the securities fraud litigation is pending. \nThat would be wrong. Neither Republicans nor Democrats who supported \nthat amendment want that to happen. So the Leahy-Grassley amendment, \nwhich was accepted by all Members, Republicans and Democrats, in the \ncommittee during committee consideration, would remedy that injustice \nand makes it clear that Congress intended for all securities fraud \njudgments, orders, or settlements to be nondischargeable.\n  Another area we have to consider is the economic hardships faced by \nservice members' families. When you get a call to serve your country in \nIraq or Afghanistan or elsewhere--and now it is a disproportionate \nnumber of guardsmen and reservists who are called up; I watch this as \nthe cochair of the National Guard caucus of the Senate--it can cause \nloss of family income, the close of a family business, a whole lot of \nother unexpected expenses. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for \nservice members and their families to be forced into filing for \nbankruptcy relief. We have to protect those who are fighting for us. I \nknow Senators Durbin and Nelson have taken an interest in this issue. I \nlook forward to hearing their thoughts on how we can help the \nsituations faced by service members serving our Nation and their \nfamilies.\n  I spoke of the financial misdeeds of U.S. corporations. When you talk \nabout Enron and WorldCom, others, it leaves a very bitter taste in the \nmouths of average Americans. If an average American were to steal $500 \nor $1,000, they might go to jail. Apparently, if you steel $100 \nmillion, $200 million, or $500 million, you are a hero. When it is \ndone, there are no heroes, not to any of us. They have damaged investor \nconfidence. They have shaken our capital markets. Senators Sarbanes, \nKennedy, Durbin, Harkin, and Cantwell have prepared amendments to \naddress the ongoing problems caused by corporate abuse.\n\n  We must strengthen the financial safety net for hard-working American \nfamilies who confront illness or injury. Medical problems contribute to \nabout half of all bankruptcies, even though most of those who file had \nhealth insurance when they became sick. Many lose their jobs and their \ninsurance because they got sick. Others face thousands of dollars in \ncopayments and deductibles for services not covered by their insurance. \nSenators Kennedy, Durbin, Clinton, and Corzine will be leading the \ndebate on this issue.\n  Since we last considered bankruptcy reform legislation, financially \ntroubled companies have shortchanged their pension promises by nearly \n$100 billion, putting workers approaching retirement age or responsible \ncompanies and actually taxpayers at risk. We will hear from Senators \nHarkin, Rockefeller, and Dayton during debate over this issue.\n  I know that Senators Grassley, Durbin, Dodd, Feinstein, and others \nshare a commitment to include credit industry reform in a balanced \nbankruptcy bill. The millions of credit card solicitations made to \nAmerican consumers in the past year have contributed to the rise in \nconsumer debt and bankruptcy. It is relatively easy to obtain credit. \nWe have heard the stories of a neighbor's dog getting a $3,000 \npreapproved credit card. Kids go to college and are inundated with \npreapproved credit cards. So it is relatively easy to obtain them. Not \nnearly enough is done to ensure that credit is properly managed. \nCurrently, credit card statements fail to include all of the \ninformation necessary to allow individuals to make fully informed \nfinancial decisions. Additional disclosure is needed to ensure that \nindividuals completely understand the implications of their credit card \nuse.\n  Senator Akaka intends to offer the credit card minimum payment \nwarning act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor with him. It will \nprovide a wake-up call for consumers by making it very clear what costs \nthey are going to incur if they make only the minimum payments on their \ncredit cards. The personalized information they will receive for each \nof their accounts will help consumers make informed choices about their \ndebts. In an era of computers, this is not a real burden on the \ncompanies.\n  Senator Feingold, a longtime protector of working middle and lower \nincome families who rely on the ability to resolve overwhelming \nfinancial burdens through bankruptcy, is going to offer several \namendments to improve this bill. Senator Feingold and I have worked \ntogether on bankruptcy reform issues for a long time. I know his \nexpertise and the measures he means to propose will enhance this \nlegislation.\n  We have to be careful that our efforts to ensure accountability in \nthe bankruptcy process do not inadvertently create problems for privacy \nand security. We are in an age where personal information--far too much \npersonal information--can be easily digitized and shared. If it falls \ninto the wrong hands, it is abused. Identity theft is one danger, as is \ntracking and harassing a battered spouse. We can look for \naccountability, but we have to find ways to minimize the possibilities \nof abuse.\n  Four years ago, the committee adopted the Leahy-Hatch amendment to \nprotect the personal privacy of consumers whose information is held by \nfirms in bankruptcy as part of bankruptcy reform legislation. I am \npleased this bill retains this proprivacy provision.\n  Our bipartisan provision permits bankruptcy courts to honor the \nprivacy policies of business debtors. It creates a consumer privacy \nombudsman to protect personal privacy in bankruptcy proceedings. I \nappreciate Senator Hatch's efforts to add important consumer privacy \nprotections to the code.\n  Unfortunately, the Leahy-Hatch amendment is needed because the \ncustomer lists and databases of failed firms now can be put up for sale \nin bankruptcy without any privacy considerations, even in violation of \nthe failed firm's own public privacy policy against sale of personal \ncustomer information to third parties.\n  Let me just tell you what happened in this case, and it is not \nuntypical. We had an online toy store called Toysmart.com. Toysmart.com \nwanted to encourage parents to allow their children to go online and, \nin doing so, they promised on their Web site that personal information \nvoluntarily submitted by visitors to the site--such as name, address, \nbilling information, childhood preferences--would never be shared with \na third party. If you are a parent, you would look at that and say: I \nfeel a little bit better about this. I don't want my son or daughter's \nnames out there.\n  Guess what happened. They filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Even though \nthey had made this promise to parents and children, the personal \ncustomer information was put on the auction block. In a way, the \nbankruptcy court had a catch-22. I suspect the judge realized that this \nwas violating everything every parent thought of, but under the law at \nthat time, there was only one real asset. It was this mailing list. It \nwasn't the old desks or loading docks or the warehouse. Those were \nempty. It wasn't the computers. Those would be out of date every few \nmonths. The one item of any value was the mailing list. The mailing \nlist that parents had been promised would never go out, the children's \nnames would never be sold, that had to go into bankruptcy. That is why \nwe have the Leahy-Hatch amendment.\n\n  The Leahy-Hatch provision included in this legislation adds privacy \nprotections and a consumer privacy ombudsman to the bankruptcy code. We \nwanted to prevent future cases like Toysmart.com. Once somebody tells \nyou we are going to keep your kids, information confidential, it will \nbe.\n  We have seen in the news recently the ChoicePoint Inc. breach. It is \njust the latest example of why we need to take special care with \ndatabases containing America's personal information. It is astounding \nthat a company in the business of providing data for background checks \nand law enforcement purposes failed to assess the legitimacy of its own \ncustomers. It sold\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\npersonal data on 145,000 individuals to scam artists. Many of the \nvictims had no idea that ChoicePoint existed, let alone that the \ncompany compiled data. How irresponsible, how wrong. How can the people \nwho run ChoicePoint sleep at night? This is one of the most outrageous \nthings we have heard. How can they possibly hold themselves up as a \ncompany? We now find that as this was going on, some of them were \nmaking millions of dollars in stock options. This is outrageous. I \nwould hope that the Department of Justice and others are looking at \nthis. How can anybody be this negligent? How can anybody be this \ncriminal? They make millions of dollars, the people running it. \nSomebody who has a mom and pop somewhere can find, because they were so \nnegligent, because they opened the doors and let the scam artists come \nin, they may lose their business. Somebody who has a child in college \nmay not be able to pay the tuition. Somebody who is trying to make the \nrent or the mortgage, living paycheck to paycheck, may not be able to.\n  Apparently, according to the press this past week, their executives \nwill make millions of dollars on stock while their customers are being \nclobbered. What shame. And we haven't heard a single one of them step \nforward and say how ashamed they are by this outrageous action.\n  It has become all too familiar. In recent years, headlines have \nrecounted how personal information has been compromised and database \nbreaches of government contractors, at banks, at universities, even a \nblood bank. One hospital on the west coast sends things to be \ntranslated in Pakistan. All these secret medical records that you think \nare so private, they sent it over to Pakistan, and the person in \nPakistan said: I want more money.\n  If you don't give me more money--because I am in Pakistan, and you \ncannot touch me here--I am going to put all of these people's medical \nrecords online. What were they thinking, the people who run this thing? \nThey make a whole lot of money, but, boy, they are clobbering the \npeople who go there. This puts America's most private information at \nrisk not only for financial crimes but for stalking. You can find out \nwho lives alone, who is vulnerable, who could be blackmailed, and find \nout who may be a victim for scam artists. The administration talks \nabout fighting terrorism. This creates a potential avenue for a \nterrorist to masquerade as an innocent person.\n  I have called for a series of hearings on how we ensure data \nsecurity, privacy and proper use in the information age. I am pleased \nthat Chairman Specter has agreed to my request for hearings, and I look \nforward to these opportunities to consider these issues closely.\n  We need to take reasonable measures in the bankruptcy process to \nguide what information will be available publicly and to whom. Debtors \nare often required to submit documents containing highly personal \ninformation. Declaring bankruptcy is challenging enough for those who \nfind themselves in that circumstance, we shouldn't make it worse by \ncreating the possibility that they will be victimized later on. I am \nsubmitting an amendment to provide protections in handling personal \ndata in those submissions. These changes reflect current Judicial \nConference policy and were included in last term's Hatch-Leahy Federal \nCourts Improvement Act.\n  First, my amendment expands the court's discretion to protect \ninformation such as social security numbers and passport numbers. The \nbankruptcy courts are in a unique position to properly balance the need \nto share information with the need to protect privacy, and we should \nrely on their good judgment and discretion as much as possible. The \namendment draws from the current civil procedure discovery rules to set \na standard against which the court can apply its discretion. The \namendment also allows individuals to request that the court protect \nsensitive information before it is placed in the public record. This \nprotection is particularly important given our increasing reliance on \nelectronic filing, where information is immediately available to the \npublic.\n  Second, my amendment provides important protection for social \nsecurity numbers. Originally promised to be narrow in purpose and use, \nsocial security numbers are now the universal identifier with the key \nto unlock access to bank accounts and other highly sensitive areas. We \nmust treat these numbers commensurate with their power, and ensure that \nthey are only accessed in appropriate situations by authorized users. \nMy amendment would allow debtors to limit disclosure to only the last \nfour digits of his or her social security number in the notices that \nare filed with the court. The amendment still protects creditors where \nnecessary, and specifies that creditors who are on the schedule of \nassets and liabilities should receive the full tax payer identification \nnumber in the notices sent specifically to the creditor.\n  This idea of truncation isn't new. Just last year, we passed the Fair \nand Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, and that Act required \ntruncation of credit card and debit card numbers on receipts given to \ncardholders.\n  As I stand here on the Senate floor, I look at the Presiding Officer, \nmy neighbor from New Hampshire, and I see waiting to speak the other \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire. We come from an area where we \nbelieve in privacy. We live in a country where we are giving up more \nand more of our privacy all the time. We have to be careful. We are \ngiving it up not just in corporate areas but in government. Both \nconservatives and liberals ought to join hands on how much information \nwe are willing to give up on ourselves and allow to go into databanks. \nAn example is what happened with Bank of America, which is one of the \ndumbest things I have ever seen. All of their records were lost. Good \nLord, they send something off or ship it off by plane--not private, but \nthey mail it to a location with backup files of all of their customers. \nI don't know. I suspect maybe their top executives fly by private jets. \nMaybe they don't understand that the three Senators on the floor right \nnow fly commercially, and we know how often you get your bags lost or a \nsuitcase lost. They just lost thousands upon thousands upon thousands \nof files on their customers. How would you like to be a Bank of America \ncustomer and wake up and find out they were so stupid and negligent \nthat they lost all your information? They ought to be ashamed of \nthemselves.\n  But I digress. I mentioned privacy. I have kept an article. It is the \nonly thing I have ever framed that was written about me in one of our \nnewspapers. To put this into context, you have to understand that we \nlive on a dirt road in an old farmhouse. We have an adjoining farm \nfamily who kind of watches over the place when we are not there. The \nreporter in this article drives up on a Saturday with out-of-State \nlicense plates and asks the farmer sitting on the porch, ``Does Senator \nLeahy live up this road?''\n  The farmer said, ``Are you a relative of his?''\n  He said, ``No.''\n  ``Are you a friend of his?''\n  He answered, ``Not really.''\n  ``Is he expecting you?''\n  ``No.''\n  ``Never heard of him.''\n  That is the kind of privacy we like. These people in a cavalier way--\nlike Bank of America and all--are giving information away. We are \nfinding more and more that our own Government is being lax with the \ninformation they have. Of course, the information can often be wrong. \nThe third most senior Member of the Senate has been stopped half a \ndozen times getting on an airplane when going home--something he has \nbeen doing for decades--because he is on a terrorist list. He is one of \nthe most recognizable people in America, and he cannot get off this \nlist. You have to kind of ask, how much are we willing to give up and \nwhat does it do for us? Bank of America didn't do much of anything. \nThese are some of the reforms included in the bill. I hope we will all \nlook at this carefully and work together closely.\n  Requiring truncation of social security numbers is similarly \nreasonable. It provides protection against abuse, but still allows for \nimportant information sharing to take place.\n  These are just some of the reforms that should be included in this \nbill. I hope that all Senators will give fair and thoughtful \nconsideration to amendments proposed on either side of the aisle. When \nthe Senate works productively and constructively, we can\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\nimprove legislation on a bipartisan basis. I have worked with Senator \nGrassley and others to make bipartisan improvements in the past and I \nhope that we can do that again on this bankruptcy reform legislation.\n  In particular, I urge my colleagues to give full consideration to an \namendment Senator Schumer will offer to make sure debts incurred \nthrough violence and other illegal acts at health clinics may not be \ndischarged in bankruptcy. Senator Schumer has been the leader on ending \nthis bankruptcy abuse and I have always been proud to support his \nefforts. Any fair bankruptcy reform measure should end abusive \nbankruptcy filings used to avoid the legal consequences of violence, \nvandalism and obstruction to deny access to legal health services.\n  As we move forward with reforms that are appropriate to eliminate \nabuses in the system, we need to remember the people who use the \nsystem, both the debtor and the creditor. We need to balance the \ninterests of creditors with those of the poor and middle class who need \nthe opportunity to resolve overwhelming financial burdens.\n  These are important subjects that have a real impact on the lives of \nmany people who have already suffered from illnesses or divorce or job \nloss. We should utilize the expertise of our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to ensure that the Senate passes balanced legislation.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Grassley, Senator \nSpecter and the rest of my colleagues to make more bipartisan \nimprovements on the Senate floor to enact balanced bankruptcy reform \nlegislation into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are on the bill, I take it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, it was a pleasure to hear the \npresentation by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking \nmember relative to the bankruptcy bill, which is an extraordinarily \nimportant piece of legislation, which has been to the floor before--in \nfact, too many times. Hopefully, this year we will pass it and send it \nto the President to be signed. I congratulate the Judiciary Committee \nfor bringing it out. Certainly, it is a piece of legislation that is \nvery important to the commerce of our country and needs to be passed.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  I wanted to speak about another subject--specifically, the budget of \nthe United States and the fiscal policy, as we are presently dealing \nwith the funding of the Federal Government. Within the next 3 weeks, \nhopefully, we will take up a budget in committee and here on the floor \nof the Senate. The budget is a blueprint of where we are going as a \ncountry relative to our spending policies and fiscal policies. What is \nimportant to remember is that the budget is just an outline. It doesn't \nget into too much specific detail of how we function as a Government \nbut, rather, it sets goals that we as a Government wish to pursue in \nthe area of policy relative to spending and relative to taxes.\n  What we need to focus on, I believe, this year--and I believe \nCongress did focus on it, and certainly the President did in his \nbudget, which is a very laudable document, and it does focus \nspecifically on these issues--there are two things: the deficit, as we \nconfront as a Nation the short-term liabilities, and what we confront \nin the long-term.\n  The deficit in the short term is having an unfortunate impact on our \ncountry. It arises for a lot of reasons. I argue that it arises for two \nprimary reasons. First is that in the mid and late 1990s, we started to \nrun very significant surpluses in this Nation as a result of an \neconomic boom known as the Internet bubble--a bubble that is an \naberration on the economic landscape. There have been other major \nbubbles in our history. It is basically when people have created \nartificial money. The Internet bubble was probably the largest bubble \nin the history of the world. In many instances, it was an artificial \nexpansion of the economy relative to real productivity and growth. That \nbubble collapsed, as they do. As a result of that collapse, the economy \nslowed dramatically, and the revenues to the Federal Government dropped \nsignificantly.\n  The second major cause, obviously, of the deficits we confront today, \nin my opinion, was the fact that we were attacked on 9/11. We are at \nwar, and as a nation we must fight that war with every tool we have \navailable, and that means fully arming and manning our soldiers. Also, \nit means regearing ourselves as a nation, retooling as a nation. We \nhave had to make what I would call significant investments in our \nnational security, both in the homeland area, bringing first responders \nup to speed, in the area of protecting ourselves from biological, \nchemical, or potentially nuclear attacks, and in the area, obviously, \nof rearming and retooling our military and our intelligence community \nacross the country and the globe. It has been extremely expensive for \nus as a nation, but it is money we must spend because we have been \nattacked, we are at war.\n\n  There are people who wish to do us harm in the most heinous way. They \nwant to kill Americans simply because they are Americans. They wish to \ndestroy our culture and Nation because they don't like our freedoms, \nthey don't like the fact that we are prosperous. Those people are still \nout there, and they must be found and brought to justice, and, most \nimportantly, kept from attacking us here in America. That is a \ncommitment we have made as a nation, and this President has pursued \nthat with a focus.\n  So we went through a period of significant surpluses in the late \n1990s to a period of deficit. That deficit has been rather large. We \nare now as a nation trying to address that fact. The deficit in the \nshort term is having deleterious effect on our Nation. It is obviously \ncausing us to pass on to our children the debts for the operation of \ntoday's Government. You are basically borrowing from the future, and \nthe people who are going to have to pay that are your children, not \nyou, because that note becomes due not in your lifetime--well, maybe in \nyour lifetime--but 10, 15 years from now. Who has to pay it? The people \nwho work 10, 15 years from now, in their taxes. They have less money to \nkeep because they have to pay more taxes. So we are borrowing from our \nchildren's future to pay for this deficit.\n  Second, it is having an impact on our economy internationally. The \ndollar is weakened in large part because the international community \nlooks at our deficit and says we are not doing a heck of a lot about \nit.\n  So we need to address the short-term deficit, and I will get to the \nspecifics of that, how we have done that. But the President's budget \nhas attempted to do that. That is an important public policy issue.\n  The second largest public policy issue we have is the question of how \nwe deal with the long-term liabilities of our country, liabilities that \nalready exist. What does that mean?\n  We have basically put in place today a large number of Federal \nprograms that we have to pay for today because these programs survive \nfor as far as the eye can see--infinity. We know they are going to cost \nmoney. Most of these programs--the most expensive ones, called \nentitlements--deal with making sure that people who are retired have a \ndecent lifestyle. This has been a great benefit to our Nation--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid. These programs have truly improved the \nquality of life of the American population, especially those who are \nretired. But as we look into the future, we see huge and very \ncomplicated and difficult problems for us as a country as we try to \nmaintain those programs and make sure that people who are retired have \na decent lifestyle.\n  What is driving this major concern, this huge cost which we are going \nto face as a nation, is a fact which has never existed before in our \nhistory. It is called demographics. After World War II, the largest \nexpansion ever in our population occurred. More children were born \nduring a period from about 1946 to about 1955 than at any other period \nin American history. It is called the baby boom generation.\n  That generation was so large--and I happen to be a member of it--that \nit totally restructured every lifestyle event it impacted. As children, \nthat generation caused a massive expansion in schools. As college \nstudents, that generation created the huge social concern of the \nsixties, in the area of rights\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nof African Americans and minorities and the rights of women and, of \ncourse, with regard to the issue of how Vietnam was fought. In the \nseventies and eighties, as that generation went into the workplace, it \nbecame the most productive engine of economic wealth this country had \never seen and continues to be a producer of economic wealth.\n  Now that generation is headed toward retirement, and we know, because \neveryone is alive today, that generation will be the largest retired \ngeneration in the history of our country. We know the benefits \nstructure which we have put in place to help senior citizens through \nretirement so they can live a decent lifestyle is also in place. When \nthose two merge--this huge generation and that benefits structure \ncalled Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--it is going to put \ndramatic demands on our society in the area of costs to pay for the \nbenefits which are in place.\n  Think of it this way: Almost all the retirement programs we have--\nSocial Security and Medicare especially--were designed with the genius \nof Franklin Roosevelt. His policy essentially said there will always be \nmany more people working than those retired. So the working Americans \ncan always support the retired Americans.\n  It was always perceived there would be a pyramid. In fact, in 1950, \nthere were about 16 Americans working for every 1 American retired. \nThat meant programs such as Social Security and Medicare not only \ngenerated money to support those who were retired, they actually \ngenerated more money than needed to support the people who retired. \nThat is happening today even. But the number of people retiring \ncompared to the number of people working has been changing. It has gone \nfrom 16 in 1950 down to about 3\\1/2\\ today. And further into this \ncentury, as the baby boom generation retires, it will drop to 2 people \nworking for every 1 person retired.\n  There is where the problem is. We go from a pyramid to essentially a \nrectangle. It becomes pretty obvious, if you only have two people \nworking to pay for one person retired, those two people are going to \nhave to pay a lot more in taxes to support that one person retired than \nif we have 10 people working or 3\\1/2\\ people working, as we have \ntoday.\n  So this creates a huge what is called unfunded liability, contingent \nliability. We do not know how we are going to pay for this in the \noutyears. We do know the problem is going to exist, but we do not know \nhow we are going to pay for it.\n  I want to give you some context of this problem because it is so \nmassive, and we should be so concerned about it.\n  Entitlements--which basically is what I am talking about, which is \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--represent this orange bar on \nthis chart as a percentage of Federal spending. One will see today that \norange bar is approximately 56 percent of the Federal Government, with \ndefense spending being about 18 percent of the Federal Government, \nnondefense spending about 18 percent of the Federal Government, and \ninterest on the Federal debt being about 7 percent.\n\n  When the baby boom generation is headed to full retirement, beginning \nabout the year 2015--actually, it starts in the year 2008--there is an \nexplosion in the entitlement spending as a percentage of Federal \nspending. Defense spending does not change much, discretionary spending \ndoes not change much, but retirement spending jumps to 64 percent of \nthe Federal Government. In fact, if it continues on its present track, \nspending to support Social Security will create this massive problem \nfor us as a nation, which I have alluded to, which is we will have so \nmany programmatic demands placed on the younger working Americans that \ntheir taxes will have to go up radically in order to pay for this.\n  This chart shows it pretty clearly. The historic spending levels of \nthe Federal Government since the year 1960 have been right around 20 \npercent. That is historic spending. That is all Federal spending in the \npost-World War II period. But entitlement spending as a percentage of \ngross national product has always been--or up until now--fairly flat--\nnot flat, going up, but still staying within the 5 to 10-percent range.\n  However, beginning in the year 2008, it starts to climb \nprecipitously. By the year 2030, Medicare and Social Security spending \nwill be 20 percent of the gross national product. By the year 2040, it \nwill exceed that and be 25 percent of the gross national product. We \nwill essentially be spending more on those two programs alone within a \nfew years, about a decade and a half to two decades, than we spend \ntoday on the entire Federal Government.\n  What does that mean? It means either at that point you do not have \nany part of the Federal Government--you do not have national defense, \nyou do not have any education programs, you do not have any \nenvironmental programs--or you have to jump the tax rates dramatically \nto pay for Social Security and Medicare expenditures.\n  What is the implication of this other than we are headed toward clear \nfiscal disaster? One of the implications is if this graph were carried \nout to its logical conclusion, the tax rate on working Americans--my \nchildren, your children, and our grandchildren--will have to be doubled \nto support the system.\n  Another implication is that there is, according to the Comptroller \nGeneral, approximately $44 trillion of potential liability over the \nnatural lifetime of Social Security, which is deemed to be 75 years, or \nMedicare. Mr. President, $44 trillion--that is trillion, and I do not \neven know what a trillion is, but that is what it is--$44 trillion of \ncosts which we have no idea how we are going to pay. We have no idea at \nall. It is called unfunded liabilities, $44 trillion.\n  To try to put this in perspective: If you take all the taxes paid \ninto the Federal Government since the beginning of America, all the \ntaxes paid into the Federal Government in U.S. history, that represents \n$38 trillion. We are talking about a liability that exceeds that \nnumber. We are talking about a liability that would actually be about \nthe same as the present value net worth. That is the present value \nnumber, by the way. It means it is discounted to today's dollar, which \nactually would be almost the same as the present net worth of every \nAmerican.\n\n  The present net worth of every American is about $47 trillion. The \npresent liability of just the Medicare and Social Security funds--with \nnot even Medicaid included in this--is $44 trillion. So essentially we \nwould have to use every dollar of every American, every asset of every \nAmerican to pay this.\n  We can see the problem is astronomical, so large, in fact, that many \nare burying their heads on the issue and saying it does not exist, \nwhich is a very unique approach to the problem. Obviously, we are not \ngoing to solve it this year or in the next couple of weeks. But what we \ncan do in the next couple of weeks as we address the budget is try to \nstart addressing these two major issues. One is the short-term deficit; \nthe other is this long-term, looming problem which we confront as a \nnation. And that brings us back to the budget process and why it is \nimportant.\n  It is important because it is the blueprint off which we can begin \nthis process of addressing these huge public policy issues. If we do \nnot address them now, it is like that old television ad, you can pay me \nnow or you can pay me later. When you pay later, the cost is going to \nbe basically unacceptable because if we wait until 2008 or 2015 to \nstart addressing these issues, we are essentially going to have to do \nsomething extraordinarily precipitous. We are either going to have to \nradically cut the benefits of seniors who are retired or we are going \nto have to radically increase the taxes on our children and their \nchildren's children, meaning their quality of life is going to be \nreduced significantly.\n  The President sent up a budget which begins the process of trying to \naddress some of these core issues. On the first issue of the deficit, \nhe has proposed a budget which reduces in half the deficit over the \nnext few years. You can see he takes it from about 4.5 percent of GDP, \nthe deficit. That is what we need to look at because the actual numbers \ndo not relate to what their effect is on the economy.\n  The deficit was projected to be about 4.5 percent of gross domestic \nproduct back in 2004, down to approximately 1.3 percent of gross \ndomestic product in 2009, 1.5 percent in 2009, 1.7 percent in 2008, or \nhe reduces it in half. I would be the first to say that in that \nestimate,\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\nespecially the 2008 number, there is no accounting for the war. The war \nis a one-time item, hopefully, or two-time item. We do not expect the \nwar to go on forever. In fact, by 2008, we hope the war to be over \nrelative to Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not be built into the base, \nand we expect it will not be.\n  These numbers may be inaccurate in that they may be off in not \naccounting for the war. But the point is, when you go from 4.5 percent \nto 1.7 percent, that should still be able to be accomplished whether we \nare at war, with accounting for the war correctly. We can reduce this \ndeficit, and the President has proposed this.\n  How has he proposed it? He proposed to do it in a series of ways, but \nthere is a consistency within his proposal, which is this: Basically, \nhe said we have to get fiscal discipline in place. We have to be \nresponsible for how much money we spend, and in order to accomplish \nthat, we are going to have to reduce the rate of growth--we never \nactually cut spending--reduce the rate of growth of Federal spending \nright across the board.\n\n  So he has essentially proposed goring everybody's ox, and maybe that \nis the way we have to approach something like this. He suggests we \nfreeze nondiscretionary defense spending, which is going to be \ndifficult, but it is something we have to do. He suggests the defense \ncore budget not rise as fast as it is projected to rise. We are already \nhearing discussions from many of the defense subcontractors and \ncontractors around the city that they cannot live with that number. So \nI guess it must be stepping on some toes out there.\n  He is suggesting in the entitlement accounts--and this is the most \nimportant--that we begin to reduce the rate of growth; not cut them but \nreduce their rate of growth. That is a courageous step but a step that \nhas to be taken.\n  The only accounting he did not address, quite honestly, was Medicare \nbecause of his recent enactment of the Medicare reform bill which I \nguess they would like to play out a little while before they move into \nthat account. Everybody else has been impacted. He has put in place and \nsuggested a series of enforcement mechanisms which will allow us to \naccomplish this type of a budget, and we intend to put in even more to \naccomplish this because the numbers mean nothing if they are not \nenforceable.\n  As we move forward in this debate--I see the Senator from Utah is \nhere. He wished to speak at 3 o'clock, and I have gone past my time. I \nwill come back to the topic again and talk a little bit about the tax \nside of this. As we move forward in this debate, it is critical we \nunderstand that we are facing these two huge public policy issues: the \nneed to bring under control the short-term deficit but even more \nimportantly the need to address the long-term entitlement reform \nquestion.\n\n  I should mention on that point that not only did he address the \nentitlements, such as Medicaid and some others within the budget, but \nhe has set forth a proposal to address Social Security. That is a \ncourageous act, and that, of course, is one of the key components of \nany sort of major entitlement reform. We must address the issue of \nSocial Security.\n  The President has stepped up to the plate, so to speak, to move \nforward with a plan which will put in place fiscal discipline. As the \nSenate moves forward, it is our responsibility to pursue this course \nalso, to put in place a budget which is fiscally responsible and which \naddresses not only the discretionary side of the ledger but the \nentitlement side of the ledger. That is going to be our challenge. It \nis very doable. All it takes is a willingness to stand up and recognize \nthat if we do not do it, we will be passing on to our children a nation \nwhich does not guarantee them as high a quality of life as we have had \nbecause of the burden of taxation which we will be placing on them.\n  It is our responsibility to move forward in this area, and I look \nforward to the next few weeks as an opportunity to debate and discuss \nthese proposals even further.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask that my remarks be as in morning \nbusiness.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n            boy scouts of america land transfer act of 2005\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica Land Transfer Act of 2005. This important legislation will \nallow the exchange of two small parcels of land between the Utah \nNational Parks Council of the Boy Scouts of America and Brian Head Ski \nResort.\n  In a 1983 land patent, the Bureau of Land Management granted roughly \n1,300 acres to the Utah National Parks Council of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica to be used as a Boy Scout camp. The Scout camp, known as Camp \nThunder Ridge, is situated in the mountains adjacent to Brian Head Ski \nResort and near Cedar Breaks National Monument.\n  At the time the land patent was granted, a local rancher owned a \nparcel of land adjacent to the camp and another parcel right in the \nmiddle of the camp. Several years ago, the rancher gave those lands to \nBrian Head Ski Resort. The Scouts need to obtain the land, totaling 120 \nacres, from Brian Head. However, under the patent, land cannot be sold \nor exchanged without an act of Congress.\n  While Camp Thunder Ridge is located in a steep, rough, mountainous \narea, much of the land the Boy Scouts seek is flat, making it \nparticularly important for the camp. Obtaining the land would make it \npossible for the Scouts to make the camp's shooting area and archery \nrange safer and would allow them to improve and expand their camping \nfacilities. It also would allow for the installation of much-needed \nseptic tanks.\n  I am a strong supporter of the Boy Scouts of America. The Boy Scouts \nhave a long tradition of instilling strong values in young men.\n  Scout camps such as Camp Thunder Ridge give young men the opportunity \nto learn vital skills, fulfil merit badge requirements, and otherwise \nimprove themselves. This small land exchange will allow Camp Thunder \nRidge to more fully help these young men learn and grow.\n  For their part, Brian Head Ski Resort is seeking to expand their \noperations and have received preliminary approval from local officials. \nThe local planning commission, however, has required them to build an \nemergency exit from their property. The only place to build such a road \nis through land owned by the Boy Scouts. The exchange will allow Brian \nHead to construct the access road and comply with county fire safety \nregulations.\n  The Boy Scouts have been working for more than 20 years to secure the \nlands in question, and Brian Head needs to build a road on lands \ncurrently owned by the Scouts. This exchange is desperately needed by \nboth parties, and I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 256, the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The purpose of \nthis bill is to make our bankruptcy system more fair and efficient. \nEvery citizen has a stake in this bill. It is obvious that bankruptcy \nfilers have a lot at stake in this legislation.\n  In recent years, the number of bankruptcies has been on the rise, and \nI understand that today more bankruptcies are filed every year than \nduring the entire decade of the Great Depression, and this chart shows \nthat. It begins in the year 1900. It is basically a flat line until we \nget to about 1984--actually, 1995--and then it heads straight up. These \nare bankruptcy filings per 100,000 population, and they have gone up \ndramatically over the years. Annual bankruptcy filings have now reached \nabout 1.6 million Americans, and this is up significantly since the \ntime we started working on the overhaul of the bankruptcy system now 8 \nyears ago.\n  One of the key goals of legislation we have before us today is to \nmake sure the system is not abused by the unscrupulous who leave their \ncreditors high and dry. At the same time, the concept of allowing those \ncitizens who have become saddled by debt to use bankruptcy to get a \nfresh start is firmly entrenched in the American legal system. Gone are \nthe days of debtor prisons.\n  We want to treat debtors fairly and give those who become overwhelmed \nby debt a second chance. We do not want\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\nto send a signal to those who for whatever reason get into a financial \nhole that it is okay to go deeper in that hole prior to filing for and \nbecome absolved by bankruptcy. We want to give those in debt a fair \nsecond chance to bring their fiscal houses in order.\n  We also want to treat creditors fairly. At the end of the day, it is \nlaw-abiding, bill-paying citizens who pay for the bankruptcy of others, \nregardless of whether the debts involved were taken on by con men or \nthose whose situations simply got out of hand.\n  As this debate goes forward, it is important for all to understand \nthat according to some experts, a conservative estimate is that every \nAmerican family pays about $400 a year in a hidden tax associated with \nbankruptcies, taxes they should not have to pay. I am told that others \nplace the fair estimate of this hidden bankruptcy tax in the range of \n$550 per person per year. There are numerous examples of people who \ntake advantage of loopholes today at the expense of everyone else \ntomorrow.\n  We recently heard from a Wisconsin credit union president who \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee about a young couple who \nwanted a clean financial slate before they got married. What did they \ndo? They ran up their credit card purchases. One of them prepaid a car \nloan with the credit union to have the other cosigner released. Then, \nalthough they were both employed full-time, they filed for bankruptcy \nto wipe out their debt. Their credit union and its members had to \nabsorb the $3,000 in credit card debt and then another couple of \nhundred dollars on the car itself. Bankruptcy relief was never meant to \nallow this kind of abuse. Hard-working Americans, including the members \nof credit unions nationwide, have been victimized by abusers of the \ncurrent bankruptcy system long enough.\n  Bankruptcy abuse also hurts our Nation's small businesses. Without \nreforms from this bill, losses from bankruptcy abuse will continue to \nbreak the backs of the Nation's small businesses and retailers, which \nwork with slim profit margins and have even smaller margins for error.\n\n  Throughout this debate, I want those who pay their bills in full and \non time to understand that our attempt to rebalance some of the aspects \nof the bankruptcy system will have a positive impact on their \npocketbooks each time they go to the store. In effect, we all pay for \nthe bankruptcies of others through this ``hidden tax.'' In some \nrespects, I suppose one could view this bill as a tax cut for the \nresponsible people.\n  While one large impact of bankruptcy is felt in the wallet, perhaps \nthe most important principle involved in this is when one borrows \nmoney, they need to take personal responsibility to pay it back. \nPersonal responsibility is a core American value. This legislation, \nwhich has been crafted over years of debate and compromise, reflects \nthat basic value.\n  We are mindful of the old adage there is no such thing as a free \nlunch. When some people do not pay their credit card bills, the rest of \nus pay for them in the form of increased prices. We do not get off. We \nhave to pay for it. Great strain is placed on businesses, particularly \nsmall businesses, when customers do not pay for their purchases.\n  While we want to be fair to those who are in serious debt, we must \nalso be mindful that sometimes it is employees and their families who \nhave to pay through lost salary increases or even pay cuts or job loss \nwhen some do not pay their bills. No firm can expand or even maintain \nits operations or stay in business for long if a substantial portion of \ngoods and services it sells is not paid for by its customers. We all \nsimply have a stake in bankruptcy policy and, therefore, we all have a \nstake in this bill.\n  Unfortunately, our current system allows certain people with the \nability to repay at least some of their debt load to take advantage of \nthe system at the expense of everyone else. Today, individuals with \nrelatively high incomes can run up substantial debts and then too \neasily use bankruptcy to get out of honoring them. In the end, all of \nus pay for those who abuse the system.\n  As I will describe, one of the key improvements made by this bill is \nto devise a new and equitable system to see that those who declare \nbankruptcy will be called upon to repay a fair portion of their past \ndebts with future earnings if they are able to do so. This is the so-\ncalled means test that I will describe in a few minutes.\n  First, I will take a few minutes to highlight some of the key \nproconsumer provisions of this bill. S. 256, the Bankruptcy Abuse \nPrevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, includes a debtor's \nbill of rights with new consumer protections to prevent the bankruptcy \nmills from preying upon those who are uninformed of their legal rights \nand needlessly pushing them into bankruptcy. This is an important \nimprovement over current law and helps rectify the current practice \nwhereby some, both debtors and creditors alike, lose out in the long \nrun to some shady legal advisers who take their fees and run.\n  The bill also includes new consumer protections under the Truth in \nLending Act, such as new required disclosures regarding minimum monthly \npayments and introductory rates for credit cards. It protects consumers \nfrom unscrupulous creditors with new penalties on creditors who refuse \nto negotiate reasonable payment schedules outside of bankruptcy.\n\n  Our bill provides penalties on creditors who fail to properly credit \nplanned payments in bankruptcy. It includes credit counseling programs \nto help people avoid the cycle of indebtedness. This is an important \nprovision for consumers.\n  Except for those with evil motivations and a willingness to take \nadvantage of the system, no one likes to be in debt. This bill helps \nconsumers learn how to better protect their financial resources. S. 256 \nprovides for a protection of educational savings accounts, and it gives \nequal protection for retirement accounts or retirement savings in \nbankruptcy. These provisions will help our children and our parents \nhave adequate resources.\n  The bankruptcy legislation also contains important changes in current \nlaw that will benefit women and children. We have heard some people \ncomplain that our bankruptcy laws do not adequately take care of women \nand children. Through our years of work on this bill, we have tried to \nmake the law more protective in these areas, and this bill accomplishes \nthat goal.\n  Current law provides that child support obligations are seventh in \noverall priority among unsecured claims. This bill dramatically changes \nthe world with respect to child support. This bill contains a large set \nof provisions addressing the treatment of child support, including \nmaking domestic support obligations first in priority after certain \nrequired expenditures.\n  I will repeat that for emphasis. Child support goes from seventh to \nfirst in priority within its category for repayment under this bill. \nFrom seventh in line to top priority, this is a big change. \nUnfortunately, those who have slow walked this bill for the last 8 \nyears have prevented this important change from taking effect.\n  The legislation also includes a provision that makes staying current \non child support a condition of getting a discharge in bankruptcy. It \nmakes debt discharge in bankruptcy conditional upon full payment of \npast due child support and alimony. S. 256 makes domestic support \nobligations automatically nondischargeable without the costs of \nlitigation. It prevents bankruptcy from holding up child custody, \nvisitation, and domestic violation cases. It helps eliminate \nadministrative roadblocks in the current system so children can get the \nsupport they need. All of these measures are valuable additions and \nchanges in the bankruptcy laws.\n  It is in the best interests of women and children to pass this bill. \nIt is a tremendous improvement for children and families over current \nlaw. That is why there is such overwhelming support for this \nlegislation from the child support professionals across the country--\nthe very people who go after deadbeats to help get children the \nfinancial support they need.\n  That is not all. Let me cite a few more improvements over current law \nfor women and children.\n  The bill makes the payment of child support arrears a condition of \nplan confirmation. It provides stronger and more comprehensive notice \nrequirements and more information for easier child support collection. \nIt provides help in tracking down deadbeats.\n  It allows for claims against a deadbeat parent's property. It allows \nfor\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\npayment of child support with interest by those with means. It \nfacilitates wage withholding to collect child support from deadbeat \nparents.\n  As I have just described, there are many important provisions in this \nbill for children, women, and the aged. I hope that we can finally get \nthis bill to the President's desk for signature. This is a bill that is \nway overdue.\n  This legislation, S. 256, also requires extensive new disclosure \nrequirements by creditors in the area of reaffirmations and more \njudicial oversight of reaffirmations to protect people from being \npressured into agreements against their interests.\n  These are important provisions. Let me explain why.\n  Reaffirmation agreements commonly occur in conjunction with \nbankruptcy proceedings when debtors agree to repay a debt they would \nnot otherwise have to pay. These reaffirmation agreements can be very \nhelpful to debtors as they seek to reestablish their good financial \nstatus with their creditors as they emerge from bankruptcy.\n  By increasing disclosure requirements and judicial oversight, the \nreaffirmation process can operate to the advantage of debtor and \ncreditor alike.\n  Next, I would like to briefly describe one of the key features of the \nbill, the means test, and how it relates to, and will improve, the \noverall operation of our bankruptcy system.\n  The premise behind the means test is that those who are able to pay \nall, or some, of their past debts should do so. The means test helps \nthe courts determine who can and who can not repay their debts and, \nperhaps most importantly, how much they can afford to pay.\n  The challenge is to set this figure at the right level, neither too \nhigh nor too low.\n  If the figure is set too high, the debtor may be placed in a vicious \ncycle from which he or she can never escape and get a fair chance to \nstart over. Of course, if the repayment schedule is set too low, the \ndebtors will escape responsibility at the expense of those who they \nowe.\n  Through this new means test, in certain circumstances, the bill \nrequires those filing for bankruptcy to pay a fair but not overly \nburdensome portion of their future earnings.\n  The means test allows for a straight deduction of actual expenses for \nthe care and support of an elderly, chronically ill, or disabled \nhousehold member, or member of the debtor's immediate family.\n  This test allows for a straight deduction for food and clothing \nexpenses.\n  This test allows for up to $1,500 to be deducted per child for \neducational purposes.\n  This test includes an allowance for housing and utilities costs.\n  This test includes all the categories enumerated under the National \nStandards, Local Standards and Other National Expenses issued by the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  This test allows for the straight deduction of expenses incurred in \nmaintaining the safety of the debtor and the family of the debtor from \nfamily violence.\n  This test includes a special circumstances safety valve that allows \ndebtors to adjust their income or expenditures based on unforeseen \ncircumstances such as military activation and deployment or unexpected \nand catastrophic medical conditions.\n  Finally, this test includes a safe harbor provision which exempts \ndebtors below their respective State median incomes.\n  After all of these exemptions are applied, including the safe harbor, \nit is estimated that 90 percent of debtors will not be affected by the \nchanges in the repayment provisions of this bill.\n  Who constitutes the remaining 10 percent? They are the people who can \nafford to pay at least some of their debts. And that is what the means \ntest is all about.\n  All of these changes that I have described are important. Many of us \nhave worked for many years on this bill. Frankly, some of us think this \nbill has already taken way too many years to complete.\n  I want to take a few minutes describing the extensive legislative \nhistory of the bill. This is important for many reasons. One of those \nreasons is that this history will reveal that this measure has already \nbeen fully debated and this bill reflects literally dozens and dozens \nof compromises along its 8-year journey.\n  I will describe the nadir of this bill when President Clinton pocket \nvetoed the legislation after Congress adjourned in the fall of 2000.\n  This bill has had broad bipartisan support from the very beginning.\n  In the Senate, Senators Grassley and Biden have been at this for a \nlong time, as have many others on both sides of the aisle.\n  When we debate amendments over the next few days, I want my \ncolleagues to pay close attention to those who are offering amendments.\n  If what occurred at the Judiciary Committee mark-up of the bill \nrepeats itself on the floor, it might be the case that many amendments \nwill be offered by that relatively small group of Senators who have \nsteadfastly opposed this bill each step of the way during the last 8 \nyears. If that is the case, we must examine their amendments with both \nexacting scrutiny and heavy skepticism.\n  It is one thing to attempt to improve a bill and bring it more to \nyour liking, it is another matter altogether to try to scuttle a bill. \nThis can be a fine line on any bill. But with a bill with the extensive \nhistory as this, it is easier to assess who is trying to get this bill \nover the goal line finally and who is trying to push us out of bounds \nand into yet another period of legislative overtime.\n  The House and Senate have been engaged in the process of deliberating \non this issue since 1997, back during the 105th Congress. Turning back \nthe clock to 1997, we see that the comprehensive bankruptcy reform bill \nwas developed and passed in both bodies by overwhelming votes. The \nactual substance of bankruptcy reform legislation has been a \nbipartisan, bicameral effort.\n  The successful work by each chamber of Congress in 1997 was followed \nby the appointment of conferees, negotiations with the House, and, in \nOctober of 1998, an overwhelming vote by House Members in favor of the \nconference report. Unfortunately, the Senate did not complete its vote \non final passage before the end of the Congress.\n  Next, in February of 1999, Congressman Gekas and Senator Grassley \nreintroduced the same bankruptcy bill agreed to by both bodies during \nthe previous conference committee. That bill passed the House in May by \nan overwhelming margin. Later that same month, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee marked up our bill and we reported it from committee.\n  Finally, in February of 2000, after months of procedural delays and \ndebate on the Senate floor, the reform legislation passed by another \nimpressive margin of 83 to 14.\n  I suspect this body will approve this bill by a similar lopsided \nmargin when a vote on final passage is taken in this Congress if we can \nget to a vote on final passage. There are some who have indicated they \nare going to filibuster this bill. We will have to see. But there have \nbeen far too many people, on both sides of the aisle, who promised they \nwould work to get this bill through, and they should fight against any \nfilibuster.\n  Turning back to the year 2000 after the bipartisan 83-14 vote, the \nSenate then requested a conference. This should be a routine matter, \nbut the objection of a single Senator blocked the appointment of \nconferees. As a result, the House and Senate had to turn to an informal \nconference process.\n  With a great deal of effort by Members on both sides of the aisle, we \nreached a compromise agreement on over 400 pages of legislation.\n  Ultimately, both the House and Senate were able to pass that \nconference report in another series of decisive votes in the fall of \n2000.\n  However, President Clinton chose to pocket-veto the legislation and \n(refused to sign it into law, despite the overwhelming support. Once \nagain, the stone pushed by Sisyphus was at the bottom of the mountain.\n  Representative Gekas introduced the bill, yet again, in January of \n2001. The conference report for that bill, H.R. 333, became the \nbackbone of the legislation pending before us today. It too, had \noverwhelming support, except for what is now understood to be a poison-\npill amendment.\n  I will not take the time today to discuss just how this important \ncomprehensive change in the bankruptcy bill got waylaid in the eleventh \nhour\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\nby this problematical and, many believe, perhaps mostly hypothetical \nand politically motivated, provision.\n  We all know that this bill has repeatedly won the overwhelming \napproval of our colleagues in both Houses of Congress.\n  Before we began a conference meeting on an earlier version a few \nyears ago I referred to that meeting as being the last leg of a \nlegislative marathon. I was wrong then--but I hope, and I have every \nconfidence, that this floor debate represents the final beginning of \nthat last leg.\n  We succeeded in finally enacting the class action reform bill 2 weeks \nago and I am hopeful that we can duplicate this success with the \nbankruptcy bill over the next several days.\n  As many have said, this is a compromise bill that enjoys broad \nbipartisan support among Democrats and Republicans, and conservatives \nand liberals.\n  Even after having worked for 8 years already, we agreed to make some \nadditional compromises in the Judiciary Committee during mark-up 2 \nweeks ago to satisfy some concerns of our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. Those compromises were difficult to make, but we have \nmade them.\n  I should add that there are some on our side of the aisle, such as \nSenator Cornyn, who would like to make additional changes in this bill. \nHe has a very substantial proposal addressing the issue of venue \nreform. It is an area in which he has special expertise from his \nexperiences with some important bankruptcies that affected many \ncitizens of Texas but were litigated out of State.\n  There are things I would like to see changed in the bill.\n  But I also recognize that many have cooperated and compromised in \norder to reach the state where this legislation is today. Given the \nextensive and lengthy history of this bill, I think it best for my \ncolleagues to refrain from offering controversial amendments on this \nvehicle at this time--and I will do so because I know that any further \namendments might scuttle this bill.\n  This bill provides new consumer protections, helps children in need \nof child support, and makes other necessary reforms to a system that is \nopen to abuse.\n  I want to stress the fact that this legislation does not make it more \ndifficult for people to file for bankruptcy, but it does eliminate some \nof the opportunities for abuse that exist under the current system.\n  This is a good bill. We should pass it promptly and send it to the \nHouse.\n  It is possible that during this debate that some may falsely suggest \nthat this bill unfairly treats low-income persons. Let me tell you at \nthe outset that the poor are not affected by the means test. The \nlegislation provides a safe harbor for those who fall below the median \nincome, so they are not subjected to the means test at all. What the \nmeans test is designed to do, and what it will do, is to prevent abuse \nby those who can and should pay a portion of their debts wit future \nearnings. It will stop the fraud. It will stop the abuse of a system \nthat has been going on through some of these unscrupulous lawyers and \nbankruptcy helpers.\n  Another misconception that I have heard again and again from \nopponents of the bill is that this legislation will not let people file \nfor bankruptcy relief when they need it. The fact is that this \nlegislation does not deny anyone access to bankruptcy relief, it just \nrequires those who have the means to repay their debts based on their \nincome and ability to pay.\n  It is that simple. It is fair. It is a long overdue change for the \nbetter.\n  Some opponents of this legislation have also claimed that it somehow \nhurts women and children. This falsehood is particularly disturbing for \nme to hear, because I have had a long history of advocating for \nchildren and families in Congress, and I have worked tirelessly, \nprovision by provision, to make this legislation dramatically improve \nthe position of children and ex-spouses who are entitled to domestic \nsupport. I have already told you in some detail why these allegations \nare baseless and how this bill works to help women and children.\n  I look forward to participating in this debate.\n  This is a very good bill.\n  It represents years of bipartisan, bicameral work. It is time we pass \nthis bill. This President will sign this bill.\n  I hope that we will not get sidetracked by nonrelevant or \ncounterproductive, controversial amendments on a consensus bill that \nhas been so long in the making.\n  I hope there will not be any frivolous amendments or amendments \ndesigned to kill the bill or message amendments trying to make \npolitical points rather than solve the problems we have regarding \nbankruptcy.\n  Let us pass this bill for the fourth and final time and get on to \nother business.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 256, the Bankruptcy Abuse \nPrevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just before we went into recess on February \n17, the distinguished majority leader introduced, and the Senate passed \nby unanimous consent, a resolution commending the public life of our \ndear former colleague, Senator Howard Baker. I did not have the \nopportunity to speak to this resolution then, and I wish to add a few \nwords today.\n  I commend the current majority leader for taking a few moments from \nour busy Senate schedule that Friday to introduce and pass a resolution \ncommending a former majority leader, my former colleague and dear \nfriend, Howard Baker, for his lifetime of public service. All of us who \nknow Ambassador Baker, or have had the great pleasure of serving under \nhim, on either side of the aisle, will see this as certainly the least \ncontroversial act this Senate will pass this year.\n  I have known Howard Baker my entire Senate career--there are very few \nhere who came to this body before Senator Baker did, back in 1966. And \nto know Howard Baker is to know consummate Southern grace and manners, \nto know a man who it is almost as much a pleasure to disagree with as \nit is to agree with. In my many years serving with Senator Baker, and \nunder him, as my Republican Leader, when I first arrived, and as the \nmajority leader, during the first 6 years of the Reagan administration, \nI had a few occasions where we stood on different sides of an issue, \nbut many more where we did the people's business side-by-side. Our \ncause was always stronger when we had the intelligence and perseverance \nof Howard Baker on our side, and, on the few occasions where we did \ndisagree, my arguments always had to be stronger because of the \nscrutiny and deliberation of my colleague's same intelligence and \nperseverance.\n  Majority Leader Baker did such a superb job during the first 6 years \nof the Reagan administration that President Reagan wisely chose him as \nhis Chief of Staff for the last, often difficult, 2 years of his \nadministration. It was a wise choice.\n  A few years later, Howard Baker made his own very wise choice. After \nbeing widowed, he married another one of our most distinguished \ncolleagues, former Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum. I can honestly say \nthat I have never seen a better collaboration between two Senators I \nhold in the highest regard.\n  As we all know, our distinguished former colleague's service to the \nNation was not over yet. He served our Nation with great distinction in \none of the most important ambassadorial positions we have, the United \nStates Ambassador to Japan.\n  Mr. President, when they teach civics in our primary and secondary \nschools\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\ntoday, the textbook writers would be wise to have a lesson on the \ncareer of Howard Baker. His character and example, and the policies he \nadvanced, would be admired by all who, unlike some of us, have not had \nthe opportunity to know this man in person. The textbook writers should \nwait a while longer, however, as I hope and expect that Howard Baker's \nlife of public service continues, for the good of the Nation and the \ngood of all of us. I heartily co-sponsor this resolution and offer my \nwarmest congratulations to former Senator Baker, and his wife, former \nSenator Kassebaum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/28/senate-section/article/S1789-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1789-S1791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is especially appropriate that this \nyear the theme of African-American History Month should be the Niagara \nMovement, for 100 years ago, in July 1905, the Niagara Movement \nconvened for the first time. It brought together a distinguished group \nof twenty-nine thinkers, writers, educators, attorneys, ministers and \nbusinessmen in the African-American community; among them was the \nReverend George Freeman Bragg, for many years the pastor of St. James' \nEpiscopal Church in Baltimore and the author of Men of Maryland, a \nhistory of African Americans in Maryland from the earliest days of the \ncolony. Although the participants were scheduled to meet in Buffalo \nthey were unable to find hotel accommodations in that city, and as a \nconsequence they moved to Fort Erie, on the Canadian side of the Falls.\n  The Niagara Movement symbolized a ``mighty current'' of protest \nagainst all the disabilities and indignities of second-class \ncitizenship to which African-Americans were subjected. It rejected the \npernicious ``separate but equal'' doctrine set out 9 years earlier by \nthe Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson, and all the political, social \nand economic consequences of that decision. The prospect that African-\nAmerican citizens of this Nation would at last be guaranteed all the \nrights and protections of the Constitution had already begun to fade \nwith the end of Reconstruction, in 1876, and Plessy seemed to affirm \nthat although African-Americans might no longer be enslaved, they \nshould never aspire to be full citizens of the Republic. Within the \nAfrican-American community voices arose urging accommodation and \nacquiescence; the most prominent, Booker T. Washington's, counseled \nagainst seeking political and social rights.\n  John Hope, an academic who subsequently became one of the founders of \nthe Niagara Movement, offered a ringing rebuttal to this advice:\n\n       In this republic, we shall be less than freemen if we have \n     a whit less than that which thrift, education and honor \n     afford other freemen. If equality, political, economic and \n     social is the boon of other men in this great country of \n     ours, then equality, political, economic and social is what \n     we demand.\n\n  When the Niagara Movement met for the first time, it adopted a \nmanifesto that formally rejected accommodation and courageously \nasserted:\n\n       We claim for ourselves every single right that belongs to a \n     freeborn American, political, civil and social; and until we \n     get these rights we will never cease to protest and assail \n     the ears of America. The battle we wage is not for ourselves \n     alone but for all true Americans.\n\n  The movement faced truly daunting challenges. It was met by the \npublic at large with alarm, skepticism and outright hostility--and on \nthe part of the press, by a wall of silence. The annual meeting shifted \nfrom one place to another--from Buffalo to Harper's Ferry, to Boston \nand then to Oberlin, and in its last year to Sea Girt, NJ. Membership \nnever numbered more than a few hundred; and plans to establish chapters \nin all thirty States were never fully realized. The movement's \nfinancial resources were painfully inadequate to the challenge it \nfaced, and its efforts to organize were met by hostility and, worst of \nall, silence on the part of the press.\n  Although the movement sank into obscurity, a small number of scholars \nand commentators have recognized its importance. Among them is John \nBambacus, whose 1972 master's thesis, ``W.E.B. DuBois and the Niagara \nMovement,'' remains a valuable introduction to the subject. Today John \nBambacus serves both as the mayor of Frostburg, in Maryland's Allegany \nCounty, and also as a member of the faculty of Frostburg State \nUniversity, where he is an Associate Professor and Director of \nFrostburg's Public Affairs Institute and Internship Program.\n  It is clear today that the Niagara Movement was indeed the beginning \none hundred years ago of the ``mighty current'' that became the great \ncivil rights movement of the 20th century and transformed this Nation. \nAnd when after a few years the movement faltered, the NAACP emerged in \nits place.\n  For Marylanders, the NAACP has very special significance. It is not \nonly that the NAACP, with a membership of some 500,000, nearly 2,000 \nbranch chapters and hundreds of college and youth chapters, has its \nheadquarters in Baltimore. It is not only that the NAACP has worked \nceaselessly since its founding 95 years ago to ensure that African-\nAmericans will have access to all the rights and opportunities our \ncountry offers, and that by doing so it has made our country a better \nplace for all our people. It is not just the brilliant programs the \nNAACP has designed and implemented over the years--among them, the \nhistoric voter registration projects and the Voter Empowerment Program \nthat grew out of them, the critically important economic empowerment \nprogram, and the Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific \nOlympics program that sets a high standard of achievement for young \npeople and challenges them to meet it.\n  It is also the legacy of Thurgood Marshall, who was born and raised \nin Baltimore, who received his high-school diploma from Frederick \nDouglass High School in Baltimore, and who returned to Baltimore after \nlaw school at Howard University. It was at Howard, where he was class \nvaledictorian, that Thurgood Marshall became a member of the brilliant \nteam that Dean Charles Hamilton Houston assembled for the express \npurpose of sweeping away ``separate but equal'' and establishing the \nright of African-Americans to full participation in every aspect of \nAmerican life. Within a year of returning to Baltimore Thurgood \nMarshall joined the staff of the Baltimore branch of the NAACP. He went \non to become the NAACP's chief legal officer and also director of the \nNAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n  In that capacity he led the team that successfully argued the \nlandmark case of Brown v. Board of Education in the Supreme Court, \nthereby laying the indestructible foundation for transforming the \nprinciples set out by the Niagara Movement into the reality of American \nlife.\n  Marshall did not rest with his triumph in the Brown case. President \nKennedy appointed him to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, where of \nJudge Marshall's 112 rulings that were appealed, every one was later \nupheld by the Supreme Court. Subsequently President Johnson appointed \nhim to be Solicitor General, and then to sit on the Supreme Court as \nthe Nation's first African-American Justice. Justice Marshall's \ncolleague on the Supreme Court, Justice Brennan, called him--\n\n     the voice of authority . . . the voice of reason . . . [a]nd \n     a voice with an unwavering message: that the Constitution's \n     protections must not be denied to anyone . . .\n\n  Thurgood Marshall was a leader among the brilliant and courageous \nmembers of the African-American community who dedicated their efforts--\nand in many cases their lives--to the fundamental principles of \nequality and respect that were set out in Buffalo 100 years ago by the \nNiagara Movement. We have come far, but yet we have far to go.\n  No one has put this more eloquently than Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \nAs we approach the end of African-American History Month 2005 we should \nremember what he told us nearly 50 years ago, in ``Facing the Challenge \nof a New Age'':\n\n     . . . our world is geographically one. Now we are faced with \n     the challenge of making it spiritually one. Through our \n     scientific genius we have made of the world a neighborhood; \n     now through our moral and spiritual genius we must make of it \n     a brotherhood. We are all involved in the single process. \n     Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. We are \n     all links in the great chain of humanity.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today marks the end of Black History Month. \nEach year, we take this opportunity to\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\nhonor the heritage and extraordinary contributions that African \nAmericans have made in building our Nation.\n  We have many fallen martyrs in the civil rights movement to honor: \nHarriet Tubman, the pioneer of the Underground Railroad; Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., a drum major for justice; Rosa Parks, mother of the \ncivil rights movement; and recently deceased Shirley Chisholm, champion \nof political firsts; to name only a few.\n  Arkansas has its own heroes who turned their determination into \nopportunity for others and helped shape history as a result.\n  It is perhaps the Little Rock Nine who taught America that \n``separate'' was not ``equal.'' Nine black students--Ernest Green, \nElizabeth Eckford, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Carlotta Walls LaNier, \nMinnijean Borwn Trickey, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, Thelma \nMothershed Wair and Melba Pattillo Beals--defied hatred and prejudice \nto attend the all-white Central High School and exercise their right to \na better education.\n  Last year, I worked closely with members of the Little Rock Nine, as \nwell as the former Congressional Black Caucus Chairman, Elijah \nCummings, to secure funding to build a Visitor's Center at the Little \nRock Central High School in time to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of \nthe school's desegregation crisis. I am thrilled Congress authorized \nthe design funding for this project. We celebrate Black History Month \nevery February, but the Visitor's Center is open to teach stories of \nthe civil rights movement all-year long.\n  Part of this Visitor's Center will tell the story of civil rights \nleader Daisy Gatson Bates, who paid a personal and financial price to \nhelp the Little Rock Nine succeed. Bates also made significant strides \nin the courtroom and increasing public awareness through her newspaper, \nthe Arkansas State Press, about the inequality that existed in \nArkansas.\n  Just as Arkansans broke barriers in our schools, they also played a \nlarge role in integrating our Nation's military operations, making it \nthe most skilled military in the world. The actions of the Tuskegee \nAirmen are legendary. Arkansas' own Tuskegee Airmen include: Herbert \nClark of Pine Bluff, Richard Caesar of Lake Village, William Mattison \nof Conway, Woodrow Crockett of Little Rock, James Ewing of Helena, \nMarsille Reed of Tillar, Jerry Hodges of Heth, and Grandville Coggs of \nLittle Rock.\n  Before 1940, African Americans were barred from flying for the U.S. \nmilitary. Civil rights organizations and the black press exerted \npressure that resulted in the formation of an African-American flying \nsquadron based in Tuskegee, AL., in 1941. The Tuskegee Airmen \nestablished an incredible and unprecedented flying record, most notably \ncompleting 200 bomber escort missions over most of central and southern \nEurope without the loss of a single bomber to enemy aircraft. By the \nend of World War II, almost 1,000 African Americans had won their wings \nat Tuskegee Army Air Field. Each airman had his own victories and \nvalor, but in the end, the Tuskegee Airmen knew that never again would \nanybody deny a man or woman the opportunity to serve our country in any \ncapacity because of the color of his or her skin.\n  In 1948, President Harry Truman enacted an Executive order which \ndirected equality of treatment and opportunity in all of the U.S. Armed \nForces. This order, in time, led to the end of racial segregation in \nthe military forces.\n  African Americans continue to make remarkable contributions in the \nfields of mathematics, science, arts, politics and the Armed Forces. \nArkansas is blessed to be the home to many of these trailblazers, \nincluding Pulitzer Prize winner Maya Angelou, former U.S. Secretary of \nTransportation Rodney Slater, and many individuals who may not be \nhousehold names but who make an extraordinary difference in our \ncommunities nonetheless.\n  As we look back at the African Americans who brought us here today, \nwe must also consider those who are history in the making.\n  The Little Rock Nine and Daisy Gatson Bates knew that education is \nthe great equalizer. Keeping students in school and preparing them for \ncollege will pay off in dividends for communities. For students who \npursue higher education, the pay margin is significant. In 2002, the \naverage earnings for nongraduates were $18,826; for high school \ngraduates, $27,280; for bachelor's degree holders, $51,194; and for \nthose with advanced degrees, $72,824.\n  Last week, I traveled towns in the Delta, where some rural areas \nsuffer from unemployment rates two to three times higher than the \nnational average, the poverty rate is more than double the national \naverage, and access to health care is abysmal. I spoke with middle \nschool and high school students, sharing with them a message of \ncommitment and responsibility.\n  Every child should know that if they take the initiative to work hard \nand make good grades, this body will stand by them and match that \ncommitment. Standing by our youth means fulfilling the promises we made \nto them to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Most students know that the No Child Left Behind Act requires them to \ntake more tests, but they don't understand the overall goal is to \nimprove our schools--in poor neighborhoods and in wealthy school \ndistricts--so that they will all be able to compete in the global and \ntechnically advanced workplace.\n  In fulfilling Congress' commitment to our youth, it is imperative \nthat we support programs like the Federal TRIO programs, which help \nlow-income, first-generation college students progress through the \nacademic pipeline from middle school to post-baccalaureate programs.\n  I recently learned about Jessica, a high school senior who \nparticipates in the Upward Bound Program. Through the Federal TRIO \nprogram, she received tutoring and technical assistance that she needed \nto attend college. Jessica took the initiative to make good grades in \nschool, score well on her ACTs, and balance a part-time job at \nMcDonalds. She was accepted at the University of Central Arkansas, her \nfirst choice college, and she now awaits scholarship information so she \nknows for sure whether UCA is in her future.\n  Oprah Winfrey once said ``luck is a matter of preparation meeting \nopportunity.'' Preparation is the most important part of the equation. \nFor students to be prepared and compete in the workforce, Congress must \nsupport programs like title I, IDEA, TRIO, as well as programs that \nprovide vocational preparation and technology in rural schools. When we \nunderfund or slash funding for them, as the President proposes in his \nbudget proposal, we take opportunity away from them.\n  African-American students are reaping the benefits of equal \nopportunity laws passed on to them through the sacrifice of their \nancestors. However, too many African-American seniors struggle \nfinancially today because they simply did not have the same opportunity \nin their schools or in the workplace. As a result, 40 percent of \nAfrican-American seniors rely on Social Security as their only source \nof income, and the program provides about three-quarters of all \nretirement income for African-American seniors. Statistics show, in \nfact, without Social Security, poverty rates for African-American \nseniors would more than double to 58 percent.\n  The Social Security safety net is at risk with the President's \nprivatization plan. I hope African-American families in Arkansas and \nthroughout the country will listen closely to the debate on Social \nSecurity's future. The President recently stated private accounts are \nin the best interest of African-Americans because the accounts benefit \nindividuals with a shorter life expectancy. To me that statement means \nwe need to reduce the health care disparity in this country, which is \nsomething I hope the Senate will take action on this year. Weakening \nSocial Security is not the answer.\n  Black History Month presents an occasion to reflect on the great \ncontributions African-Americans have made to our country, and to \ncelebrate the steps we have taken toward equality. But too much is left \nto be done to simply leave it at that. We must also remind ourselves of \nthe work ahead and meet the commitment of those who seek opportunity.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, this month we mark the 79th celebration of \nAfrican American Black History Month. What was launched by civil rights \npioneer Dr. Carter G. Woodson in 1926 as Black History Week and \nobserved in Black schools and churches\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\ntoday is a month-long national tribute to the tremendous historical \ncontributions of African Americans from all walks of life and \nprofessions.\n  I am so very proud of the rich and vibrant African-American heritage \nin my home State of North Carolina. Our history is full of \ntrailblazers, including Franklin McCain, Joseph McNeil, Ezell Blair, \nJr., and David Richmond, known as the Greensboro Four because of their \nFebruary 1960 sit-ins at a Woolworth Store counter in Greensboro, NC. \nTheir sit-ins were the first significant event of this type, quickly \ngaining momentum and attention. In less than a week, the four North \nCarolina A freshmen had been joined by 1,000 other students from \nlocal high schools and universities. As the Greensboro News & Record \nstated earlier this month, the Greensboro sit-in ``gave new life to the \nnation's civil rights movement and helped pave the way for its triumphs \nlater in the decade.'' These individuals truly laid the foundation for \nthe America we strive to be, where all people are given opportunity and \ntreated fairly, regardless of their skin color.\n  North Carolina, with its long and proud military history, also \nproduced 21 of the famed Tuskegee Airmen. Trained in Tuskegee, AL, \nthese brave men made up the first African-American military flying unit \nin World War II. I am proud to cosponsor recently introduced \nlegislation that authorizes the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of Congress to the Tuskegee Airmen. These brave soldiers truly \nleft their mark on history not just in battle--their great success \nhelped pave the way for the integration of our Armed Forces in 1948.\n  North Carolina also has made great strides in higher education. We \nhave 11 historically Black colleges and universities, including Shaw \nUniversity in Raleigh, founded in 1865 and the oldest HBCU in the \nSouth. I was honored to give the commencement address and receive an \nhonorary degree several years ago from Livingstone College, another \noutstanding historically Black college in my hometown of Salisbury. I \nalso am so very proud that my husband Bob is serving as chairman of a \n$50 million fundraising campaign at Bennett College in Greensboro, one \nof only two historically Black women's colleges in America. Bennett \nCollege President Dr. Johnnetta Cole is a pioneer in her own right, \nhaving received 50 honorary degrees during an impressive career in \nacademia that includes being the first African-American woman to serve \nas president of Spelman College. And in May 2004, Dr. Cole became the \nfirst African-American to serve as chair of the Board of United Way of \nAmerica.\n  A short time ago Congress debated legislation to make the birthday of \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a national holiday. The floor leader for \nthat legislation was a fellow named Bob Dole. During the final debate, \nI had the privilege of sitting in the gallery with Coretta Scott King, \nas we heard Bob deliver these words: ``A nation defines itself in many \nways; in the promises it makes and the programs it enacts, the dreams \nit enshrines, or the doors it slams shut. Thanks to Dr. King, America \nwrote new laws to strike down old barriers. She built bridges instead \nof walls . . . there is nothing partisan about justice. It is \nconservative as the Constitution, as liberal as Lincoln, as radical as \nJefferson's sweeping assertion that all of God's creation is equal in \nHis eyes.'' I could not agree more.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise again, as I have earlier this month, \nto honor February as Black History Month. Each February since 1926, we \nhave recognized the contributions of Black Americans to the Nation.\n  This is no accident; February is a significant month in Black \nAmerican history. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, President Abraham \nLincoln, and scholar and civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois were born in \nthe month of February. The 15th amendment to the Constitution was \nratified 132 years ago this month, preventing race discrimination in \nthe right to vote. The National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People was founded in February in New York City. February 1 was \nthe 45th anniversary of the Greensboro Four's historic sit-in. And on \nFebruary 25, 1870, this body welcomed its first Black senator, Hiram R. \nRevels of Mississippi.\n  In this important month, I have wanted to celebrate some of the \ncontributions made by Black Americans in my home State of Oregon. Since \nMarcus Lopez, who sailed with Captain Robert Gray in 1788, became the \nfirst person of African descent known to set foot in Oregon, a great \nmany Black Americans have helped shape the history of my State. \nThroughout this month, I have come to the floor to highlight some of \ntheir stories. Today, on the last day of Black History Month, I have \ncome to honor one more.\n  Louis A. Southworth was a blacksmith, fiddler, and farmer. Though a \ncombination of his contagious personality, appealing fiddle playing, \nand an unwavering devotion to civic duty, he became one of Oregon's \nmost respected and well-liked citizens of his time.\n  Born into slavery in Tennessee in 1830, he later moved with his \nfamily to Oregon in 1851. Although slavery was officially banned in \nOregon, it was still practiced with some frequency. While working in \nthe gold mines, Southworth soon found that people greatly enjoyed his \nmusical talents. He was able to parlay his talents on a fiddle into an \nextra source of income, and at age 28, bought his freedom for $1,000. \nThe phrase ``fiddling for freedom'' soon caught on, and Louis \nSouthworth become some what of a local hero.\n  In 1879, he moved with his wife and adopted son to the south bank of \nthe Alsea River. Southworth, with his family and his fiddle, soon won \nover this small community. He worked as a farmer, and ferried cargo and \npassengers across the bay to town.\n  As more people began to move into the community, he donated some of \nhis land to build a local school house and later served as chair of the \nschool board. Along with his new life came a renewed sense of civic \nduty. Southworth became a dedicated political activist. During the \nelections of 1890, a strong storm ravaged his small town. Unafraid of \nthe weather, Louis Southworth rigged two oil drums to his boat for \nbuoyancy and rowed across the bay to the polling place. As it turns \nout, he was the only person to cast a vote in Waldport that day.\n  Despite the chaotic times in which he lived, Louis Southworth was \nembraced by his community. Before he died in 1917, his neighbors raised \nthe $300 needed to pay off his mortgage in Corvallis, OR.\n  Louis Southworth provides one example of a man triumphing over \nseemingly insurmountable odds. As a Black man living in troubled times, \nhis personality, compassion, work ethic, talents, generosity, and \ndevotion to the community service allowed him to become a respected \nleader. He was accepted by many of his peers, of all races, religions, \nand ethnic backgrounds, long before this was common or expected. His \nlegacy of service and kindness is one that lives on today, and one that \nshould be remembered for years to come. On this last day of Black \nHistory Month, I believe it is only right to celebrate an Oregonian \nlike Louis Southworth, whose contributions to race relations in Oregon, \nwhile great, have not yet received the attention they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/28/senate-section/article/S1791-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1791-S1792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   corporal matthew reed smith, usmc\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on the recent passing \nof Corporal Matthew Reed Smith of the United States Marine Corps. \nCorporal Smith was a native of West Valley City, UT, who died in a \nhelicopter crash near the town of Rutbah, Iraq. Corporal Smith was one \nof 29 Marines and one Navy sailor who lost their lives in that fateful \naccident. Today, I know the Senate will join me in honoring their \nmemory as heroes who died in performance of their duty. The sacrifice \nof these brave servicemen will be remembered forever.\n  Corporal Smith, during his younger years, often dreamed of being in \nthe Armed Forces. I have been told that as a child he would play make-\nbelieve with his brothers on the hill in front of their home and that \nhe always insisted on being the ``Marine.'' Nicknamed the ``Three \nMusketeers'' by their mother, Corporal Smith and his two brothers grew \nup doing the things they loved most, camping, hunting, wrestling, and \nriding their motorbikes in the mountains.\n  Corporal Smith joined the Marines because ``they were the first ones \nin there.'' As a Marine, he fought bravely to expel the insurgents from \nthe city of\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\nFallujah. There were times during the fighting when he could hear the \nbullets whistling past his head. His best friend lost an arm and a leg \nin the Battle for Fallujah.\n  Being unable to obtain leave in order to attend the wedding of his \nbrother last March, members of his family made a life-size cutout of \nCorporal Smith and moved it around the dance floor as the night \nprogressed. On learning of Corporal Smith's death, his family placed \nthe cutout in the living room of their home. That silhouette of \nCorporal Smith, dressed sharply in his Marine uniform, today remains in \nour hearts as a symbol that he served his country with honor and \ncourage.\n  Recently, I had the opportunity to visit a website created to honor \nhim. I was struck by the number of comments and sentiments that clearly \nshowed that Corporal Smith was a true friend and loved by all who knew \nhim. In one particularly moving tribute, a fellow mourner wrote that he \ncould not imagine Corporal Smith departing this life ``in any other way \nthan selflessly serving others.''\n  Mr. President, it is a privilege to learn about the extraordinary \nlife of such a man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/28/senate-section/article/S1792-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SUSPENSION OF RUSSIA FROM THE G8\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friend \nSenator McCain, to speak about a resolution that is of great importance \nto the cause of democracy which we have devoted America to advance at \nhome and around the world. In November 2003 Senator McCain and I were \nmoved by Russia's failure to adhere to democratic principles to submit \na resolution to hold Russia accountable for the commitments Moscow made \nwhen first invited to participate in what became known as the G8. Since \nthen, the situation in Russia has deteriorated. I am particularly \npleased that Senators Bayh, Burns, Chambliss, Smith, and Durbin have \njoined as original co-sponsors of this resolution indicating the \nincreasing Senatorial concern over the accelerating erosion of \ndemocratic and economic freedom in Russia. As President Bush returns \nfrom his meeting with President Putin at the summit in Bratislava, we \ncall once again on the President of the United States and the Secretary \nof State to work with our partners in the G7 to condition Russia's \ncontinued participation in the G8 on Russia's compliance with basic \nstandards of democracy and rule of law.\n  We have a real stake in Russia's adherence to democratic norms \nbecause our commitment to Russia's transition toward democracy is \ncritical to secure a peaceful future with Russia. The G7 nations are \nhighly industrialized countries bound together by fundamental \nprinciples of democracy, rule of law, a free market system, and respect \nfor human rights.\n  The actions of President Putin over the past few years have raised \nserious concerns about Russia's commitment to these principles. There \nis a long list of well-documented antidemocratic developments in \nRussia. The Putin administration has limited freedom of expression in \nRussia by seizing independent media organizations and suppressing the \nactivities of independent journalists, religious organizations, and \nnongovernmental organizations that are all integral components of a \nhealthy civil society. The Russian government's dismantling of Yukos \nand the arrest of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky 16 months ago raised \nserious doubts about Russia's commitment to free market principles and \nrule of law as well as respect for property and shareholder rights. The \nFederal Security Services, FSB, play a strong role in Russia's power \nstructures in a manner reminiscent of the KGB in the old regime. \nPresident Putin's support for the first fraudulent results in the \nUkrainian presidential elections last year exhibited disregard for \nbasic democratic principles. Fortunately, a democratic outcome \nprevailed in a new vote and Yushchenko's victory--a very positive \ndevelopment for Ukraine's and Russia's democrats.\n  We were all moved by the horrific attack on the schoolchildren and \nfamilies of Beslan school last September. There can be no justification \nfor such brutal acts and we condemn them with every fiber of our soul. \nOur hearts and sympathy go out to the families of these victims as they \ncontinue to cope with the loss of their loved ones. The United States \ncondemns terrorism in all forms. But the tragedy of the Beslan school \nshould not be used by President Putin to retreat from democratic \nreforms. In the wake of the Beslan crisis, President Putin abolished \nthe popular election of regional governors in favor of presidential \nappointees. These changes to the Russian political system enhance the \npower of the executive branch, while reducing the checks and balances \nthat make democracies work. As former Secretary of State Colin Powell \nsaid, ``We understand the need to fight against terrorism . . . but in \nan attempt to go after terrorists I think one has to strike a proper \nbalance to make sure that you don't move in a direction that takes you \naway from the democratic reforms or the democratic process.''\n  Allowing Russia to continue its involvement in the G8 and to host the \n2006 G8 Summit while continuing to undermine democracy makes mockery of \nthe very principles that bind the\nG8 countries together. This resolution is not anti-Russian; it is a \nstrong show of support for Russia's democrats who have long urged the \nUnited States to not turn a blind eye to undemocratic developments in \nRussia. Sharing a deeply personal moment from his time in Soviet Gulag, \nNatan Sharansky recently told a group of Senators how deeply supported \nhe felt when President Reagan gave his famous ``evil empire'' speech \nthat honestly addressed the oppression of the Soviet system. Since then \nRussia has come a long way, but we must speak openly in the face of the \nbacksliding we are seeing.\n  As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently said, ``The real \ndeepening of our relations can only take place on the basis of common \nvalues.'' To do otherwise would be to shirk our responsibilities as a \nleader of the democratic world. And as President Bush said so \neloquently in his inaugural and State of the Union addresses, America's \nsecurity is advanced by the advancement of freedom. This resolution \nputs those sentiments into concrete action and I urge my fellow \nSenators to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/28/senate-section/article/S1792-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  In December of 2004, a gay man was attacked outside of his Kansas \nCity home by two unknown assailants. Floyd Elliot reported to \nauthorities that two men held him down, cut him with a knife, and used \nthe knife to burn letters into his skin. It looks as if the assailants \nwere attempting to ``brand'' a homosexual slur onto the victim's chest. \nThe attack is being investigated as a hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/28/senate-section/article/S1792-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1792-S1793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HARRY T.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to enhance \nthe literacy in finance and economics, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce comprehensive \nlegislation aimed at addressing the issue of economic and financial \nilliteracy on college campuses. I am referring to the worrisome \nproblems of skyrocketing debt levels, low rates of saving, and the \nproliferation of unchecked predatory practices by unscrupulous \nfinancial institutions among young adults who hold our country's future \nin their hands. Entitled the College LIFE or College Literacy In \nFinance and Economics Act, this bill has the support of Senators \nSarbanes and Corzine. I thank my colleagues from Maryland and New \nJersey for joining me as original cosponsors of this measure. I also \nthank Senator Enzi, the Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, for working with me on financial literacy as it \naffects all constituencies, including college students.\n  The problem we are working to address with the College LIFE Act is \nsimple. Our college students are many of America's best and the \nbrightest and will go on to become leaders--in business, education, \npolitics, the military, the community--any area you can name. I find it \nwonderful that many young people are fulfilling their dreams of higher \neducation in numbers that I did not imagine when I was in college. In \nfact, as reported by the Census Bureau, college enrollment was \nestimated at 15.9 million for the current school year, compared to 5.7 \nmillion in 1965 when the Higher Education Act was enacted. However, I \nam gravely concerned, both as a member of this body and particularly as \na grandparent and great-grandparent, that our young people are entering \ncollege without proper direction or good skills for money management or \neconomic decisionmaking.\n  As we work on increasing access to higher education, we must give \nstudents access to tools needed to make sound economic and financial \ndecisions once they are on campus; however, the lack of personal \nfinance and economics standards or implementation of existing standards \nin elementary and secondary education in a number of States results in \nmany students arriving at college with little understanding of economic \nconcepts like supply and demand or benefits versus costs, or personal \nfinance concepts such as household money management or the importance \nof maintaining good credit history. Without this basic understanding, \ncollege students are not effectively evaluating credit alternatives, \nmanaging their debt, and preparing for long-term financial goals, such \nas saving for a home or retirement.\n  Imagine life from the point of view of a college student. A young \nadult leaves his home and travels many miles--thousands of miles in the \ncase of Hawaii students attending mainland colleges--to the campus that \nholds his hopes and dreams. Perhaps he is not being mindful of how much \nmoney he needs for textbooks, school supplies, or student fees. He \nvisits the campus bookstore and walks out with a bag that includes a \npreapproved credit card application, which he immediately completes and \nsends. Months later, he has joined other credit card-holding college \nstudents who, on average, have credit card balances above $3,000. \nSophomore year rolls around and, instead of conferring with his parents \nabout the details of his renewal FAFSA for student financial aid or \nmaster promissory note, he is saddled with another $20,000 loan. \nAccording to the Census Bureau, average college tuition, room, and \nboard have increased to $29,119 for a four-year private institution and \nto $9,953 for a four-year public institution. The same scenario repeats \nitself in junior and senior year. Finally, after completing all \ncoursework, he graduates, finds an entry-level job, and realizes that, \nafter servicing his debt, he has little left to spend on basics such as \nfood, transportation, and rent, much less career clothing or a new \nbriefcase. His lack of knowledge about how to properly use credit has \nled him to anxiety-causing financial missteps. With appropriate \nfinancial and economic literacy, he may have known what debt load to \nanticipate and made wiser financing and spending decisions while in \nschool.\n  Instead, she may be on the road to true financial trouble. A U.S. \nPublic Interest Research Group and Consumer Federation of America \nanalysis of Federal Reserve data indicates that the average household \nwith debt carries approximately $10,000 to $12,000 in total revolving \ndebt and has nine credit cards. From January through September of 2004, \napproximately 1.2 million consumers filed for bankruptcy, keeping pace \nwith last year's record level, which is almost half of the number of \ncollege diplomas expected to be conferred this year at 2.5 million. \nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve Board reports that Americans currently \npay more than 13 percent of after-tax income to service their debts. We \nmust ensure that our youth make the right decisions to follow a better \nfinancial path. This is especially in light of a report cited by Dan \nIannicola, Jr., Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for \nFinancial Education, at a House hearing last Congress, noting that \nyouths spent more than $172 billion in a recent year, and figures from \nMarketResearch.com noting that typical 8- to 14-year-olds spend--from \nallowances, jobs, and gifts--nearly $1,300 a year or $25 a week.\n  The College LIFE Act represents a comprehensive approach to assist \nupcoming generations of Americans. It proposes four new grant programs \nthat provide resources to encourage experimentation with delivery \nsystems--innovative methods used in or out of the classroom to increase \ncollege students'\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\nfinancial literacy. Another grant would allow higher education \ninstitutions to share best practices about or create personal finance \ncourses where none exist. A third grant would assist efforts that are \nlooking at the best ways to integrate personal finance and economic \neducation into basic educational subjects, which is especially \nimportant as schools are facing challenges under the No Child Left \nBehind Act and are tempted to focus on subjects being tested for \nAdequate Yearly Progress. The final grant would train teachers and high \nschool counselors toward increasing financial and economic literacy in \ngrades K-12 so that our college students are prepared when they arrive \nat college campuses.\n  The bill also proposes a pilot program for five higher education \ninstitutions to encourage students to take a personal finance course \nand participate in preventive annual credit counseling, working in \nconjunction with State or local public, private, and nonprofit entities \nselected by the local education agency or the school, and measuring the \neffectiveness of efforts in any behavioral changes that may result. It \npromotes greater collaboration with and support from Federal agencies \nin the form of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission. \nFinally, the measure emphasizes the importance of personal finance and \neconomic education and counseling by authorizing these activities as \nallowable uses in existing Higher Education Act programs, such as TRIO, \nGEAR UP, and Title III and Title V Serving Institutions.\n  Furthermore, I intend the reach of this bill to be beyond the \ntraditional college student. Our returning college students are a vital \npart of society--many who are already community leaders and \nbreadwinners for their families who have already gained valuable work \nexperience that they may use as they learn a new field or continue \ntheir undergraduate study in the pursuit of a graduate or doctoral \ndegree. In addition, older adults who are entering higher education for \nthe first time can also be lauded for their enterprising spirit in \nwanting to better their lives by earning an associates or bachelors \ndegree. I anticipate that the assistance provided through the College \nLIFE Act will work to provided needed help to many of these students as \nwell.\n  I am looking forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to have \nthe College LIFE Act passed or included in the upcoming Higher \nEducation Act reauthorization. I encourage my colleagues' support for \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Roberts, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Chambliss, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Hagel, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 469. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income the gain from the sale of a principal residence by \ncertain employees of the intelligence community; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nextend an important tax benefit to the men and women of the United \nStates Intelligence Community. I am pleased that in keeping with the \nbipartisan traditions of the Intelligence Committee, every member, \nRepublican and Democrat, is listed as an original cosponsor.\n  Two years ago, on Veterans Day, President Bush signed into law an \nimportant modification to our tax code to ensure that it does not \npunish those who serve our country in the military and in the U.S. \nforeign service. Unfortunately, that legislation did not extend to \nintelligence officers, who serve alongside their military and \ndiplomatic colleagues all around the world and who often face the same \ntax issues encountered by those individuals. The legislation I am \nintroducing today makes a common sense modification to the capital \ngains tax exclusion rules to ensure that when selling their homes, \nintelligence officers do not pay more tax than they would if they did \nnot serve their country.\n  The men and women of the Intelligence Community, serve with the \nmilitary in Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, and numerous other locations \nwhere we have U.S. forces deployed. They also serve in U.S. Embassies \naround the world. Often times they carry an added burden because they \nmust serve undercover. Their families and friends don't know what they \ndo. They live their cover story by day and perform their critical \nintelligence work by night. They work for all fifteen of the agencies \nincluded in the intelligence community and they do a remarkable job. \nThese people are dedicated to their mission and to this country.\n  These patriotic individuals sacrifice a great deal on behalf of the \nrest of us. They uproot and relocate their families every few years. \nThey often live in places most of us wouldn't even visit. And they \nrarely have the quality of life with access to modern luxuries that the \nrest of us take for granted. To then say that they are going to be \npenalized by our tax code is unacceptable.\n  Since 1997, our tax code has allowed Americans to sell their homes \nwithout paying taxes on up to $250,000 of capital gains. Married \ncouples can exclude $500,000 in capital gains from taxation. This \nprovision is specifically intended only for principle residences, and \ntherefore, sellers are required to have lived in the homes for at least \n2 of the 5 years prior to sale.\n  In 2003, Congress recognized that this residency requirement was \noften difficult for members of the armed forces and foreign service to \nsatisfy. If they had been stationed away from home while serving their \ncountry, they were essentially punished with higher taxes on the sales \nof their homes. Congress addressed this injustice by allowing service \npersonnel and foreign service officers who were stationed away from \nhome to suspend the residency requirement for as many as ten years. \nThis change allows, for example, a soldier who spent the last 7 years \nstationed in Germany to exclude from taxes the capital gains on the \nsale of his former home in the U.S., as long as he had lived in it for \nat least 2 of the 5 years prior to his service overseas. The change is \neffective on all sales after 1997, when the capital gains tax exclusion \nfor home sales was provided to all Americans.\n  Fairness demands that Congress apply the same rules to intelligence \nofficers serving their country away from home. My legislation simply \ninserts intelligence officers into the list of those allowed to suspend \nthe 5 year residency test period for up to 10 years while they are \nstationed away from home.\n  I intend to work with my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee and \nthe Finance Committee to ensure that this provision is enacted this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 470. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to expand the \nclinical trials drug data bank; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Access to \nClinical Trials, FACT, Act. I want to begin by thanking Senator \nGrassley, Senator Johnson, and Senator Wyden for joining me in \nintroducing this legislation. Our bill will create an electronic \ndatabanks for clinical trials of drugs, biological products, and \nmedical devices. Such a databank will ensure that physicians, \nresearchers, the general public, and patients seeking to enroll in \nclinical trials have access to basic information about those trials. It \nwill require manufacturers and other researchers to reveal the results \nof clinical trials so that clinically important information will be \navailable to all Americans, and physicians will have all the necessary \ninformation to make appropriate treatment decisions for their patients.\n  Events of the past year have made it clear that such a databank is \nneeded. First, serious questions were raised about the effectiveness \nand safety of antidepressants when used in children and youth. It has \nnow become clear that the existing data indicates that these drugs may \nvery well put children at risk. However, because the data from \nantidepressant clinical trials was not publicly available, it took \nyears for this risk to be realized. In the meantime, millions of \nchildren have been prescribed antidepressants by well-meaning \nphysicians. While these drugs undoubtedly helped many of these \nchildren, they also led to greater suffering for others. Recently, it \nhas been suggested that the risk of antidepressants might even extend \nbeyond children.\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\n  The news is similarly disturbing for a popular class of painkillers \nknown as Cox-2 inhibitors. These medicines, taken by millions of \nAmericans, have been associated with an increased risk of \ncardiovascular adverse events, such as heart attack and stroke. It has \nbeen suggested that one of these medicines, which has since been pulled \nfrom the market, may be responsible for tens of thousands of deaths.\n  Unfortunately, antidepressants and Cox-2 inhibitors are just two \nexamples of a story that has become all too common. It has been \nsuggested that negative data might actually have been suppressed; and \nif this is discovered to be the case, those responsible should be dealt \nwith harshly. However, because of what is known as ``publication \nbias,'' the information available to the public and physicians can be \nmisleading even without nefarious motives. The simple fact is that a \nstudy with a positive result is far more likely to be published, and \nthus publicly available, than a study with a negative result. \nPhysicians and patients hear the good news, but rarely the bad news. In \nthe end, the imbalance of available information hurts patients.\n  Our bill would correct the imbalance of information, and prevent \nmanufacturers from suppressing negative data. It would do so by \ncreating a two-part databank, consisting of an expansion of \nclinicaltrials.gov--an existing registry that is operated by the \nNational Library of Medicine, NLM--and a new database for clinical \ntrial results.\n  Under the FACT Act, the registry would continue to operate as a \nresource for patients seeking to enroll in clinical trials for drugs \nand biological products intended to treat serious or life-threatening \nconditions--and for the first time, it would also include medical \ndevice trials. The new results database would include all trials, \nexcept for preliminary safety trials, and would require the submission \nof results data.\n  Our legislation would enforce the requirement to submit information \nto the databank in two ways. First, by requiring registration as a \ncondition of Institutional Review Board, IRB, approval, no trial could \nbegin without submitting preliminary information to the registry and \ndatabase. This information would include the purpose of the trial, the \nestimated date of trial completion, as well as all of the information \nnecessary to help patients to enroll in the trial.\n  Once the trial is completed, the researcher or manufacturer would be \nrequired to submit the results to the database. If they refuse to do \nso, they would be subject to monetary penalties or, in the case of \nfederally funded research, a restriction on future funding. It is my \nbelief that these enforcement mechanisms will ensure broad compliance. \nHowever, in the rare case where a manufacturer does not comply, this \nlegislation also gives the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the \nauthority to publicize the required information.\n  Let me also say that any time you are collecting large amounts of \ndata and making it public, protecting patient privacy and \nconfidentiality must be paramount. Our legislation would in no way \nthreaten that privacy. The simple fact is that under this bill, no \nindividually identifiable information would be available to the public.\n  I believe that the establishment of a clinical trials databank is \nabsolutely necessary for the health and well-being of the American \npublic. But I would also like to highlight two other benefits that such \na databank will have. First, it has the potential to reduce health care \ncosts. Studies have shown that publication bias also leads to a bias \ntoward new and more expensive treatment options. A databank could help \nmake it clear that, in some cases, less expensive treatments are just \nas effective for patients.\n  In addition, a databank will ensure that the sacrifice made by \npatients who enroll in clinical trials is not squandered. Many patients \nwould be less willing to participate in trials if they understood that \nthe data are unlikely to be made public if the results of the trial are \nnegative. We owe it to patients to make sure that their participation \nin a trial will benefit other individuals suffering from the same \nillness or condition.\n  The problems associated with publication bias have recently drawn \nmore attention from the medical community, and there is broad consensus \nthat a clinical trials registry is one of the best ways to address the \nissue. Accordingly, the American Medical Association, AMA, has \nrecommended the creation of such a databank, and the major medical \njournals have established a policy that they will only publish the \nresults of trials that were registered in a public database before the \ntrial began. Our legislation meets all of the minimum criteria for a \ntrial registry set out by the International Committee of Medical \nJournal Editors.\n\n  To its credit, the pharmaceutical industry has also acknowledged the \nproblem, and has created a database to which manufacturers can \nvoluntarily submit clinical trials data. I applaud this step. However, \nif our objective is to provide the public with a complete and \nconsistent supply of information, a voluntary database is unlikely to \nachieve that goal. Some companies will provide information, but others \nmay decide not to participate. We need a clinical trials framework that \nis not just fair to all companies, but provides patients with peace of \nmind that they will receive complete information about the medicines \nthey rely on.\n  The American drug industry is an extraordinary success story. As a \nresult of the innovations that this industry has spawned, millions of \nlives have been improved and saved in our country and around the globe. \nBecause of the importance of these medicines to our health and well-\nbeing, I have consistently supported sound public policies to help the \nindustry to succeed. This legislation aims to build upon the successes \nof this industry, and help ensure that the positive changes to our \nhealth care system that prescription drugs have brought are not \nundermined by controversies such as the ones now surrounding \nantidepressants and Cox-2 inhibitors, which are at least in part based \non a lack of public information. This bill will help ensure that well-\ninformed patients will use new and innovative medicines.\n  I look forward to working with industry, physicians, the medical \njournals, patient groups, and my colleagues--including the Chairman and \nthe Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy--to move this legislation \nforward. This bill has already been endorsed by the National \nOrganization for Rare Disorders, Consumers Union, the Elizabeth Glaser \nPediatric AIDS Foundation, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent \nPsychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association, the New England \nJournal of Medicine, and the National Women's Health Network. I thank \nthese organizations for lending their expertise as we crafted this \nlegislation.\n  The creation of a clinical trials databank is a critical step toward \nensuring the safety of drugs, biological products, and devices in this \ncountry--but it should not be the end of our efforts. I believe that \nother steps are necessary to fully restore patient confidence in the \nsafety of the medicines they rely on. I have already announced my \nintention to introduce another piece of legislation that will create an \nOffice of Patient Protection within the FDA, which will be responsible \nfor ensuring the safety of prescription drugs once they are on the \nmarket. I look forward to introducing this bill in the coming weeks.\n  Clinical trials are critical to protecting the safety and health of \nthe American public, and for this reason, trial results must not be \ntreated as information that can be hidden from scrutiny. Recent events \nhave made it clear that a clinical trials databank is needed. Patients \nand physicians agree that such a databank is in the interest of the \npublic health. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I \nam hopeful that it will become law as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 470\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, earlier today, Senate Bill 470 was \nintroduced. I am pleased to sponsor the Fair Access to Clinical Trials \nAct of 2005, with Senator Dodd. I am co-sponsoring this legislation as \npart of a sustained effort to restore public confidence in the Federal \nGovernment's food and drug safety agency. Enactment of this bill will \nbe a meaningful step toward greater transparency and accountability in \nclinical trials and the scientific process.\n  The Food and Drug Administration earned its prized reputation through \ndecades of good work on behalf of the American people. The FDA's drug \napproval process has long been considered the ``Good Housekeeping Seal \nof Approval.'' However, the Vioxx disaster and its aftermath have \nshaken the public's confidence. American consumers demand and deserve \nassurances that the medicines in their cabinets are safe. The health \nand safety of the public must be the FDA's first and only concern. \nUnfortunately, reforms at the FDA are necessary to place that mission \nfront and center once again.\n  I began my oversight of the FDA last year in response to concerns \nabout the reluctance of the FDA to provide information to the public \nabout the increased suicidal risks for young people taking anti-\ndepressants. Last November, I chaired a groundbreaking hearing on drug \nsafety, the FDA and Vioxx. That hearing and other critical drug safety \nconcerns of the past year highlighted the need for reforms and more \nstringent oversight of the FDA.\n  Sometimes congressional scrutiny of agency mismanagement can lead to \nnecessary reforms. Sometimes an agency will act on its own to enhance \nits credibility. I have been pressing for reforms--both administrative \nand legislative--to bring about greater responsiveness and transparency \nat the FDA. The risks and benefits of prescription drugs should be \nreadily available to patients and doctors seeking to make informed \ndecisions.\n  The FACT Act will expand www.clinicaltrials.gov to create a publicly \naccessible national data bank of clinical trial information comprised \nof a clinical trial registry and a clinical trial results database. The \nlegislation will foster transparency and accountability in health-\nrelated intervention research and development and ensure that the \nscientific community and the general public have access to basic \ninformation about clinical trials. Importantly, the FACT Act will \nmaintain clinicaltrials.gov as a registry for patients and physicians \nseeking information about ongoing clinical trials for serious or life-\nthreatening diseases and conditions. The legislation will also prevent \ncompanies from withholding clinically important information about their \nproducts.\n  The FACT Act will maintain a clinical trial registry accessible to \npatients and health care practitioners seeking information related to \nongoing clinical trials for serious or life-threatening diseases and \nconditions; establish a clinical trials results database of all \npublicly and privately funded clinical trial results regardless of \noutcome that is accessible to the scientific community, health care \npractitioners, and members of the public; require the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) to make internal drug approval and safety reviews \npublicly available; build on the successful model of \nwww.clinicaltrials.gov, which was established in 1997. The web site \nwill continue to be run by the National Library of Medicine at the \nNational Institutes of Health, with assistance from the FDA; apply to \nclinical trials for drugs, biologics, and medical devices. All trials \nmust be registered in the database in order to obtain approval from a \nU.S. Institutional Review Board; require that foreign trials that are \nsubmitted to the FDA or used in advertising to U.S. physicians be \nregistered in the database at the time of submission; require that \nresearchers promptly disclose the objectives, eligibility criteria, \nsources of funding, and anticipated timeline of clinical trials. The \nbill's standards will meet all of the minimum criteria for a trial \nregistry set out by the International Committee of Medical Journal \nEditors on September 8, 2004; mandate that the results of clinical \ntrials be available to doctors and patients. Recognizing that the peer \nreview process is the best safeguard for scientific accuracy, the bill \nprovides time for researchers to publish their results. The disclosure \nof important trial results satisfies the recommendation of the American \nMedical Association; establish strong enforcement mechanisms. The bill \nwill provide for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 per day for \nsponsors who refuse to comply. Monetary penalties will be earmarked for \nstudies that compare clinical therapies; provide authority to audit the \ncompleteness and accuracy of the information in the registry; and \nensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the authority to \ncorrect false or misleading statements about the results of clinical \ntrials.\n  Later this month I will also introduce legislation to establish an \nindependent office of drug safety in the Food and Drug Administration. \nToday's legislation is an important step toward reforming the FDA. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in this effort by cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I join several of my colleagues in \nintroducing a very important piece of legislation that will improve \naccess to information about prescription drugs for\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\npatients and their doctors. Today, Senators Dodd, Grassley, Wyden and I \nare introducing the Fair Access to Clinical Trials Act or FACT Act. I \ncommend my colleagues for their hard work on this legislation. I also \nthank them for their commitment to ensuring that finally, objective, \nunbiased information can be put in the hands of consumers and doctors, \nreducing negative outcomes, improving patient care, and ultimately \nreducing costs of medications.\n  In recent months, we have learned that certain prescription drugs on \nthe market today may not be as safe as we once thought. \nGlaxoSmithKline's antidepressant drug, Paxil, was found to increase the \nrisk of suicide among adolescents. Further investigation of this issue \nindicated that some manufacturers of antidepressants highlighted \npositive findings of tests on youngsters, while playing down negative \nor inconclusive ones. In addition, the arthritis medication, Vioxx, was \npulled off the market due to negative study findings, and over 27,000 \nsudden cardiac deaths and heart attacks may have been caused by this \nmedication.\n  I find it unacceptable that current law does not require that the \nresults of these studies on Paxil and Vioxx be made readily available \nto doctors and their patients. It is unacceptable that today, much of \nthe information consumers and doctors rely on to make decisions about \nthe medications they use are based on incomplete information. Patients \nare often swayed by direct-to-consumer drug advertisements and doctors \nmust rely on the information they learn at drug company sponsored \nconferences. Access to complete information about prescription drugs is \nan important consumer issue, and that is why I am introducing this \nlegislation that would require pharmaceutical companies to fully \ndisclose clinical drug trial information in a public database before \nmedications are introduced on the shelves.\n  Under my legislation, all studies on medicines like Paxil and Vioxx \nwould be listed in a public drug trial registry database. The database \nwould include all the studies, both good and bad, the studies that are \nconducted after the drug is already on the market, and even the studies \nthat are discontinued. Doctors and patients would have access to all \ndifferent types of information so they could make a clear decision on \nwhich drugs are best for any circumstance.\n  The drug trial database established under this legislation would be \naccessible to the public on a governmental Web site. The database will \ninclude information about the sponsor of the drug trial, the parameters \nof the study, and the outcome or results of the trial. Medical \nprofessionals ought to have complete information available when \nprescribing medications, and consumers should be aware of all the \neffects prescription drugs can have when taken over a period of time. \nCommon sense tells us we need transparency in the prescription drug \nindustry when it comes to the effectiveness of medications, and this \ndatabase works towards that goal and will help to hold drug companies \naccountable for their products on the market.\n  I hope the Senate and House will take up this bill and pass it. It \naddresses an important consumer right-to-know issue that will help to \nensure that patients and doctors have the best, most accurate \ninformation at their fingertips when making life-altering medical \ndecisions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 472. A bill to criminalize Internet scams involving fraudulently \nobtaining personal information, commonly known as phishing; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, the Anti-\nPhishing Act of 2005, which targets a serious threat to the security of \nthe Internet.\n  Phishing is a rapidly growing class of identity theft scams on the \nInternet that is causing both short-term losses and long-term economic \ndamage. In the short-term, these scams defraud individuals and \nfinancial institutions. Estimated losses from phishing attacks are now \nin the billions of dollars, and those losses are growing. The short-\nterm losses, however, are just a chapter in a larger story. In the \nlong-term, phishing undermines the public's trust in the Internet. By \nmaking consumers uncertain about the integrity of the Internet's \ncomplex addressing system, phishing threatens to make us all less \nlikely to use the Internet for secure transactions. If you can't trust \nwhere you are on the web, you are less likely to use it for commerce \nand communications.\n  Those well versed in popular culture may guess that phishing was \nnamed after the phenomenally popular Vermont band, Phish. But phishing \nover the Internet was in fact named from the sport of fishing, as an \nanalogy for its technique of luring Internet prey with convincing email \nbait. The ``F'' is replaced by a ``P-H'' in keeping with a computer \nhacker tradition.\n  Phishing attacks usually start with emails that are, in Internet \njargon, ``spoofed.'' That is, they are made to appear to be coming from \nsome trusted financial institution or commercial entity. The spoofed \nemail usually asks the victim to go to a website to confirm or renew \nprivate account information. These emails offer a link that appears to \ntake the victim to the website of the trusted institution. In fact the \nlink takes the victim to a phony website that is visually identical to \nthat of the trusted institution, but is in fact run by the criminal. \nWhen the victim takes the bait and sends their account information, the \ncriminal uses it--sometimes within minutes--to transfer the victim's \nfunds or to make purchases. Phishers are the new con artists of \ncyberspace.\n  Phishing is on the rise. The Anti-Phishing Working Group reports that \nthe number of new phishing messages climbed at a monthly rate of 38 \npercent in the last six months of 2004. The number of new phishing \nwebsites has climbed 24 percent per month since last August. And \nphishing attacks are increasingly sophisticated. Early phishing attacks \nwere by novices, but there is now evidence that some attacks are backed \nby organized crime. Some of the attacks these days also include \nspyware, a type of software that is secretly installed on the victim's \ncomputer to surreptitiously capture account information when the victim \nvisits legitimate websites.\n  In addition, the Internet faces the threat of ``pharming.'' This \ninsidious crime does not rely on email bait. Rather, it attacks web \nbrowsers and the Internet's addressing system. The effect is that even \nindividuals who type a desired Internet destination into their web \nbrowser may be redirected to a phony web site, with the same disastrous \nresult as clicking on the phony link in a phishing attack.\n  Some phishers and pharmers can be prosecuted under wire fraud or \nidentity theft statutes, but often these prosecutions take place only \nafter someone has been defrauded. For most of these criminals, that \nleaves plenty of time to cover their tracks. It has been reported that \nthe average phishing website is active on the Internet for less than \nsix days. Moreover, the mere threat of these attacks undermines \neveryone's confidence in the Internet. When people cannot trust that \nwebsites are what they appear to be, they will not use the Internet for \ntheir secure transactions. Traditional wire fraud and identity theft \nstatutes are not sufficient to respond to phishing and pharming.\n  The Anti-Phishing Act of 2005 protects the integrity of the Internet \nin two ways. First, it criminalizes the bait. It makes it illegal to \nknowingly send out spoofed email that links to sham websites with the \nintention of committing a crime. Second, it criminalizes the sham \nwebsites that are the true scene of both types of crime.\n  There are, of course, important First Amendment concerns to be \nprotected. The Anti-Phishing Act protects parodies and political speech \nfrom being prosecuted as Phishing. We have worked closely with various \npublic interest organizations to ensure that the Anti-Phishing Act does \nnot impinge on the important democratic role that the Internet plays.\n  To many Americans, phishing and pharming are new words. They are \ncertainly a new form of an old crime. They are also very serious, and \nwe need to act aggressively to keep them from eroding the public's \ntrust in online commerce and communication. I look forward to working \nwith others in the Senate in addressing this growing threat to the \nInternet with effective and responsible action.\n\n[[Page S1805]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 473. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to promote and \nimprove the allied health professions; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the well-being of the U.S. population \ndepends to a considerable extent on having access to high quality \nhealth care which, in turn, requires the presence of an adequate supply \nof health care professionals. The Congress and the President recognized \nthis need when we passed, and President Bush signed, the Nurse \nReinvestment Act in the 107th Congress. Just as with nurses, we must \nalso insure an adequate supply of well-prepared allied health \nprofessionals. That is why, today, I am introducing the Allied Health \nReinvestment Act with my good colleagues, Senator Bingaman of New \nMexico and Senator Lieberman of Connecticut.\n  The allied health professions are many. Those recognized in the act \ninclude professionals in the areas of: dental hygiene, dietetics/\nnutrition, emergency medical services, health information management, \nclinical laboratory sciences/medical technology, cytotechnology, \noccupational therapy, physical therapy, radiologic technology, nuclear \nmedical technology, rehabilitation counseling, respiratory therapy, and \nspeech-language pathology/audiology. This is not an exhaustive list, as \nthe act will leave to the discretion of the Secretary of HHS additional \nprofessions deemed eligible.\n  Today, many allied health professions are characterized by existing \nworkforce shortages, declining enrollments in academic institutions, or \na combination of both factors. The American Hospital Association, AHA, \nreports vacancy rates of 18 percent among radiology technicians, 10 \npercent among laboratory technologists, 15.3 percent among imaging \ntechnicians, and 12.7 percent among pharmacy technicians. In addition, \nthe AHA indicates that hospitals are having increasing difficulties \nrecruiting these same professionals over the preceding 2-year period.\n  In my own State of Washington, the Washington State Hospital \nAssociation reports vacancy rates of 14.3 percent among ultrasound \ntechnologists, 11.3 percent among radiology technicians, and 10.9 \npercent among nuclear medicine technologists. These vacancy rates have \na real effect on the hospitals in my State. When I meet with hospital \nofficials back home, they always tell me how the lack of technicians \naffects patient care.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that in the period 1998-\n2008, the United States would need a total of 93,000 new professionals \nin clinical laboratory science by creating 53,000 new positions and \nfilling the 40,000 existing vacancies. That averages 9,000 openings per \nyear for technicians, and yet academic institutions are producing only \n4,990 graduates annually. If these numbers stay constant, we will be \nshort by 43,100 needed technicians in 2008.\n  According to the American Hospital Association, declining enrollment \nin health education programs contributes to the critical shortages of \nhealth care professionals. Similarly, data from a November 2002 study \nof 90 institutions by the Association of Schools of Allied Health \nProfessions, ASAHP, shows a 3-year period of decline in enrollment in \ncardiovascular perfusion technology, cytotechnology, dietetics, \nemergency medical sciences, health administration, health information \nmanagement, medical technology, occupational therapy, rehabilitation \ncounseling, respiratory therapy, and respiratory therapy technician \nprograms. As an indication of a worsening situation, data from the \n2002-2003 academic year, alone, show that dental hygiene, physician \nassistant, and speech-language pathology and audiology should be added \nto this list.\n\n  While having an adequate number of health professionals in our \ncountry is key to ensuring access to health care for all of us, \ncertainly one of the key populations for whom a healthy supply of \nhealth professionals is vitally important for is our senior population.\n  The U.S. Census Bureau reports that rapid growth of the population \nage 65 and over will begin in 2011 when the first of the baby boom \ngeneration reaches age 65 and will continue for many years. From 1900 \nto 2000, the proportion of persons 65 and over tripled, going from 4.1 \npercent to 12.4 percent.\n  The baby-boom generation's movement into middle age, a period when \nthe incidence of heart attack and stroke increases, will produce a \nhigher demand for therapeutic services. Medical advances now enable \nmore patients with critical problems to survive, but in order to do so \nand maintain a high quality of life, these patients may need extensive \ntherapy.\n  Along with the aging of the population came an increase in the number \nof Americans living with one, and often more than one, chronic \ncondition. Today, it is estimated that 125 million Americans live with \na chronic condition, and by 2020 as the population ages, that number \nwill increase to an estimated 157 million, with 81 million of them \nhaving two or more chronic conditions. Twenty-five percent of \nindividuals with chronic conditions have some type of activity \nlimitations. Two-thirds of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries with \nfive or more chronic conditions.\n  Many individuals with chronic conditions rely on family caregivers. \nApproximately 9 million Americans provide such services, and on the \naverage, they spend 24 hours a week doing so. Caregivers aged 65-74 \nprovide an average of 30.7 hours of care per week and individuals aged \n75 and older provide an average of 34.5 hours per week.\n  Women are more likely than men to have chronic conditions, in part \nbecause they have longer life expectancies. These same women are \ncaregivers to other chronically ill persons. In addition, 65 percent of \ncaregivers are female, and of all caregivers, nearly 40 percent are 55 \nyears of age and older.\n  Physicians report that their training does not adequately prepare \nthem to care for this type of patient by providing education and \noffering effective nutritional guidance. Those aspects of care can be \nprovided by allied health professionals, but many of them need better \npreparation to treat and coordinate care for patients with chronic \nconditions. While much emphasis is placed on curative forms of care, \nadditional efforts must be devoted to slowing the progression of \ndisease and its effects.\n  One example of the effectiveness of allied health interventions may \nbe illustrated by a study funded by the National Institute on Aging, \nthe National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, and the Agency \nfor Health Care Policy and Research--since renamed the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality. The investigation showed that \nsignificant benefits resulted from a 9-month occupational therapy \nintervention intended to reduce health-related declines urban, \nmultiethnic, independent-living older adults. The majority of study \nparticipants, 73 percent, lived alone and 26 percent reported at least \none disability. Important health-related benefits attributable to the \nintervention continued over a 6-month interval in the absence of \nfurther treatment.\n\n  The bill my colleagues and I introduce today, like the Nurse \nReinvestment Act in the 107th Congress, is intended to provide \nincentives for individuals to seek and complete high quality allied \nhealth education and training. Furthermore, the bill will provide \nadditional funding to ensure that such education and training can be \nprovided to allied health students so that the U.S. healthcare industry \nwith have a supply of allied health professionals needed to support the \nNation's health care system in this decade and beyond.\n  The bill offers allied health education, practice, and retention \ngrants. Education grants will be used to expand the enrollment in \nallied health education programs, especially by underrepresented racial \nand ethnic minority students, and provide educational opportunities \nthrough new technologies and methods, including distance-learning. \nPractice grants are intended to establish or expand allied health \npractice arrangements in noninstitutional settings to demonstrate \nmethods that will improve access to primary health care in rural areas \nand other medically underserved communities. Retention grants are \nintended to promote career advancement for allied health personnel.\n  Grants will also be made available to health care facilities to \nenable them to\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\ncarry out demonstrations of models and best practices in allied health \nfor the purpose of developing innovative strategies or approaches for \nretention of allied health professionals. These grants will be awarded \nto a variety of geographic regions, and to a range of different types \nand sizes of facilities, including facilities located in rural, urban, \nand suburban areas.\n  Furthermore, this bill will give the Secretary of HHS, acting through \nthe Administrator of HRSA, the authority to enter into an agreement \nwith any institution that offers an eligible allied health education \nprogram to establish and operate a faculty loan fund to increase the \nnumber of qualified allied health faculty. Loans may be granted to \nfaculty who are pursuing a full-time course of study or, at the \ndiscretion of the Secretary, a part-time course of study in an advanced \ndegree program.\n  I am especially proud of the provisions of this legislation regarding \nthe National Health Service Corps program, the brain child of Senator \nWarren Magnuson of Washington. The NHSC program, of course, encourages \nstudents in the health professions such as doctors and dentists to \nserve in underserved areas throughout our nation in return for loan \nrepayment assistance. And, like the NHSC program, this Allied Health \nReinvestment Act will establish a scholarship program that provides \nscholarships to individuals seeking allied health education in exchange \nfor service by those individuals in rural and other medically \nunderserved areas with allied health personnel shortages.\n  There are a number of organizations supporting this bill, and I thank \nthem for that support. Among them, the list includes, but is not \nlimited to:\n\n     Washington State Hospital Association\n     Health Work Force Institute (Seattle, WA)\n     American Association for Respiratory Care\n     American Association of Community Colleges\n     American Clinical Laboratory Association\n     American Dental Hygienists' Association\n     American Dietetic Association\n     American Health Information Management Association\n     American Hospital Association\n     American Physical Therapy Association\n     American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science\n     American Society for Clinical Pathology\n     American Society of Radiologic Technologists\n     Association of Academic Health Centers\n     College of Health Deans\n     Midwest Regional Deans Group\n     Myositis Association\n     National Association of EMS Educators\n     National Cancer Registrars Association\n     National Network of Health Career Programs in Two-Year \n         Colleges\n     Northeast Regional Deans Group\n\n  In addition to these organizations, I would also like to express my \nappreciation to the Association of Schools of Allied Health \nProfessions, ASAHP, for its support of the legislation as well as its \nongoing efforts to address the need for allied health professionals and \nallied health faculty.\n  ASAHP, founded in 1967, has a membership that includes 108 \ninstitutions of higher learning throughout the United States, as well \nas several hundred individual members. ASAHP publishes a quarterly \njournal and also conducts an annual survey of member institutions. This \nannual survey, called the ``Institutional Profile Survey,'' is used \nfor, among other purposes, collecting student application and \nenrollment data. These data substantiate that there is a pressing need \nto address existing allied health workforce shortages, which have been \nfurther exacerbated by declines in enrollment that have occurred for 4 \nstraight years.\n  In the survey conducted during the period September-November 2004 for \nthe 2004-2005 class starting in fall 2004, the results from 90 academic \ninstitutions indicate that in 16 of the 20 professions studied, \navailable classroom seats were not filled. For example, only 33 percent \nof enrollment capacity was reached for health information management \nprograms in these schools. Given the emphasis on increasing the use of \ninformation technology in health care such as conversion to electronic \npatient records, that figure is disturbingly low.\n  Similarly, the survey shows that enrollment levels were low in the \nfollowing professions: rehabilitation counseling, 44 percent, emergency \nmedical sciences, 66 percent, cytotechnology, 69 percent, and medical \ntechnology, 77 percent. Severe workforce shortages already exist in the \ntwo laboratory professions and emergency medical personnel will play a \nkey role as first responders in dealing with any bioterrorism incident \nthat might occur.\n  Using data from the Institutional Profile Survey, as well as the \nGeneral Accounting Office, U.S. Census Bureau, and other sources, ASAHP \nhas compiled what I believe to be a compelling rationale in its support \nfor the Allied Health Reinvestment Act that Senators Bingaman, \nLieberman, and I introduce today. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof this Rationale for an Allied Health Reinvestment Act from the \nAssociation of Schools of Allied Health Professions be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Rationale for an Allied Health Reinvestment Act\n\n       Led by the Association of Schools of Allied Health \n     Professions, a Washington-DC based organization with 108 \n     colleges and universities as members, a coalition of 30 \n     national organizations supports the enactment of an Allied \n     Health Reinvestment Act.\n       The well-being of the U.S. population depends to a \n     considerable extent on having access to high quality health \n     care, which requires the presence of an adequate supply of \n     competently-prepared allied health professionals. Workforce, \n     demographic, and epidemiologic imperatives are the driving \n     forces behind the need to have such legislation enacted.\n\n\n                        The Workforce Imperative\n\n       Many allied health professions are characterized by \n     existing workforce shortages, declining enrollments in \n     academic institutions, or a combination of both factors. \n     Hospital officials have reported vacancy rates of 18 percent \n     among radiologic technologists and 10 percent among \n     laboratory technologists, plus they indicated more difficulty \n     in recruiting these same professionals than two years prior.\n       Fitch, a leading global rating agency that provides the \n     world's credit markets with credit opinions, indicates that \n     labor expenses due to personnel shortages will continue to \n     plague hospitals and is the biggest financial concern for \n     that sector because it typically costs up to twice normal \n     equivalent wages to fill gaps with temporary agency help.\n       The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that in the \n     period 1998-2008, a total of 93,000 positions in clinical \n     laboratory science need to be provided in the form of \n     creating 53,000 new jobs and filling 40,000 existing \n     vacancies. Of the 9,000 openings per year, academic \n     institutions are producing only 4,990 graduates annually. BLS \n     projections in 2004 show that nine of the 10 fastest growing \n     occupations are health or computer (information technology) \n     occupations.\n       Accredited respiratory therapy programs in 2000 graduated \n     5,512 students--21% fewer than the 6,062 graduates in 1999. \n     In 2001, the number of graduates from these schools fell \n     another 20% to 4,437. The BLS expects employment of \n     respiratory therapists to increase faster than the average of \n     all occupations, increasing from 21% to 35% through 2010. The \n     aging population and an attendant rise in the incidence of \n     respiratory ailments, including asthma and COPD, and \n     cardiopulmonary diseases drive this demand.\n       Employment growth in schools will result from expansion of \n     the school-age population and extended services for disabled \n     students. Therapists will be needed to help children with \n     disabilities prepare to enter special education programs.\n       The American Hospital Association has identified declining \n     enrollment in health education programs as a factor leading \n     to critical shortages of health care professionals. That \n     assessment is buttressed by data from 90 institutions \n     belonging to the Association of Schools of Allied Health \n     Professions. The following professions were unable to reach \n     enrollment capacity over a three-year period: cardiovascular \n     perfusion technology, cytotechnology, dietetics, emergency \n     medical sciences, health administration, health information \n     management, medical technology, occupational therapy, \n     rehabilitation counseling, respiratory therapy, and \n     respiratory therapy technician.\n       Given the level of anxiety over the possibility of \n     terrorist attacks occurring in this country, in a study \n     released by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on April 8, \n     2003 that focused on the nation's adequacy of preparedness \n     against bioterrorism, it was reported that shortages in \n     clinical laboratory personnel exist in state and local public \n     health departments, laboratories, and hospitals. Moreover, \n     these shortages are a major concern that is difficult to \n     remedy.\n       Laboratories play a critical role in the detection and \n     diagnosis of illnesses resulting from exposure to either \n     biological or chemical agents. No therapy or prophylaxis can \n     be initiated without laboratory identification and \n     confirmation of the agent in question. Laboratories need to \n     have adequate capacity and necessary staff to test clinical \n     and environmental samples in order to identify an\n\n[[Page S1807]]\n\n     agent promptly so that proper treatment can be started and \n     infectious diseases prevented from spreading.\n       Meanwhile, the U.S population continues to become more \n     racially and ethnically diverse. A health care workforce is \n     needed that better reflects the population they serve. \n     Practitioners must become more attuned to cultural \n     differences in order to facilitate communication and enhance \n     health care quality.\n\n\n                       The Demographic Imperative\n\n       The U.S. Census Bureau reports that rapid growth of the \n     population age 65 and over will begin in 2011 when the first \n     of the baby-boom generation reaches age 65 and will continue \n     for many years. The larger proportions of the population in \n     older age groups result in part from sustained low fertility \n     levels and from relatively larger declines in mortality at \n     older ages in the latter part of the 20th century. From 1900 \n     to 2000, the proportion of persons 65 and over went from 4.1 \n     percent to 12.4 percent.\n       In the 20th century, the total population more than \n     tripled, while the 65 years and older population grew more \n     than tenfold, from 3.1 million in 1900 to 35.0 million in \n     2000.\n       Among the older population, the cohort 85 years and over \n     increased from 122,000 in 1900 to 4.2 million in 2000. Since \n     1940, this age group increased at a more rapid rate than 65-\n     to-74 year olds and 75-to-85 year olds in every decade. As a \n     proportion of the older population, the 85 and over group \n     went from being four percent of the older population to 12 \n     percent between 1900 and 2000.\n\n\n                     The Epidemiological Imperative\n\n       The baby-boom generation's movement into middle age, a \n     period when the incidence of heart attack and stroke \n     increases, will produce a higher demand for therapeutic \n     services. Medical advances now enable more patients with \n     critical problems to survive. These patients may need \n     extensive therapy.\n       According to Solucient, a major provider of information for \n     health care providers, profound demographic shifts over the \n     next twenty-five years will result in significant increases \n     in the demand for inpatient acute care services if current \n     utilization patterns do not change. An aging baby-boom \n     generation, increasing life expectancy, rising fertility \n     rates, and continued immigration will undoubtedly increase \n     the volume of inpatient hospitalizations and significantly \n     alter the mix of acute care services required by patients \n     over the next quarter century. Nationwide, demographic \n     changes alone could result in a 46 percent increase in acute \n     care bed demand by 2027. Total acute care admissions could \n     also increase by almost 13 million cases in the next quarter \n     century--a growth of 41 percent from the current number of \n     national admissions. Currently, the aged nationwide account \n     for about 40 percent of inpatient admissions and about 49 \n     percent of beds. By 2027, they could make up a majority of \n     acute care services--51 percent of admissions and 59 percent \n     of beds.\n       Along with the aging of the population came an increase in \n     the number of Americans living with one, and often more than \n     one, chronic condition. Today, it is estimated that 125 \n     million Americans live with a chronic condition, and by 2020 \n     as the population ages, that number will increase to an \n     estimated 157 million, with 81 million of them having two or \n     more chronic conditions. Twenty-five percent of individuals \n     with chronic conditions have some type of activity \n     limitations. Two-thirds of Medicare spending is for \n     beneficiaries with five or more chronic conditions.\n       Many individuals with chronic conditions rely on family \n     caregivers. Approximately nine million Americans provide such \n     services, and on the average, they spend 24 hours a week \n     doing so. Caregivers age 65-74 provide an average of 30.7 \n     hours of care per week and individuals age 75 and older \n     provide an average of 34.5 hours per week.\n       Women are more likely than men to have chronic conditions, \n     in part because they have longer life expectancies. These \n     same women are caregivers to other chronically ill persons. \n     In addition, 65 percent of caregivers are female, and of all \n     caregivers, nearly 40 percent are 55 years of age and older.\n       Physicians report that their training does not adequately \n     prepare them to care for this type of patient in areas such \n     as providing education and offering effective nutritional \n     guidance. Allied health professionals can provide those \n     aspects of care, but many of them need better preparation to \n     treat and coordinate care for patients with chronic \n     conditions. While much emphasis is placed on curative forms \n     of care, additional efforts must be devoted to slowing the \n     progression of disease and its effects.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 473\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Allied Health Reinvestment \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Census Bureau and other reports \n     highlight the increased demand for acute and chronic \n     healthcare services among both the general population and a \n     rapidly growing aging portion of the population.\n       (2) The calls for reduction in medical errors, increased \n     patient safety, and quality of care have resulted in an \n     amplified call for allied health professionals to provide \n     healthcare services.\n       (3) Several allied health professions are characterized by \n     workforce shortages, declining enrollments in allied health \n     education programs, or a combination of both factors, and \n     hospital officials have reported vacancy rates in positions \n     occupied by allied health professionals.\n       (4) Many allied health education programs are facing \n     significant economic pressure that could force their closure \n     due to an insufficient number of students.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide \n     incentives for individuals to seek and complete high quality \n     allied health education and training and provide additional \n     funding to ensure that such education and training can be \n     provided to allied health students so that the United States \n     healthcare industry with have a supply of allied health \n     professionals needed to support the health care system of the \n     United States in this decade and beyond.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the bankruptcy bill. Today we were able to accommodate \nseveral opening statements on the bill, and I hope that we can make \nreal progress in the amendment process tomorrow. We anticipate that \namendments will be offered prior to the policy luncheon recess. \nHowever, as I mentioned earlier today, I do not anticipate a vote on \nany amendment until after the policy luncheons. Again, I encourage all \nMembers who may have amendments to the bill to contact the cloakrooms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at approximately 11 o'clock tomorrow, when \nwe finish morning business, Senator Durbin will be here to offer the \nfirst amendment. We have had good opening statements by the two \nmanagers of the bill. I do not know if Senator Hatch will be managing \nthe bill or Senator Specter. It was good to see him here. A long \nstatement by Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the committee, was \ngiven today.\n  We are going to start offering amendments, and if people want to make \nstatements, there will be time during this bill--there will be quorum \ncalls and they will be able to do that. We are going to try to limit \nthose as much as we can and move forward. Senator Durbin's amendment \nwill be one relative to bankruptcy.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in terms of scheduling a vote--we will have \nmore information on that tomorrow--again, it will be after the policy \nluncheon on the first amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/28/senate-section/article/S1811-6", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
