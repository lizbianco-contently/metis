Mr. President, I again want to congratulate the new \nleadership in the Senate for the 110th Congress. Democrats 2 days ago \nelected their leadership and the Republicans yesterday elected our \nleadership. A lot of planning is underway for the 110th Congress. As \neveryone knows, we have before us the objective of finishing the \nbusiness of the 109th Congress, both over the course of today and \npossibly tomorrow, and then in a period that will begin the week of \nDecember 4, and possibly continue into the week following that. Both \nthe Democratic leader and I have outlined what we have to accomplish. \nIt is still a very long list in terms of appropriations bills, in terms \nof the United States-India nuclear agreement, in terms of potentially \nother trade agreements. We have tax extenders and a whole range of \nissues.\n  The Democratic leader and I will go into a quorum call very shortly \nand we will finalize the plan for today. But as we stated yesterday, \nbefore we leave this week--either tomorrow or we could finish later \ntonight--we do need to finish the United States-India nuclear \nagreement. We talked yesterday in our own conference about the \nimportance of that particular piece of legislation, legislation that \nall our colleagues are familiar with, and we have a unanimous consent \nagreement to proceed to that with a fixed number of amendments. If you \nlook at the amendments, it is clear that we won't have to do all of \nthose amendments on that legislation. So I am confident that we can and \nwe will finish that bill before we leave.\n  We do have an understanding that we will go to the agriculture \nappropriations bill as well. At some point I want to be able to do that \nand hopefully we can work out the details on how we can accomplish at \nleast starting that particular bill, with the objective of finishing \nthe United States-India nuclear agreement before we leave. So in the \nnext few minutes we will be coming back with an announcement of that \nschedule as agreed to, but we will finish that bill before we leave.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S10978-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10978]]\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I think it is so important that we do \nwhatever we can to pass this nuclear agreement that has been negotiated \nwith India. India is the largest democracy in the world and we have had \nsuch tremendous relations with them over the last number of years. I \nthink it would send a great sign to the rest of the world that we are \nable to work on issues of this importance and actually get it done. I \nsurely hope we can do this. I feel confident we can. There are \namendments and people can debate them. When the managers of the bill \nhave heard enough, if necessary they can move to table, or whatever it \ntakes to move these along. Senator Biden on Tuesday said there are a \nlot of these amendments he is aware of that they could work out or \naccept.\n  So I am hopeful we can finish today, tonight, or tomorrow, and there \nis no reason we shouldn't be able to. We have a number of amendments \nthat have been locked in and there is no way this matter should not be \ncompleted. I think it is very important that we go into the \nThanksgiving period with knowing that we have been able to work out \nsomething between two great democracies.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be back with the plans here shortly \nafter I talk to the Democratic leader, and in the meantime we will be \nin a period of morning business. Again, the United States-India nuclear \nagreement is something we will complete before we leave and is the \norder of the day. We should be able to go to that very early this \nmorning, maybe as soon as 20 minutes from now. That will be the plan, \nto proceed through those amendments. There is one amendment we may have \nto go into a closed session to debate, and the details will be \nannounced for that as well.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the elections are behind us now and we are \nlooking forward to the next Congress which will be seated on January \n4--the 110th Congress. We have in town a number of newly elected \nSenators and their spouses. A number of us--Senator Alexander, Senator \nVoinovich, Senator Pryor, and myself--have been involved, along with \nthe Secretary of the Senate, in holding orientation for new Senators \nand their spouses. On Tuesday night we were over at the National \nArchives and we had the opportunity to have a reception there and a \ndinner. The reception turned out to be a tour of the National Archives \nand the opportunity to see firsthand original copies of the \nConstitution, the Bill of Rights, handwritten letters from George \nWashington to all kinds of people, and from Abraham Lincoln to all \nkinds of people. We actually looked at the original Bill of Rights \nwhere we found that there were actually 12 amendments proposed to the \nConstitution, not 10. Two were not actually adopted. It was interesting \nto see and to go back over 200 years to the history and formation of \nour country, to focus on it and to think about it and reflect on it.\n  When the Constitutional Convention was held, just up the Delaware \nRiver from where I live in Wilmington, DE, and up in Philadelphia, \nwhenever the Founding Fathers were getting into a tough time trying to \ncome to consensus or agreement on one issue or the other that they were \ngrappling with, a lot of times they would take a break and pray about \nit. When the inauguration of President Washington occurred in New York \nCity, when they finished the inauguration, they didn't go off and hold \nbig parties and balls, but they actually went to a church and prayed \ntogether and had a worship service. In fact, I am told over in the \nHouse of Representatives, when our country was young, President \nJefferson was participating in worship services held there. Even now, \n207 years later, we still begin each day's session here in the Senate, \nas they do in the House, with a prayer. We have Bible study groups that \nmeet on Thursday with the Senate Chaplain, Barry Black. We have done \nthat for a number of years. Senator Coleman, who has been one of our \nleaders in a Wednesday morning prayer breakfast, and Mark Pryor from \nArkansas have led that for a number of years.\n  So faith, from the beginning of our foundation as a country, has been \nimportant to us, to guide us as a nation, and to guide us today in our \nown personal lives.\n  When the Constitution was written and the Bill of Rights was written, \nthe idea was not to establish an organized religion; the idea was to \nmake sure people were free to practice whatever faith they wanted, and \nto be respectful of people of different faiths and the fact that people \ncan worship as they see fit or choose not to worship at all. One of the \nstrengths of our Nation is our faith, but another of the strengths of \nour Nation is the respect we have for people of different faiths. We \nhave people in this body who are Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish. We \nworship the same God, just a bit differently.\n  One of the things we try to do during the course of the week is to \nuse our faith. Whether we happen to be Presbyterian, Mormon, or Jewish, \nhow do we use that faith to help guide us in the policies we adopt for \nour country and for the people we represent? I feel fortunate to live \nin a country where we are free to worship God as we see fit. I think \nthere is a real opportunity here for us in the Senate as we try to put \nour country back together and begin to work together after a rough-and-\ntumble election to find ways that we can use our faith to figure out \nour path, and to better ensure the people in this country have health \ncare, that folks have decent jobs, that folks get a good education, and \nthat we can bind the wounds we have opened over the last several months \nand to move forward as a nation.\n  I say how pleased I am to have a chance to work with Senator Coleman \nfrom Minnesota and how much I appreciate the great leadership he has \nshown in bringing a bunch of us together on Wednesday mornings. I \nusually can't get here on Wednesday morning. I go back and forth on the \ntrain to Delaware almost every night, so I can't be there for many \nWednesday mornings for that type of fellowship. But I oftentimes join \nmy colleagues, including Senator Lincoln of Arkansas and others, on \nThursday right down the hall here for a Bible study group that is a \nlittle bit like an adult Sunday school class with the Senate Chaplain, \naffording us the opportunity to read scripture together, reflect \ntogether, to pray for one another, and to be nourished spiritually.\n\n[[Page S10979]]\n\n  I am delighted to be here with Senator Coleman today, and I thank him \nfor his leadership.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Carper for his \nleadership. Next week is actually National Bible Week. I think it has \nbeen celebrated since 1941. The Senator from Delaware is one of the \ncochairs of that. Part of what I think is the purpose of it and the \nimportance of it is to reflect a little bit on the value, the \nimportance of the Bible and of faith in our lives. And we do bring \ndifferent faith perspectives and different historical perspectives. I \nhave a great sense of almost envy a little bit about being from a State \nthat goes back to the very beginning, to the time of the Founders. The \nMinnesota journey has been a little briefer journey, a challenging \njourney when the early settlers were coming out and landing. It was \npretty cold in the winter and it could be blistering hot in the summer. \nYou kind of reflect on your own mortality. To this day, we stand now in \nthe 21st century, and one of the things faith does--and we heard it \nfrom the Chaplain, if you listened to the Chaplain's intonation when \nthe prayer began, calling upon God for wisdom, in a sense humility, \nthat even in this august Chamber it is important for us and our \ncolleagues to have. I think faith gives you that, requires that of \nyou. Alvin Toffler, in ``Future Shock,'' talked about the geometric \nrate of change--everything is moving so quickly, and reflected in that \nis the importance of some island of stability. One of the things that \nfaith does for those of us in this body is, in a sea of change, it \nprovides us with stability. It is an island. Everything else is moving \nvery quickly around us, but if you look into the Bible, look into the \nHebrew Torah, you find those kinds of rooted values--the social \ncompact, the necessity to help the poor, the necessity to raise your \nvoices on behalf of those who are oppressed, in bondage. All those \nvalues are rooted in these books that we still, then, reflect on and \nstudy today. I think it is important for us to do that.\n\n  One of the things, by the way, we have been doing is we have a \nNational Prayer Breakfast. Senator Pryor and I got to chair that this \nyear. I recntly put into the Congressional Record the entire program, \nthe transcript. I urge my colleagues to read it, take a look at it. \nThere are fascinating reflections from King Abdallah from Jordan. The \nrock star Bono was the chief speaker. He said he is not a man of the \ncloth, unless your cloth is leather, but then he went on to talk about \nhis own faith journey. He went on to say he used to wake up all the \ntime and pray that God blessed a certain thing that he did. Now what he \ntalks about is looking at and kind of putting his efforts into the \nthings that God wants done, that He has already blessed, trying to \nfigure out what is the right thing to do.\n  At a time when the partisan divide is so great--we see it on C-SPAN--\nwhat I think our faith has done, what it does for my colleagues and for \nme in fellowship with my colleagues is, for those brief--those moments, \nI would not say brief moments; actually, they are extended moments--it \nallows us to get past that and recognize what is in the heart of a \ncolleague.\n  In the end, I hope it is a mitigating factor, something that then \nlessens the divide that we see so often played out on the screen and \nplayed out on TV. The things that bind us are so much more powerful \nthan the things that separate us. We do it, I believe, with a sense of \nhumility.\n  I was the mayor of Saint Paul, MN, the capital city. We say Saint \nPaul is the city of two cathedral domes. There is the dome of the State \ncapitol and then the dome of the magnificent Cathedral of Saint Paul. \nThe dome of the cathedral is on the highest plane of the city, and I \nsay it is a reflection of who is in charge, and it is not the Governor \nor State legislature, if we reflect on that in a positive way.\n  There are mad men who use religion and holy books to do terrible \nthings, but those are mad men. That is not what faith is all about. At \na time of great change and the world moving so quickly, I know for me, \npersonally, and my colleagues, we find refuge, we find solace, we find \na sense of peace in reflecting upon the traditions that brought us to \nthis floor, to this moment, and hopefully that allows us to operate in \na way in which we do those good things--those good things that we see \nourselves.\n  One of my favorite quotes is from Maimonides, who says each of us \nmust act as if the world were held in balance and any single act of \ngoodness on our part could tip the scale. I believe that every day of \nmy life. That is what faith brings to me and brings to us.\n  I see my colleague from Arkansas is here. Yesterday, we were visiting \nthe new Senators, our new colleagues, and kind of moving them to this \nfamily. I will, again, say to my new colleagues that I urge them, on \nthe floor of the Senate, to participate in the National Prayer \nBreakfast. The President is there, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nmembers of the Supreme Court and leaders from 170-something countries. \nThis is not just a Senate thing or a U.S. thing, this is a global thing \nof great importance, as we saw in our last prayer breakfast, where you \nhave King Abdallah, a direct descendant of Mohammed, Norm Coleman, a \nJewish boy from Minnesota, and Mark Pryor, a Christian from Arkansas, \ncoming together on the platform. I hope that has meaning beyond that \nsingle day.\n  With that, I see my colleague from Arkansas and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am so proud to join my colleagues this \nmorning, and I especially thank my colleague from Delaware for his \nservice as the Senate chairperson of the National Bible Week this year \nand for preserving time this morning for our observance of this annual \ncelebration. I also want to say a very special thanks to my colleague, \nNorm Coleman, the Senator from Minnesota, who does a tremendous job. We \nwork together on so many different things, but yesterday it was great \nto be able to sit down and visit with the new Members, the new Senators \ncoming into this body and talk to them about how to keep their life \nrich; not just to do their jobs as Senators but to take care of \nthemselves and to make sure that their journey in life stays strong. We \nall know, in this journey that we all share on this Earth, this \nincredible blessing we have been given to live this journey here on \nEarth, if we keep that journey strong, then we will always be better \nSenators.\n  I could not have found a better partner in communicating that than my \ngood colleague from Minnesota, and I appreciate him so much for that.\n  I am very grateful to be here to speak about the Bible, in \nrecognition of this annual National Bible Week and certainly its \nimportance in my life, what it has meant to me. In my family, growing \nup in east Arkansas, my dad was a farmer. We are a seventh-generation \nArkansas farm family. We go back to our roots there along the \nMississippi River. Actually, the first Lambert, which is my maiden \nname, who came to Arkansas was a Presbyterian minister who was sent as \na missionary to the Native Americans who lived in that area. It was \nlong before Arkansas was a State, and again it is a huge part of my \nheritage where, as a Presbyterian minister and a Christian, Rev. Jordan \nB. Lambert came across the border as a missionary to carry his faith \ninto the West.\n\n  In my family, we were all introduced to the Bible at a very early \nage, and we were taught how to turn to its teachings early and often \nfor guidance in our daily lives and what we needed to make this \njourney, our journey, each of us, our individual journey on this Earth, \na full one, one that not only was fulfilling for us but, more \nimportantly, fulfilling to our fellow man.\n  I can remember, as a young teenager, coming to Sunday school on \nSunday mornings. I remember one of my Sunday school teachers who would \ntake us every Sunday into our Sunday school room, and we made this huge \nBible village out of clay and papier-mache. It was wonderful because it \ntaught us so much of the times, of the Old Testament and the New \nTestament. It was incredible how we built this.\n  I realize now, later in life, that that was a time to reflect, \nreflect on the writings and the times that the Bible brings to us \nbecause, as we sat there, very curiously and very diligently creating \nout of clay and papier-mache this Bible village, we talked. We talked \nto each other. We talked to the Sunday school teacher, the adult who \nwas there to help guide us. As she read Scripture to us and we made \nthese\n\n[[Page S10980]]\n\nthings, we talked about our experiences as young teenagers. We talked \nabout what we were going through in school, the cruel words that others \nmay have presented to us or the new student who had come to class and \nwho was not being well received or someone whose family was ill or had \na tremendous tragedy. We talked about these things as we created this \nvillage, and then we realized, through those Bible teachings and \nthrough those stories that we, too, were living that word--hopefully--\nand learning how better to live that word in our teenage years and in \nour adult years.\n  Without question, for me, the Bible is the most profound book in \nlife, and there is no doubt that its lessons shape the type of person I \nam; the type of person I strive to become each and every day, working \nhard to do my best; the type of parent I want as an example for my \nchildren as they grow up and they learn these stories; and the type of \nSenator I want to be to help lead this country.\n  It is no secret to any of us that the Members of this incredible body \nare very blessed and fortunate in so many different ways. But what does \nthat mean, exactly, and particularly to those who are scholars of \nBible? I am not a Bible scholar, I wish I were, but I do look to the \nBible for that guidance and as a part of my faith, as the Senator from \nDelaware said, it is a light. It is a lamp unto my feet. But the Bible \nteaches me: To whom much is given, much is required. If you look around \nthroughout this body and realize how blessed we truly are, our devotion \nto public service, hopefully, comes from a desire to live by the types \nof teachings that the Bible gives us and that is to help the least \namong us. It doesn't just teach us to clothe those who are naked. It \ndoesn't just teach us to feed those who are hungry. Those are the \nimportant parts. But I never shall forget a lesson I learned in person \nworking in a soup kitchen in downtown Washington, cleaning up tables \nafter we, our Bible study group, had served a breakfast, which we did \non a monthly basis. I was cleaning up those tables and moving to what \nwas the next thing in life, which was heading off to work, there was a \nman sitting at the last table and, as I began to break it down, I asked \nhim:\n\n       Are you still hungry? Is there something more that you \n     would like?\n       No, just 10 minutes of your time. Could you just please sit \n     and visit with me for 10 minutes?\n\n  I realized it was not just the nourishment that he needed. He needed \nhis soul to be fed as well.\n  If I think about all of the most important teachings in the Bible, I \nthink about how important it is for us to nourish one another, \nDemocrats to nourish Republicans and Republicans to nourish Democrats; \nhow important it is in this body that we feed one another's souls with \nthe kind of loving care that we are taught about in the Bible.\n  As a Senator, I thoroughly believe that government can be a weapon of \ngood, if we adhere to and follow the basic message of the Bible's \nteaching of love. I think that is, without a doubt, the most clear \nmessage that comes there--love, care, and respect for our fellow man.\n  Perhaps my favorite Bible lesson proclaims: Let us not love in word \nbut in deed and in truth. In an environment that gets way too \npolitical, and so often it does, it is so incredibly important for all \nof us to look to that lesson.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and especially thank my colleagues, for \ncoming here to recognize what an important role the Bible does play in \nso many of our lives and what a wonderful opportunity it gives us to \nnourish each other's soul on a daily basis.\n  I yield to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, how much time do we have on our 20 \nminutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 55 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. CARPER.

Is there objection? The Senator \nfrom North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall not \nobject, Senator Conrad is not on the floor. I am certain this will be \nacceptable to him. His amendment will modify the disaster aid amendment \nthat was put in the Senate appropriations bill in the Senate committee. \nI wish to be recognized following Senator Conrad's statement on this \nintroduction, to be part of that discussion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. What this means is, to clarify, in a few minutes we will \nbe going to the United States-India legislation.

Madam President, at some point today following the debate \nwith respect to the India security agreement, we will by unanimous \nconsent have an opportunity to have the agriculture appropriations bill \non the floor. My colleague Senator Conrad will offer an amendment to \nthat bill which will amend a provision that I added to the bill in the \nSenate Appropriations Committee.\n  My colleague Senator Burns and I added a farm disaster amendment. My \ncolleague Senator Conrad has been working on an amendment that will \nexpand that to include the 2007 disaster\n\n[[Page S10981]]\n\nlegislation. Because we are going to have an agriculture appropriations \nbill on the floor today at some point, I thought it was interesting to \ncall attention to a story that was in today's newspaper.\n  Our family farmers--many of whom got hurt badly with the devastating \ndroughts and some of whom have been hurt by floods and so on--as I said \nyesterday are the economic all-stars of this country. They get up in \nthe morning and do chores. They take showers afterwards--not before. \nThey risk everything they have, hoping their crops will grow. They \nproduce foodstuff for a hungry world. They are the economic all-stars \nin this country.\n  But let me point out that in this morning's newspaper the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture has said they are going to eliminate \n``hunger''--actually eliminate the word ``hungry.'' The U.S. Government \nhas vowed that Americans will never be hungry again, but they may \nexperience ``very low food security.'' The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture has decided they are not going to use the term ``hungry'' \nas they define that number of people in this country who do not have \nenough to eat and are hungry.\n  There is something called ``an ache in your belly.'' There are hunger \npangs for people who do not have enough to eat. Apparently that is not \ngoing to be called ``hunger'' anymore. Those folks who can't find \nanything to eat and are suffering the pangs of hunger and the ravage to \ntheir body because of not having food are going to be called people \nwith ``very low food security.''\n  If you don't have anything to eat, that is a ``very low food \nsecurity,'' but it doesn't describe in English what is happening. In \nEnglish, these are people who are hungry.\n  I don't understand sometimes the bureaucracy. I was here years ago \nwhen ketchup was described as a vegetable, a part of a daily meal. Of \ncourse, that was never very right. It is not a vegetable. Now they are \ngoing to eliminate ``hunger.''\n  Throughout the years I have been here, I have served on the hunger \ncommittee when I was in the U.S. House, and I toured much of the \nworld--going to refugee camps, been around parts of this country. I \nhave seen hunger. I have seen devastating hunger.\n  I would desire to eliminate hunger, if we can. Our farmers are part \nof being able to do that at some point with the prodigious quantities \nof good food which they produce. We are not going to eliminate hunger \nby taking ``hunger'' out of the lexicon of the Department and replacing \nit with ``very low food security.'' I think it is not about the \nterminology; it is about the will. Do we have the will to decide in a \ncountry such as ours to address the issue of hunger and make sure they \nhave enough to eat.\n  We have programs in this country such as food stamps and the WIC \nProgram and other programs to try to address some of these issues. Now \napparently we have some folks in the bureaucracy who will address it by \nchanging the words to ``very low food security.''\n  Remember that when we later today talk about family farmers and the \nplight many of them have. They are the ones planting the seed and \ngrowing the crops--or at least trying to do that, except during the \nyears where there is a disaster when they have serious problems.\n  We have a hungry world. The fact is in this world we circle the Sun. \nOur little planet has 6.3 billion neighbors. Half of them have never \nmade a telephone call and live on less than $2 a day. There is plenty \nof hunger in this country and the world. Eliminating the word \n``hunger'' from the lexicon of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is \nnot addressing the issue of hunger.\n  I yield the floor.

Madam President, we have had a flurry of phone calls and \nconsultations this morning about the dispute that has gone on over the \nlast several days about getting to the agriculture appropriations bill \nso we might consider disaster relief for farmers and ranchers hard hit \nby drought across the country, the third worst drought in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  My understanding of the agreement is that we will go to the India \nnuclear matter but that at some time today we will turn our attention \nto the agriculture appropriations bill and I will have the chance to \noffer the first amendment to that bill. Is that a correct understanding \nof the agreement that has been entered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct in that under the \nunanimous consent entered into earlier we will move to the United \nStates-India legislation, after which the agriculture appropriations \nbill will be taken up. It provides under that agreement for Senator \nConrad to be recognized in order to offer a first-degree amendment \nfollowing the statement of the chairman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Very good. That is my understanding. I appreciate the \nChair confirming that.\n  There are 26 cosponsors of the legislation. It is wholly bipartisan--\nmany Republicans and many Democrats. I want to alert my colleagues that \nat some point we will go to this issue today. It is not specified when, \nas I understand it. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is specified that sometime today we will go to it, and \nafter statements of the Chair and ranking member I will be given an \nopportunity to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of H.R. 3699, that it then be referred to the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and immediately discharged, and that the \nSenate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3699) to provide for the sale, acquisition, \n     conveyance, and exchange of certain real property in the \n     District of Columbia to facilitate the utilization, \n     development, and redevelopment of such property, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I take the opportunity to thank the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee for bringing H.R. 3699 to the floor for \npassage today. The Federal and District of Columbia Government Real \nProperty Act of 2005 is a unique proposal to reevaluate the significant \nFederal property in DC and make some land available to redevelopment by \nthe city. This redevelopment will broaden the District's tax base and \nwill eventually add strength to the city economy. As the ranking \nDemocratic member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the \nDistrict of Columbia I am tasked with my friends on the Government \nAffairs Committee to provide appropriate oversight of the District and \nensure a strong financial condition.\n  The Federal property that will be transferred to the District through \nthis bill will provide for a variety of new projects and there is a \ngreat deal of potential. Reservation 13 is envisioned as a mixed-use \nnew community that will include new housing and businesses, and improve \naccess to existing healthcare facilities. That property also includes \nthe Court Services and\n\n[[Page S10982]]\n\nOffender Services Agency, CSOSA, a Federal entity providing offender \nand defendant oversight in the District. I commend my colleagues for \nincluding a provision in this bill to ensure the CSOSA will remain on \nreservation 13 in a facility which the Federal government has provided \nsignificant resources to renovate. They are doing a tremendous job to \nensure that offenders returning to the city are prepared for the \nchallenges that face them and should continue that good work.\n  In addition, I emphasize my strong support for youth recreation and \neducation opportunities in this bill. Properties all along the \nAnacostia River and elsewhere will now be under the District's control \nto develop and I strongly encourage them to commit to reserving a \nportion of each property for youth recreation. We all know the health \nbenefits to children being outdoors, whether in organized sports or the \nchance to learn about the environment. There are many tremendous youth \nsports organizations in DC that boost kids' self-esteem and oftentimes \nprovide educational support or mentoring at no cost to low income \nchildren. Particularly in an urban area where space is limited it is \ncritical that the District commit to providing opportunities for youth \nto be outdoors.\n  I recognize the important need for outreach to the poorest and most \nvulnerable children in DC. I strongly urge the Anacostia Waterfront \nCorporation to form a partnership with a DC-based organization whose \nmission is to provide environmental education to children in natural \nand historic settings, and particularly to underserved populations. In \nmy work with the District I have always encouraged partnerships with \ncommunity organizations who know the need and how best to meet it and \nthis is a perfect opportunity to create new vibrant partnerships to \nbenefit the community.\n  I thank Senators Collins, Voinovich, Lieberman, and Akaka for their \nhard work on this legislation over the past year. The base of the bill \nwas proposed by the administration in 2005 and we have worked \ncollaboratively with the District government and the Federal agencies \nholding property in the city to develop a sensible approach. I support \nthe goals of this bill to rationalize property in the District and I \nencourage city leaders to ensure youth have a place to play in their \nplans for the property. I urge passage of H.R. 3699 and thank the \nauthorizing committee for their work.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nbill be read three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate, and that \nstatements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3699) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S10982-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10982-S11010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       UNITED STATES-INDIA PEACEFUL ATOMIC ENERGY COOPERATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask that the bill S. 3709, the United \nStates-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act, be called up and \nbe the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. 3709, which the clerk will report.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislation clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3709) to exempt from certain requirements of the \n     Atomic Energy Act of 1954 United States exports of nuclear \n     materials, equipment, and technology to India, and to \n     implement the United States Additional Protocol.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, today the Senate begins consideration of \nlegislation on the U.S.-India Civilian Nuclear Agreement. This \nagreement is the most important strategic diplomatic initiative \nundertaken by President Bush. By concluding this pact and the far-\nreaching set of cooperative agreements that accompany it, the President \nhas embraced a long-term outlook that seeks to enhance the core \nstrength of our foreign policy in a way that will give us new \ndiplomatic options and improve global stability.\n  The Committee on Foreign Relations undertook an extensive review of \nthis agreement. We held four public hearings with testimony from 17 \nwitnesses, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. We received a \nclassified briefing from Undersecretaries of State Nick Burns and Bob \nJoseph. Numerous briefings were held for staff with experts from the \nCongressional Research Service, the State Department, and the National \nSecurity Council. I submitted 174 written questions for the record to \nthe Department of State on details of the agreement and posted the \nanswers on the committee web site.\n  The agreement allows India to receive nuclear fuel, technology, and \nreactors from the United States--benefits that were previously denied \nto India because of its status outside the Nuclear Non-proliferation \nTreaty--NPT. This pact is a lasting incentive for India to abstain from \nfurther nuclear weapons tests and to cooperate closely with the United \nStates in stopping proliferation.\n  The bill before us is an important step toward implementing the \nnuclear agreement with India, but we should understand that it is not \nthe final step in the process. This legislation sets the rules for \nsubsequent congressional consideration of a so-called 123 Agreement \nbetween the U.S. and India. A 123 Agreement is the term for a peaceful \nnuclear cooperation pact with a foreign country under the conditions \noutlined in section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act.\n  Our legislation does not restrict nor does it predetermine \ncongressional action on the forthcoming 123 Agreement. Unlike \nthe adminisiration's original legislative proposal, this bill preserves \ncongressional prerogatives with regard to consideration of a future 123 \nAgreement. Under the administration's original proposal, the 123 \nAgreement would have entered into force 90 days after submission unless \nboth houses of congress voted against it, and with majorities that \ncould overcome a likely Presidential veto. I am pleased the \nadministration changed course on this matter and agreed to submit the \n123 Agreement with India to Congress under normal procedures. This \nmeans that both the House and the Senate must cast a positive vote of \nsupport before the 123 Agreement can enter into force.\n\n  In our view, this better protects Congress's role in the process and \nensures congressional views will be taken into consideration.\n  I thank Senator Biden for his close cooperation on developing this \nimportant bill. It reflects our shared views and concerns. He and his \nstaff were valuable partners in the drafting of this legislation, and \nthe final product is much improved because of their efforts. Together, \nwe have constructed a bill that allows the U.S. to seize an important \nstrategic opportunity, while ensuring a strong congressional oversight \nrole, reinforcing U.S. nonproliferation efforts, and maintaining our \nresponsibilities under the NPT. I also want to thank all members of the \nForeign Relations Committee for their support, and the work of their \nstaffs, in crafting a bill that received the overwhelming support of \nthe committee last June.\n  For the benefit of Senators, I offer the following section by section \nanalysis.\n  Section 101 identifies the bill as the U.S.-India Peaceful Atomic \nEnergy and U.S. Additional Protocol Implementation Act. Sections 102 \nand 103 of the Lugar-Biden bill include sense of the Congress \nprovisions on U.S.-India relations and policy declarations. These \nprovisions give voice to a set of important policy issues involving \nbilateral relations, democratic values, nuclear non-proliferation \nregimes, fissile material production in South Asia, and support for \nIAEA safeguards and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. All of these concerns \nare reinforced by the bill's comprehensive reporting requirements.\n  Section 104 provides waiver authority from provisions in the Atomic \nEnergy Act and removes the prohibition on cooperating with India due to \nits 1998 weapons tests and its existing weapons program. At the same \ntime, section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act, which is preserved under \nthe Lugar-Biden bill, terminates nuclear cooperation if India conducts \na nuclear test, proliferates nuclear weapons or materials, or breaks \nits agreements with the IAEA or the United States.\n  Section 105 of our proposal adopts all of the administration's \nrequirements\n\n[[Page S10983]]\n\nto ensure that India is meeting its nonproliferation commitments. In \naddition, we require that decisions in the Nuclear Suppliers Group \nenabling nuclear trade with India are made by consensus and consistent \nwith its rules. Our aim is to ensure that this multilateral \norganization will continue to play a vital role in global \nnonproliferation efforts.\n  Section 106 prohibits exports of equipment, materials or technology \nrelated to the enrichment of uranium, the reprocessing of spent nuclear \nfuel, or the production of heavy water. The provision allows narrow \nexceptions for the export of these items from the United States to \nIndia if they are for proliferation-resistant activities that involve \nthe United States or have the sponsorship of a recognized international \nbody such as the IAEA. This provision is consistent with the \nadministration's policy regarding such transfers. It would allow \ncooperation in sensitive nuclear areas only if such cooperation could \nbe implemented with no risk of proliferation.\n  Section 107 requires the creation of a system to ensure that no items \nexported to India are diverted to any uses that are not peaceful. This \nsection seeks to ensure U.S. compliance with our NPT obligations.\n  Section 108 requires annual Presidential certifications that India is \nmeeting its commitments under the July 2005 Joint Statement, its \nSeparation Plan, New Delhi's Safeguards Agreement and additional \nprotocol with the IAEA, the 123 Agreement, and applicable U.S. laws \nregarding U.S. exports to India. The President must also certify on an \nannual basis that U.S. trade with India in these areas remains in the \nnational security interests of the United States.\n\n  Section 109 requires that no action be undertaken under this act that \ncould violate any U.S. obligation under the NPT. Section 110 explicitly \nstipulates that if India conducts a nuclear test, U.S.-India civilian \nnuclear cooperation is terminated. Finally, sections 111 and 112 \nclarify India's Missile Technology Control Regime status under U.S. law \nand various terms used in the bill.\n  The U.S.-Indian agreement resulted from a delicately balanced \nnegotiation. Neither side got everything it wanted. Nevertheless, the \nBush administration and the Indian government came to the conclusion \nthat the agreement was in the national security interest of both \ncountries. I urge Senators to vote in favor of this legislation without \nconditions that would kill the agreement.\n  I would also note that Senator Biden and I included an important \npiece of nonproliferation legislation in the bill as title II. In 2004, \nthe Senate ratified the IAEA Additional Protocol, but Congress did not \npass implementing legislation that is required for the treaty to go \ninto effect. President Bush has called on the Senate to act on this \nimportant matter, and the committee voted unanimously in favor of this \nbill in March.\n  The Committee approved this legislation with a bipartisan vote of 16 \nto 2. Furthermore 15 members of the committee asked to be named as \noriginal cosponsors. Since that time, additional Senators have \nrequested to be added as cosponsors.\n  Due to the fact that the legislation was an original bill, the \nParliamentarian ruled that cosponsors were not permitted. This is \nunfortunate because the amount of support our legislation has received \nis impressive. I appreciate the strong support of Senators Biden, \nHagel, Chafee, Allen, Coleman, Voinovich, Alexander, Sununu, Murkowski, \nMartinez, Dodd, Kerry, Nelson, Obama, Cornyn, Bayh, Hutchison, DeWine, \nand Lott.\n  During our markup, the committee rejected an amendment offered by \nSenator Feingold. Under the amendment, the President would have had to \ndetermine with absolute certainty that no U.S. nuclear fuel exports to \nIndia could increase its production of fissile materials for weapons. \nNew Delhi would rightly see this as moving the goalposts--an \nunacceptable unilateral alteration of the pact. If the Feingold \namendment or others like it are included in the final legislation, they \nwould effectively kill the U.S.-India Agreement.\n\n  I would have preferred that the U.S.-India Agreement had included a \ncommitment by New Delhi to stop making nuclear bomb materials, but \nnegotiations did not yield that result. Instead, the Bush \nadministration won an important commitment to negotiate a Fissile \nMaterial Cutoff Treaty. Such a multilateral approach is the best way to \nreduce nuclear tensions and threats associated with an arms race in \nSouth Asia.\n  The Lugar-Biden bill declares it the policy of the United States to \nachieve as quickly as possible a cessation of the production of fissile \nmaterials for nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan. Our bill also \nincludes an annual reporting requirement detailing:\n\n       United States efforts to promote national or regional \n     progress by India and Pakistan in disclosing, securing, \n     capping, and reducing their fissile material stockpiles, \n     pending creation of a world-wide fissile material cut-off \n     regime, including the institution of a Fissile Material Cut-\n     off Treaty.\n\n  I will oppose amendments that delay or impose additional conditions \non the agreement before it can enter into force. The Senate will not \nadvance U.S. national security in this case by making the perfect the \nenemy of the good. We should not hold up the significant \nnonproliferation gains afforded by this initiative in order to seek a \nfissile material cap that India has indicated it will not consider \nabsent similar commitments by Pakistan and China.\n  The United States and India have engaged in initial discussions on a \nmultilateral Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty, FMCT, to be negotiated in \nthe conference on disarmament. We should press for rapid progress in \nthat context. \n  The Indian government has expressed concern about section 106 of our \nbill. This section prohibits the export of any equipment, materials or \ntechnology related to the enrichment of uranium, the reprocessing of \nspent fuel, or the production of heavy water. These technologies are \nnot purely civilian in nature. They are considered critical elements to \na modern nuclear weapons program.\n  This provision in our bill is entirely consistent with President \nBush's policy announcement on this matter at the National Defense \nUniversity on February 11, 2004. In his speech, the President said:\n\n       The 40 nations of the Nuclear Suppliers Group should refuse \n     to sell enrichment and reprocessing equipment and \n     technologies to any state that does not already possess full-\n     scale, functioning enrichment and reprocessing plants. This \n     step will prevent new states from developing the means to \n     produce fissile material for nuclear bombs. Proliferators \n     must not be allowed to cynically manipulate the NPT to \n     acquire the material and infrastructure necessary for \n     manufacturing illegal weapons.\n\n  President Bush also said that ``enrichment and reprocessing are not \nnecessary for nations seeking to harness nuclear energy for peaceful \npurposes.''\n  In response to questions for the record that I submitted, Under \nSecretaries of State Bob Joseph and Nick Burns amplified this \nadministration policy as it applies to the nuclear agreement with \nIndia. They said:\n\n       For the United States, ``full civil nuclear cooperation'' \n     with India means trade in most civil nuclear technologies, \n     including fuel and reactors. But we do not intend to provide \n     enrichment or reprocessing technology to India. As the \n     President said in February 2004, ``enrichment and \n     reprocessing are not necessary for nations seeking to \n     harness nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.'' We do not \n     currently provide enrichment or reprocessing equipment to \n     any country. We will also need to ensure that any \n     cooperation is fully consistent with U.S. obligations \n     under the NPT not to in any way assist India's nuclear \n     weapons program, and with provisions of U.S. law.\n\n  Under Secretaries Burns and Joseph also answered that:\n\n       We do not export enrichment or reprocessing technology to \n     any state. Therefore, full civil nuclear cooperation with \n     India will not include enrichment or reprocessing technology.\n\n  This answer is especially significant, since the phrase ``full civil \nnuclear energy cooperation'' is the phrase taken directly from the July \n2005 joint statement.\n  In response to a question for the record that I submitted to \nSecretary Rice, she responded:\n\n       The U.S. does not foresee transferring heavy water \n     production equipment or technology to India, and the draft \n     bilateral peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement accordingly \n     makes no provisions for such transfers.\n\n  Our committee bill, S. 3709, does not break any new ground in this \narea. This is not a new subject. The answers to these questions have \nbeen on the committee's Web site for months.\n\n[[Page S10984]]\n\nNothing in this bill deviates from the President's policy, and we even \ngo one step further by allowing the flexibility to export those items \nfrom the United States for proliferation-resistant activities with the \nU.S. or under international cooperation. I support section 106, and I \nthink it is important that we take the strong and definitive statements \nmade by President Bush, Secretary Rice, Under Secretary of State Nick \nBurns, and Under Secretary of State Robert Joseph and put them into \nlaw.\n\n  The Indian government has also expressed concern about section 107, \nwhich requires an end-use monitoring program to be carried out with \nrespect to U.S. exports and re-exports of nuclear materials, equipment, \nand technology sold or leased to India. Some have argued that this \nprovision is not needed because IAEA safeguards would verify the use of \nany U.S. exports to India. IAEA safeguards only apply, however, to \nnuclear materials, not to nuclear technology. Sensitive technology of \nthe kind the United States might export to India that can be used in \nIndia's civilian nuclear program could also advance India's nuclear \nweapons program.\n  This type of end-use system is not without precedent, as Congress \nrequired similar recordkeeping for nuclear cooperation with China.\n  An end-use monitoring program can provide increased confidence in \nIndia's separation of its civilian and military nuclear programs. It \nalso would further ensure United States compliance with article I of \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  The provision is not intended to cast doubt on the sincerity of \nIndia's July 18 Joint Statement commitments or its March and May 2006 \nseparation documents. Rather, the committee believes that by building \nand establishing a special program with India, the resulting \ncoordination between India and U.S. regulatory agencies can provide a \nbasis for even greater cooperation and commerce between the two \nnations.\n  Section 107 would confirm that only authorized recipients are \nreceiving nuclear technology; that the nuclear technology identified \nfor transfer will be used only for peaceful safeguarded nuclear \nactivities; that the nuclear technology identified for transfer will \nnot be retransferred without the prior consent of the United States; \nand that facilities, equipment, or materials derived through the use of \ntransferred technology will not be transferred without the prior \nconsent of the United States.\n  This section also requires that, in the absence of IAEA safeguards, \nthe U.S. and India must arrange a bilateral system to ensure that \nsafeguards in India remain on U.S. exports and re-exports in \nperpetuity.\n  Section 107 requirements could be met by applying to India those \nmeasures already governing atomic energy cooperation under the 123 \nAgreement with China. Under Secretary Joseph testified before the \ncommittee that, while the 123 Agreement with India will not provide for \nfull-scope safeguards, it ``will allow for appropriate controls to help \nensure that material or goods provided for civilian purposes remain \nwithin the civilian sector.'' So nothing in section 107 would be \ninconsistent with what may be concluded in the 123 Agreement with India \nitself.\n\n  Title II of the bill includes the committee's IAEA Additional \nProtocol Implementing Legislation. This title permits the Additional \nProtocol the U.S. has concluded with the IAEA to go into effect.\n  In President Bush's 2004 speech at the National Defense University, \nhe called on the Senate to ratify the U.S. Additional Protocol with the \nIAEA. He said:\n\n       We must ensure that the IAEA has all the tools it needs to \n     fulfill its essential mandate. America and other nations \n     support what is called the Additional Protocol, which \n     requires states to declare a broad range of nuclear \n     activities and facilities, and allow the IAEA to inspect \n     those facilities . . . Nations that are serious about \n     fighting proliferation will approve and implement the \n     Additional Protocol. I've submitted the Additional Protocol \n     to the Senate. I urge the Senate to consent immediately to \n     its ratification.\n\n  The Committee on Foreign Relations voted unanimously to approve a \nresolution of ratification on the U.S. Additional Protocol on March 4, \n2004, and the full Senate approved it on March 31 by unanimous consent \nin 2004.\n  Unfortunately the Additional Protocol is not self-executing. Congress \nmust adopt implementing legislation for the United States to submit its \ninstruments of ratification. In other words, implementing legislation \nmust be passed before the Additional Protocol can go into effect. The \nCommittee on Foreign Relations unanimously approved the implementing \nlegislation on March 4, 2006, but efforts to pass the legislation in \nthe full Senate have been unsuccessful due to holds placed by several \nSenators.\n  At a time when the administration and the Congress are demanding that \nIndia conclude such an Additional Protocol as part of its overall \nnuclear arrangements, Congress must muster the political will to act on \nthe implementing legislation. Our credibility as the leader of global \nnonproliferation efforts is at stake. Along with many other nations, we \nare asking the IAEA to perform critical functions aimed at preventing \nnuclear proliferation. An effective IAEA is very much in the national \nsecurity interest of the United States.\n  Some Senators expressed concern that the Additional Protocol and the \nimplementing legislation will make it possible, even likely, that \ninternational inspectors will learn secrets about our nuclear weapons \nprogram. Let me state clearly, nothing could be further from the truth. \nThe Additional Protocol does not contain any new arms control or \ndisarmament obligations for the United States. Although there are \nincreased rights granted to the IAEA for the conduct of inspections in \nthe United States, although there are increased rights granted to the \nIAEA for the conduct of inspections in the United States, the \nadministration has assured the Foreign Relations Committee that the \nlikelihood of an inspection occurring in our country is very low. \nMoreover, even if an inspection under the Additional Protocol is \nrequested, the United States has the full right, through the National \nSecurity Exclusion, to prevent the inspection if we determine that it \ncould be potentially harmful to U.S. national security interests.\n  On July 26, 2006, the National Security Adviser, Steve Hadley, \nexpressed the administration's support for the language in title II. He \nwrote:\n\n       The Administration urges both Houses of Congress to act to \n     complete expeditious action on implementing legislation to \n     enable the United States to meet its obligations under the \n     Additional Protocol.\n\n  More recently, President Bush's Assistant Secretary of State for \nInternational Security and Nonproliferation, John Rood, testified at \nhis confirmation hearing that the administration strongly supports the \nAdditional Protocol and that it is important that the United States \npass implementing legislation.\n\n  I am pleased to report that a compromise was reached between the \nadministration, the Committee on Foreign Relations, and those Senators \nwho expressed concerns about the IAEA Additional Protocol implementing \nlegislation. This is an important step for U.S. nonproliferation \npolicy, and I thank all of the parties involved in the discussions for \ntheir support of those efforts.\n  In conclusion, Madam President, I urge my colleagues to approve the \nU.S.-India agreement. This legislation will allow the United States to \nengage in peaceful nuclear cooperation while safeguarding U.S. national \nsecurity and nonproliferation efforts, as well as congressional \nprerogatives. It is an opportunity to build a vital strategic \npartnership with a nation that shares our democratic values and will \nexert increasing influence on the world stage. We should move forward \nnow.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, today the Senate is engaged in a truly \nhistoric process. When we pass this bill--and I expect we will do \nthat--America will take a giant step closer to approving a major shift \nin United States-India relations. If we are right, this shift will \nincrease the prospects for stability and progress in South Asia and, I \nwould argue, the world at large. The Committee on Foreign Relations has \nworked to move this project forward, while safeguarding the role of \nCongress and minimizing any harm to nuclear nonproliferation policies \nand institutions. There is no one who has been stronger in dealing with \nthe issue of nonproliferation than my colleague, the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee. I have supported him in those efforts for \nyears.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a real close look at the argument that \nis being made by some that this is going to promote the proliferation \nof nuclear weapons. The fact is, I believe it will not.\n  I am going to urge my colleagues at the appropriate time to support \nthis bill. It has been a cliche to speak of the United States-India \nrelationship as a bond between the world's two oldest democracies and \nthe world's two largest democracies, but this cliche is also a fact. \nShared political values are the foundation of our relationship and, I \nwould argue, the raison d'etre for taking a chance for those who are \ndoubtful on this treaty. Both the United States and India believe in \nthe dignity of man and the consent of the governed. Both countries are \nmultiethnic and multireligious. Both countries seek economic and social \nbetterment for their people and believe that it is best achieved \nthrough peaceful change, both domestically and externally. If that were \nthe whole story, however, it would not have taken us six decades to get \nto the moment we are now.\n  For much of the last 60 years, the political structures were trumped \nby geopolitical ones. Democracy in democratic India was often closer to \nthe Soviet Union, while the United States often favored India's rival \nPakistan, particularly during the most undemocratic phase of Pakistan's \nnational history. That alignment was an anomaly of the cold war. Today \nthe United States and Pakistan are important allies in the war on \nterror and, at the same time, today the national interests of the \nUnited States and India are in concert, perhaps more than any time in \nthe past. India and the United States are both status quo powers, at \nleast regarding territory. Neither of us has any claim on any \nneighboring piece of real estate. We face similar challenges from \nextremists and terrorists; in some cases, from the same terrorist \ngroups and same individuals. We share a common desire for stability and \nthe spread of liberal democracy throughout Asia and, indeed, throughout \nthe world. And we share a concern about the world's need for energy, \nespecially energy that does not increase the speed and risk of global \nwarming.\n  The need for new energy supplies is an important underpinning of the \nissues before us today, legislation opening the way for civil nuclear \ncooperation between the United States and India. In time, I hope \nIndia's burgeoning energy needs will prove a spur to a wide variety of \nalternatives to fossil fuels, including solar, wind, and biofuel. On \nmany of these, India has already begun to move, but at present, nuclear \npower is a vital part of India's energy equation. It is likely to grow \nin significance in the years to come. Experts note correctly that \nnuclear power will still provide only a small portion of India's energy \nconsumption even when this passes. But at the margin, the contribution \nof nuclear power will be greater, and India's leaders across the \npolitical spectrum see nuclear power as an important and necessary \ncontributor to their country's economic progress.\n  The Agreement on Nuclear Cooperation negotiated by President Bush and \nPrime Minister Singh in July of 2005 cannot be implemented unless \nCongress approves changes in U.S. law. So we in the Senate must now \naddress both the opportunities and the nonproliferation issues raised \nby that agreement. The administration proposed that we treat the United \nStates-India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement as if it met all the \nrequirements of section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act. In fact, it does \nnot. There is no way, of course, that India, with a nuclear weapons \nprogram that is outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, could \nmeet these requirements. I compliment my chairman for making it clear \nto the administration that was a nonstarter.\n  Were Congress to accept the administration's proposal, it would lose \nany real ability to influence a nuclear agreement with India. The \nagreement would be sent to Congress, but we would have to enact a \nmotion to disapprove over a likely Presidential veto within 90 days in \norder to stop any agreement from entering into effect. That would be a \ngigantic usurpation of our responsibility. The Foreign Relations \nCommittee, under the leadership of the chairman, rejected this \napproach, as did the House of Representatives.\n  The bill before us today would require, instead, an affirmative vote \nof Congress before a United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement \ncan enter into effect. Section 3709 provides expedited procedures for \nthe resolution to approve such a United States-India agreement. That \nresolution would not contain any conditions, and it could not be \namended. But if Congress found the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement \nwanting in some respect, it could either reject the expedited \nresolution or approval or pass a different resolution that did contain \nconditions. That is what Congress did with the United States-China \nNuclear Cooperation Agreement in 1985. So this bill protects \ncongressional powers not for the sake of protecting congressional \npowers, as if we were interested in turf; it protects the balance of \npower, the separation of power, which is essential in the formulation \nof a policy, including foreign policy. At the same time, it offers \nprocedures that will expedite approval of a good agreement.\n  Section 3907 also allows the President to waive section 128 of the \nAtomic Energy Act, which provides for annual submission of one export \nlicense to Congress. That provision has never been used and would be of \nlittle benefit to Congress, as a sale could be blocked only if a \nresolution of disapproval were enacted, again, over the likelihood of a \nPresidential veto.\n  The administration argued that section 128, while giving Congress \nlittle real power, would harm U.S. industry\n\n[[Page S10986]]\n\nby creating an annual event that would frighten both the customer and \nthe investor from proceeding. We agreed, and this bill includes a \nsection 128 waiver provision that the administration requested. \nChairman Lugar and I yield to nobody in our commitment to \nnonproliferation, and no one has a stronger record on this than Senator \nLugar. We believe we have presented to this body a bill that allows \ncivil nuclear cooperation with India to proceed and ends India's \nnuclear isolation, but it does so without seriously jeopardizing the \nhard-won nonproliferation gains of nearly the last four decades.\n  Specifically, our aims have been as follows:\n  To preserve the right of Congress to conduct a meaningful review of \nthe peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement that India and the United \nStates are negotiating; secondly, to ensure that such nuclear \ncooperation is used exclusively in India's civil nuclear program and \nthat India continues to be a ``good citizen'' when it comes to \nnonproliferation, as it has been; to preserve the role and procedures \nof the Nuclear Suppliers Group and of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency; and to do all this without requiring any renegotiation of the \nUnited States-India treaty deal.\n  Look, every time we have a treaty presented to us in the Senate, \nthere are those of us, including my friend from North Dakota who is on \nthe Senate floor, who believe we can probably do it better. We believe \nwe could have gotten a better deal. We believe we could have gotten a \ntreaty that was even better than the one that exists. But the old \nexpression is that we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n  It wasn't really very easy to do what we set out to do, but I truly \nbelieve we have succeeded in the points I have just made. There is a \nreason this bill was reported out of committee with a 16-to-2 margin; \nwe did really try to address the major nonproliferation concerns \nlegitimately raised by colleagues in the committee.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee did not endorse, for example, the \nadministration's request for broad waiver authority regarding section \n129 of the Atomic Energy Act. That section terminates nuclear exports \nto a country under certain circumstances. The administration did not \nwant that in place.\n  The committee agreed that the President needs the right to waive \nthose portions of section 129 which would end exports because India has \na nuclear weapons program or because it has tested nuclear devices in \nthe past. But section 3709 doesn't grant a waiver authority regarding \nthose portions of section 129 which would end nuclear exports if India \nwere to, 1, test a nuclear device in the future; 2, terminate or \nmaterially violate the IAEA safeguard; 3, materially violate its \nagreement with the United States, or engage in nuclear proliferation.\n  Look, if India does any of those things, then the premise upon which \nwe have dealt with a good friend and neighbor was falsely relied upon. \nI believe India understands the consequence of this bilateral \nrelationship as profoundly as we do. If I am wrong about that and India \nwere to do any or all of the four things I just named, it would clearly \nviolate the spirit of this agreement, part of which, as all agreements \nultimately are, is based on some sense of comity and trust.\n  This bill requires that India sign a safeguards agreement with the \nIAEA and negotiate an additional protocol as well. It requires the \nPresident to certify, moreover, that the safeguards agreement is ``in \naccordance with IAEA standards, principles, and practices.'' The \nPresident must certify to that effect.\n  We understand that India, having nuclear weapons, will not accept \nfull-scope safeguards. But the language in this bill makes clear our \nexpectation that the safeguards agreement India works out with the IAEA \nwill guard effectively against diversion of foreign nuclear material \nand technology to India's military program.\n  Section 3709 also requires the President to certify that the Nuclear \nSuppliers Group has decided to permit civil nuclear commerce with India \nand that the NSG, Nuclear Suppliers Group, decision was made by \nconsensus. We do not want to damage the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which \nhas been a vital institution in our fight against nuclear \nproliferation. So this bill protects the Nuclear Suppliers Group's role \nin governing peaceful nuclear commerce.\n  The administration has said repeatedly that this is an India nuclear \ndeal, not intended to permit nuclear commerce with Pakistan or Israel--\nthe only other states that never signed the NPT. The committee's bill \nincorporates that distinction by requiring the President to certify \nthat the NSG--Nuclear Suppliers Group--decision does not permit nuclear \ncommerce with any other state that does not accept full-scope \nsafeguards.\n  The NSG is not likely to single out India as an exception to its \nguidelines. Rather, it will create tests that a non-NPT state must meet \nbefore nuclear commerce with the country may take place. The committee \nbelieves that such a test should be substantial, so that the countries \noutside the NPT are not all given the same benefits as the nonnuclear \nweapon states inside the treaty. Thus, the bill before us today is \ndesigned to maintain important nonproliferation policies that have \nserved our country well.\n  With regard to sections 106 and 107, two sections of this bill, they \nhave been cited by some Indian officials as causing concern. I will \naddress these sections, as I do not believe such concern is merited.\n  Section 106 in the agreement bars the executive branch from exporting \nto India ``any equipment, materials, or technology related to the \nenrichment of uranium, the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, or the \nproduction of heavy water.'' That is because these technologies are all \nused to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In fact, the \nadministration already has a worldwide policy of not exporting these \ntechnologies. Section 106 merely makes that a legal requirement in this \ncase.\n\n  Because section 106 makes this a legal requirement, we also added two \nexemptions. One would be for a program such as the Global Nuclear \nEnergy Partnership, which is to develop a new generation of \nproliferation-resistant nuclear facilities. In other words, the second \nexemption would be for a facility in an IAEA-approved program to \nprovide alternatives to national fuel cycle capability. For example, \nthere might some day be a South Asian regional uranium enrichment \nfacility under IAEA auspices.\n  Some Indian officials are reportedly upset because section 106 \nsingles out India. But they have long known that it is U.S. policy not \nto sell them these technologies, so this is a matter more of pride than \nof substance, which I hope they deal with. I would not object to making \nsection 106 apply worldwide, but we believed this was too large a step \nto take in this bill. I would think it should apply worldwide.\n  Section 107 requires a program to maintain accountability with \nrespect to nuclear materials, equipment, and technology that we sell, \nlease, export, or reexport to India. This program would include end-use \nmonitoring conditions, as appropriate. A similar program exists for \nU.S. nuclear exports to China. Such a monitoring program would enhance \nconfidence in India's separation of its civilian and military nuclear \nprograms. It would also further ensure U.S. compliance with article I \nof the nonproliferation treaty.\n  Indian officials are reportedly upset that American personnel might \nneed to visit India's nuclear sites. It should come as no surprise, \nhowever, that we need to ensure that U.S. nuclear materials, equipment, \nand technology are not diverted to military uses.\n  The purpose of section 107 is not to impose new conditions upon India \nbut, rather, to make sure the executive branch doesn't forget its \nobligation to guard against diversion. That obligation is already U.S. \npolicy. It also flows from article I of the nonproliferation treaty, \nwhich requires nuclear weapon states not to assist nonnuclear weapon \nstates ``in any way'' to manufacture nuclear weapons. And India remains \na nonnuclear weapons state under both the NPT and U.S. law, despite the \nfact that now it does have nuclear weapons.\n  I hope that in conference we can adjust the wording of section 107 to \ncorrect any potential misunderstanding of its effect, which is not \nintended to be onerous. I also hope that Indian officials will \nunderstand the U.S. need to embark upon nuclear commerce with India in \na manner that maintains our\n\n[[Page S10987]]\n\nnonproliferation policies and fulfills our international obligation. I \nbelieve the bill reported out by the Foreign Relations Committee does \nthat in a most reasonable manner and that it will provide a strong \nfoundation for a new beginning in United States-Indian relations.\n  The United States-Indian agreement is much more than just a nuclear \ndeal, though, Mr. President. I believe historians will see this as a \nhistoric step, part of the dramatic and positive departure in United \nStates-Indian relationship that was begun by President Clinton.\n  President Bush is to be commended for continuing and accelerating the \njourney President Clinton started in our relations with India.\n  If I were asked to name the pillars for security in the 21st century, \nIndia and the United States would be two of them. India and the United \nStates, working in cooperation toward the same goal, can provide the \nbeginning of a strong foundation for a stable world. And for the United \nStates, no relationship, in my view, is more important than the United \nStates-India relationship maturing along the lines that have begun.\n  The ultimate success of this agreement will rest on India's \nwillingness and ability to reduce tensions with its nuclear neighbors \nand achieve nuclear stability. We all hope to see the day when India \nand Pakistan voluntarily reduce or end their fissile material \nproduction, as the recognized NPT nuclear weapons states already have \ndone.\n  I hope especially that India will not use its peaceful nuclear \ncommerce to free up domestic uranium for increased production of \nnuclear weapons. The United States-India deal doesn't bar India from \ndoing that. But such a nuclear buildup--unless carried out in response \nto a direct threat from its nuclear-armed neighbors--would be a gross \nabuse of the world's trust, in my view. It would sour relations between \nIndia and the United States, just at a time when both countries hope to \nbuild upon a new foundation that has been laid in the past decade and \nwhich I respectfully suggest is in the overwhelming self-interest of \nboth countries.\n  India and the world will also benefit if India embraces these \ncritical nonproliferation standards. These include the Proliferation \nSecurity Initiative; the guidelines and policies of the Australia \nGroup, which, I add, controls exports that could help countries build \nchemical or biological weapons; and the guidelines and policies of the \nWassenaar Arrangement, which combats the spread of advanced \nconventional weapons.\n  India is a major world power. India needs to--and will, I believe--\nstep up to this awesome responsibility. As an important world power, it \nis important that support for the complete nonproliferation regime \nwould make a gigantic difference in the world. Currently, however, \nIndia doesn't stop its companies from exporting dual-use chemicals and \nequipment to countries such as Iran because those exports are not \nbanned by the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Other leading countries have concluded that unrestrained exports of \nitems that could be used to produce chemical or biological weapons and \nadvanced conventional weapons are a real danger to world stability. It \nis my fervent hope and prayer that India reaches that conclusion as \nwell. It is time for them to adopt, in my opinion, the same approach to \nthe dangers posed by such proliferation.\n  India will not attain the respect and status it seeks and deserves in \nthe world unless it takes a willing and active role in preventing \nproliferation of all kinds. The nuclear deal we are considering today \nis a sign, however, of the world's desire to bring India into the fold. \nI hope India will use this deal as a departure point from which it will \nbranch out to embrace all international nonproliferation activities. It \nwill surely be welcomed if it does.\n  In my view, the bill before us is a victory for United States-India \nrelationships. It is a victory for the quest to move beyond fossil \nfuels. And it is a victory we have achieved while doing our best to \nmaintain the global effort to end proliferation.\n  I believe, not guaranteed by this agreement, it will be also a point \nof departure for India to rethink its role in the world with regard to \nproliferation of all kinds. I sincerely hope it does.\n  I end where I began. I think United States-India relations is two of \nthe pillars upon which we have a chance--we have a chance, a real \nchance--to build a 21st century that is much more stable than the 20th \ncentury and to avoid the carnage of the 20th century. It cannot be done \nwithout India's cooperation, and it can be done with India's \nleadership.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening. I understand my friend from \nNorth Dakota may have an amendment or may wish to seek the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish I were on the Senate floor today \nable to be supportive of the chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittee. They have both given persuasive and eloquent statements \nabout the matter.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate with a different view. I come here \nvery disappointed because I think we are beginning down a very \ntroublesome road for this country. I want to talk a little about what \nall this means.\n  I know the issue is not an issue that rates at the top of the \nattention of the American people at the moment, this Government, or the \npress corps. This is an issue about whether there will be more nuclear \nweapons built in a world in which there are already too many nuclear \nweapons. This is an issue in which we are going to discuss the issue of \nnonproliferation, stopping the spread of nuclear weapons at a time when \nwe have terrorism in this world that we worry could result in a \nterrorist organization acquiring a nuclear weapon and detonating a \nnuclear weapon in a major American city.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to show a couple of items on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Lugar, is someone \nwho has been a real leader with Senator Nunn on the Nunn-Lugar program, \nwhich I have been proud to support. It has been a program that has \nactually reduced the number of nuclear weapons and reduced the delivery \nsystems for nuclear weapons. It is what we aspire to do. It is what our \ncountry should lead the world in doing, and that is to step away from \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons and the building of new nuclear \nweapons.\n  This is a piece of a wing strut from a Backfire bomber. This used to \nbe flying in the air, part of a wing strut from a Soviet Backfire \nbomber that likely carryied nuclear weapons that threatened our \ncountry. We didn't shoot this plane down. This wing strut was sawed \noff. The wing was destroyed. The plane was destroyed. It was \ndismantled.\n  How did that happen? We actually paid for it. My colleagues, Senator \nNunn and Senator Lugar, proposed legislation that allowed us to, with \nthe Russians, actually begin to destroy and reduce delivery systems and \nnuclear weapons. So this bomber that carried a nuclear weapon, \npresumably to threaten this country, doesn't exist anymore. A piece of \nits wing is in my desk drawer in the United States Senate.\n  This is a vile of ground-up copper. This used to be part of a Soviet \nsubmarine, that prowled under the water with missiles and warheads \npresumably aimed at U.S. cities. Yes, this used to be a Soviet \nsubmarine carrying weapons of mass destruction threatening our country.\n  This was a hinge on a missile silo in the Ukraine, and that missile \nsilo contained a missile. That missile contained nuclear warheads, \npresumably aimed at a U.S. military target or a U.S. city. This hinge, \nof course, is in my desk today, not in a field in the Ukraine. Where \nthat missile used to sit, there is no missile. There is no missile \nsilo. There are now sunflowers planted in that field in the Ukraine.\n  The Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus--all three countries--had several \nthousand nuclear weapons and are now free of all nuclear weapons.\n  How did all that happen? Was it by accident? No, no, it wasn't. This \ncountry embarked on a set of policies and proposals that resulted in \nthe reduction of delivery systems and nuclear weapons.\n  Have we been enormously successful? I have described some successes, \nbut we\n\n[[Page S10988]]\n\nhave, oh, probably 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear weapons remaining on this \nEarth. Far too many--25,000 to 30,000 nuclear weapons. We have much to \ndo to step away from the abyss of having a terrorist organization or \nrogue nation acquire nuclear weapons and threaten our country or \nthreaten the world.\n  We have all experienced 9/11/2001 where several thousand innocent \nAmericans were murdered. That was an unbelievable terrorist attack on \nour country. It could happen again with a nuclear weapon. We are going \nto spend $9 billion or $10 billion this year building an antiballistic \nmissile defense system to create some sort of an electronic catcher's \nmitt to catch an intercontinental ballistic missile someone might aim \nat our country armed with a nuclear warhead.\n\n  That is one of the least likely threats our country faces. We are \ngoing to spend close to $10 billion for a threat that is one of the \nleast likely threats we face.\n  The most likely threat, perhaps, instead of an intercontinental \nballistic missile coming in at 18,000 miles an hour aimed at an \nAmerican city, is a container ship pulling up to a dock in a major \nAmerican city at 3 miles an hour with a container that contains a \nweapon of mass destruction onboard, to be detonated in the middle of an \nAmerican city.\n  Let me read for the Record, as I start--and I want to then talk about \nthis specific agreement--I want to read an excerpt from Graham \nAllison's book. He is at Harvard. He wrote a book called ``Nuclear \nTerrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe.''\n  I talk about 9/11/2001, several thousand Americans murdered by \nterrorists. The detonation of a nuclear weapon in an American city by a \nterrorist group will not mean several thousand Americans being \nmurdered; it could likely mean several hundred thousand Americans being \nmurdered, or more.\n  Let me read to you from Graham Allison's book. I am quoting:\n\n       On October 11, 2001, a month to the day after the terrorist \n     assault on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, President \n     George W. Bush faced an even more terrifying prospect. At \n     that morning's Presidential Daily Intelligence Briefing, \n     George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, informed \n     the president that a CIA agent code-named Dragonfire had \n     reported that Al Qaeda terrorists possessed a ten-kiloton \n     nuclear bomb, evidently stolen from the Russian arsenal. \n     According to Dragonfire, this nuclear weapon was now on \n     American soil, in New York City.\n       The CIA had no independent confirmation of this report, but \n     neither did it have any basis on which to dismiss it. Did \n     Russia's arsenal include a large number of ten-kiloton \n     weapons? Yes. Could the Russian government account for all \n     the nuclear weapons the Soviet Union had built during the \n     Cold War? No. Could Al Qaeda have acquired one or more of \n     these weapons? Yes. Could it have smuggled a nuclear weapon \n     through American border controls in New York City without \n     anyone's knowledge? Yes. . . .\n       In the hours that followed, national security adviser \n     Condoleezza Rice analyzed what strategists call the ``problem \n     from hell.'' Unlike the Cold War, when the United States and \n     the Soviet Union knew that an attack against the other would \n     illicit a retaliatory strike of greater measure, Al Qaeda--\n     with no return address--had no such fear of reprisal. Even if \n     the president were prepared to negotiate, Al Qaeda had no \n     phone number to call.\n       Clearly, no decision could be taken without much more \n     information about the threat and those behind it. But how \n     could Rice engage a wider circle of experts and analysts \n     without the White House's suspicions leaking to the press? A \n     CNN flash that the White House had information about an Al \n     Qaeda nuclear weapon in Manhattan would create chaos. New \n     Yorkers would flee the city in terror, and residents of other \n     metropolitan areas would panic.\n\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       Concerned that Al Qaeda could have smuggled a nuclear \n     weapon into Washington as well, the president ordered Vice \n     President Dick Cheney to leave the capital for an \n     ``undisclosed location,'' where he would remain for many \n     weeks to follow. That was standard procedure to ensure \n     ``continuity of government''. . . . Several hundred federal \n     employees from more than a dozen government agencies joined \n     the vice president at this secret site. . . . The president \n     also immediately dispatched NEST specialists (Nuclear \n     Emergency Support Teams of scientists and engineers) to New \n     York City to search for the weapon. But no one in the city \n     was informed of the threat, not even Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.\n       As the CIA's analysts examined Dragonfire's report and \n     compared it with other bits of information, they noted that \n     the attack on the World Trade Center in September had set the \n     bar higher for future terrorist spectaculars.\n\n  I won't read to the end. I ask unanimous consent that this document \nbe printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. At the end of this process, they finally determined after \nabout a month that this was not a credible threat. Dragonfire's report \nturned out not to be credible.\n  But at the time they took the report very seriously. They analyzed it \nthis way: Was it possible that a Russian 10-kiloton nuclear weapon \ncould have been stolen? Yes, it was possible. Is it possible a \nterrorist group could have acquired it? Yes. Is it possible it could \nhave been smuggled into New York City? The answer was yes. And, if so, \nwas it possible a terrorist group could detonate a nuclear weapon in a \nmajor American city? The answer was yes.\n  This is not fiction. I am reading an excerpt of a book of something \nthat happened in October of 2001.\n  My greatest fear is that we do not yet understand the difference \nbetween what was and what is. What was, was a standoff called the cold \nwar in which two major nuclear superpowers aimed massive numbers of \nnuclear warheads at each other, but understanding, under the concept of \nmutually assured destruction, called MAD, that if either attacked the \nother, the other would be literally vaporized by an avalanche of \nnuclear weapons. The result was that there was a standoff, a mutually \nassured destruction standoff, and although both sides in that Cold \nWar--the United States and the Soviet Union--possessed the most \nunbelievably powerful killing machines known to humankind, they were \nnot used. Neither side ever used them.\n  Fast-forward to today. The Cold War is over. President Bush, in fact, \nvisited with the President Putin yesterday, in Russia. Times have \nchanged, but this world still has somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000 \nnuclear weapons, the loss of one of which could be cataclysmic for this \nworld. The detonation of one nuclear weapon in a major city will change \neverything--everything--and be a catastrophe unlike any we have \npreviously known.\n  If we have 25,000 or 30,000 nuclear weapons on this Earth, what is \nthe responsibility of this great country? What is our responsibility? \nWhat burden falls on our shoulders? I submit it is the burden to \nprovide world leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and to \nreduce the threat of nuclear weapons and to reduce the stockpile of \nnuclear weapons. That is our responsibility. That responsibility falls \non us.\n  How do we do that? Listen, our country has provided leadership in a \nnonproliferation treaty, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the test \nban treaty. Our country has been moving always, telling the rest of the \nworld we aspire to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Now we live in \nthis age of terrorism where we see people who are perfectly content to \nkill themselves. They don't care. As long as they can take a weapon \nwith them and kill themselves and many others with them, it doesn't \nmatter to them. They are reaching for some higher glory, apparently.\n  In this age of terrorism, everything about nuclear weapons has \nchanged. The loss of one nuclear weapon, the loss of one anywhere on \nthis globe to a terrorist organization is going to be devastating.\n  So if that is the case, what does it have to do with what we are \ntalking about today? We are now talking today about a country called \nIndia. India is quite a remarkable place--a wonderful country with \nwonderful people. It is a big country. It is trying to build an \neconomy. You can read some books about what is going on in India and \nthe discussions about progress--it is quite a remarkable place. Our \ncountry aspires to have a better relationship with India. I support \nthat. I believe we ought to reach out to India and improve our \nrelationship, cement our relationship.\n  I know there are some who see all of the geopolitical relationships \non this Earth as aligning one way or the other. We align with this \ncountry to be a counterweight against this set of interests, and it is \nkind of akin to teams. So I confess to you, I come here today not \nperhaps understanding all of the sophisticated elements of \ncounterweights\n\n[[Page S10989]]\n\nand the nuances of why someone believes it is essential, at this point, \nto allow India to produce additional nuclear weapons in order to create \nsome sort of counterweight to China, but I want to talk about this \nissue. I was unbelievably surprised to read in the newspaper of the \ntravels of Ambassador Burns, someone for whom I have high regard, and \nof the interest of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in going to \nIndia and reaching a deal without consulting Congress that I think \nbegins to unravel, and undermine several decades of efforts in our \ncountry to tell the world: It is our responsibility and our major goal \nto stop the spread of nuclear weapons and try to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons and reduce the nuclear threat.\n  We would not be in this position today with this bill with India if \nIndia had followed the example, for example, of South Africa. They \nsecretly had nuclear weapons by the 1980s. But South Africa dismantled \nthem prior to the transfer of power to the postapartheid government. \nUkraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus had more than 4,000 nuclear weapons in \nthose three countries when the Soviet Union was dissolved which they \ngave up in the years following. And I must say that my colleague \nSenator Lugar and others had significant successes in working with \nthose three countries to accomplish that. So Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and \nBelarus are all now free of nuclear weapons.\n  Any nuclear deal--any relationship we have with another country that \ndeals with nuclear power and nuclear issues should be judged, in my \nopinion, on whether it reduces the number of nuclear weapons. Does it \nreduce the nuclear weapons that exist or increase them? It is quite \nclear that what we are debating will result in an increase in nuclear \nweapons in India. I don't think there is much doubt about that. This \nbill fails that test, in my judgment.\n  Experts have warned that there is enough weapons-usable fissile \nmaterial in the world to make about 130,000 nuclear weapons. A working \nnuclear bomb, we are told, can be made with as little as 35 pounds of \nuranium-235 or 9 pounds of plutonium-239. And the acquisition of a \nnuclear weapon by a terrorist is, in my judgment, the greatest threat \nthat exists in our country.\n  Retired GEN Eugene Habiger, who commanded America's nuclear forces, \nsaid that nuclear terrorism ``is not a matter of if, it is a matter of \nwhen.''\n  Henry Kissinger wrote in the Washington Post recently:\n\n       The world is faced with the nightmarish prospect that \n     nuclear weapons will become a standard part of national \n     armament and wind up in terrorists' hands.\n\n  Former Senator Sam Nunn wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       We know that terrorists are seeking nuclear materials--\n     enriched uranium or plutonium--to build nuclear weapons. We \n     know that if they get that nuclear material, they can build a \n     nuclear weapon. We believe that if they build such a weapon, \n     they will use it. We know terrorists are not likely to be \n     deterred, and that the more this nuclear material is \n     available, the higher the risks.\n\n  Osama bin Laden has been seeking nuclear components since the 1990s. \nIn 1998, Osama bin Laden issued a statement entitled ``The Nuclear Bomb \nof Islam,'' declaring:\n\n       It is the duty of Muslims to prepare as much force as \n     possible to terrorize the enemies of God.\n\n  And Osama bin Laden's spokesman announced that the group aspires ``to \nkill 4 million Americans, including 1 million children,'' in response \nto casualties supposedly inflicted on Muslims by the United States and \nIsrael.\n  The more countries there are with nuclear weapons and weapons-grade \nnuclear material and the more weapons each of them has, the greater the \nthreat that one will be used by a rogue nation or will fall into the \nhands of terrorist groups.\n  Now, frankly, we have not been very aggressive as a country in recent \nyears in stopping proliferation. Instead of talking about how we would \nreduce the number of nuclear weapons, we were on the floor of the \nSenate, during previous debates, talking about the fact that we need \nnew nuclear weapons. Our country has said we need designer nuclear \nweapons; we need bunker-buster nuclear weapons. We have people openly \nspeaking about the desire in this country to build additional nuclear \nweapons.\n  We attacked Iraq because we believed it possessed and was seeking \nnuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. We are spending $10 \nbillion a year, as I said, on missile defense for fear that North Korea \nalready has nuclear weapons. And we are talking about serious issues \nwith Iran in order to try to stop its nuclear program. And the No. 1 \nnightmare is that a terrorist group may acquire a nuclear weapon. No \none in my judgment can credibly say that a world that has more nuclear \nweapons is a safer world. It is just not.\n  Nowhere in the world is the threat of nuclear terrorism more imminent \nthan in South Asia. It is the home to al-Qaida which seeks nuclear \nweapons. It is an area where relations among regional nuclear powers \nare always tense: China, India, and Pakistan. India and China fought a \nborder war in 1962. India and Pakistan fought three major wars, had \nnumerous smaller scale conflicts since the partition of British India \nin 1947. Both India and Pakistan detonated nuclear weapons in 1998 and \ndeclared themselves as nuclear powers. And after that, all of us in the \nworld held our breath as they began fighting a limited war in Kashmir.\n\n  Now, it has traditionally been the case that the United States has \nled the international community in efforts to deny India, Pakistan, and \nother nonnuclear States access to nuclear technology. That has been our \ntraditional role. We have always been the one who said: No, no, no. We \ncan't do that. We need to limit the capability of nations that will not \nsign up to nonproliferation.\n  We pushed for the nonproliferation treaty, which prohibits nuclear \nassistance to these so-called nonnuclear States, unless they agree to \nput all of their nuclear facilities under international safeguards and \nto give up the option of developing a nuclear weapon. That has been our \nposition. It has always been our position.\n  Article I of the nonproliferation treaty obligates the recognized \nnuclear weapons States, including the United States, to:\n\n       Not in any way assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear \n     weapons State to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear \n     weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\n\n  That is Article I of the nonproliferation treaty. We signed it. We \nhelped write it. We supported it. It is what we believe in.\n  The United States helped form the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 1975 to \nhelp prevent the misuse of peaceful nuclear technology. In 1978, we \npassed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, which restricts nuclear \ncommerce with States that don't agree to the full scope of the \nsafeguards. We pushed for U.N. Security Council Resolution 1172 which \ncondemned India's and Pakistan's 1998 nuclear tests and called upon \nthem to cease their nuclear weapons programs and join the \nnonproliferation treaty as nonnuclear weapons states. We did that.\n  In 1998, President Clinton imposed sanctions on both India and \nPakistan, under section 102 of the Arms Control Act, which requires \nsanctions on any non-nuclear weapons state that has detonated nuclear \ndevices.\n  Now, these policies did not stop India's and Pakistan's nuclear \nweapons programs, but they did restrain them and they hindered them. In \nfact, that is precisely why we are here with respect to India.\n  The Bush administration has taken a different tact now. Their \nproposal is to provide ``full'' assistance to India's civilian nuclear \nprogram, while India keeps its nuclear weapons, which represents a \ncomplete abandonment of our traditional approach to nonproliferation.\n  I don't think you can come to the floor and argue that this is part \nof an approach we have always taken. This is a U-turn. This is a 180-\ndegree change from the approach we have always had. The Bush \nadministration formed an agreement that allows New Delhi to \ndramatically expand its stockpile of nuclear weapons and could ignite a \nregional arms race. That is what we have here. They can have reactors \nbehind the curtain that will not be subject to inspection by anybody. \nThat is part of the deal. It will undermine 30 years of \nnonproliferation efforts at the very time when we are engaged in these \nissues with North Korea and Iran.\n  It is a major, it seems to me, exception to the prohibition of \nnuclear assistance to any country that doesn't\n\n[[Page S10990]]\n\naccept international monitoring of all of its nuclear facilities. This \nis a major exception to that. And it also is one that gives legitimacy \nto a nuclear arsenal that India secretly developed, and it is not going \nto help us in any way. It will hinder us in convincing others to give \nup their nuclear weapons.\n  Now, India never signed the nonproliferation treaty. Because of that, \nPakistan never signed the treaty. In the 1960s, India used both \nAmerican technology and also Canadian technology and the nuclear fuel \nprovided under what was called the Atoms For Peace Program to secretly \nbuild nuclear weapons. By doing so, New Delhi broke an explicit pledge \nto both the United States and to Canada about the use of technology and \nnuclear fuel only for peaceful purposes. In 1974, India conducted its \nfirst nuclear weapons test. It denied that it had done so. It said it \nwas a peaceful nuclear test.\n  In May, 1998, they conducted a series of nuclear tests and declared \nthemselves as a nuclear weapons state. In response, Pakistan did \nexactly the same thing and declared themselves as a nuclear state.\n  Because India has a shortage of domestic uranium, the application of \nthe U.S. and international laws that prevent the sale of nuclear fuel \nand other nuclear assistance to them has seriously constrained its \nnuclear power industry and nuclear weapons program. All of us \nunderstand that India has energy issues. It has an expanding population \nand it wishes to build additional powerplants, nuclear powerplants, but \nit also wishes to build additional nuclear weapons. India's power \nreactors, we are now told, are operating at less than capacity due to \nfuel shortages and their utilization rates are expected to decrease \neven further. Very little uranium is leftover from its domestic \nsupplies for India to turn to nuclear weapons. So in the past year--\ncouple of years--New Delhi has stepped up efforts to get our assistance \nin obtaining nuclear fuel and reactor components so it can increase its \nnuclear power. But the fact is, it will also increase its nuclear \nweapons programs.\n  Here is what the deal that is now brought to the floor of the Senate \ndoes: My understanding is that it obligates the United States to \npersuade the members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group to change their \nrules which bar sales to India. It allows India to buy sensitive \nnuclear technologies, now forbidden under the nonproliferation treaty. \nIt includes nuclear fuel, nuclear reactors, and advanced technology. \nThis agreement would open the door to India's cooperation with France, \nJapan, and others who want to do business with India and who now have \nnot been doing business with India because of the NPT. In return, in \nthis agreement, India has agreed to allow the IAEA inspections and \nsafeguards at 14 of their 22 planned nuclear power reactors. But eight \nof their nuclear power reactors will be placed behind a curtain. No one \nwill be able to inspect them. That is where they will be able to \ncontinue increasing the production of nuclear weapons, and it is not--\nyou wonder, do they want to produce additional nuclear weapons? Let me \nquote directly from a senior adviser to India's nuclear program, \nDecember 2005, an article in The Times of India. Dr. Subrahmanyam says:\n\n       Given India's uranium ore crunch and the need to build up \n     our minimum credible nuclear arsenal as fast as possible, it \n     is to India's advantage to categorize as many power reactors \n     as possible as civilian ones to be refueled by imported \n     uranium and conserve our native uranium fuel for weapons-\n     grade plutonium production.\n\n  This is clear:\n\n       Given India's . . . crunch and the need to build up our \n     minimum credible nuclear deterrent arsenal. . . .\n\n  That is what this is about in India.\n  We have those who support this, who say it is not perfect, but it is \nnot bad. I don't know whether the contention on the Senate floor is \ngoing to be that this will not result in additional warheads. But I am \nclear, and I think everybody should be clear, it will. India will \nproduce additional nuclear weapons. We believe, if that makes the world \nsafer, I guess that is what one can argue. I do not believe that at \nall. I think the addition of nuclear weapons to the stockpile that \nexists in this world is a serious danger to the world.\n  Pakistan has already said: If you are going to give this deal to \nIndia, how about giving this deal to us? We might want to look at what \nwe are doing. The administration just proposed, by the way, a big arms \npackage for Pakistan: 36 Lockheed F-16C/D fighter planes, 500 JDAM \nsatellite-guided bomb kits, 700 bunker buster bombs, 1,600 laser-guided \nbombs, 800 conventional bombs, 500 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, 200 \nSidewinder air-to-air missiles, 130 Harpoon antiship missiles, 115 \nself-propelled howitzers.\n  That is an arms package to Pakistan. But Pakistan would say: We have \nnuclear weapons. We exploded them. We showed you we have nuclear \nweapons. You are going to give this deal to build more nuclear weapons \nto India. We want that deal for Pakistan. We want to build more nuclear \nweapons.\n  What will China say? What will China say when they see this agreement \nand decide that India is increasing its stockpile? China will say: We \nwant to increase the stockpile of nuclear weapons.\n  India is in the process of becoming a full-fledged nuclear power with \na triad, an emerging triad. Aircraft? They have a number of types of \naircraft used to deliver a nuclear weapon, or that could be so used, \nand land-based missiles and naval weapons.\n  I do not allege that India is a country that is an aggressor. That is \nnot my point. I think our relationship with India is important. I \nbelieve we ought to connect with India. We ought to reach out to India. \nWe ought to have an improved relationship with India. I don't know, \nmaybe it is advantageous to have India as a counterweight in the region \nto China.\n  But, look, do any of us really believe that an agreement that pulls \nthe rug out from under decades of positions we have held in this \ncountry on nonproliferation that results in the building of additional \nnuclear weapons advances our interests? Advances the world's interests? \nOf course not.\n  It falls on our shoulders as the nuclear power in the world. It is \nour responsibility to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Will our \nchildren or our grandchildren someday see a nuclear weapon detonated in \na major American city? Will we see that? We didn't see it during the \nCold War because we had mutually agreed destruction; that is, both \ncountries, us and the Soviet Union, understood if one launched a \nmissile or airplane containing a nuclear weapon to be detonated in our \ncountry, we would launch sufficient nuclear weapons to completely \ndestroy their country and their society. Both sides understood that. \nBoth sides understood we have arsenals that would destroy each other \nand neither side did. Neither side was an aggressor.\n  In an age of terrorism, all of that has changed. In an age of \nterrorism, if we do not embrace policies that stop the production of \nadditional nuclear weapons, we have missed an enormous opportunity to \nprevent the detonation of a nuclear weapon in one of our cities. This \nagreement simply does not stop the spread of nuclear weapons. It \ndoesn't prevent the production of additional nuclear weapons. This \nundermines that which we have described as our goal in the United \nNations. It undermines that which we have for decades described as \nbeing our goal as a leader in nonproliferation. It provides the green \nlight for India to produce additional nuclear weapons.\n  With all the sophisticated arguments in favor of this agreement, I \nfail to see how undermining decades of effort at nonproliferation and \nnow providing a green light to India to produce new nuclear weapons, \nadditional nuclear weapons, makes this a safer world. Quite the \ncontrary. I think it is dangerous. I think this agreement is a horrible \nmistake. I think all of the sophisticated calculations mean very little \nwhen we have decided to send signals to the world that we do not oppose \nproducing additional nuclear weapons; that we support that.\n  We are willing to decide to undermine the nonproliferation treaty. We \nare willing to ignore United Nations resolutions all because Ambassador \nBurns and Secretary Rice and the Bush administration said: You know \nwhat, we have all these calculations about weights and counterweights \nand geopolitical strategies and here is our new one. It is a new \nstrategy that undermines decades of what ought to be the best virtue of \nthis country, and that is providing world leadership, real world\n\n[[Page S10991]]\n\nleadership, aggressive world leadership to stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons and prevent the building of more nuclear weapons and begin \nreducing the number of nuclear weapons that exist in this world.\n  As I said when I started, I regret very much I am on the other side \nof this issue from Senator Lugar. Senator Lugar has great credibility \non these issues because he has done a very substantial amount of good \nwork. I am not quite sure how I should describe this. I was \nextraordinarily surprised when I read the first account in the \nnewspaper that it was likely that this agreement was going to be \nsupported by my colleague and friend. I would say the same with respect \nto Senator Biden. I have great respect for them. So I am someone who \ncomes to the floor of the Senate in disagreement. That doesn't mean I \nin any way disparage their abilities or their intellectual honesty in \npursuing strategies they believe are best for this country.\n  I have very strong opposition to those who believe, however, that \nthis in any way represents our best interests. I wish I could come to \nthe Senate floor with a better message, but I do not. I believe one day \nwe will look back on this with great regret. We have seen that in this \ndecade already with some other decisions, information provided us with \nrespect to Iraq and other decisions we have made. We have already, in \nmy judgment, had opportunities to understand regret about policies \nundertaken that turned out to be not in this country's best interests.\n  I believe if we open the floodgates with this agreement, we will \nseriously undermine this country's best interests.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From Blueprint Magazine, October 7, 2004]\n\n                    Nuclear Terrorism--Book Excerpt\n\n                          (By Graham Allison)\n\n       On October 11, 2001, a month to the day after the terrorist \n     assault on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, President \n     George W. Bush faced an even more terrifying prospect. At \n     that morning's Presidential Daily Intelligence Briefing, \n     George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, informed \n     the president that a CIA agent code-named Dragonfire had \n     reported that Al Qaeda terrorists possessed a ten-kiloton \n     nuclear bomb, evidently stolen from the Russian arsenal. \n     According to Dragonfire, this nuclear weapon was now on \n     American soil, in New York City.\n       The CIA had no independent confirmation of this report, but \n     neither did it have any basis on which to dismiss it. Did \n     Russia's arsenal include a large number of ten-kiloton \n     weapons? Yes. Could the Russian government account for all \n     the nuclear weapon the Soviet Union had built during the Cold \n     War? No. Could Al Qaeda have acquired one or more of these \n     weapons? Yes. Could it have smuggled a nuclear weapon through \n     American border controls into New York City without anyone's \n     knowledge? Yes. In a moment of gallows humor, someone quipped \n     that the terrorists could have wrapped the bomb in one of the \n     bales of marijuana that are routinely smuggled into cities \n     like New York.\n       In the hours that followed, national security adviser \n     Condoleezza Rice analyzed what strategists call the ``problem \n     from hell'' Unlike the Cold War, when the United States and \n     the Soviet Union knew that an attack against the other would \n     elicit a retaliatory strike for greater measure, Al Qaeda--\n     with no return address--had no such fear of reprisal. Ever if \n     the president were prepared to negotiate, Al Qaeda had no \n     phone number to call.\n       Clearly no decision could be taken without much more \n     information about the threat and those behind it. But how \n     could Rice engage a wider circle of experts and analysts \n     without the White House's suspicions leaking to the press? A \n     CNN flash that the White House had information about an Al \n     Qaeda nuclear weapon in Manhattan would create chaos. New \n     Yorkers would flee the city in terror, and residents of other \n     metropolitan areas would panic. The stock market, which was \n     just then stabilizing from the shock of 9/11, could collapse.\n       American Hiroshima. Concerned that Al Qaeda could have \n     smuggled a nuclear weapon into Washington as well, the \n     president ordered Vice President Dick Cheney to leave the \n     capital for an ``undisclosed location,'' where he would \n     remain for many weeks to follow. This was standard procedure \n     to ensure ``continuity of government'' in case of a \n     decapitation strike against the U.S. political leadership. \n     Several hundred federal employees from more tan a dozen \n     government agencies joined the vice president at this secret \n     site, the core of an alternative government that would seek \n     to cope in the aftermath of a nuclear explosion that \n     destroyed Washington. The president also immediately \n     dispatched NEST specialists (Nuclear Emergency Support Teams \n     of scientists and engineers) to New York to search for the \n     weapon. But no one in the city was informed of the threat, \n     not even Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.\n       Six months earlier the CIA's Counterterrorism Center had \n     picked up chatter in Al Qaeda channels about an ``American \n     Hiroshima,'' The CIA knew that Osama bin Laden's \n     fascination with nuclear weapons went back at least to \n     1992, when he attempted to buy highly enriched uranium \n     from South Africa. Al Qaeda operatives were alleged to \n     have negotiated with Chechen separatists in Russia to buy \n     a nuclear warhead, which the Chechen warlord Shamil \n     Basayev claimed to have acquired from Russian arsenals. \n     The CIA's special task force on Al Qaeda had noted the \n     terrorist group's emphasis on thorough planning, intensive \n     training, and repetition of successful tactics. The task \n     force also highlighted Al Qaeda's strong preference for \n     symbolic targets and spectacular attacks.\n       Staggering the imagination. As the CIA's analysts examined \n     Dragonfire's report and compared it with other bits of \n     information, they noted that the attack on the World Trade \n     Center in September had set the bar higher for future \n     terrorist spectaculars. Psychologically, a nuclear attack \n     would stagger the world's imagination as dramatically as \n     9/11 did. Considering where Al Qaeda might detonate such a \n     bomb, they noted that New York was, in the jargon of national \n     security experts, ``target rich.'' Among hundreds of \n     potential targets, what could be more compelling than Times \n     Square, the most famous address in the self-proclaimed \n     capital of the world?\n       Amid this sea of unknowns, analysts could definitively \n     answer at least one question. They knew what kind of \n     devastation a nuclear explosion would cause. If Al Qaeda was \n     to rent a van to carry the ten-kiloton Russian weapon into \n     the heart of Times Square and detonate it adjacent to the \n     Morgan Stanley headquarters at 1585 Broadway, Times Square \n     would vanish in the twinkling of an eye. The blast would \n     generate temperatures reaching into the tens of millions of \n     degrees Fahrenheit. The resulting fireball and blast wave \n     would destroy instantaneously the theater district, the New \n     York Times building, Grand Central Terminal, and every other \n     structure within a third of a mile of the point of \n     detonation. The ensuing firestorm would engulf Rockefeller \n     Center, Carnegie Hall, the Empire State Building, and Madison \n     Square Garden, leaving a landscape resembling the World Trade \n     Center site. From the United Nations headquarters on the East \n     River and the Lincoln Tunnel under the Hudson River, to the \n     Metropolitan Museum in the eighties and the Flatiron Building \n     in the twenties, structures would remind one of the Alfred P. \n     Murrah Federal Office Building following the Oklahoma City \n     bombing.\n       On a normal workday, more than half a million people crowd \n     the area within a half-mile radius of Times Square. A noon \n     detonation in midtown Manhattan could kill them all. Hundreds \n     of thousands of others would die from collapsing buildings, \n     fire, and fallout in the ensuing hours. The electromagnetic \n     pulse generated by the blast would fry cell phones, radios, \n     and other electronic communications. Hospitals, doctors, and \n     emergency services would be overwhelmed by the wounded. \n     Firefighters would be battling an uncontrolled ring of fires \n     for many days thereafter.\n       The threat of nuclear terrorism, moreover, is not limited \n     to New York City. While New York is widely seen as the most \n     likely target, it is clear that Al Qaeda is not only capable \n     of, but also interested in, mounting attacks on other \n     American cities, where people may be less prepared. Imagine \n     the consequences of a ten-kiloton weapon exploding in San \n     Francisco, Houston, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, or any \n     other city Americans call home. From the epicenter of the \n     blast to a distance of approximately a third of a mile, every \n     structure and individual would vanish in a vaporous haze. A \n     second circle of destruction, extending three-quarters of a \n     mile from ground zero, would leave buildings looking like the \n     Murrah building in Oklahoma City. A third circle, reaching \n     out one and one-half miles, would be ravaged by fires and \n     radiation.\n       Uncontrollable blaze. In Washington, a bomb going off at \n     the Smithsonian Institution would destroy everything from the \n     White House to the lawn of the Capitol building; everything \n     from the Supreme Court to the FDR Memorial would be left in \n     rubble; uncontrollable fires would reach all the way out to \n     the Pentagon.\n       In a cover story in the New York Times Magazine in May \n     2002, Bill Keller interviewed Eugene Habiger, the retired \n     four-star general who had overseen strategic nuclear weapons \n     until 1998 and had run nuclear antiterror programs for the \n     Department of Energy until 2001. Summarizing his decade of \n     daily experience dealing with threats, Habiger offered a \n     categorical conclusion about nuclear terrorism: ``it is not a \n     matter of if; it's a matter of when.'' ``That,'' Keller noted \n     drily, may explain why he now lives in San Antonio.''\n       In the end, the Dragonfire report turned out to be a false \n     alarm.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to say just one additional thing. I have two \namendments that I intend to offer today. I do not intend to take a \ngreat amount of time with either of them. Both of them are very \nimportant. I wish to say to the chairman, I know he is working through \nthis bill today. I want to be\n\n[[Page S10992]]\n\ncooperative but not so cooperative that I do not have an opportunity to \nfully explain amendments that I think are very important relative to \nwhat I just described.\n  The amendments I will offer, one has to do with requiring India to \ncomply with what the U.S. is already required to comply with, the \nsecond relates to a United Nations resolution, that our country pushed, \nthat represents American policy that appears to be completely \ncontradictory to the underlying bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  I say to the chairman, I will have two amendments. I am prepared in a \nreasonable period to offer the amendments. I do have, with Senator \nMcCain, an obligation at 12 o'clock for a few minutes off the Senate \nfloor. We are going to be speaking to a group. But following that, I \nwould be happy to come over and offer my two amendments if the Senator \nis willing to have me do that.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would like to respond to my distinguished colleague. I \nappreciate the appointment that he has with our colleague from Arizona. \nMy hope would be that the Senator would proceed with his amendments. It \nwould be timely to do so at his earliest convenience. I encourage him \nto do so.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I missed the last point.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I just indicated as soon as you could proceed with your \namendments, this would be timely, in terms of moving the progress of \nour bill today.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be off of the Senate floor for the other \nrequirement that I have, but I will come back. My understanding is \nthere is a proposal to perhaps try to modify one of my amendments?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is correct. Staffs have been working on one of the \namendments of the Senator with the hope it might be possible to accept \nthat amendment. The other amendment would have to be offered and \ndebated.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. I intend to offer the other amendment, debate it, \nand ask for a recorded vote on it. I will take a look at the proposed \nmodification to see what that modification is, but I will try to be \nback on the Senate floor as quickly as possible to accommodate the \nSenator's interests in getting it done.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I appreciate that and thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 3709, \nthe United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act. This \nlegislation has been thoughtfully crafted and will help cement an \nimportant partnership with a vitally important Nation in a part of the \nworld that will become increasingly important for the future.\n  I first want to thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Lugar, for his commitment to this agreement from the \nvery beginning. Thoughtful, as he always is, I thank him for his \nknowledge, his expertise, his wisdom, trying to make sure this is \nappropriate for our country, as well as India, and making sure there \nare provisions in there that are beneficial to our country while also \nnot harming the ability of our friends in India to pass it in their \ncountry as well.\n  There is no person in the Senate more knowledgeable on anti-\nproliferation issues than Senator Lugar. His leadership was \ninstrumental in developing a bill with protocols that met the \ncommitments made by our President while also respecting the safeguard \nagreements that have protected this country for decades. I thank our \nchairman.\n  The hearings by Chairman Lugar back in the spring, along with \ninformative testimony of Secretary Nicholas Burns, were a necessary \nlesson for our colleagues on the committee, and I think the entire \nUnited States, that explained the benefits and also helped remove \noutstanding concerns about this historic pact. Chairman Lugar, earlier \nspeaking on this measure, along with the ranking member on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Biden, addressed the specific sections of \nthe bill, so I will not recite all of those provisions again for my \ncolleagues. I wish to provide the principles behind it, the strategic \ngoals that are achieved in this United States-India civil nuclear pact. \nI want to focus on the big picture and the long-term impact of this \ncooperation agreement.\n  First and foremost, the United States-India civil nuclear cooperation \nagreement is a significant foreign policy achievement for the \nadvancement of our security. It is a significant achievement for the \nadvancement of jobs, and also a significant achievement in improving \nthe environment--the air quality particularly, in India. This strategic \npartnership between the world's oldest democracy, the United States, \nand the world's largest democracy, India, is desirable, and it is \npossible because we share the same values. We both believe in \nrepresentative democracy. We believe in and are girded by the rule of \nlaw. We respect human rights and religious tolerance. We share the same \ngoals for Asia and for the world, which are freedom and peace.\n  This pact, this partnership, this agreement, in my view, can be the \nbeginning of a blossoming marriage between the people of the United \nStates and the people of India. India is a vital ally and a key global \npartner in the war on terrorism. They understand it. They have been \nthreatened in India. In fact, India has been hit by terrorism in the \nname of religious fanaticism and religious extremism. This agreement is \na step forward also regarding concerns with nuclear proliferation. Some \ncritics will argue this agreement undermines the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, but when you look at the facts, India has no \nrecord of proliferating nuclear material, nuclear equipment, or \ntechnology to any other countries. In addition, India's nuclear weapons \nare there for self-defense and India has been a consistent practitioner \nof the ``no first use'' doctrine when it comes to nuclear weapons.\n  India has been an exception in this regard and, in my view, should be \nviewed differently than other countries that do not have such a record.\n  The fact is as a result of this agreement India will place a majority \nof its thermal power reactors under the International Atomic Energy \nsafeguards for the very first time, and there also will be permanent \ninspections.\n  By contrast, Iran doesn't have the same sort of policy as India. Iran \nhas kicked out the IAEA inspectors. This agreement helps bring India \ninto the global nuclear mainstream where it is not right now.\n  It is very clear, whether it was Chairman Lugar or Senator Biden and \nothers, if you examine this agreement it is going to significantly \nincrease transparency and oversight of its civilian nuclear program.\n  We also ought to look at the economic and energy benefits of this \ncooperation. India has tremendous energy needs that will only increase \nas their economy and country grows and increasingly prospers.\n  The United States-India nuclear agreement strengthens energy security \nfor the United States and India by promoting the development and stable \nuse of clean nuclear power, rather than relying on the Middle East for \noil and gas, particularly from Iran. Obviously, India benefits through \na reliable, affordable energy supply. United States companies will \nbenefit from increased jobs and economic opportunity in the India \nenergy market. Cooperation from this will also ensue, I believe, in \nclean coal technology and also biofuels.\n  Having been in India last November-December, the air quality there is \nawful. The coal they have in India is dirty coal. They have to import \ncoal.\n  There are millions of people in India prospering as a country, and \nincreasing. There are millions of people who do not have electricity. \nFor India to have its energy needs met, they are going to have to be \nable to import more or they are going to have to come up with creative \napproaches.\n  The U.S.A. is far more dependent on foreign sources of energy. We \nneed to have more exploration of oil and natural gas in our country. We \nought to be using more clean coal technology since we are the Saudi \nArabia of the world in coal for electricity and gasification and \nliquification of coal. We also need advanced nuclear, biofuels, solar--\na diversity of fuels for our energy independence rather than being so \ndependent on foreign sources of energy from the Middle East and hostile \ndictators around the world.\n\n[[Page S10993]]\n\n  India is in a similar situation. In fact, they are even more \ndependent than the United States. There are concerns they will have to \nhave a pipeline from Iran for natural gas or for oil. We are trying to \nget Iran not to develop nuclear weapons. One of the reasons \ngeopolitically why it is difficult to impose sanctions or any sort of \nefforts to get them to comply is there are other parts of the world \nthat are so dependent on Iran for natural gas or for oil.\n  In a sense, the energy independence and energy security concerns that \nwe have in our country are also brought about for the people in India \nwhich are even more dependent on foreign sources of energy than we are. \nIf India can have clean nuclear for electricity generation, that is \ngoing to obviously help the people of India. It will improve their air \nquality, clearly. As you all know, a barrel of oil, wherever it is \nproduced, has the same price.\n  With the increasing economies of China and India and elsewhere around \nthe world, for every bit of oil that is produced, the whole global \nmarket is competing for that barrel of oil. To the extent that India's \ndemands can be somewhat ameliorated as well as ours in coal \nliquification or biofuels or other renewable approaches, it is going to \nhelp our energy independence in this insofar as India is concerned.\n  Beyond energy and jobs, we have grave threats facing the United \nStates and also our friends and allies insofar as security. We need to \nbuild new alliances, and we need to strengthen existing alliances as \nwell.\n  With that in mind, I think we ought to be looking further into the \n21st century to determine what U.S. policy will be in Asia. What should \nit be? Where can we reasonably expect support to come from, whether in \nAsia or the Western Pacific?\n  Presently, some of the key allies that share our values are South \nKorea, Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, and Australia. They are key \nleaders with us. Further positive concerted efforts need to be made \nwith Pakistan and Indonesia. India has a key role in all of this. I \nthink India is absolutely essential for our freedom and shared values \nbut also our freedom advancement in innovation and our security.\n  As I mentioned, I was in India last fall. This was a key issue on the \nminds of Prime Minister Singh and other government leaders. India is a \ncountry with tremendous potential, amazing values, but also a lot of \nhardship, hard breaks, and poverty in that country. They need reliable \nenergy. They are working in education. In fact, we can learn a lot from \nIndia insofar as education is concerned as young people in middle \nschool are focused on high school exams to get into the India \ninstitutes of technology. We need to get more Americans from all \nbackgrounds interested in engineering and science as India has done.\n  India is also so important to security--a country which will soon \nhave well over 1.2 billion people, not only the world's largest \ndemocracy but the world's largest country in the next few years.\n  The challenges that face India's future development are making \nprogress, but they are tremendous challenges. So while India is now a \nglobal economic power, it is going to be increasingly an economic power \nin the future. It is going to be a much more important voice in Asia as \nwell.\n  So it is in the interest of the United States to engage India, to \nhelp it develop safe, clean, and reliable energy, and also further our \nexisting ties with its leaders in government, especially the people of \nIndia who appreciate the United States. Of course, there is a great \ndeal of trade between the United States and India. Many of the H-1B \nvisa applicants are from India which are very important for Virginia's \neconomy and for the economy of the United States.\n  I also believe that we need to--I urge my colleagues to--examine this \nin its totality. It is imperative that we pass this legislation and \nbegin finalizing this agreement that was reached by the elected leaders \nof the United States and India. It is in our security interests. It is \nin our economic interests. It strengthens the alliance which will be \nvital for years ahead.\n\n  I believe very strongly that this United States-India pact will be a \nmarriage which will benefit all of us, not just now but for generations \nto come.\n  I thank my colleagues. I urge most respectfully the passage of the \nUnited States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act with no \nkiller amendments and let's allow this marriage between the United \nStates and India blossom for our security, for our jobs, and our best \ninterests through the years to come.\n  I thank Chairman Lugar again for his outstanding and remarkable \nwisdom and insight shepherding this measure through. I hope by the end \nof the day this will pass, and that this marriage will continue to bear \nfruit for generations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for his very generous comments about my leadership and the \nwork of the committee. But I want to say that I appreciated very much \nthe Senator's diligent and thoughtful work on the committee. He will be \nmissed. He has been a great leader in our efforts and has participated \nmaterially in the formation of the legislation he talked about today. I \ndeeply appreciate the strength of his statement and his very thoughtful \ncomments.\n  I understand the distinguished Senator from Kansas wishes to make a \nstatement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Indiana, \nChairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He has done an outstanding \njob. He has been a leader and a foreign policy voice on Capitol Hill. \nHis leadership is measured, and he is very knowledgeable and quite \ngood. I appreciate his wisdom, counsel, and leadership--and his \nleadership on this bill as well.\n  I recognize my colleague from Virginia who has done an outstanding \njob for many years in many capacities on foreign relations. I know that \nhe knows the issues on the United States-India relationship. Many \npeople I have worked with on India have worked with the Senator from \nVirginia. I deeply appreciated his work, knowledge, interest, and \npassion on pushing these issues. It takes people such as that to build \nrelationships. You have to always be pushing people together. I \nappreciate his willingness to do that.\n  I rise in support of this bill. I rise, as my colleague from Virginia \nhas done, in support of the bill but without debilitating killer \namendments associated with it.\n  I rise as someone who has chaired the South Asia subcommittee for a \nperiod of time and worked in building relationships with India.\n  I rise as the Senator who carried the initial bill to allow the \nadministration to lift sanctions against India when it tested nuclear \nweapons during the Clinton administration. It was a big brawl of \ndiscussion we had at that point in time.\n  Let me take my colleagues back a little bit. That was the point in \ntime when India was starting to shift away from its former focus on the \nSoviet Union, then Russia, and whether it was going to join the West \nand work with us. There was a big debate going on within Indian society \nas to whether they were going to pull along alongside the United \nStates. It was a very heated debate, a very important discussion. It \nbecame the signature moment as to whether the United States would be a \npartner with India.\n  You will recall that for many years the United States and India had \nwhat was best described as a prickly relationship. There was not an \neasy, favorable one even though the fundamentals underneath seemed like \nthey were something that would be very good. India is equal. It has the \nlargest democracy and we the oldest. We are the two largest democracies \nin the world. It would seem to be that this would be a very easy and \nlogical relationship. Yet they had gone into the Soviet sphere. We had \nbuilt more of a relationship with China than with India even though the \nfundamentals under India were much better for us than they were with \nChina. There has been this separation and division for some period of \ntime.\n  India decided they needed to have a nuclear basis. They tested. \nPakistan tested in response to that. We had a series of sanctions that \nimmediately kicked in with that testing. Then our\n\n[[Page S10994]]\n\nentire relationship with India was viewed through the nuclear \nnonproliferation issue. We had all these other issues that we needed to \ndiscuss--economics, spread of terrorism, a series of issues, human \nrights items. Everything went through the nonproliferation portal. If \nyou couldn't clear it through, we wouldn't be able to develop the rest.\n  Finally, we were able to provide the relationship, the \nadministration, and the capacity to waive this series of sanctions. It \nwas a difficult discussion and decision within the Congress. We were \nable to pass it through. Then let us get into a broader range--and the \nrelationship flourished. It expanded enormously.\n  Now I think we are at another step. This is another one of those key \njunctures in the relationship as to whether this was going be a true \nand budding and future-oriented relationship. That is whether we can \nenter into this agreement that we are discussing here today. This is \nbeing watched very carefully in India as being a key view as to what \nthe United States is going to do in its ongoing relationship with \nIndia.\n  I urge passage and strong support in building the fundamentals and \nstrengthening a United States-India relationship. This agreement is not \nabout sacrificing the nonproliferation regime on the altar of strategic \ncooperation. I want to emphasize that point. I think as people look at \nit, the initial question they would come up with is, I am fine with the \nstrategic relationship; I will not sacrifice the nonproliferation \nissue. It is not about sacrificing that. It is about recognizing the \nreality of India's 30-year nuclear program. Engaged in peaceful \ncivilian--as the chairman has said many times--nuclear cooperation with \nthe world's largest democracy, securing commitments from India to \nimplement the IAEA standard and safeguard and affirming India's \nlongstanding commitment to democracy and its constructive role in \nshaping the world in decades ahead.\n  There is an environmental angle on this as we look at India as being \na key economy in growth. That growth is consuming much more energy. \nThat energy is generally in the form of fossil fuels which release a \nlot more CO2. If we are concerned about the release and the \nimpact and the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere, one of \nthe key things we should do from an environmental perspective is to \nengage in this agreement on civilian nuclear power. That is where we \nwill reduce the CO2 loading into the atmosphere.\n\n  From another nonstrategic, nonproliferation angle, from an \nenvironmental angle, this is a very positive agreement, a key agreement \nwe can have with one of the fastest growing economies in the world that \nwill be releasing a lot more CO2 in the atmosphere unless \nthey use a great deal of nuclear capacity in building that energy \nsystem.\n  Bringing India to the nonproliferation regime and forging a strategic \npartnership with the world's largest democracy makes America safer, as \nwell. We have a common enemy in the war on terrorism around the world. \nIndia has been a key and strategic partner in their assistance in \ncurbing the nuclear pursuits of Iran, a weaponized nuclear pursuit by \nIran. We are getting help from India on that. We continue to work with \nPakistan.\n  As a number have pointed out, either implicitly or explicitly, it is \na balancing issue, a balance-of-power issue with China. I know everyone \nin this Senate thinks about that, even if it is not expressed often, \nbut it is key that we build this balance of power in our balance with \nIndia in this region of the world as a democracy, as a country that is \nwith us in the fight on terrorism.\n  India shares strategic interests; it also shares values. They have a \ncommitment to democracy, with rules of law, transparency, a \nmultireligious country. America and India, as I mentioned, are the \nworld's two largest democracies, and India has had a functioning \ndemocracy for some period of time. Civilian nuclear cooperation is an \nimportant step in developing new and alternative energy sources.\n  Comparison with Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs are \nmisleading. There are strict measures taken to ensure our cooperation \nwill only be with India's civilian nuclear program. They have proven to \nbe trustworthy. There is still reason to believe North Korea and Iran \nare clearly pursuing these for nuclear weapons and for purposes against \nus, very threatening to us and our interests. We need to look at the \nnature of the regimes. India is a peaceful, stable democracy versus \nauthoritarian in Iran and North Korea.\n  Finally, this is just one of the key relationships at one of the key \ntimes. It is important we take the right steps during those points in \ntime. I hope we have a very positive, robust debate and pass this bill \nby a very large margin, saying to the people of India and around the \nworld: We are interested in partnering with you, we want to partner \nwith you, we want to expand that partnership, and we see this as a key \npartnership for our future, for your future, and for global stability.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator from Kansas for a very strong \nendorsement of this legislation.\n  I note in the Senate the distinguished Senator from Georgia who would \nlike to participate. I look forward to hearing from him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise in full support of the United \nStates-Indian nuclear agreement. I wish to share the two distinct \nreasons for my support.\n  First and foremost is the distinguished chairman from Indiana, \nSenator Lugar. There is not an individual in this Senate and I say \nprobably not an individual in this country who has committed more of \ntheir life to preventing nuclear disaster and its proliferation. There \nis perhaps no one who has worked harder to see to it that the U.S. \nagreements, as they relate to the security of nuclear power and the \ninterest of our country, have always been nothing but in the best \ninterest of the United States of America.\n  As a Senator from Georgia, I am well aware that Senator Lugar \npartnered for many years and still partners today with our Senator, Sam \nNunn, in seeking to ensure nuclear proliferation does not take place \nanywhere in the world and that nuclear materials from existing nuclear \nnations never fall in the hands of those who would use them in an act \nof terrorism. I place my confidence first and foremost in the \ndistinguished chairman from Indiana.\n  There is a second, equally compelling reason; that is, my visit to \nIndia in April of this year, just shortly after the President announced \nthe civilian nuclear deal with India. Quite frankly, my initial \nreaction before I went to India was one of significant concern. I think \nany time any of us look into nuclear agreements and the sharing of \nnuclear technology, we should have significant concern. However, I went \nto India and learned a number of things firsthand that I did not know. \nI share them with this Senate today because I believe they are \nimportant in whether we grant this agreement.\n  First, I learned quickly that in the 30-year history of involvement \nin the development of nuclear energy, India has never had a single \ndeviation from its stated original purpose, which was civilian use, and \nin terms of military, only for minimal deterrence. They have clearly \nsaid from the beginning they would never be a first-strike nation, and \nthey have always said that our motivation from a defensive mechanism is \nminimal deterrence. A 30-year consistent policy like that in any nation \nis good enough evidence for me in terms of the heart and the intent of \nthat country.\n  Second, India is a democracy of 1.3 billion people in round numbers \nin a part of the world of significant importance to the United States \nof America. They have demonstrated in their cooperation with us in the \nglobal war on terror their interest only in peaceful operations of all \nnations and never in nuclear energy or technology falling into the \nhands of those who would use it in a devious way.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Virginia has said, India is a \nblossoming nation economically, but it suffers dramatically from the \ncoal it has to burn and from the lack of efficient energy sources it \nnow has. This civilian nuclear agreement allows them the opportunity to \nexpand nuclear energy for the generation of electricity and to reduce \nthe pollution in the atmosphere, which is not just India's atmosphere \nbut is the world's atmosphere.\n\n[[Page S10995]]\n\n  The distinguished chairman from Indiana has worked long and hard on \nthis agreement. I am in full support of this agreement in its draft \nform and its presented form today. I hope the Members of the Senate \nwill endorse and ratify without debilitating amendments. I have \nconfidence in the chairman and his work. I have confidence in my visit \nto the people of India and Prime Minister Singh that they will continue \nto be what they have been: a burgeoning democracy and a great partner \nwith the United States of America.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia for visiting India, for his personal testimony on this issue, \nfor strong support of the treaty, and for his very thoughtful personal \ncomments.\n  I note the presence of the very distinguished leader in the Senate in \nfostering and strengthening India-United States relationships, the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the United \nStates-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act. I particularly \nexpress my gratitude to the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Chairman Lugar, for his outstanding work on this bipartisan \npiece of legislation that advances our strategic relationship with \nIndia while also bringing India into the mainstream of international \nnonproliferation efforts.\n  I am delighted to be the cochair, along with Senator Hillary Clinton, \nof the United States-India caucus in the Senate, actually something we \nresurrected just a couple short years ago that had fallen by the \nwayside.\n  After my own visit to India and in consultation with a number of \nIndian-American constituents who live in Texas--about 200,000 live in \nmy State alone--I became absolutely convinced that a closer \nrelationship with the great nation of India and its people was \nessential to our security interests and essential to our economic \ninterests.\n  As our colleagues know and as has been mentioned by a number of our \nMembers, Prime Minister Singh visited Washington last summer and \nPresident Bush paid a visit to India this spring. These events mark a \ncritical milestone in our improving relationship. Passage of this \nlegislation will mark another significant step and I daresay cement \nwhat is a very important relationship to both nations.\n  President Bush made a fundamental foreign policy objective to move \nthe United States-India relationship to a new level. As Secretary Rice \nhas said, our relationship with India is one of the most important \npartnerships the United States can have in the 21st century.\n  As has been often noted, India is the world's largest democracy, \nwhile we are the world's oldest democracy, and our two great nations \nshare so many common values and common beliefs. It is only appropriate \nthat the United States and India become true strategic partners as we \nmove into the 21st century. Fortunately, the days of the Cold War, when \nIndia was more aligned with the Soviet Union than with the United \nStates, are in the long past. The United States and India share a \ncommon vision for our future. It is a peaceful vision where we battle \nterrorism together, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nHIV/AIDS, and a host of other challenges that face our world today.\n  While it is true that the agreement on Civil Nuclear Cooperation is a \nsignificant departure from previous U.S. policy, I strongly believe \nthis legislation represents a positive step as we grow our strategic \nrelationship.\n  For more than 30 years, the United States and India have disagreed \nover India's decision not to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. \nAs such, the United States has not cooperated with the Nation of India \non any civilian nuclear technology to speak of. In short, we have been \nat a stalemate which has neither served our nonproliferation goals, nor \nhelped India's vast needs for energy resources. Fortunately, this \ncarefully crafted legislation will allow us to move forward in a \nresponsible manner. The agreement, in fact, enhances our \nnonproliferation efforts.\n  It is correct to say that India is not a signatory to the \nnonproliferation treaty. They have decided for their own national \nsecurity reasons that they will not become a party to the treaty, and \nno amount of international pressure is likely to change that \nconclusion. This is the reality we face, and the status quo for another \n30 years is simply not acceptable. Recognizing this reality, we must \nask ourselves, What can we do to promote nonproliferation efforts with \nIndia and bring them into the international nonproliferation regime? \nThis legislation provides that answer.\n  Despite not signing the nonproliferation treaty, India, for the \nrecord, has an excellent nonproliferation record. They understand, \nperhaps as well as anyone, the danger of the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction. This is why India has agreed to adhere to key \ninternational nonproliferation efforts on top of their own stringent \nexport control regime. This is a significant step forward which has \nbeen welcomed by the International Atomic Energy Agency Director \nGeneral Mohamed ElBaradei, who understands India will not come into the \nnonproliferation treaty by traditional means but can be accommodated \nthrough this route.\n  I conclude by noting that the United States is fortunate, indeed, to \nhave many Indian Americans who have helped bring our two nations closer \ntogether. As I have noted, many of them live in my State, as they do \naround this great country, contributing to our brainpower, to our \neconomy. Frankly, this community is one of the hardest working, most \naccomplished communities in our Nation today. There are about 200,000 \nof them living in Texas, and nearly 80,000 Indian students are studying \nat our Nation's colleges and universities. Their contributions to our \nNation and the United States-India relationship have been remarkably \npositive.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, to advance our \nstrategic relationship with India while also bringing India into the \nmainstream of international nonproliferation efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the distinguished Senator for his leadership. His \naction with the distinguished Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, is \ncertainly timely for these important visits to occur and these \nnegotiations. I think they have restored significance in our \nrelationship. I thank the Senator for coming to the Senate and offering \nstrong support for the treaty.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of another distinguished member of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the distinguished Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for S. \n3709, the United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act, \nof which I am a cosponsor. First, I congratulate Senators Lugar and \nBiden for their excellent bipartisan effort to produce a quality piece \nof legislation. We can all be very proud of this product.\n  I have long believed the United States and India should expand its \nexcellent friendship and embark upon a deeper, more strategic \nrelationship. We now have that opportunity, and I urge my fellow \nMembers of the Senate to pass S. 3709, a bill that will enable us to \ntransform our relationship with India and initiate a solid partnership \nwith great security, economic, and environmental returns for U.S. \nnational interests.\n  As President Bush said when he met with Indian Prime Minister \nManmohan Singh in New Delhi last spring:\n\n       India in the 21st century is a natural partner of the \n     United States because we are brothers in the cause of human \n     liberty.\n\n  By expanding civil nuclear cooperation with India, the United States \nhas an opportunity to bring India into an arms control regime that will \nguarantee greater oversight and inspection rights and which will allow \nus to make India's preexisting nuclear program safer and more \ntransparent. At a time when we are facing many other nuclear power \nchallenges, we should welcome this as a positive step in the world of \nnonproliferation.\n  It is not just the United States that supports civil nuclear \ncooperation with India. I was in Vienna in May, where I met with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. During our meetings--we\n\n[[Page S10996]]\n\nwere talking primarily about Iran and what they were doing in terms of \nIran's violation of the nuclear nonproliferation agreement. We also \ntalked about India and how they felt about the proposal that was being \nentered into between the United States and India. And I was told, at \nthat time, that India has been a more active and responsible partner, \nin terms of their cooperation with the IAEA, than many of the \nsignatories to the nuclear nonproliferation agreement.\n  As was just pointed out by the Senator from Texas, later on Director \nGeneral Mohamed ElBaradei called the idea that is contained in this \nagreement ``a milestone'' and ``timely for ongoing efforts to \nconsolidate the non-proliferation regime, combat nuclear terrorism and \nstrengthen nuclear safety.''\n  Furthermore, this agreement will allow us to form a critical \nstrategic relationship with India. And from a point of view, it is long \noverdue. The geostrategic facts are that China and India are two rising \npowers in the industrialized world. As China expands its economic power \nand military strength, U.S. nuclear cooperation with India can help to \neven the international keel.\n  I am also referring to the fact that China, could pose a threat to \nU.S. national security in the future. We are working very carefully to \nmake sure that does not happen, but it is something we should think \nabout. But I am also thinking about the fact that India and China also \nhave a good relationship. So the fact that we are entering into a new \nrelationship with India, I think, also would be well received by the \nChinese and other Asian countries and helpful to alleviating any \ntensions that exist.\n  For the past 30 years, we let differences in our domestic policies \nand our international intentions keep us from working together. But \nIndia is a unique democracy, a new shining city upon a hill, and we \nneed this more than ever before. We need models such as this, where \npeople of different faiths and ethnicities live together and where the \nGovernment is open and accountable for its actions. It is the largest \ndemocracy that we have in the world today.\n  Following the end of the Cold War, new economic opportunities have \ncreated room for cooperation between the United States and India in \nagriculture, health care, commerce, defense, technology, and education. \nIt is amazing to me the number of businesses I have in Ohio that have \njoint ventures in India and Indian investment in the State of Ohio.\n  In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, India has been a leader \nin fighting terrorism and rooting out extremists from its society. It \nhas a long record of responsible behavior on nonproliferation matters, \nand it is time we embrace India as part of that nonproliferation \ncommunity.\n  I strongly encourage the Senate to pass S. 3907 and take the next \nstep in bolstering our relationship with India. A democratic, \neconomically sound, internationally integrated India will serve as a \nballast in a region experiencing rapid, sweeping change.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I have recognition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the floor manager and the matter we \nhave before us is of great importance and consequence. I know we have a \nvariety of different amendments that are being considered and are being \ntalked about, even as we are here now. I do not mean to interfere with \nthe flow of this debate and reaching a timely conclusion of it, but I \nwant to address the Senate for a few moments on what I consider to be \nsort of the important agenda for our committee, our HELP Committee, in \nthis next session. I will cooperate, obviously, with the floor manager \nand ask that my remarks be printed in an appropriate place in the \nRecord. And I will speak for just a few moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So others who want to continue the debate will have the \nopportunity to do so. And as one who has been a floor manager, I \nunderstand his desire to have focus and attention on the underlying \nmatters. But I appreciate the courtesy and the understanding of the \nmanager letting me talk briefly this afternoon.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5173\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk that has \nbeen cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5173.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make the waiver authority of the President contingent upon \n   a determination that India is fully and actively participating in \n  United States and international efforts to dissuade, sanction, and \n  contain Iran for its nuclear program consistent with United Nations \n                     Security Council resolutions)\n\n       On page 8, beginning on line 8, strike ``Group; and'' and \n     all that follows through ``Nuclear'' on line 9 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     Group;\n       (8) India is fully and actively participating in United \n     States and international efforts to dissuade, sanction, and \n     contain Iran for its nuclear program consistent with United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions; and\n       (9) the Nuclear\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill, \nChairman Lugar and Senator Biden, for accepting my amendment. I thank \nmy colleagues.\n  My amendment is very simple and straightforward. It requires the \nPresident to determine that India was fully and actively participating \nin U.S. and international efforts to dissuade, sanction, and contain \nIran's nuclear program consistent with United Nations Security Council \nResolutions.\n  As my colleagues know, Iran is one of, if not the most, urgent \nnuclear nonproliferation challenges the world faces today.\n  For two decades Iran secretly built up its nuclear capabilities in \nviolation of the safeguards commitments it made with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, IAEA. To date, Iran has completed most of the \nconstruction of a massive uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz, opened \na heavy-water production plant at Arak and began construction of a 40-\nmegawatt reactor there. It also began construction on a fuel \nmanufacturing plant at Isfahan; tested centrifuges with uranium, \nhexafluoride, produced their first samples of low-enriched uranium; and \nnearly completed construction of their first nuclear power reactor at \nBushehr, set to open in 2007.\n  Iran says these programs are for peaceful purposes, but experts agree \nand the Bush administration believes, that Iran is on its way to \nacquiring the capability to produce large quantities of bomb grade \nnuclear material. Additionally, Iran has not fully answered numerous \nquestions from the IAEA about activities that may be related to a \nweapons program. These activities are very concerning.\n  Earlier this year, the IAEA Board of Governors found Iran to be in \nviolation of its safeguards commitments and reported Iran's file to the \nU.N. Security Council. The Security Council has demanded that Iran \nsuspend its uranium enrichment program and construction of a heavy-\nwater production reactor. These technologies can be used to make bomb-\ngrade nuclear material.\n  However, Iran continues to stiff-arm the IAEA's investigation of its \nprogram. This week Iran again thumbed its nose at the international \ncommunity boasting that the world would have to ``live with a nuclear \nIran.'' A new report this week from the IAEA says the agency found new \ntraces of plutonium and enriched uranium at a nuclear research facility \nin Tehran.\n  As we are here debating this bill, U.S. diplomats are engaged with \nour partners in the U.N. Security Council on this very important issue. \nThey are working to build support for a new resolution that would \nmandate targeted sanctions on Iran to help persuade its leadership to \nchange course and halt its uranium enrichment work.\n  This diplomatic course of action is appropriate at this stage, and I \nfully support it. To succeed, any targeted sanctions policy must not \nonly have the active support of Security Council member states, but \nalso the cooperation of other member states of the\n\n[[Page S10997]]\n\ninternational community. Targeted sanctions against Iran will not work \nunless they are fully and actively supported by states close to Iran \nand with ties to Iran, such as India. They will not work, I would add, \nwithout effective diplomatic engagement with Iran.\n  This is a time when we need to have the support of every country as \nthe United States works with our allies to contain and constrain Iran's \ntroubling nuclear program.\n  Now my colleagues may be wondering what this has to do with India.\n  India has a robust relationship with Iran. India actively engages in \nmilitary-to-military cooperation with Iran and the two countries have a \nsignificant trade relationship. India plans to build a gas pipeline \nfrom Iran through Pakistan. India's leaders see Iran as a diplomatic \npartner on many issues. In fact, Iran's Foreign Minister will be \nvisiting New Delhi today.\n  Given India's proximity to Iran, none of this is surprising, but it \nmeans that India has a particular responsibility to help contain Iran's \nnuclear and missile capabilities and support possible U.N. Security \nCouncil sanctions against Iran.\n  Obviously, India, like most other states, does not support a nuclear \nweapons option for Iran.\n  However, Indian views of the threat posed by the Iran nuclear program \nand its perspective on Iran's so-called ``right'' to peaceful nuclear \ntechnology differ significantly from U.S. views. Unfortunately, some of \nIndia's policies appear to embolden Iran's leaders to press forward \nwith their ambitious nuclear plans.\n  As we move forward in our effort with the international community to \ndeal, contain, and if necessary sanction Iran for its defiance of \ninternational demands to halt its sensitive nuclear activities, we will \nneed greater support from all states, including India, in this effort.\n  Over a year ago, on September 24, 2005, India voted with the United \nStates and 20 other states on the IAEA resolution which found Iran in \ncompliance with its safeguards agreement. But the resolution did not \nrefer the matter immediately to the Security Council and according to a \nrecent report produced by the Congressional Research Service, India was \none of a handful of countries seeking to avoid such a referral.\n  Disturbingly, India's official explanation of its vote highlights \nIndia's differences with the United States on how to deal with Iran's \nnuclear transgressions. It stated that:\n  In our Explanation of Vote (this is the Indian government), we have \nclearly expressed our opposition to Iran being declared as noncompliant \nwith its safeguards agreements. Nor do we agree that the current \nsituation could constitute a threat to international peace and \nsecurity. Nevertheless, the resolution does not refer the matter to the \nSecurity Council and has agreed that outstanding issues be dealt with \nunder the aegis of the IAEA itself. This is in line with our position \nand therefore, we have extended our support.\n  India again voted with the United States on February 4, 2006, when \nthe IAEA Board of Governors voted to refer Iran's noncompliance to the \nU.N. Security Council. This was welcomed at the time. Yet the Indian \nMinistry of External Affairs responded to questions about its vote by \nnoting that:\n  ``While there will be a report to the Security Council, the Iran \nnuclear issue remains within the purview of the IAEA. It has been our \nconsistent position that confrontation should be avoided and any \noutstanding issue ought to be resolved through dialogue. . . . Our vote \nin favour of the Resolution should not be interpreted as in any way \ndetracting from the traditionally close and friendly relations we enjoy \nwith Iran.''\n  By keeping the issue under the purview of the IAEA Iran would not be \nsubject to sanctions. The IAEA does not have that capability, the \nSecurity Council does.\n  In April 2006, the U.N. Security Council issued a statement calling \nfor an immediate suspension of all Iranian enrichment activities. Iran \nresponded by announcing that it had produced a small quantity of low-\nenriched uranium using a test assembly of centrifuges and noted it \nplanned to expand the facility's production capacity.\n  What was India's response? On May 30, India signed onto a statement \nby the Non-Aligned Movement, which said that concerns surrounding \nIran's nuclear program should be resolved at the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency Board of Governors and not the U.N. Security Council, \nagain seeking to avoid sanctions, contrary to what U.S. diplomats and \nothers were urging at that time.\n  In July, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1696, which gave \nTehran until August 31 to suspend its uranium enrichment program and \nrequired Tehran to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency's, IAEA, investigation of its nuclear programs.\n  Again what was India's response? Apparently, in an attempt to patch \nup relations with Tehran over its earlier votes at the IAEA Board of \nGovernors, India added its name to the September 2006 joint statement \non Iran's nuclear program released by the Non-Aligned Movement at its \nmeeting in Havana. In this statement, India called nuclear research and \ndevelopment a ``basic inalienable right'' of Iran's, and said that \nnuclear ``choices and decisions'' of different countries ``must be \nrespected.''\n  Newspaper headlines in Iran trumpeted the news. The Iran Times \nheadline on September 18 read: ``118 Countries Back Iran's Nuclear \nProgram.'' Iran's President met with India's Prime Minister in Havana \nto discuss how to deepen Indo-Iranian ties.\n  Since then, talks between Iran and the EU to halt the Iranian nuclear \nprogram have broken down, and in October, Iran took additional steps to \nimprove its enrichment capability and is now seeking IAEA nuclear \nsafety assistance on its Arak heavy-water reactor. U.S. diplomats are \nworking hard now to lobby fellow members of the IAEA Board of Governors \nto reject this request. We need India's active support when that \nhappens.\n  In a recent report, the Congressional Research Service detailed some \nconcerns about India's proliferation record with respect to Iran.\n  The U.S. Government, as a result of the Iran-Syria Nonproliferation \nAct, has sanctioned Indian companies for transferring WMD technologies \nand materials to Iran and other countries.\n  On August 4, the Bush administration publicly announced in the \nFederal Register sanctions on two Indian entities for transferring \nchemicals that can be used to produce missile propellant to Iran. The \nsanctions determination had been made July 25, a day before the House \npassed its version of the India bill.\n  For its part, India contended the sanctions were unwarranted. A \nMinistry of External Affairs spokesperson asserted on August 7th the \ntransfers were ``not in violation of our regulations or our \ninternational obligations.''\n  This is deeply disturbing. What this means is that India's current \nexport control laws are inadequate and do not meet the same high \nstandards of U.S. export laws.\n  As we move forward in our effort with the international community to \ndeal, contain, and if necessary, sanction Iran for its defiance of \ninternational demands to halt its sensitive nuclear activities, we will \nneed greater support from a regional partner. We will need India to be \nmore effective and diligent in preventing the proliferation of \ntechnologies, goods, and material that might be used by Iran to produce \nweapons of mass destruction or the means to deliver them.\n  I think that my colleagues would agree that the ties between India \nand Iran are troubling. That is why I believe we must--through my \namendment--require the President to provide a determination that India \nis actively supporting efforts to contain Iran's nuclear program before \nhe can waive existing restrictions on civil nuclear commerce with \nIndia.\n  I want to be clear--my amendment is not ``anti-India.'' My amendment \nis a positive and vital step in safeguarding our own national security \ninterests.\n  There are some in this body who have argued that this legislation, \nand the possible agreement for nuclear cooperation, will enhance our \nstrategic relationship and improve India's nonproliferation record. \nOthers have warned that this will damage the vital effort to reduce \nnuclear weapons dangers in South Asia and elsewhere if we don't make \nadjustments to strengthen the nonproliferation requirements in the \npackage.\n\n[[Page S10998]]\n\n  Whatever our differences may be regarding other aspects of this \nproposal, one issue that I hope we can agree on is the need to ensure \nwe have India's full and active cooperation and support in the effort \nto prevent Iran or other states from acquiring the capability to \nproduce bomb material.\n  As the Senate considers reversing 36 years of nuclear proliferation \nrestrictions, it is important that we ensure that India is a true \nstrategic partner in the effort to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear \nweapons.\n  Again, I appreciate the support of my colleagues in accepting my \namendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 5173.\n  The amendment (No. 5173) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I note the distinguished Senator from New Mexico is \npresent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5174\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5174.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To limit the waiver authority of the President)\n\n       On page 6, after line 21, add the following:\n\n       (c) Operation of Waivers.--Notwithstanding any waiver under \n     subsection (a)--\n       (1) no nuclear equipment or sensitive nuclear technology \n     may be exported to India unless the President has determined, \n     and has submitted to the appropriate congressional committees \n     a report stating, that both India and the United States are \n     taking specific steps to conclude a multilateral treaty on \n     the cessation of the production of fissile materials for use \n     in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; and\n       (2) no nuclear materials may be exported to India unless \n     the President has determined, and has submitted to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report stating, that \n     India has stopped producing fissile materials for weapons \n     pursuant to a unilateral moratorium or multilateral \n     agreement.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment would establish a link \nbetween the export of nuclear fuel and equipment to India under the \nUnited States-India nuclear agreement and India's halting of the \nproduction of nuclear weapons material. More specifically, my amendment \nprovides two separate tests, one for nuclear equipment and technology, \nand another for nuclear material.\n  As to the nuclear equipment and technology, my amendment would \nrequire the President to certify that both India and the United States \nare taking specific steps to conclude a verifiable fissile material \ncutoff treaty before the United States exports any nuclear equipment or \ntechnology to India. As to nuclear fuel, my amendment would require the \nPresident to certify that India has stopped producing fissile material \nfor weapons, either unilaterally or as part of a multilateral \nagreement, again, before the United States exports nuclear material to \nIndia.\n  The purpose of the amendment is not to kill the bill or the agreement \nwith India but, as I see it, to strengthen that agreement. It would \nallow nuclear trade with India to proceed but in a way that will be \nconsistent with our nuclear nonproliferation goals and our security \ninterests.\n  It imposes no unreasonable or unrealistic conditions on nuclear trade \nwith India. It simply requires the President to determine that India \nhas followed through on its stated agreement to work toward a fissile \nmaterial cutoff treaty. Let me explain why I believe this amendment is \nnecessary.\n  In 1974, India tested a nuclear weapon it built using technology that \nwe had provided to it for peaceful purposes. The title of the pending \nbill is United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act. So \nin 1974, India tested a nuclear weapon built using technology that we \nhad given it for peaceful purposes. We responded then by strengthening \nour nuclear export laws in 1978 to ensure that that could not happen \nagain. In 1980, we cut off nuclear cooperation with India, after India \nfailed to meet the terms of the new law.\n  The bill before us would make it possible to resume nuclear \ncooperation with India by exempting India from certain requirements \nthat we added to our nuclear export laws in 1978.\n  Proponents of the bill offer some strong arguments for going ahead. \nThey say that we need to resume nuclear cooperation in order to \ncultivate closer ties with India. They say it is in our best interest \nto help India expand its civilian nuclear power program so that India \nmight meet its growing energy needs with clean, environmentally \nfriendly sources of power. They say it will help to bring India within \nthe ``nonproliferation mainstream.'' I don't quarrel with any of those \narguments or with the goal of the legislation. I agree that our past \npolicies to pressure India on nuclear nonproliferation have not worked. \nCompared to several of its neighbors, India has a relatively good \nnonproliferation record, and by improving cooperation with India, we \nmay be able to make India a useful ally in our efforts to halt the \nspread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East and in Asia.\n  My quarrel is not with the goal of reopening nuclear cooperation with \nIndia but in the details of the bill and in the terms on which we \npropose to resume that cooperation.\n  Under current law, in order for the United States to resume nuclear \ntrade with India, our two nations must enter into an agreement for \ncooperation under section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act. Section 123 of \nthe Atomic Energy Act requires the agreement to meet eight specific \nconditions. One of those conditions is that India must sign an \nagreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to safeguard all \nnuclear material under its jurisdiction. India has consistently and \nsteadfastly refused to agree to these so-called full-scope safeguards.\n  Even if we were able to enter into an agreement for cooperation with \nIndia, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would then have to license the \nexport of specific nuclear material and facilities to India under the \nprovisions of section 126 of that same Atomic Energy Act. And in order \nto license an export under those provisions, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission would first have to find that the statutory export licensing \ncriteria of section 127 and 128 of the Atomic Energy Act are met. Among \nother things, section 128 requires the Commission to find that the \nfull-scope IAEA safeguards will be maintained on all of India's nuclear \nactivities.\n  Once again, though, of course, India has refused to agree to those \nfull-scope safeguards. Even if India were to accept full-scope \nsafeguards, there is the third problem.\n  Section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act prohibits the export of nuclear \nmaterials or equipment or sensitive nuclear technology to any \nnonnuclear weapons state that has detonated a nuclear explosive device, \nviolated or abrogated IAEA safeguards, or engaged in activities \ndirected toward making a nuclear explosive device. Even section 129--\nand since India tested a nuclear explosive device in 1974 and five \ntimes since then in 1998, it has clearly run afoul of this provision.\n\n  The Atomic Energy Act provides a way around all of these obstacles. \nIt says that the President can waive the full-scope safeguard \nrequirement and can enter into an agreement for cooperation, as he is \nhere proposing to do, without full-scope safeguards if he determines \nthat insistence on full-scope safeguards:\n\n       Would be seriously prejudicial to the achievement of the \n     United States nonproliferation objectives or otherwise \n     jeopardize the common defense and security.\n\n  Similarly, the act allows the President to authorize exports without \nfull-scope safeguards, and in spite of India's detonation of a nuclear \nexplosive device, if the President:\n\n       Determines that cessation of such exports would be \n     seriously prejudicial to the achievement of the United States \n     nonproliferation objectives or otherwise jeopardize the \n     common defense and security.\n\n\n[[Page S10999]]\n\n\n  President Carter used this authority in 1980 to export nuclear fuel \nto India. But the current administration has apparently concluded that \nPresident Bush cannot say that withholding nuclear exports from India \nwould seriously prejudice our nonproliferation objectives or jeopardize \nour security.\n  So instead of relying on the existing waiver authority that is in the \nlaw, the administration has requested and the bill provides--the bill \nbefore us would provide a specific statutory waiver for India. This is \na waiver from the full-scope safeguard requirements of sections 126, \n128, and the nuclear weapons prohibition contained in section 129. So \ninstead of applying full-scope safeguards to all peaceful nuclear \nactivities in India, the bill only asks that India give the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and the United States a:\n\n       Credible plan to separate its civil nuclear facilities, \n     materials, and programs from its military facilities, \n     materials, and programs, and that it only apply the IAEA \n     safeguards to those civilian activities.\n\n  Let me just put up a chart up here to make the point as to what I \nthink the bill contains. This is an important distinction for all of us \nto understand.\n  India has been called upon in this agreement to separate what they \nare going to open to safeguards from the portion of their nuclear \nprogram they are going to keep separate from any kind of a full-scope \nsafeguard. So there are 14 power reactors and one fuel reprocessing \nplant they have identified as being subject to safeguards under this \nagreement. That is the so-called civilian side of what they are doing.\n  Then there is the nonsafeguarded area, and that, according to the \nIndians--and, of course, they are the ones who make this judgment and \nhave under this agreement we are now considering, they have determined \nthat there are eight power reactors for which they are not going to \nprovide safeguards: their Fast Breeder program, which they are not \ngoing to provide safeguards for, and of course their entire military \nprogram, which is made up of two plutonium reprocessing plants, two \nuranium enrichment plants, and two heavy water plutonium production \nreactors. So it is clear that there is a substantial amount of their \nnuclear program that they have determined they will not open to \ninspection by the IAEA and will not open to these requirements which \nare contained in our own law.\n  There are major problems with this approach. First is that the \npartial safeguards are not full-scope safeguards. India produced its \nseparation plan in March. It offers to place some of its civilian power \nreactors, some of its fuel cycle facilities, some of its research \nfacilities under safeguards, but it leaves still others of its civilian \npower reactors, its fuel cycle facilities, its research reactors, and \nits military plants unsafeguarded. Many of the facilities that raise \nthe greatest proliferation concerns, including the Fast Breeder Reactor \nprogram and its uranium enrichment plants and its spent fuel processing \nfacilities, are placed beyond the reach of any international \nsafeguards. India will be free to use these facilities to produce \nfissile material for nuclear weapons without any international \ninspection or control.\n  To make matters worse, by allowing India to buy civilian nuclear fuel \non the international market, India will no longer have to choose \nbetween using its own limited uranium resources to supply its civilian \npower program or its weapons program. It will be able to buy nuclear \nfuel for its civilian power program and devote all its own uranium \nresources to its weapons program.\n  The other major problem with this approach is that it abandons the \nfundamental tenet of our nuclear nonproliferation policy; namely, that \nnations are required to renounce nuclear weapons in order to get our \nassistance. This simple bargain has been the cornerstone of our \nnonproliferation policy since President Eisenhower announced the Atoms \nFor Peace program over a half a century ago. The bill before us \nabandons that policy. It offers U.S. assistance to India without any \nrestraint or limitation on its existing weapons program. Making such an \nexception for India will, in my view, permanently weaken our \nnonproliferation policy and our credibility on this issue. Already \nthere are other nations, including Pakistan, that have asked for \nsimilar treatment. We are signaling that there are no general rules \nthat apply when it comes to nonproliferation; whether we will ship \nnuclear technology or nuclear fuel or materials to a country depends \nupon the circumstances of each case. That is what this agreement \nsignals to the rest of the world. It is difficult to see how we can \ninsist that China and Russia strictly enforce full-scope safeguards in \ntheir dealings with Iran and North Korea if we are not going to enforce \nfull-scope safeguards in our dealings with other countries--India, in \nthis case. That is not to say we should bar the door to further nuclear \ncooperation with India or vote down the bill. I think we should open up \nnuclear trade with India, but we should do it in a way that is in \nkeeping with our broad nuclear nonproliferation policy.\n  I believe the bill before us, while seriously flawed as it now \nstands, can be fixed, can be salvaged, and that is the purpose of my \namendment. The central issue, as I see it, is how to allow nuclear \ntrade with India to proceed without aiding and abetting India's nuclear \nweapons program. India has dozens of nuclear weapons today. China has \nhundreds of nuclear weapons today. We do not want to see a race begin \nin Asia to see who can achieve the greatest capability in nuclear \nweapons. I believe the answer is to establish a link between our \ncooperation with India's civilian nuclear program and India stopping \nits production of nuclear materials for its weapons program.\n\n  What I am recommending is nothing more than what our former \ncolleague, Senator Sam Nunn, suggested in the article which is on each \nMember's desk entitled ``A Nuclear Pig In A Poke.'' It was an article \nin the Wall Street Journal on May 24, and I commend it to all of my \ncolleagues for their consideration. Specifically, Senator Nunn in that \narticle recommended that:\n\n       Congress require a two-stage process. First, before any \n     export of nuclear reactors, components, or related technology \n     are provided to India, the President should have to certify \n     that both India and the United States are taking specific \n     steps to lead a serious and expedited international effort to \n     conclude a verifiable fissile material cutoff treatment.\n\n  Continuing with his statement:\n\n       Second, before any exports of nuclear reactor fuel or its \n     components are provided to India, thereby freeing India to \n     use its limited stocks to expand its nuclear weapons program, \n     the President would be required to certify that India has \n     stopped producing fissile materials for weapons, either as \n     part of a voluntary moratorium or multilateral agreement.\n\n  That is precisely what the amendment does.\n  I have attached a letter to the opinion piece Senator Nunn wrote, a \nletter from Senator Nunn to me where he states that clearly the \namendment I am offering today is trying to implement the \nrecommendations he made in his earlier opinion piece. So this amendment \nis based squarely on Senator Nunn's proposal. It simply requires first \nthat before nuclear equipment and technology can be exported, the \nPresident first should determine that both India and the United States \nare taking specific steps to conclude a fissile material cutoff treaty; \nsecond, that before any nuclear materials may be exported to India, the \nPresident must determine that India has stopped producing fissile \nmaterials for weapons.\n  Both the United States and India have already agreed to work toward a \nfissile materials cutoff treaty. The bill before us, in section 1055, \nalready requires the President to determine that India is working with \nus toward such a treaty before he can use the waivers. All my amendment \ndoes is to require the President to determine and to report to Congress \nthat specific steps are being taken before we export nuclear equipment \nand technology, and that India has, in fact, stopped producing weapons \nmaterial before we export nuclear material to India. The amendment \nwould simply implement Senator Nunn's recommendations.\n  As I indicated, there is a letter pointing out that this amendment \nwould, in fact, accomplish that objective that is attached to the \nopinion piece.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nunn's May 24 op-\ned in the Wall Street Journal and his letter to me dated September 28 \nof this year be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S11000]]\n\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I am proposing here is not \na killer amendment. I know the traditional approach in the Senate is \nthat any time an amendment is offered, it is characterized by its \nopponents as a killer amendment, so you could make the argument that \nanything we might change in the pending legislation would absolutely \nkill our prospects of getting anything done. But this amendment is not \na killer amendment. As Senator Nunn has stated in his op-ed piece, it \nis not a killer amendment:\n\n       Unless you believe that India will continue its weapons-\n     usable nuclear material production, and that U.S. and Indian \n     pledges to work for a fissile material cutoff treaty are \n     insincere, meaningless gestures.\n\n  If those pledges are sincere and meaningful, as I trust they are, \nthen this amendment simply says they should be fulfilled before exports \nbegin.\n  Adoption of my amendment will significantly strengthen the agreement \nwith India. As Senator Nunn has said:\n\n       This two-stage approach would significantly strengthen the \n     deal in a way that improves the protection of our core \n     security interests, while ultimately allowing trade to \n     proceed. By establishing a linkage between exports of nuclear \n     material and the cessation of Indian production of nuclear \n     weapons material, this amendment will maintain the integrity \n     of an important U.S. security objective; that is, preventing \n     the growth and spread of nuclear weapons-usable material \n     around the globe.\n\n  Without this amendment I am offering, I fear the enactment of the \nbill pending before us would result in making the world a more \ndangerous place rather than a less dangerous place. This amendment will \ngive us the advantages of the agreement but without the increased \ndanger which all of us would like to see avoided.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico. This is a killer condition \nbecause it requires the President to make two determinations prior to \nthe U.S.-India agreement being implemented that are at odds with the \npurpose of the pact.\n  First, under the Bingaman amendment a determination must be made that \nboth India and the United States have taken specific steps to conclude \na Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, or FMCT, before the U.S. can export \nnuclear equipment and technology.\n  The amendment requires that a second determination be made that India \nhas stopped the production of fissile material for weapons before the \nU.S. can export nuclear materials.\n  While I agree that an Indian commitment to abandon its nuclear \nweapons program would have been optimal, even in its absence this \nagreement serves U.S. national security interests. Members must \nconsider whether this amendment and others like it advance U.S. \nnational security. I believe that U.S. interests are served by greater \nIAEA oversight of India's nuclear program and I reject amendments that \nmake the perfect the enemy of the good. I support this agreement and \noppose amendments, like this one, that would derail its implementation.\n  By linking American exports of nuclear equipment and technology to \nU.S. and Indian progress on a multilateral FMCT holds New Delhi to a \ndifferent and higher standard than any other country we have nuclear \ntrade with, higher standards for example than we require of Beijing. A \nsuccessful FMCT will only be concluded and implemented when every \nnation with fissile material production capabilities agrees and abides \nby its commitment. I worry that this amendment may provide countries \nwho oppose this bilateral agreement with a backdoor veto. In other \nwords, if another nation stymies progress on a FMCT, will India and the \nU.S. be penalized?\n  I share the strong support of the Senator from New Mexico for an \nFMCT. But a successful FMCT negotiation will require the assent of all \nnations, in particular China. Unlike the U.S., the United Kingdom, \nFrance, and Russia, China is assumed to have ceased fissile material \nproduction but has not made a public statement confirming this as the \nothers have.\n  The report that accompanies the Lugar-Biden legislation, S. 3709, \nhighlights the potential trouble with these kind of linkages. The \nConference on Disarmament, the host of talks on a FMCT, has been unable \nto agree on a work program, in part because some countries--notably \nChina--have refused to approve the beginning of FMCT negotiations \nunless the Conference on Disarmament also approves discussions of other \nissues, such as nuclear disarmament and banning weapons in outer space. \nFor its part India has long supported conclusion of an effectively \nverifiable FMCT. This position reflects India's concern regarding \nfissile material production by its nuclear-armed neighbors, and it \nwould be unrealistic to expect a precipitous change in India's \nposition. It would be difficult to determine that the U.S. and India \nhave taken specific steps to conclude an FMCT if Chinese interference \ndidn't permit the negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament to \nstart.\n  In testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations, former \nSecretary of Defense William Perry addressed the danger of conditioning \npassage of the U.S.-India agreement on FMCT-related issues. In fact, \nBill Perry stated that there were many things by which we could \ncondition nuclear trade with India on, including ``India tak[ing] a \nleadership position in promoting an international cutoff in the \nproduction of fissile material.'' But Dr. Perry concluded:\n\n       I do not recommend that the Senate try to modify the \n     agreement to include them. Instead, I recommend that the \n     Senate task the Administration to vigorously pursue \n     continuing diplomacy to facilitate these actions, and that \n     should be as a follow-on to the agreement.\n\n  Secretary Perry's advice was good counsel and we adopted it in the \nLugar-Biden bill. In our opinion, S. 3709 strikes the right balance in \nconditioning nuclear trade with India in areas consistent with the July \n18, 2005, Joint Statement. India reiterated its support for an FMCT in \nthat statement and our bill applies pressure and requires continue \nmonitoring of future Indian and U.S. administrations to ensure full \nimplementation of the decision by India to support such a treaty.\n  Section 105(5) of the Lugar-Biden bill requires an annual \ndetermination that India continues its support for an FMCT and is not \npreventing adoption of a negotiating mandate that leaves the issue of \nverification to be decided in the negotiations. If India is working \nwith the United States to conclude an FMCT or a similar treaty, that \nwould justify a presidential determination under this provision.\n  We reinforce these requirements with report language that reads that:\n\n     the United States must now use the influence it has gained \n     through efforts in both India and Pakistan, and with India \n     in particular through its nuclear trade with that nation, \n     to help them transition from nuclear build-ups to \n     stability and arms reductions. This is nowhere more \n     relevant than in the area of fissile material production.\n\n  In addition, this amendment requires the President to determine that \nIndia has ceased the production of fissile materials for nuclear \nweapons before the agreement can be implemented. India has long \nrejected calls for the cessation of fissile material production, \npointing to rival nuclear weapons programs as justification.\n  India maintains that it cannot agree to a unilateral cap on fissile \nmaterial production at this time. Pakistan continues to produce fissile \nmaterial for weapons-related purposes, and China has not yet committed \nto a moratorium on such production. It is not in U.S. national security \ninterests to threaten the significant nonproliferation gains afforded \nby this Initiative with India in order to seek a fissile material cap \nthat India indicates it cannot agree to, absent a similar commitment by \nPakistan and China.\n  As Secretary Rice testified on April 6, 2006, before the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n       India would never accept a unilateral freeze or cap on its \n     nuclear arsenal. We raised this with the Indians, but the \n     Indians said that its plans and policies must take into \n     account regional realities. No one can credibly assert that \n     India would accept what would amount to an arms control \n     agreement that did not include other key countries, like \n     China and Pakistan.\n\n  In addition, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security Policy, Bob Joseph, and Under Secretary of State \nfor Political Affairs, Nicholas Burns, stated on March 29, 2006:\n\n       The curtailment of the production of fissile material for \n     weapons was discussed as part of the Civil Nuclear \n     Cooperation Initiative, but India maintained that it could \n     not agree to a unilateral cap at this time. The U.S. has \n     achieved an important objective by obtaining India's \n     commitment to work toward the\n\n[[Page S11001]]\n\n     conclusion of a multilateral Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty \n     (FMCT). Moreover, we remain willing to explore other \n     intermediate options that might also serve such an objective. \n     We also continue to call on all states that produce fissile \n     material for weapons purposes to observe a voluntary \n     production moratorium, as the United States has done for \n     many years.\n\n  Senator Biden and I took a number of steps to address concerns about \ncontinued Indian fissile material production but we sought to do so in \na manner that did not threaten the efficacy of the U.S.-India \nAgreement. In section 103(1) of our bill we make it the policy of the \nUnited States ``to achieve as quickly as possible a cessation of the \nproduction by India and Pakistan of fissile materials for nuclear \nweapons and other nuclear explosive devices.''\n  Section 108(a)(1)(A) requires an annual reporting requirement on \nIndian implementation and compliance with ``the nonproliferation \ncommitments undertaken in the Joint Statement of July 18, 2005, between \nthe President of the United States and the Prime Minister of India.''\n  Other subsections within section 108 of our legislation require: (1) \nannual reports on ``significant changes in the production by India of \nnuclear weapons or in the types of amounts of fissile materials \nproduced''; (2) whether India ``is in full compliance with the \ncommitments and obligations contained in the [U.S.-India] agreements \nand other documents''; and (3) a requirement to identify and assess all \ncompliance issues arising on India's commitments and obligations. These \nreporting requirements will ensure that Congress remains fully informed \non developments related to the implementation of this agreement. As we \nall know, it is the prerogative of Congress to review these treaties \nand take action should we ever determine that Indian activities put the \nbenefits of the agreement on U.S. national security interests in doubt.\n  In addition, the committee adopted an amendment offered by Senator \nChafee during markup of S. 3709 making it the policy of the United \nStates that peaceful atomic cooperation and ``exports of nuclear fuel \nto India should not contribute to, or in any way encourage, increases \nin the production by India of fissile material for non-civilian \npurposes.''\n  The administration is in the midst of negotiations with India on a \n123 Agreement, and New Delhi is also negotiating a new safeguards \nagreement with the IAEA. The Nuclear Suppliers Group has yet to make a \ndecision to embrace the U.S.-India Agreement and approve its 45 member \nstates to engage in nuclear trade with India. If we accede to \nconditions such as the one contained in the Bingaman amendment, \nconditions that India has already rejected, we will severely limit our \nability to influence India's nuclear program.\n  Moreover, the IAEA's ability to monitor India's activities will be \nfurther circumscribed and we will return to a time when India was a \nhindrance rather than a partner in international, multilateral \nnonproliferation and arms control efforts.\n  Senator Biden and I believe we have addressed this matter in a manner \nthat does not threaten the viability of the agreement. The \ndeterminations I described above were carefully drafted to balance, and \nnot upset, the ongoing negotiations in Vienna or those in the U.S. and \nIndia. We must not forget that Congress will have a chance to vote on \nthe 123 Agreement. S. 3709 provides Congress with an up or down vote on \nthis important agreement and fully protects Congress' role in the \nprocess and ensures congressional views will be taken into \nconsideration.\n  In conclusion, the Bingaman amendment imposes an unacceptable \nprecondition on civil nuclear cooperation with India. India will regard \nthis as ``moving the goalposts,'' an unacceptable renegotiation of the \ndeal, and a bad-faith effort on our part.\n  As a consequence, this is a deal-killer that wrecks the balance that \nwe sought between executive and legislative power, nonproliferation \nresponsibilities, and the U.S.-India relationship. Killer conditions \nsuch as these forfeit the U.S. ability to influence Indian behavior. \nWhile I understand that this was not the intent of the Senator from New \nMexico, in my view it is the practical effect.\n  In sum, the Lugar-Biden bill addresses the issues raised by this \namendment without undercutting the agreement. Unfortunately, the \nBingaman amendment is a killer amendment and I urge Senators to oppose \nit.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have two amendments to offer. I will be happy to offer \nand debate them in order and to work with the chairman on whatever \narrangements he might wish for a vote on these amendments.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Let me respond to the Senator. I appreciate his \nwillingness to offer the amendments in a timely fashion. We are in the \nprocess of debating one amendment, but I will ask unanimous consent it \nbe temporarily laid aside so the Senator can offer his amendments to \nexpedite this consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n  The Senator is recognized to present his first amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5178\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5178.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To declare that it is the policy of the United States to \n continue to support implementation of United Nations Security Council \n                        Resolution 1172 (1998))\n\n         On page 5, beginning on line 15, strike ``Treaty; and'' \n     and all that follows through ``that exports'' on line 16 and \n     insert the following: ``Treaty;\n         (9) to continue to support implementation of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1172 (1998); and\n         (10) that exports\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and very \nshort. Its brevity is contained in line 4 to line 6.\n  It is an amendment that says we will:\n\n       On page 5, beginning on line 15, strike ``Treaty; and'' and \n     all that follows through ``that exports'' . . . and insert \n     the following:\n       (9) to continue to support implementation of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1172.\n\n  Let me describe what this means and why I am offering it. In May of \n1998, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed Security \nCouncil Resolution No. 1172 after India and then Pakistan, detonated \nnuclear weapons. The Security Council unanimously passed a resolution.\n  The resolution I have in my hand, in part, says that the Security \nCouncil is gravely concerned at the challenge that the nuclear tests \nconducted by India and then Pakistan constitute to international \nefforts aimed at strengthening the global regime of nonproliferation of \nnuclear weapons and also gravely concerned at the danger to peace and \nstability in the region.\n  Continuing, it says that the resolution condemns the nuclear tests \nconducted by India on 11 and 13 May, 1998, and by Pakistan on 28 and 30 \nMay, 1998, demands that India and Pakistan refrain from further nuclear \ntests, calls upon India and Pakistan immediately to stop their nuclear \nweapon development programs, to refrain from weaponization or from the \ndeployment of nuclear weapons, to cease development of ballistic \nmissiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and any further \nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons; it says the \nSecurity Council recognizes that the tests conducted by India and \nPakistan constitute a serious threat to global efforts toward nuclear \nnonproliferation and disarmament, urges India and Pakistan and all \nother states that have not yet done so to become parties to the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty and to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty without delay and without conditions.\n  That was the reaction of our country and of the United Nations in May \nof\n\n[[Page S11002]]\n\n1998, following the detonation of nuclear weapons by both India and \nPakistan, a point in time in which the world was very concerned about \nthose actions.\n  Our country then led a multinational effort to pass a resolution in \nthe United Nations, Resolution 1172. That resolution, which passed \nunanimously and which has become a resolution that represents our \npolicy and our support for these basic tenets, is at odds with the \nunderlying legislation being considered by the Senate.\n  I offer a piece of legislation, an amendment, that says it is still \nU.S. policy to support the implementations of United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 1172.\n  How does this square with what is before the Senate?\n  Resolution 1172 demonstrated that our country, the United States, and \nthe rest of the international community, agree there should be no \nfurther nuclear weapons testing in South Asia and there should be an \nend to dangerous nuclear arms competition and no additional nuclear \nweapons produced. That resolution is as relevant today as it was in \n1998.\n  Both India and Pakistan have violated Resolution 1172. They continue \nto build nuclear weapons, they produce fissile material for weapons in \nboth of those countries, they continue to develop new nuclear-capable \nmissiles.\n  No one in this Chamber would like to see, in my judgment, India or \nPakistan resume nuclear testing.\n  Now, the Bush administration wants to lift international restrictions \non nuclear trade with India. It is as if the United Nations Security \nCouncil resolution doesn't exist, never happened, doesn't apply to our \ncountry, doesn't apply to India. What does that say to North Korea? \nWhat does that tell the country of Iran?\n  This past July, the United States convinced the Security Council of \nthe United Nations to call upon Iran to fully cooperate with the IAEA \nand suspend its uranium enrichment program, stop work on a heavy water \nproduction. Iran has not complied and the U.S. working with other \nnation states on the Security Council to pass another resolution.\n  In October, the Security Council passed Resolution 1718, which \ncondemns North Korea's nuclear test and demands that North Korea not \nconduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic missile. It \nalso calls on North Korea to abandon all nuclear weapons in existing \nnuclear programs in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner; \nalso, to give up its ballistic missile program.\n  But these resolutions on Iran and North Korea will, in my judgment, \nmean far less if the United States does not reaffirm its commitment to \nResolution 1172 with respect to India and Pakistan.\n  As the world watches our actions--and we have Ambassador Burns and \nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice rushing to India to negotiate these \nkinds of agreements that begin to untie and unravel decades of \nleadership by our country against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. \nAs the world watches our actions, what will they learn from this \ndiscussion, from these actions by the Senate? Will they learn today \nthat we remain committed to Resolution 1172 of the United Nations?\n  It would be, it seems to me, a huge step backward for the Senate to \nsay that Resolution 1172, which was our policy, which passed \nunanimously in the United Nations, which called for the cessation of \nthe production of additional nuclear weapons by both India and \nPakistan, if we were to tell the world that somehow that is no longer \nour policy, that is no longer operative--at least it is not operative \nwith respect to India and Pakistan.\n  As I said earlier, the burden falls to us to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons. It is our responsibility. We are the major nuclear \nsuperpower in the world. We inherit the requirement to stop the spread \nof nuclear weapons, keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of \nterrorists, try to prevent a cataclysmic terror attack anywhere in the \nworld and especially against the cities of our country by a terrorist \ngroup who has a nuclear weapon. It is our responsibility to do that.\n  What then embraces that responsibility? What kind of things should we \nbe doing in the Senate? Should we be deciding in the Senate that one \nway to do that is to allow the production of additional nuclear weapons \non this Earth? Of course not, that is absurd. Will the underlying bill \nthat is before the Senate allow the production of additional nuclear \nweapons? Of course, it will. Everyone agrees with that. We all \nunderstand that. If that weren't the case, there would not be a \nrequirement to keep eight of the nuclear reactors behind a curtain that \nwill never be inspected. We understand what is going on.\n  I read this morning the statement from one of the top advisers in \nIndia that said they have a responsibility to move quickly and \naggressively to continue to build their nuclear deterrent. That is \nexactly what is at work here. Has our country now decided it is not our \nresponsibility to stop this? Have we decided to be the green light to \nallow others to build additional nuclear weapons? Is that the junction \nwe have reached? Not with my vote.\n  I understand all the arguments about the geopolitics and about India \nand China and counterweights and all of these issues. None of it, in my \njudgment, justifies a decision by the United States of America to send \na signal to the world that we believe it is all right for anybody to \nbegin producing additional nuclear weapons.\n  Our role, our responsibility, is to find ways today, on Thursday, \nNovember 16, 2006 to shut down the production of additional nuclear \nweapons, put pressure on those who want to build more nuclear weapons, \nto say to them it is not acceptable to us to have you building \nadditional nuclear weapons.\n  Yes, that goes for India. It goes for Pakistan. It goes for China. It \ngoes for all of those countries.\n  That ought to be our message. It ought to be unified. It ought not to \nbe convoluted. It ought to be clear. Yet the underlying message with \nwhat is on the floor of the Senate--again, negotiated by Ambassador \nBurns and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, largely in secret; I \nread about it, by the way, in the Washington Post--the underlying \nmessage is we have decided to develop a relationship with India that is \na counterweight to China in that region. One way to do that is to allow \nIndia to be able to purchase the things they need with which to produce \nadditional nuclear power.\n  They have been prevented from doing that because they refused to sign \nthe nonproliferation treaty. They refused to sign that treaty; \ntherefore, they have had sanctions against them and resolutions at the \nUnited Nations enacted that have condemned the actions. And now, in one \nfell swoop, they are told: Never mind. It does not matter. We are \nfriends, and that friendship transcends the sanctions that exist for \nthose of you who have not signed the nonproliferation treaty.\n  I think this is a horrible mistake. Again, I do not question the \nmotives of those who disagree with me. But we have made some very \nserious mistakes recently because some big thinkers made some big \nmistakes. This is a very big mistake. It is likely that the Senate will \npass the underlying legislation today. I will regret that. But if it \npasses that legislation without reaffirming the basic support for \nResolution 1172, this message today will have been a very destructive \nmessage to the rest of the world with respect to our country's \nleadership away from nuclear proliferation.\n  So, Mr. President, I would hope that we could have a vote on this \nresolution. I have a second resolution that I shall offer. But with \nthat discussion of my resolution, I will yield the floor so my \ncolleagues can respond to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 5179 and 5180\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk that have \nbeen cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes amendments numbered 5179 and 5180, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n[[Page S11003]]\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 5179\n\n   (Purpose: To require as part of the implementation and compliance \n  report an estimate of uranium use and an analysis of the production \n                   rate of nuclear explosive devices)\n\n       On page 18, beginning on line 7, strike ``existing'' and \n     all that follows through ``description'' on line 9 and insert \n     the following:\n\n     existing agreements;\n       (6) an estimate of--\n       (A) the amount of uranium mined in India during the \n     previous year;\n       (B) the amount of such uranium that has likely been used or \n     allocated for the production of nuclear explosive devices; \n     and\n       (C) the rate of production in India of--\n       (i) fissile material for nuclear explosive devices; and\n       (ii) nuclear explosive devices;\n       (7) an analysis as to whether imported uranium has affected \n     the rate of production in India of nuclear explosive devices; \n     and\n       (8) a detailed description\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 5180\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a United States-India scientific cooperative \n                       threat reduction program)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 114. UNITED STATES-INDIA SCIENTIFIC COOPERATIVE THREAT \n                   REDUCTION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Energy, acting through \n     the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration, shall establish a cooperative threat \n     reduction program to pursue jointly with scientists from the \n     United States and India a program to further common \n     nonproliferation goals, including scientific research and \n     development efforts related to nuclear nonproliferation, with \n     an emphasis on nuclear safeguards (in this section referred \n     to as the ``program'').\n       (b) Consultation.--The program shall be carried out in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \n     Defense.\n       (c) National Academies Recommendations.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Energy shall enter into \n     an agreement with the National Academies to develop \n     recommendations for the implementation of the program.\n       (2) Recommendations.--The agreement entered into under \n     paragraph (1) shall provide for the preparation by qualified \n     individuals with relevant expertise and knowledge and the \n     communication to the Secretary of Energy each fiscal year \n     of--\n       (A) recommendations for research and related programs \n     designed to overcome existing technological barriers to \n     nuclear nonproliferation; and\n       (B) an assessment of whether activities and programs funded \n     under this section are achieving the goals of the activities \n     and programs.\n       (3) Public availability.--The recommendations and \n     assessments prepared under this subsection shall be made \n     publicly available.\n       (d) Consistency With Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.--All \n     United States activities related to the program shall be \n     consistent with United States obligations under the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I urge adoption of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are adopted \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5179 and 5180) were agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would mention, Mr. President, the author of the \namendments is Senator Bingaman, and one of the amendments is also in \nconjunction with Senator Domenici.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5178\n\n  Mr. President, I want to respond to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota briefly. I oppose his amendment. While the amendment would \nmerely state that it is U.S. policy to continue to support \nimplementation of the Security Council resolution that was passed in \nJune 1998 in response to the nuclear weapons tests in South Asia--a \nresolution we voted for--I believe the amendment casts us back to a \nvery different time, well before the miraculous changes in India's \nrelations with the United States and with the world that occurred as a \nresult of the July 2005 Joint Statement and India's decision to turn \nthe corner on nonproliferation policy generally.\n  I do not believe this bill is the right place to address ourselves to \nthe past. This bill is about the future. We have taken adequate account \nin the bill of the concerns the Senator's amendment would address. \nSection 1033 of the Lugar-Biden bill makes it the policy of the United \nStates that:\n\n       India remains in full compliance with its non-\n     proliferation, arms control, and disarmament agreements, \n     obligations, and commitments.\n\n  Section 108(b) of our legislation requires annual reporting, \nincluding a detailed description of ``United States efforts to promote \nnational or regional progress by India and Pakistan in disclosing, \nsecuring, capping, and reducing their fissile material stockpiles, \npending creation of a world-wide fissile material cut-off regime, \nincluding the institution of a Fissile Material Cut-Off treaty; the \nreactions of India and Pakistan to such efforts; and assistance that \nthe United States is providing, or would be able to provide, to India \nand Pakistan'' to promote such objectives.\n  In the context of this bill, I do not believe it is appropriate to \nreturn to the past in a way the Senator's amendment would, and I urge \ndefeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Dorgan amendment. I \nappreciate, respect, and share the sentiment and concern of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota who has been doggedly supportive of pushing \nnonproliferation and a nonproliferation regime. And if this were 1998 \nor 1999, I would support the Senator's amendment. But this is 2006, and \na great deal has changed since India and Pakistan both exploded nuclear \ndevices in 1998.\n  The Security Council resolution passed after those tests called for \nseveral things: one including for India and Pakistan to immediately \nstop their nuclear weapons programs and their ballistic missile \nprograms. We wish they would have ceased their nuclear programs. They \ndid not. We wish they had ceased their programs with regard to \nmissiles. Well, they did not.\n  So the fact is, it is not realistic. We wish they would join the \nnuclear test ban treaty. But do we really think that is possible under \nthis administration that is not supportive of a comprehensive nuclear \ntest ban treaty?\n  In this legislation, and in the United States-India nuclear \nagreement, we are making clear that continued cooperation under this \nnuclear agreement and nuclear exports to India will cease if India, \none, tests a nuclear device, terminates or materially violates its IAEA \nsafeguards, materially violates its agreement with the United States, \nor engages in nuclear proliferation.\n  Further, the bill requires that India sign a safeguards agreement \nwith the IAEA and negotiate an additional protocol. It also requires \nthe President to certify that the safeguards agreement is in accordance \nwith the IAEA standards, principles, and practices.\n  In sum, that is U.S. policy toward India and its nuclear program, and \nI do not see the purpose of revisiting the old history of 1998. We need \nto look forward, and that is what we are doing in this legislation. We \nare using this legislation and the agreement to build a new \nrelationship with India on this issue, and also using it as a means to \nstrengthen the bilateral relationship across the board. And in doing \nso, we have enshrined important nonproliferation principles into this \nlegislation because we cannot turn back the history of 1998.\n  So at the appropriate time--and I think we are working now on a \nconsent agreement--I would urge the defeat of the Dorgan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, just a couple of----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield just for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, how long do you think \nit will take for you to discuss and dispose of your amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my intention to respond briefly to a \ncouple of comments that have been made in objection to my amendment, \nand then to offer my second amendment, per agreement with the chairman. \nThat would probably take me about 10 minutes, and to speak in support \nof my second amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened intently to my two colleagues\n\n[[Page S11004]]\n\nwho apparently cannot find the ability to support this amendment. I do \nwant to make a couple of observations. One of my colleagues said that \nIndia is in full compliance with its commitments. Well, yes, that is \ntrue. And the reason they are in full compliance with their commitments \nis they do not have the commitments we have. They have not signed the \nnonproliferation treaty. They do not have the commitments that we would \nexpect of them. So are they in full compliance with the commitments \nthat do not exist? I do not know. I mean, I guess. It is not much of an \nexcuse for India, in my judgment. I don't understand that objection.\n  The discussion of ``this agreement would cease if the following'' \nomitted one key issue: ``This agreement will cease if India continues \nto produce additional nuclear weapons.'' No, that was not included in \nthis bill. Why? Because this agreement allows India to continue to \nproduce additional nuclear weapons. That is at the root of this \nagreement; otherwise why would you have nuclear facilities put off \nlimits behind a curtain, behind which India can produce additional \nnuclear bombs?\n  So this issue of that we have safeguards, and this agreement will \ncease if the following exists, does not include that this agreement \nwill cease if India continues to produce additional nuclear weapons. \nWhy doesn't it include that provision? Because all of us here know what \nis going to happen. What is going to happen is this agreement is going \nto pass, and our ally, a wonderful country, India, is going to be told \nby this country: It is all right if behind a curtain uninspected \nfacilities continue to produce additional nuclear bombs. That is all \nright with us. It works fine with us. It is not all right with me. It \ndoes not work fine with me.\n  The past versus the future? I am glad we are not debating the \nConstitution. That is the past. Man, that is a couple hundred years \npast. What are the virtues of the Constitution? How about the virtues \nof the past, the efforts in the past at nonproliferation, the efforts \nin the past when we were serious about these issues? Really serious. \nAnd this country took it upon themselves to say: We are going to lead \nthe way. We, by God, are going to lead the way because it is our \nburden. It is our responsibility.\n  We inherit that requirement. Yes, that is the past, and I am proud of \nthat past. In fact, this morning I described part of that past, \ncredited, I might say, to my colleague from Indiana and my former \ncolleague from Georgia, and my colleague from Delaware. I hold in my \nhand a wing strut from a Soviet bomber that likely carried a nuclear \nweapon, which could have been dropped on an American city.\n  That wing strut came from an airplane that was not shot down. That \nairplane was sawed up by an agreement. That sawing of that Backfire \nbomber, whose wing strut I now hold, was paid for by American \ntaxpayers. We destroyed nuclear weapons, no, not by battle, not through \nfiring our nuclear weapons. We destroyed them by saws and other methods \nof destruction, paid for by the American taxpayer.\n  We destroyed nuclear weapons. Four countries that possessed them are \nnow free of nuclear weapons. We destroyed delivery systems, Backfire \nbombers, missiles. Yes, that is the past, a past I am enormously proud \nof, a past we need more of, a past we need to learn from.\n  The future? The future is a process here by which we say: Do you know \nwhat. India, you are a good country--and let me join in that \ndescription of the county of India. But we also say: We don't care so \nmuch anymore you didn't sign the nonproliferation treaty. We don't care \nthat you violated Resolution 1172 of the United Nations. That is all \nOK. And, in fact, we are going to tell the suppliers of the world that \ncan supply you with things you need to produce nuclear power go ahead \nand do that. The sanctions are off. We have decided that our position \nhas changed. It used to be that we and the rest of the world would not \nallow you to purchase that because you would not sign the \nnonproliferation treaty. We have changed our minds. In fact, we are \ngoing to tell the suppliers to furnish that to you, and you can use it \nbehind the curtain with some of your facilities to produce additional \nnuclear weapons. You can do it because there will be no inspections.\n  That, frankly, is the circumstance of this legislation. So we have \ndisagreement. I regret that. But I feel very strongly. I know my \ncolleagues feel strongly about their position on this issue. I would \njust say, I hope we will not decide today as a Senate to say that \nSecurity Council Resolution 1172 does not matter because it is old. It \nis timeless. It is not old. It is timeless in its position of what we \nshould stand for as a country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  As I said, I really admire, respect, and observe the passion of my \nfriend from North Dakota on this issue. But I think the comparisons are \nnot particularly apt. The wing strut the Senator has was able to be \nheld in his hand because two countries--the United States and the \nSoviet Union--concluded that it was in their mutual interest to cease \nand desist and/or significantly reduce the threat each posed to the \nother. And they were the only threats that existed. The only threat to \nthe United States from a nuclear capability of an ICBM or a Backfire \nbomber resided in the Soviet Union.\n  Now, we tried. I was the author of--and, as a matter of fact, there \nwas a South Dakota Senator named Pressler, along with John Glenn, who \nearly on put in legislation relating to sanctions for India.\n  India obviously violated those sanctions and did not comply with the \nU.N. resolution. But there is a reason for that--not a justification, a \nreason. They looked across their borders north and west and saw two \nnuclear powers--one emerging nuclear power, one existing nuclear \npower--and they concluded, rightly or wrongly, from their perspective \nthat they had to be a nuclear power.\n  It is clear nonproliferation does not work in a vacuum. \nNonproliferation entreatments, requests, proddings to a nation that \nfinds itself in a situation where it believes it is threatened by a \nnuclear neighbor have not worked particularly well, offering those two \nexamples, for example.\n  It seems to me what we are attempting to do is the only route to get \nto the point where both India and Pakistan are part of a \nnonproliferation treaty; that is, we are trying to change the regional \nsituation on the ground. It is not going to happen through a \nnonproliferation treaty. It is going to happen through a rapprochement \nbetween India and Pakistan. The idea that we would be able to, through \nany legislation, prevent India from moving forward to add additional \nnuclear weapons, if they so choose to do that--there is no legislation \nwe can pass to do that.\n  What this legislation does is recognize the reality of the \ngeopolitical situation in the region, set up safeguards to deal with \nthe ability for India to use anything we are doing with them to be able \nto further advance their nuclear capability, give them a new buy-in to \nan international regime that will have the effect of putting pressure \non them to move in the direction we and the Soviets moved on back when \nthat Backfire bomber strut was sawed off a wing, and that is the route \nwe choose. It is not pretty. It is not clear. It is no guarantee. It is \nnot certain to succeed. But I do know one thing: Absent this agreement, \nthere is a likelihood things get worse instead of better, beyond what \nmay already occur.\n  I appreciate the Senator's comparisons, but I think they are not as \napt as they might appear to be because, again, India's motivation, in \nterms of its viewing its need for a nuclear arsenal, is not unlike the \nmotivation that existed with regard to the United States and the Soviet \nUnion. It is going to take a geopolitical settlement of that, not a \nnuclear arms control agreement imposing a settlement on India and \nPakistan at this moment, now that the genie is out of the bottle.\n  I appreciate my friend's point and respect his point of view, but I \ndisagree that it is the best way to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me respond briefly. There is a very big difference \nbetween this and the agreement we had with the Soviet Union. In the \nSoviet Union agreement, both sides, the United States and the Soviet \nUnion,\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\ndecided they wished to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and the \ndelivery systems of those weapons. As a result of that decision, both \nsides wishing to reduce both weapons and delivery systems, we embarked \non a process that was very helpful to both countries and to the world \nand to world peace. This is very different. This is mutual interest.\n  But now, we are told it is in our mutual interest, us and India, to \nhave India be allowed to produce additional nuclear weapons, not reduce \nnuclear weapons. Under this agreement, everyone will agree, India will \nbe allowed to increase nuclear weapons. If India is allowed to increase \nnuclear weapons under this agreement, that is very different from the \nagreement we had with the Soviets by which we decided to reduce.\n  The point is, this agreement says it is in our mutual interest to \nallow India to increase its production of nuclear weapons. That is \nclearly not in our mutual interest, but that is what the resolution \nsays.\n  Second, my colleague is right, none of this operates in a vacuum. \nThis will not be in a vacuum, either. Pakistan will insist on producing \nmore nuclear weapons. So will China. Pakistan has already told our \ncountry: If you are going to do this with India, we want you to do it \nwith us. So this decision will not be made in a vacuum vis-a-vis India; \nthis decision will have an impact regionally and around the world.\n  My colleague is very skillful in presenting his position. I admire \nboth of my colleagues and their skill and determination as well. We \njust have a difference of opinion. I think this is a very significant \nmistake.\n  I have a second amendment which I will send to the desk and offer for \nits consideration and try to truncate the description of that very \nbriefly, if that is appropriate to the chairman.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, may I respond briefly to my colleague?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. It would be my hope--and let me discuss this quickly--that \nthe debate on the first amendment of Senator Dorgan is completed. \nSecondly, I want a short time for Senator Domenici of New Mexico to \nmake a statement. And then thirdly, we will proceed to the introduction \nof Senator Dorgan's second amendment. My hope would be that a unanimous \nconsent will be formulated--I know staff from both sides are working on \nthat--that will provide for rollcall votes on both Dorgan amendments \nand then, at the conclusion of the debate of the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico, on the Bingaman amendment, perhaps a stack of three \nvotes for the convenience of Senators. I am broaching that, not asking \nfor everybody to agree, but I am hopeful that would be a general \nagreement of those who are around at this point.\n  It is my hope that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico might be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, \nSenator Lugar, for arranging for my few remarks before he proceeds.\n  After committing to a framework 16 months ago, President Bush and \nIndia's Prime Minister announced an agreement earlier this year on \ncivil nuclear cooperation between our two countries. I believe they \nrecognize this historic moment in our history, one that requires vision \nand foresight to anticipate the world as it will be rather than stuck \nin the past wishing things somehow would be different. Some will argue \nthat we must pursue a better deal approaching perfection, but the deal \nthat has been negotiated is a good one that we must pursue now and \nbegin taking steps to strengthen the nonproliferation regime with India \nby our side.\n  Senators Lugar and Biden and the Foreign Relations Committee have \ndone an admirable job of striking a balance that anticipates this \nfuture. This strong, bipartisan bill represents a critical step toward \nstrengthening an eroding nonproliferation framework. We only need look \nat North Korea and Iran for evidence that this erosion is taking place \nand as a wake-up call that fundamental change is needed. The global \ncommunity must work together to assure the peaceful pursuit of civilian \nnuclear waste.\n  This historic agreement is a critical step that moves the United \nStates and India toward a strategic relationship between our great \ndemocracies. Through this relationship, built on strength, we can \njointly work toward a vision of a proliferation-free world. I \nunderstand that is a vision. It is not real even now. And while things \nmight even look a little worse, the truth is, the relationship we are \nbuilding with what we are agreeing to here on the floor, when that \ncompletes its course and becomes a reality, then that means we are \nbuilding toward a proliferation-free world.\n  India is a worthy partner. That was one of the basic questions: \nShould you enter into this agreement with a partner that has not been \npart of the ordinary, agreed-upon, acceptable accords and agreements \nbetween countries heretofore? I would remind everyone that India is the \nlargest democracy--a population currently over 1 billion and expected \nto surpass China in the next 50 years. It has a rapidly expanding \neconomy with a growth rate of over 7 percent a year in 2005, a rapidly \nexpanding economy that is the envy of almost all countries that have \nfree and open democracies. This agreement with India brings global \ntransparency to India's entire civilian nuclear program. We forget that \nIndia's civilian and military program still remains closed to global \nscrutiny. Under this agreement, the entire civilian program, 65 percent \nof all nuclear activity and eventually 90 percent of all nuclear \nactivity, will open to monitoring by the IAEA. Obviously, we ought to \nstart, if that is where we are going to end up, because that is as good \nas we are going to do. And certainly we ought to be grateful that \nthrough the leadership of the President and now the leadership of the \nCongress, we can get there.\n  The people are similar to the American people. They desire a better \nlife for themselves and their children. Rapid economic growth that has \nled to improving their standard of living is projected to result in a \ndoubling of the energy needs of their country in the next 25 years. \nIndia must make choices today that drive their energy mix in the \nfuture.\n  Like many countries, they have chosen nuclear power to improve their \nenergy security while reducing reliance on imports. India currently has \nnine reactors under construction and plans to grow the nuclear share to \n25 percent by 2050. That is 100 times the 2002 capacity. Cooperation \nwith India will lead to significant opportunities for U.S. industry to \nhelp assure India's energy mix, including nuclear power, is clean, \ndiversified, and proliferation-resistant.\n  I strongly support an evolving strategic U.S. relationship with India \nthat this agreement promotes. We ought to be proud of it and move with \ndispatch. It is the world's largest democracy and a worthy partner that \nwe can work with in our pursuit of global security. I have worked with \nSenator Lugar in the past on nonproliferation measures that required \nvision and foresight. With India also, we must look to our future. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill and urge dispatch in \nconsideration of the balance of the subject matter.\n\n  I thank Senator Lugar for obtaining time for me on the floor, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici, for his very strong statement, and I simply want \nto mention again how much I appreciate working with him over the years. \nThe Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation was extremely important throughout \na good part of the last decade, and on the nonproliferation efforts he \nhas been a champion in the Senate. We appreciate his contribution to \nthis debate today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Senator Lugar.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota. We indicated that he would continue by offering his \nsecond amendment, and I would advise him to do so, if he is prepared.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5182\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 5182 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11006]]\n\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5182.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 5182\n\n(Purpose: To require as a precondition to United States-India peaceful \n atomic energy cooperation a determination by the President that India \nhas committed to certain basic provisions consistent with United States \n nonproliferation goals and the obligations and political commitments \n  undertaken by State Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty)\n\n       On page 8, beginning on line 8, strike ``Group; and'' and \n     all that follows through ``the Nuclear'' on line 9 and insert \n     the following:\n\n     Group;\n       (8) India has committed to--\n       (A) the development of a credible separation plan between \n     civilian and military facilities by ensuring all reactors \n     that supply electricity to the civilian sector are declared \n     and are subject to permanent IAEA standards and practices;\n       (B) a binding obligation to the same extent as nuclear-\n     weapon State Parties under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty--\n       (i) not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear \n     weapons or nuclear explosive devices or control over such \n     devices directly or indirectly; and\n       (ii) not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce any \n     non-nuclear-weapon State Party to manufacture or otherwise \n     acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or \n     acquire control over such weapons or explosive devices; and\n       (C) consistent with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--\n       (i) pursuing negotiations in good faith on effective \n     measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an \n     early date and to nuclear disarmament, including ending \n     fissile material production for nuclear weapons;\n       (ii) joining a legally-binding nuclear test moratorium;\n       (iii) verifiably reducing its nuclear weapons stockpile; \n     and\n       (iv) eventually eliminating all nuclear weapons; and\n       (9) the Nuclear\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5178, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to offer a \nmodification to the first amendment I offered today. The amendment had \ntwo line numbers in it that were made to the original copy of the \nlegislation. That legislation was subsequently changed. So let me ask \nunanimous consent that on the initial amendment I offered today, on \nline 1, the reference to line 15 be struck, and it is line 8; on line \n2, the reference to line 15 be struck, and it is line 9.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5178), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, beginning on line 8, strike ``Treaty; and'' and \n     all that follows through ``that exports'' on line 9 and \n     insert the following:\n\n     Treaty;\n       (9) to continue to support implementation of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1172 (1998); and\n       (10) that exports\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the second amendment I have sent to the \ndesk says that before this United States-India agreement can go into \neffect, the President must submit to the Congress a written \ndetermination that India has committed to certain basic provisions \nconsistent with U.S. nonproliferation goals and with the NPT, the \nnonproliferation treaty. It requires the President to determine that \nIndia has committed to, for example, putting all of its reactors that \nsupply electricity to the civilian sector under the IAEA inspection \nregime. This would close a loophole that exists in the proposed \nagreement, and that loophole allows India to keep electricity-producing \nreactors out of the IAEA inspection regime. Eight of them will be out \nof the regime, and those eight are going to be behind a curtain, unable \nto be inspected, and able to produce the materials to produce \nadditional nuclear weapons. Fourteen of the existing and planned \nnuclear reactors would be inspected, and eight of them would not.\n  If those other eight reactors produce civilian electricity, my \namendment would require that India allow inspection of them.\n  The bill as now written would allow India to produce energy with \nnuclear reactors that are closed to IAEA safeguards. My amendment says \nthat is a loophole which should not be allowed. If India can keep \nenergy-producing reactors outside of these safeguards, why shouldn't \nother countries be allowed to do so? How will our country say to \nothers: Well, we have special deals. We have loopholes here for one, \nbut we are not consistent. There is no consistency with respect to our \nposition on these issues.\n  The amendment also requires India to undertake a binding obligation \nnot to assist, encourage, or induce nonnuclear weapons states to \nmanufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons. That is what our \ncountry has obligated itself to do under the nonproliferation treaty. \nIt is what other nuclear weapons states have done as well, including \nRussia, China, Britain, and France. They have all agreed to and signed \nthe nonproliferation treaty and agreed to that basic provision, a \nbinding obligation not to assist, encourage, or induce nonnuclear \nweapons states to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons.\n  Lastly, my amendment requires the President to determine that India \nhas committed itself to pursuing negotiations on measures directed at \nreducing nuclear stockpiles and eventually eliminating nuclear weapons. \nThese are the same commitments, the very same commitments our country \nhas made, the same commitments other nation states which have signed \nthe nonproliferation treaty have made. So I believe it is appropriate \nthat if we have this agreement with India dealing with the issue of \nnuclear weapons, they should be under the same obligations we are \nunder. Even though they have not signed the nonproliferation treaty, we \nhave. We have obligations under that treaty. They should accept the \nobligations under that treaty, in my judgment, even though they have \nnot yet signed it.\n  This debate today has been interesting and, in many ways, very \nfrustrating as well. I intend to support very aggressively the \namendment offered by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. I \nbelieve that amendment is very important and at the root of much of \nwhat I have talked about today as well.\n  It seems to me this is a case for our children and our grandchildren \nabout what kind of a world they are going to live in. It is \ninteresting. If you just fast forward from 1960 to 1980 to 2000 and \nfast forward from 2001 to today, we went through a Cold War with the \nSoviet Union where we had heavy nuclear weapons, huge nuclear weapons \nwith big bombers and powerful missiles aimed at each other, so we had a \nCold War. Massive numbers of nuclear weapons were built. We had a \nstandoff between our country and the Soviet Union. There was great \nconcern and worry that somehow, something would happen in which someone \nwould launch a missile or a submarine or an airplane would launch a \nmissile with a nuclear weapon and we would start a nuclear war and our \ntwo countries would be obliterated. It didn't happen. Instead, we chose \na much more constructive direction.\n  We and the Soviet Union began what is called arms control talks, and \nwe reached arms control agreements. Those agreements began the \ndestruction of weapons systems, delivery systems, nuclear weapons. I \nadmit that a very small amount of those delivery systems and nuclear \nweapons were actually destroyed, but some of them were. It was actually \nmoving in the right direction rather than the wrong direction. We \ndeveloped a test ban treaty. We led the way. We said: We are going to \nno longer test nuclear weapons. We said that to the world. A \nnonproliferation treaty. We said this is important to do, and we were \nthe leaders in saying this is the right course for the world. Now we \nare told: You know what, that is old-fashioned; that is the past; this \nis the future. I say that what we did then is timeless. These values \ndon't change, the value of deciding that our future ought to be a \nfuture with fewer nuclear weapons rather than more nuclear weapons.\n  If anyone has listened closely, they will know there has been no \nrefutation of the assertion that some of my colleagues and I have made \nthat this agreement will mean we have more nuclear weapons produced. No \none has disputed that. This agreement means we are signing up to have \nmore nuclear weapons produced on this Earth. One--just one--nuclear \nweapon in the hands of a terrorist group pulling up to a dock in a \nmajor American city on a container ship at 2\\1/2\\ or 3 miles an hour\n\n[[Page S11007]]\n\ncan potentially kill hundreds of thousands of American citizens--just \none--and there are 30,000 out there. Can anyone here tell me that every \none of those 30,000 is safeguarded and that no terrorist organization \nwill acquire one? Can anybody tell me that is going to be the case?\n  I started this morning talking about a CIA agent called Dragon Fire \nwho reported 1 month after 9/11 that a Russian 10-kiloton nuclear \nweapon had been stolen by a terrorist group and taken into New York \nCity and was about to be detonated. That episode has been written about \nin a book. Most of us have heard of it. It was a time when for a month \nwe didn't know if it was true or not. It wasn't disclosed publicly \nbecause there would have been mass hysteria if it was thought that a \n10-kiloton nuclear weapon had been stolen from Russia and was now in \nNew York City about to be detonated. It eventually was discovered that \nhad not happened. But when they did the postmortem on that situation, \nit was understood that it was clearly possible. Russia had those \nweapons. They were not safeguarded well. They are not, and they were \nnot. They could have been stolen. It could have been smuggled into a \nmajor American city by a terrorist group and it could have been \ndetonated, killing hundreds of thousands of people. That is the \nconsequence of one nuclear weapon. Just one. We have 30,000 or so on \nthis Earth. What are we doing today? We are saying it is all right if \nthey build more--in this case, India. It is OK if they build more.\n  This is not going to be done in a vacuum. What we do here today will \nhave consequences for Pakistan, it will have consequences for China. \nYou think they won't decide if India is going to be allowed to build \nmore nuclear weapons that they won't build more nuclear weapons? Of \ncourse they will. That is what this is about.\n  I understand it is argued that this is geopolitics; you don't \nunderstand it; you can't see over the horizon. Maybe not. What I do \nunderstand is that this world will be a safer place with fewer nuclear \nweapons, this world will be a safer place if we care about \nnonproliferation, if we reduce the number of nuclear weapons, and this \nworld will not be safer if at the end of today we have decided that we \nhave given a green light to a world with more nuclear weapons.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree with me and support my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I intend to offer a short statement \nopposing the amendment. I would ask Members to be alert to the \npossibility that following my statement, Senator Biden has indicated he \nwould put his statement in the Record if this plan can then be \naccepted, and we would then proceed to three rollcall votes: an \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, and two amendments offered by the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Dorgan. For the convenience of our colleagues, those \nthree votes would come without pause, thus minimizing the dislocation \nof Members' schedules and accelerating our consideration of this \ndebate.\n  I am certain the Chair has heard that Senator Biden and I, for many \nof our colleagues who were hopeful that we could proceed in a \nresponsible way but conclude the debate today, on Thursday, are \nattempting to do that, and we appreciate the cooperation of our \ncolleagues.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, let me state my opposition to the \nsecond amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota. His amendment would, in fact, undo the entire effort we have \nachieved with India over the past year. Not only would he revise \nIndia's civilian military separation plan with his amendment, but he \nwould require India to assume the obligations of a nuclear weapons \nstate under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT. This is, in \neffect, a perfect killer amendment. It should be strongly opposed by \nevery Member of this body who supports an improved relationship with \nIndia.\n  The Senator's amendment adds two new determination requirements to \nour bill: first, that India's separation plan result in a situation \nwherein all reactors that supply civilian power are declared to the \nIAEA and under safeguards; and second, that India assume certain NPT \nobligations. This is unnecessary and would do us great harm. It adds a \nnew element in the separation plan that the President did not negotiate \nand would undo the deal we have reached.\n  India's separation plan is credible and sound, according to criteria \ndeveloped by the administration in its negotiations with India. As \nSecretary Rice stated last April:\n\n       For the plan to be transparent, it had to be articulated \n     publicly.\n\n  It has been.\n\n       For it to be credible and defensible from a \n     nonproliferation standpoint, it had to capture more than just \n     a token number of Indian nuclear facilities--\n\n  Which it did----\n\n       by encompassing nearly two-thirds of India's current and \n     planned thermal power reactors, as well as all future civil, \n     thermal, and breeder reactors. Importantly, for the \n     safeguards to be meaningful, India had to commit to apply \n     IAEA safeguards in perpetuity.\n\n  It did so.\n       Once a reactor is under IAEA safeguards, those safeguards \n     will remain there permanently and on an unconditional basis. \n     Further, in our view, the plan also needed to include \n     upstream and downstream facilities associated with the \n     safeguarded reactors to provide a true separation of civil \n     and military programs. India committed to these steps, and we \n     have concluded that its separation plan meets the criteria \n     established: it is credible, transparent, and defensible from \n     a nonproliferation standpoint.\n\n  The amendment changes the metrics for a credible and defensible \nseparation plan by including that such a plan must mean that any \nreactor supplying power must be declared. As Secretary Rice stated \nbefore the committee:\n\n       Regardless of whether they might be used to generate \n     electric power or not, reactors that are not declared civil, \n     and thus are not under IAEA safeguards, cannot legitimately \n     receive nuclear fuel or other nuclear cooperation from any \n     State party to the NPT.\n\n  The second element in the Senator's amendment would require India to \nassume the obligations of a nuclear weapon state party to the NPT.\n  The administration was careful not to term India a ``nuclear weapon \nstate'' with similar rights and obligations as those five nations in \nthe NPT with status as lawful weapon states--France, Russia, China, the \nU.K., and the U.S.--and instead termed India in the July 2005 joint \nstatement a ``responsible state with advanced nuclear technology.'' \nThis was necessary to do no harm to U.S. and other weapons states' \nstatus under the treaty.\n  The Senator's amendment would create obligations similar to those of \nweapon states for India through creating a determination requirement \nthat the President must make wherein India has assumed the obligations \nof a nuclear weapon state under the NPT. I would argue that this is not \nnecessary, since it could well provoke India to walk away from the \nobligations they would assume under our 123 Agreement with them and \nleave the restraint we might get through that deal on their weapons \nprogram on the negotiating table.\n  India has stated they have no intention to sign or become a party to \nthe NPT, as a weapon state or otherwise. India's July 2005 joint \nstatement commitments are significant, but they do not include NPT \nmembership.\n  I urge defeat of the amendment; it is a killer.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks \nmade by the Senator from Indiana.\n  The amendment requires India to declare as civil reactors all \nreactors that supply electricity to the civil sector.\n  There is no way that India will accept this.\n  I might wish they would, but they will not.\n  That's because for decades, they have built reactors that can be \neither civil or military.\n  So India has reserved as military enough reactors to produce more \nplutonium for nuclear weapons--in case they decide they need to do \nthat.\n  But India will also use those reactors for electric power.\n  If this amendment is enacted, India will have to choose to either \nmake all its power reactors civil, and build new ones to produce \nplutonium; or waste the electric power capability of its current \nmilitary reactors.\n  India will not do that.\n  So this is a killer amendment.\n  It's also a killer amendment because it requires India to commit to\n\n[[Page S11008]]\n\nverifiably reduce its nuclear weapons stockpile.\n  I wish India would do that--but it will not.\n  India fears both Pakistan and China, which also have nuclear weapons.\n  The Dorgan amendment does not require Pakistan and China to reduce \ntheir stockpiles, only India.\n  This is a non-starter for India.\n  Finally, the amendment requires India to commit to ``joining a \nlegally-binding, nuclear test moratorium.'' I wish India would do that. \nI hope the administration will push for that.\n  But for now, there is only one ``legally-binding, nuclear test \nmoratorium.'' It is called the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty.\n  And I do not think this administration will press India to join that \ntreaty.\n  So, I sympathize with all of the concerns raised by this amendment. \nBut I know that it would kill the nuclear deal.\n  That is the bottom line: if we support the deal, we have to reject \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a series of stacked votes in relation to the following \namendments: the Bingaman amendment No. 5174, the Dorgan amendment No. \n5178, as modified and the Dorgan amendment No. 5182; further, that \nthere be no second degrees in order to any of the amendments prior to \nthe votes, that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided before the \nsecond and third votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think \nthere is a need for a mild correction.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my second \namendment be considered, notwithstanding the Harkin amendment that was \npreviously offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the primary request?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I ask the floor manager? I would \nprefer if we had 2 minutes equally divided prior to the first vote as \nwell since there has been some time since we debated it. I want the \nchance to explain it for 1 minute before we have a vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I amend the request to include 2 minutes of \ndebate on the Bingaman amendment No. 5174 prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest, as amended?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask the chairman. I wish to respond \nfor 2 minutes to the comments which the chairman just made in \nopposition to my amendment prior to proceeding to the vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I have no objection to that. I amend the request to \ninclude 2 minutes of debate by Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection, as amended? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5182\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will try not to take the 2 minutes, but \nit is important to point out the chairman, in responding--and I suspect \nthe ranking member in his response--is saying this is a killer \namendment. It is not offered as a killer amendment, but it is the case \nthat my amendment would impose upon India exactly the same burdens that \nexist upon our country. My colleague, the chairman, said the President \n``did not negotiate''--he started the sentence. That is what brings me \nto the floor--that the President ``did not negotiate.'' What he did not \nnegotiate was a requirement and a burden on India which clearly is a \nnuclear weapons state. He did not negotiate a requirement and a burden \non them that we ourselves assume under the nonproliferation treaty. My \namendment would simply provide that requirement and that burden to the \ncountry of India.\n  I come from a town of 300 people. I have to relearn always the \nlessons of the Senate--and not just the Senate but the way the \nGovernment works. In my hometown you always call things just the way \nthey are. You saw it, you spoke it, and described it. In this body, \nhowever, now we know that India has a nuclear weapon--has many of them. \nWe know they have detonated them, and we know they are a nuclear \nweapons state. So we have decided as a country officially to describe \nIndia as a responsible state with nuclear technology as opposed to a \nnuclear weapons state. I don't know; maybe it works here. It doesn't \nwork in my hometown. We have to call things as we see them.\n  We have responsibilities--all of us do. Our responsibility is, I \nthink, toward nonproliferation, to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, \nto reduce the number of nuclear weapons. I regret that the underlying \npiece of legislation is going to result in more nuclear weapons being \nbuilt.\n  The second amendment I have offered is an amendment that simply says \nlet us impose on those with whom we negotiate the same burdens we \ninherit ourselves. In fact, the United States negotiated with India in \nthe way that exempts them from those burdens. I think that is \nfundamentally wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided on the \nBingaman amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5174\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will briefly describe the Bingaman \namendment. It is an amendment that puts into effect the recommendations \nSenator Nunn made in his op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal in May \nof this year. It says that as to nuclear equipment and technology, \nbefore we can export or reexport to India nuclear equipment or \ntechnology, the President must first determine that both India and the \nUnited States are taking specific steps to conclude a fissile material \ncutoff treaty.\n  Second, the amendment says that before any nuclear materials fuel can \nbe exported to India, the President must determine that India has \nstopped producing fissile materials for weapons.\n  This is a reasonable amendment. This does not kill the deal, as I \nwould see it. This is something which India has stated a willingness to \ngenerally abide by. I think this is the least we can insist upon. I \nhope very much my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will oppose this amendment as it goes \nsignificantly beyond the commitments India made in the joint statement. \nIndia will regard this particular requirement that India stop producing \nfissile materials for weapons as moving the goalposts and an \nunacceptable renegotiation of the deal--a bad-faith effort on our part.\n  India maintains that they cannot agree to a unilateral cap at this \ntime. We should not hold up the significant nonproliferation gains \nafforded by the initiative in order to seek a fissile material cap that \nIndia indicates it cannot agree to absent a similar commitment by \nPakistan and China. Pakistan continues to produce fissile material for \nweapons-related purposes and China has not committed to a moratorium on \nsuch production. Unfortunately, in my judgment, this is truly a killer \namendment. I strongly encourage that amendment be defeated.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the next two \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the next amendment?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, my impression was that the call was for the \nvote and then a 2-minute debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is correct.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Bingaman amendment.

Mr. President, my amendment, in light of the underlying \nbill brought to the floor of the Senate, would express that we would \ncontinue to support the implementation of the United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 1172.\n  The reason that is important is it had been the policy of this \ncountry to not only author but to support that resolution after India \nand Pakistan exploded their nuclear weapons.\n  It calls on them to immediately stop their nuclear weapons \ndevelopment programs, refrain from weaponization or deployment of \nnuclear weapons, cease the development of ballistic missiles, and so \non.\n  That has been a very important tenet of this country in supporting \nthat United Nations Resolution 1172.

The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that Members oppose the Dorgan \namendment on the basis that the resolution he talks about is an \nimportant one, but it talks about a time in which our relationship with \nIndia was very different. It talks about the past. We have been very \nfortunate in this country to move into a better relationship with \nIndia, to a point where we are now going to be in India. The IAEA is \ngoing to be in India. We are going to be able to observe a bulk of the \nnuclear reactors and programs there and to work with India in peaceful \ndevelopment.\n  There was a time when we did not have that relationship. By ``we,'' I \nmean the United States and the international community. The situation \nin India is constructive. This is a time to celebrate and to move on \nthat momentum.\n  I ask that the Dorgan amendment be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.

In other words, I would suggest that we should impose the same \nburdens on India as we have on ourselves. There is great reluctance to \ndo that by this Chamber, but that was my amendment. I must say there is \nvery little education in a third vote if I believe it weakens our \nefforts in nonproliferation nuclear weapons.

Mr. President, the relationship between the United \nStates and India is very important. As we look ahead to the coming \ndecades, it is clear that United States-India relations will be \nintegral to establishing a secure, sustainable, and prosperous \ninternational system--not only in the Asian region but around the world \nas India increasingly grows into its role as a global power.\n  And, of course, India, in many ways, is a natural ally of the United \nStates. We share a great deal in common as ethnically diverse, \nreligiously tolerant democratic societies. Our peoples are innovative, \ndriven, and eager to participate in the global economy. We both face \nthe threat of terrorism. India occupies an important position in an \nimportant part of the world, and by itself represents over l7 percent \nof the world's total population. We absolutely should be working to \nstrengthen our relationship with this important partner, and seeking \nways to deepen our strategic ties.\n  While I want to strengthen the relationship between the United States \nand India, this bill would do more than simply bring our two nations \ncloser together. It would pave the way for civilian nuclear cooperation \nbetween the United States and India for the first time since India \nexploded a nuclear device in the 1970s. If this bill is passed, it will \ndramatically shift 30 years of nonproliferation policy. Specifically, \nthis bill would have serious consequences for the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, the international nonproliferation regime, and \nU.S. national security. Such a fundamental change in policy should not \nbe undertaken lightly, which is why it is crucial that this body fully \ndiscuss and understand the implications of this bill.\n  In my work on the Foreign Relations Committee, I have had a chance to \nstudy this issue and this legislation closely. I have talked to a \nnumber of people, on all sides of this issue: senior officials from the \nadministration, business groups, nonproliferation and arms control \nexperts, Indian officials, and concerned citizens in my home State of \nWisconsin. The committee held a number of hearings to examine the \nissue, and the panelists we heard from represented a wide range of \nopinions on the prospect of nuclear cooperation with India. And after \nall of this careful consideration, I have to report that I am left with \nsome deep concerns regarding what this legislation means for United \nStates national security.\n  The primary consideration for us in the U.S. Senate as we debate this \nbill should be this: will this legislation make the citizens of the \nUnited States more secure or less? As we consider this fundamental \nshift in the international nonproliferation regime, we must make sure \nthat we have adequate protections in place to guard against the further \nspread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology.\n  The threat of nuclear weapons to the United States and the spread of \nnuclear weapons and nuclear material are among the gravest dangers that \nour country faces. It is crucial to our national security that the \nnuclear non-proliferation framework remains strong. I want to make sure \nthat the United States, as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, is working to strengthen the international treaties and regimes \nthat have been designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. A \nworld with more nuclear weapons is, simply put, a more dangerous world.\n  So that is why I am offering an amendment to this bill that spells \nout in greater detail that nuclear cooperation between the United \nStates and India will be only civilian in nature, and that none of the \nassistance the United States provides will be used for strengthening or \nfurther developing India's nuclear weapons arsenal. This is completely \nin line with President Bush's and Secretary Rice's statements about the \ndeal, and is something the United States is already committed to under \narticle I of the NPT. My amendment simply makes it a binding \nrequirement: Before the nuclear cooperation agreement can go into \neffect, the President of the United States must certify that the scope \nand content of the agreement does nothing to contribute directly or \nindirectly to the development of India's nuclear weapons arsenal. This \namendment will strengthen this bill. It will enhance transparency. And \nit will send a clear message to the world that the United States will, \nin fact, abide by its commitments and is working within the letter and \nspirit of the agreements and treaties to which it is party.\n  Allow me to quote from article I of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, because I think it will help to set forth the obligations of \nthe agreement the United States is a party to. Article I states that:\n\n       Each nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes \n     not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons \n     or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such \n     weapons or explosive devices directly, or indirectly; and not \n     in any way to assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear \n     weapon State to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear \n     weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or control over \n     such weapons or explosive devices.\n\n  Let me repeat that second clause, because it is what my amendment \nintends to address: ``not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce \nany non-nuclear weapon State to manufacture or otherwise acquire \nnuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or control over \nsuch weapons or explosive devices.''\n  India is considered to be a nonnuclear weapon state for the purposes \nof the NPT, and we are therefore prohibited from assisting their \nnuclear weapons program. My amendment will require the President to \nmake determinations to ensure that we are in line with that treaty \nobligation. First, the President would have to certify to Congress that \nthe scope and content of the nuclear cooperation agreement that he \nnegotiates will not contribute to India's nuclear weapons program--\nspecifically that it does not: Allow for the use of U.S.-origin \nequipment, technology, or material in an unsafeguarded Indian nuclear \nfacility; or allow for the replication and subsequent use of U.S.-\norigin technology for any activity related to nuclear explosive \ndevices.\n  Second, the President would have to certify that he had received \nsufficient assurances from the Government of India that nuclear fuel \nprovided by the United States will not facilitate the increased \nproduction by India of fissile material for weapons use.\n  Both India and the United States should feel comfortable with this \namendment; it only requires that the United States certify that this \ndeal is in line with our current commitments. It will go a long way to \nenhance transparency and reassure all sides that this civil nuclear \ncooperation agreement does not have any military aspects.\n  This is particularly important now, as we face nuclear crises in \nNorth Korea and Iran. While we are pressuring those countries to submit \nto international inspections and abide by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty,\n\n[[Page S11012]]\n\nit is crucial that we not simultaneously be seen to undermine the NPT's \nfoundations by our actions. My amendment sends a clear message that the \nUnited States stands by the spirit and the letter of the NPT. Rejecting \nmy amendment would send a dangerous signal to Iran, North Korea and \nother states that we are not taking seriously our international \ncommitments, and that the NPT is no longer relevant.\n\n  As you can see, my amendment is quite detailed in spelling out \nexactly how assistance to India's weapons program is defined, and what \nactivities should be prohibited under the terms of the agreement. The \nsecond determination, which relates to the provision of nuclear fuel by \nthe United States, is particularly important, because it gets to the \nheart of concerns about a possible buildup of nuclear weapons. \nCurrently, India's production of weapons grade plutonium is constrained \nby its limited domestic supply of natural uranium. Experts, from former \nSenator Sam Nunn former Assistant Secretary of State for \nNonproliferation Bob Einhorn, have expressed concern that by providing \nnuclear fuel to India through this agreement, India's domestic supply \nof uranium might be freed up in order to accelerate the production of \nnuclear weapons materials.\n  And in fact, the Indians themselves have expressed this possibility. \nListen to the words of a former head of the Indian National Security \nAdvisory Board, less than a year ago:\n\n       Given India's uranium ore crunch and the need to build up \n     our minimum credible nuclear deterrent arsenal as fast as \n     possible, it is to India's advantage to categorize as many \n     power reactors as possible as civilian ones to be refueled bv \n     imported uranium and conserve our native uranium fuel for \n     weapons grade plutonium production.\n\n  This is from an article entitled ``India and the Nuclear Deal,'' in \nthe Times of India on December 12, 2005.\n  This is a former high-level Indian Government official, arguing less \nthan a year ago that India should increase its production of weapons \nmaterial through the provision of imported uranium. I am, frankly, \nconcerned by that prospect. India has said that its strategic nuclear \nweapons program, and the production of fissile material, is unrelated \nto this deal. Secretary Rice and other members of the administration \nhave assured us of the same thing. In fact, in its official response to \none of Senator Lugar's questions last year, the State Department noted \nthat ``nothing to be provided to India under the Initiative will be \nused to enhance India's military capability or add to its military \nstockpile.''\n\n  If that is truly the case--and I believe both sides when they say \nthat expanding India's nuclear weapons arsenal is not a goal of this \nagreement--then my amendment should be absolutely uncontroversial. It \nsimply makes those claims binding, by requiring the President to make \nsuch a determination.\n  Some of my colleagues might ask, if we are already committed to non-\nassistance under the NPT, and if members of the administration have \nassured us that this is the case, why is this amendment necessary? \nAfter all, requiring a presidential determination is a big deal. My \nresponse is that this issue is a big deal. Nonassistance to India's \nnuclear weapons program is such a critical aspect of this agreement \nthat it must be spelled out within the legislation in clear, concrete \nterms, leaving no question or ambiguity. It is an issue that demands \nthe high bar of a presidential determination to Congress.\n  And there is a significant precedent for such determination The 1985 \nAgreement for Nuclear Cooperation Between the United States and China \nrequired a presidential determination on nonassistance to China's \nnuclear weapons program--one of only two binding presidential \ndeterminations included in that legislation. Specifically, the law \nstated that the U.S.-China nuclear cooperation agreement could not go \ninto force until the President provided a certification to Congress \nthat the agreement was designed ``to be effective in ensuring that any \nnuclear material, facilities, or components provided under the \nAgreement shall be utilized solely for intended peaceful purposes as \nset forth in the Agreement.''\n  In 1985, the Members of this body deemed that one of the two things \nthe President of the United States should have to make a certification \nabout prior to nuclear cooperation with another country was that our \ncivilian cooperation would in no way assist that country's weapons \nprogram. My amendment is identical in scope and purpose, and should be \npassed. If anything, there are even more reasons to push for such a \ndetermination with regard to India, given that India is a nonsignatory \nto the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\n  Some may argue that the President cannot make such a determination--\nthat the President cannot know in advance what India will do with \nmaterial we provide to them. But this amendment is about the scope and \ncontent of the agreement, and about assurances received from the Indian \ngovernment. It is about our current actions, and the strength of the \nagreement that the President negotiates. And in fact, the President \nmade exactly such a determination, in 1998, when he submitted \nPresidential Determination 98-10 to the U.S. Congress to enable nuclear \ncooperation with China to move forward under that agreement.\n  If this body is afraid that the President would be unable to make \nsuch a determination with respect to India, I ask one question: why \nthen are we pursuing this deal? If we cannot be reasonably certain that \nthis agreement will not help India to expand its nuclear arsenal, how \ngood a deal is this? This should be a simple calculation based on the \nbest interests of the United States.\n  My colleagues are aware that I voted against this legislation in \ncommittee. I stated at the time of my vote that I was not opposed to \nthe deal in principle, but was committed to working constructively to \nstrengthen this bill when it came to the floor, because I still had \nconcerns that had not been addressed. I stand by that statement. I \nwould like to see an agreement that brings our countries closer \ntogether strategically, while preserving our national security \ninterests.\n  However, since the time of the committee hearing, more information \nhas come to light that further justifies the concerns I expressed \nearlier, and which I would like to share with my colleagues.\n  First of all, since that time, the State Department released a report \nsanctioning two Indian firms for illicit missile-related transactions \nwith Iran. This report was 10 months overdue and was not released until \n1 day after the House voted on its version of this legislation. There \nare a number of things that I find troubling about this report and the \nway it was released, but the biggest is that it seems to contravene the \nBush administration's assertions that India has a stellar \nnonproliferation record. At a minimum, this report demonstrates that \nthere continue to be legitimate concerns about the spread of dangerous \nweapons technology, know-how, and equipment--in India and elsewhere.\n\n  Secondly, there have been troubling signals coming from the Indian \nGovernment itself about its commitment to nonproliferation controls. In \nan August 17 speech to the Indian Parliament, Prime Minister Singh \ndeclared that India would not agree to any changes to the nuclear deal \nimposed by the U.S. Congress: ``We will stick to the parameters of the \nagreement signed in Washington last year and this alone will be the \nbasis of nuclear cooperation,'' he said. He specifically noted that \nIndia would not allow ``external supervision'' of its strategic nuclear \nprograms, and argued that President Bush had committed to providing an \n``uninterrupted supply of fuel''--presumably, even if India were to \ndetonate another nuclear device. Prime Minister Singh also stated that \n``there is no question of India being bound by a law passed by a \nforeign legislature.'' This raises significant concerns in my mind as \nto whether India would accept the important elements of this \nlegislation that the U.S. Congress will put in place if it passes.\n  Finally, there have been signs of an increasingly warm official \nrelationship between India and Iran. I note the irony of the timing: at \nthe same time we are debating passage of a bill that will lend \nconsiderable assistance to India's nuclear program, we are doing \neverything in our power to prevent Iran from furthering its own nuclear \nprogram. I would like to read a couple of quotes from Indian Prime \nMinister Singh, who had a meeting with Iranian President Ahmadinejad on \nthe sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement Summit\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\nin Cuba in September. Following the meeting, Prime Minister Singh \nstated that ``India is determined to consolidate cultural, economic, \nand political ties with Iran,'' and he expressed regret over the \n``misunderstanding caused about India's stance on Iran's peaceful \nnuclear program,'' stressing that India would ``never join any efforts \nagainst Iran.'' I don't think it takes very much reading between the \nlines to doubt that India will support us in our efforts to curtail \nIran's nuclear program--one of the most important national security \nchallenges facing our country at this time.\n\n  As further evidence of the support for my amendment, I would like to \nsubmit for the Record a letter that was recently signed by a wide range \nof non-proliferation experts, former senior government officials, and \nrespected scientists. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Fix the Nuclear Trade Deal With India\n\n                                                November 13, 2006.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC,\n     Attn: Foreign Affairs Staff.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing again to urge you and your \n     colleagues to support amendments that would address serious \n     flaws that still plague the proposed U.S.-Indian nuclear \n     trade legislation (S. 3709), which may be considered this \n     month. Despite some important adjustments made to the \n     administration's original proposal by the Foreign Relations \n     Committee, the arrangement would have far-reaching and \n     adverse effects on U.S. nonproliferation and security \n     objectives. We believe the legislation must include further \n     improvements in several key areas, among them:\n       A determination, prior to resumption of full nuclear \n     cooperation, that India has stopped the production of fissile \n     material (plutonium and highly enriched uranium) for weapons \n     or else joined a multilateral fissile production cutoff \n     agreement;\n       A determination and annual certification that U.S. civil \n     nuclear trade does not in any way assist or encourage India's \n     nuclear weapons program;\n       Measures to ensure that the United States does not continue \n     to provide nuclear assistance directly or through other \n     suppliers in the event that India breaks the nonproliferation \n     commitments outlined on July 18, 2005; and\n       A determination that the Government of India (GOI) or GOI-\n     affiliated entities are not engaged in illicit procurement of \n     WMD-related items.\n       We believe these measures are necessary because India has \n     neither joined the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), nor \n     accepted safeguards on all of its nuclear facilities, and \n     India's nonproliferation policy is not fully consistent with \n     the nonproliferation practices and responsibilities expected \n     of the original nuclear-weapon states.\n       Under the proposed nuclear cooperation deal, India has \n     pledged to accept safeguards at only eight additional \n     ``civilian'' nuclear facilities by 2014. India has not yet \n     agreed that safeguards on these facilities would be \n     permanent. Current and future military-related nuclear \n     reactors, enrichment and reprocessing facilities, and weapons \n     fabrication facilities would remain unsafeguarded. Partial \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards would do \n     nothing to prevent the continued production of fissile \n     material for weapons in unsafeguarded facilities. \n     Consequently, foreign supplies of nuclear fuel to India could \n     assist India's bomb program by freeing-up its existing \n     limited capacity to support the production of highly enriched \n     uranium and plutonium for weapons.\n\n\n                      Fissile Material Production\n\n       To help ensure that U.S. civilian nuclear cooperation is \n     not in any way advancing India's weapons program and is not \n     contributing to nuclear arms competition with Pakistan and \n     China, Congress should require that the President determines \n     that India has stopped fissile material production for \n     weapons or has joined a multilateral production ban before \n     the United States resumes full civil nuclear assistance to \n     India. Four of the five original nuclear-weapon states--\n     France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States--\n     have publicly declared that they have stopped fissile \n     material production for weapons. China is also believed to \n     have stopped such production.\n       India's commitment to support U.S. efforts to negotiate a \n     global fissile material cutoff treaty (FMCT) is a laudable \n     but somewhat hollow promise. Differences between the United \n     States and most other states (including India) on whether \n     such a treaty should be verified and competing priorities at \n     the 65-nation Conference on Disarmament make the prospects \n     for the conclusion of an FMCT difficult.\n       If India is truly committed to a ``minimal credible \n     deterrent,'' India should be able to declare as a matter of \n     national policy that it has stopped fissile material \n     production for weapons, or else join the United States, \n     China, France, Pakistan, Russia, and the United Kingdom in a \n     multilateral fissile cutoff agreement, pending the completion \n     of a global, verifiable FMCT. The Congress should direct the \n     President to actively pursue the early conclusion of such an \n     interim cutoff agreement with India and other relevant \n     parties, pending the entry into force of a global FMCT.\n\n\n            Nonassistance to India's Nuclear Weapons Program\n\n       The Senate bill should also require that prior to \n     implementation of a U.S.-Indian nuclear cooperation \n     agreement, the President make a determination that the \n     proposed U.S. civil nuclear assistance will not, in any way, \n     assist India's nuclear weapons program. Such a determination \n     should take into account the possible replication and \n     subsequent use of any U.S.-origin technology in an \n     unsafeguarded nuclear facility and the provision of nuclear \n     fuel in such a manner as to facilitate the increased \n     production of highly enriched uranium or plutonium in \n     unsafeguarded nuclear facilities for weapons purposes. Such a \n     determination would help maintain confidence that the United \n     States is complying with its NPT Article I commitment not to \n     assist other states' nuclear weapons programs. The Senate \n     should also agree to provisions in the House bill (H.R. 5682) \n     requiring annual executive branch reports on whether any such \n     assistance has occurred, and on India's uranium mining and \n     fissile material production rates, and other related matters.\n\n\n            Termination of Trade and Fuel Supply Assurances\n\n       S. 3709 now makes clear that if India conducts another \n     nuclear test explosion or otherwise violates the terms of an \n     agreement for nuclear cooperation, U.S. nuclear assistance \n     would be jeopardized. The bill also states that it is the \n     policy of the United States not to facilitate nuclear trade \n     by other nations with India if U.S. exports are interrupted.\n       However, India is insisting that the United States help \n     provide an assured nuclear fuel supply, even in the event \n     that the New Delhi government conducts a nuclear test \n     explosion or otherwise violates the terms of a future \n     agreement for nuclear cooperation with the United States. \n     Such a guarantee would be unprecedented and unwise. \n     Congress should further clarify that the United States \n     shall not provide or facilitate the supply of nuclear fuel \n     to India if the Government of India resumes nuclear \n     testing or fails to meet other provisions in U.S. law.\n\n\n                  guarding against illicit procurement\n\n       The Senate should also address the fact that some Indian \n     government-affiliated enterprises have a history of \n     attempting to bypass export laws designed to keep U.S. and \n     other foreign technology from contributing to its weapons \n     effort. Congress should require that before the \n     implementation of any U.S.-Indian agreement for civil nuclear \n     cooperation, the President must make a determination that the \n     Indian government or entities under its jurisdiction are not \n     engaged in the illicit procurement of commodities controlled \n     under the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) or \n     the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).\n\n\n               retain useful nonproliferation provisions\n\n       We also urge Congress to retain several important elements \n     already included in S. 3709 that would help reduce the \n     adverse impacts of the initiative. Among these are the \n     provisions requiring that a new safeguards agreement between \n     the IAEA and India has entered into force and that such \n     safeguards are consistent with IAEA standards, principles, \n     and practices, and that such safeguards are permanent before \n     any expanded nuclear cooperation can take place. To date, \n     India has not begun formal talks with the IAEA on such \n     safeguards and is reportedly seeking ``India-specific'' \n     safeguards that would be contingent on continued fuel \n     supplies. This is not consistent with the IAEA safeguards \n     applicable in the Indian case, which are known as INFCIRC/\n     66.Rev.2 safeguards.\n       With respect to the Section 106 provision restricting the \n     transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technologies, for 30 \n     years U.S. nonproliferation policy has sought to discourage \n     the spread of sensitive nuclear technology. As President Bush \n     said in February 2004, ``enrichment and reprocessing are not \n     necessary for nations seeking to harness nuclear energy for \n     peaceful purposes.'' Current U.S. nuclear cooperation \n     agreements, including those with EURATOM, Japan, and China, \n     expressly prohibit transfers of such technologies, which can \n     be used to make nuclear bomb material. India should not in \n     any way be an exception to that important policy.\n       To ensure that India is meeting other key obligations \n     outlined in the July 18, 2005 Joint Statement, the Senate \n     should retain language in the House bill requiring that a \n     U.S. Indian agreement for nuclear cooperation shall be \n     terminated if India makes a materially significant transfer \n     that does not conform with the guidelines of the NSG or MTCR. \n     Congress should recall that in the past 20 months, seven \n     Indian entities have been sanctioned by the U.S. Government \n     for transfers of weapons-related items to Iran, including \n     sanctions announced in July for transfers of chemicals useful \n     for missile propellant manufacture.\n       Finally, the legislation wisely codifies commitments made \n     by senior Bush administration officials that before the \n     United States may engage in wider nuclear trade with India, \n     it must also secure the consensus approval of the 45-nation \n     NSG. The group operates under guidelines established in 1992\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\n     that restrict trade with states (such as India) that do not \n     accept full-scope safeguards on all of their nuclear \n     facilities. If the United States or other states seek to \n     sidestep the NSG's consensus decision-making process, the NSG \n     may cease to function as an important barrier against the \n     transfer of nuclear material, equipment, and technologies for \n     weapons purposes.\n       Without the inclusion of the provisions we have described, \n     the legislation for renewed nuclear cooperation with India \n     will have far-reaching and adverse implications for U.S. \n     nuclear nonproliferation and international objectives.\n       While we agree that building upon the already strong U.S.-\n     Indian partnership is an important goal, we remain convinced \n     that it can and should be pursued without undermining the \n     U.S. leadership efforts to prevent the proliferation of the \n     world's most dangerous weapons.\n           Sincerely,\n         Harold Bengelsdorf, Consultant, and former Director of \n           the Office for Nonproliferation Policy at the Energy \n           Department and former Office Director for Nuclear \n           Affairs at the State Department; Joseph Cirincione, \n           Senior Vice President for National Security and \n           International Policy, Center for American Progress; \n           Ralph Earle II, Former Director, U.S. Arms Control and \n           Disarmament Agency; Robert J.

Briefly, the letter notes that there are still flaws \nthat remain in S. 3709, and urges the Senate to adopt at least four \nmeasures to address them. The second of their four recommendations for \nimprovements is that there be ``a determination and annual \ncertification that U.S. civil nuclear policy does not in any way assist \nor encourage India's nuclear weapons program.'' My amendment is \ndirectly in line with the advice of these leading experts, and \naddresses an important shortfall in the legislation as it stands now.\n  I acknowledge that the U.S. business community has come out strongly \nin support of this legislation. I would only like to add a note of \ncaution to their optimism. There is nothing in this deal that would \nsecure U.S. contracts or guarantee an increase in U.S. business. The \nU.S. is not the only one in the nuclear market. Australia and Russia \nhave already indicated they are working with India to sell fuel, and \ncompanies from Great Britain, France, and Russia have viable civil \nreactor technology that they will certainly pitch to India. It is far \nfrom a foregone conclusion that U.S. companies will directly benefit \nfrom the deal. In the 8 years that nuclear trade has been permitted \nwith China, the United States has sold exactly zero nuclear reactors to \nChina--zero. I bring this up to point out that some of the benefits of \nthis deal may be exaggerated, and we should remember the overriding \npriority as we consider this legislation: whether it will make the \ncitizens of the United States more safe, or less.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to put in a brief word of \nappreciation for the substantial amount of work done on this bill by \nSenator Lugar, Senator Biden, and their staffs. This bill is a real \nimprovement over the original proposal put forward by the \nadministration, but there are still a few shortcomings that remain. My \namendment would address what I, and many others, see as one of the main \noutstanding concerns with the bill. It will ensure that this agreement \nis in line with our non-proliferation obligations and protects U.S. \nnational security, without putting any undue burdens on the U.S. or our \nIndian partners. It is a nonpartisan, commonsense amendment, in line \nwith previous legislation, and I hope that all of my colleagues will \nconsider voting in favor of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin for his very important contributions to the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and the specific contributions he has made to the \ndiscussion of this legislation. Reluctantly, I rise in opposition to \nhis amendment.\n  In my judgment--and I don't use the term unadvisedly--this is truly a \nkiller amendment. If accepted, it would require the United States and \nIndia to renegotiate the civilian nuclear agreement on which we are \nhaving our debate this evening. I state categorically: India has \nnuclear weapons. Let me repeat that: India has nuclear weapons and has \nstated its intent to keep them. The critical issue we must consider in \nexamining each of the amendments that have come before us is whether \nthe U.S. national security is advanced by engaging India and by \nincreasing the IAEA oversight of the India nuclear program. I believe \nthe answer is yes, and as a result I support this agreement and I \noppose amendments such as the one now before us that would require \nrenegotiation or make implementation of the agreement impossible.\n\n  While the Feingold amendment appears harmless, it requires the \nPresident to certify that no form of the U.S. civilian nuclear \ncooperation with India will in any way assist, encourage, or induce \nIndia to manufacture or otherwise acquire more nuclear weapons in the \nfuture. This certification demanded by the amendment is impossible to \nmake, and even if it could be made, it would be ineffective. How do we \nexpect the President of the United States to predict the future? \nClearly we do not expect, plan, or intend for this agreement to aid \nIndia's nuclear program. We have taken numerous steps to prevent this \nfrom happening. We are confident that we have already put the necessary \nprovisions in place in this agreement.\n  A Presidential certification as required by the amendment is a legal \npledge to Congress. Senate bill 3709 requires a number of \ncertifications, but it does so based upon information in the \nPresident's possession. We do not ask the President to predict the \nfuture or make a judgment when the necessary information is \nunavailable.\n  This is not the first time the Senator from Wisconsin has offered \nthis amendment. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 13 to 5 to \ndefeat the same amendment during our markup of S. 3709. During the \nmarkup, the administration strongly opposed the amendment and expressed \nits view that it was a killer amendment.\n  Senator Biden and I do not believe this amendment is necessary. We \nshare the concerns Senator Feingold has expressed, but we believe we \nhave addressed them in the committee-passed bill in a manner consistent \nwith our agreement with India and in a way that avoids renegotiation.\n  First, the United States is obligated by article I of the \nnonproliferation treaty not to engage in any nuclear cooperation that \nwould assist India's nuclear weapons program. Nothing in the United \nStates-India agreement violates this obligation. In reality, this \nagreement encourages India to produce fewer nuclear weapons by \nrequiring more Indian facilities to be placed under IAEA safeguards. We \nmust remember that the United States will not cooperate with any Indian \nfacility, site, or location that is not under IAEA safeguards. In other \nwords, the IAEA will have inspection rights at those places where U.S. \nexports are utilized.\n  Second, S. 3709 requires that the IAEA safeguards be supplemented by \nbilateral end-use monitoring requirements under section 107. In other\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\nwords, if the IAEA were forced to suspend their oversight of India's \ncommitments, the administration is required to have a backup plan in \nplace to ensure that American technologies and materials are not \nmisused or misdirected to India's nuclear program.\n  Third, the bill requires the President of the United States to inform \nCongress of any Indian violation of their commitments under the \nagreement. This preserves Congress's oversight role and permits us to \nact should Indian behavior require a reexamination of the cooperative \nagreement.\n  Fourth, section 109 states that no authority under S. 3709 can be \nused to violate U.S. commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty. U.S. contributions to the Indian nuclear program would be a \nblatant violation of this treaty commitment. Senator Biden and I \nthought it was critically important to reinforce the Senate's strong \nsupport for the NPT by insisting that our country continue to comply \nwith its requirements.\n  Lastly, sensitive transfers most likely to aid India's nuclear \nprograms are prohibited by this bill. Section 106 forbids trade in \nenrichment, reprocessing, and heavy water technologies unless those \ntransfers are under international supervision and then only to create \nproliferation-resistant versions. By prohibiting the transfer of these \ntechnologies, we ensure that U.S. assistance does not inadvertently \nassist India's weapons program.\n  India is not required to declare to the IAEA any information on the \nproduction of highly enriched uranium or plutonium. Its nuclear \nenrichment and processing plants will also be outside IAEA safeguards. \nWithout access to this information, it will be impossible for the \nUnited States to evaluate Indian production of fissile material. \nConsequently, it is impossible to determine whether an increase in \nIndian military fissile material production occurred because of foreign \nnuclear reactor fuel supply. In fact, India's own uranium mining and \nmilling will probably play a much larger role in any analysis on this \nsubject.\n  In sum, it is simply not possible to verify the relationship between \nthe delivery of foreign fuel exports to India and the possibility of \nincreases in Indian production of highly enriched uranium or separated \nplutonium, nor is it possible to analyze the relationship between \nfuture exports and domestic production. India is not required to share \nthis information. The IAEA does not have access to these facilities. \nRequiring the President of the United States to certify something he \nhas insufficient information to determine is unwise and potentially \nharmful, and the amendment clearly demands that the President make that \ncertification. Congress will be kept completely informed on \ndevelopments in this area through the existing reporting requirements \nof S. 3709.\n  Mr. President, for all of these reasons, I oppose this amendment. I \nask Senators to vote no when the roll is called.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana. It is \nlate, and I think that people already have a sense of where they will \ngo with this amendment, but I do want to make a couple of points for \nthe record, given how important this amendment is and how important \nthis agreement is.\n  The chairman suggests that what we would do here with this amendment \nwould somehow force the renegotiation of the agreement. I don't accept \nthat notion. But I would say, given the importance of making sure this \nisn't used for nuclear weapons, it is well worth renegotiating if it \nactually required that. But I don't think it does.\n  More importantly, it just doesn't make any sense to me that such an \namendment would require the full renegotiation of the agreement when \nyou look at the fact that the bill before us today already, in section \n105, requires eight different Presidential determinations. I am just \nadding two additional ones. There are already Presidential \ndeterminations that have to be made, so how can it be that the \nadditional requirement that there be determinations by the President of \nthe United States, not by Indian officials--how can that force the \nrenegotiation of this agreement? It doesn't direct the Indians to do \nanything. So I reject the notion that somehow this would require the \nrenegotiation of the agreement, and if it did, I think it would be \nbetter than not changing it.\n  Now, the biggest problem with the chairman's argument is that he is \nrelying on an earlier version of our amendment which we offered in \ncommittee, which I thought was worth passing. But the chairman \ncorrectly notes that we were defeated in the committee 13 to 5. One of \nthe criticisms was that somehow this amendment would force the \nPresident to certify some facts, that he couldn't necessarily know for \nsure what the Indians were exactly doing or what they might do in the \nfuture. I recognize that point. That is why I drafted this amendment to \nonly relate to the scope and content of the agreement. There is nothing \nin my amendment that requires the President to certify what might \nhappen in the future. And this is the critical distinction. This \namendment does not have the flaw that was argued in committee. It only \ntalks about the President certifying with regard to the scope and \ncontent of this agreement and also getting assurances from the Indian \nGovernment that the purpose of this agreement is not about nuclear \nweapons but is about civil purposes. So it is, in fact, different from \nthe amendment in committee, and that is an important distinction as \nMembers think about whether they want to vote for this version on the \nfloor of the Senate. It is more modest, but it still accomplishes an \nimportant goal.\n  This is not unheard of. This is exactly what was done in the China \nagreement in the 1980s. I described it in my original statement. The \nagreement called for a Presidential certification of this kind. It \nworked, and the President, in fact, made such a certification. So this \nis both necessary and practical from that point of view.\n  I believe I have responded to each of the arguments made by the \nSenator from Indiana. Obviously, I have enormous respect for him and \nhis leadership of the committee, but I would urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this amendment which would allow me to feel \ncomfortable supporting this agreement, because I do want us to have a \ngood agreement with India. I just think we need to have this sort of an \nassurance that my amendment provides.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, would the Senator yield 4 minutes from \nhis time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the Senator from New York such time as he \nneeds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to support the India nuclear trade \nagreement because it strengthens America's relationship with a critical \nally, but it also creates strong incentives for other countries to \nsupport our nonproliferation efforts by rewarding them with our \nvaluable nuclear technology.\n  Proliferation of nuclear technology is a very serious issue. Make no \nmistake about that. India has a good nonproliferation record and will \nbe a true partner in our efforts to prevent nuclear weapons technology \nfrom falling into the wrong hands. India's history of nonproliferation \nof dual-use nuclear technology and its willingness to implement IAEA \nguidelines and standards at nuclear facilities make India a welcome \nmember of the global nuclear community.\n  Of course, the devil is in the details. That is why it is so \nimportant that this bill preserves congressional oversight of any \nagreement the administration reaches with the Indian Government. It is \ncarefully crafted so that the U.S. agreement will not undermine the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or our obligations to the Nuclear \nSuppliers Group.\n  Under this bill, cooperation would end if India tests a nuclear \nweapon, proliferates nuclear weapons or materials, or breaks an \nagreement with the United States or the IAEA. India's access to nuclear \ncooperation will depend on its continued participation as a good \ncitizen of the global nuclear community.\n  A close relationship with India in general will help us to align our \nmutual goal of combating terrorism. Both our nations have been victims \nof serious attacks of terrorism, and we know that the greatest danger \nwe face is a nuclear weapon falling into the wrong hands. Neither of us \nwants al-Qaida to gain a nuclear weapon. Neither of us\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\nwants Iran to go nuclear. The best way to ensure India's proper \nhandling of its nuclear technology is not by distancing it but by \nworking with it to address issues of mutual concern.\n  Economic ties continue to bind our two countries through an \nincreasing flow of goods, services, and cultural exchange. It is vital \nthat we recognize this improving relationship and work toward common \ngoals for international policy standards. The buildup of nuclear \nweapons throughout the world is one of the most serious dangers \nhumanity faces. Especially in today's world, we must ensure that \nnuclear technology is developed and used according to global standards \nas set forth by the International Atomic Energy Association for \npeaceful purposes. An agreement with the United States will also \nprovide an incentive for India to refrain from conducting future \nnuclear weapon testing and to work with our Government to curtail \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. Most important, this legislation \ncreates incentives for other countries that cooperate with our \nnonproliferation efforts. It will encourage other countries around the \nworld to cooperate with the efforts of the United States to reduce the \nthreat of nuclear weapons by rewarding those countries that behave \nresponsibly with advanced American technology.\n\n  I yield the remainder of the time I have to my friend from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we have had a good debate. I note the \npresence of the distinguished Senator from California on the floor, \nwhich prompts me to inquire of the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin \nwhether he requires additional time? If the Senator is prepared to \nyield back his time, I will yield back time on our side, and then we \ncould proceed to debate on the amendment of the Senator from California \nand maybe to a closer time for final passage, for Members who are \nrequesting this of all of us.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Indiana. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will yield the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). All time is yielded back. The \nSenator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5187\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5187.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent the further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with. I wanted the beginning read because this \nis a very simple amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make the waiver authority of the President contingent upon \n a certification that India has agreed to suspend military-to-military \ncooperation with Iran, including training exercises, until such time as \n     Iran is no longer designated as a state sponsor of terrorism)\n\n       On page 8, beginning on line 8, strike ``Group; and'' and \n     all that follows through ``Nuclear'' on line 9 and insert the \n     following: ``Group;\n       (8) India has agreed to suspend military-to-military \n     cooperation with Iran, including training exercises, until \n     such time as the Government of Iran no longer supports acts \n     of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of \n     State under section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371) and section 6(j) of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)); and\n       (9) the Nuclear\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. What we \nare saying is this deal should not go forward until India has agreed to \ncut off military-to-military ties with Iran and that the President so \ncertifies.\n  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is the keystone of our efforts \nto stop the spread of nuclear weapons throughout the world. Back in the \n1960s, there was widespread concern that dozens of nations would have \nnuclear weapons within a decade. Just months before his death, \nPresident Kennedy warned of this dire threat, saying:\n\n       I ask you to stop and think for a moment, what it would \n     mean to have nuclear weapons in so many hands . . . that \n     there would be no rest for anyone then, no stability, no real \n     security, no chance of effective disarmament. There would \n     only be the increased chance of accidental war, and an \n     increased necessity for the great powers to involve \n     themselves in what otherwise would be local conflicts.\n\n  But thanks to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, there are less \nthan 10 nuclear weapons states in the world today. In fact, since the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was first signed in 1968, more nations \nhave ended nuclear weapons programs than have begun them. Countries \nsuch as Brazil, South Africa, and Japan decided to abandon their \nnuclear weapons program and join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  India did not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, instead \nchoosing to develop nuclear weapons outside of the NPT regime. India \ndeveloped a nuclear weapon in 1974 using a research reactor and \nmaterials provided by Canada and the United States of America in the \n1950s. India had pledged to use the reactor only for peaceful purposes, \nbut it failed to keep that promise. So by giving India a special deal \nto both possess nuclear weapons and receive civil nuclear assistance, \nit will be harder to convince nonnuclear weapons states to keep their \ncommitment to forgo nuclear weapons.\n  The timing could not be worse. Right now, the international community \nis trying to convince one nonnuclear member of the NPT, Iran, to cease \nuranium enrichment because the IAEA cannot verify that its program is \nfor peaceful purposes. We are also trying to roll back North Korea's \nnuclear program and convince them to rejoin the NPT.\n  India is becoming a recognized de facto nuclear power, but it is not \nrequired to take on any of the commitments made by the five recognized \nnuclear powers.\n  As The Economist reported earlier this year:\n\n        . . . the recognized nuclear powers--America, Russia, \n     Britain, France and China--are committed under the NPT to \n     curb their arsenals . . . on the way to eventual disarmament; \n     the deal with America lets India build as many bombs as it \n     chooses.\n\n  I think it is important to note what we are doing here. There is no \nlimit on the number of bombs that India could build in this deal.\n  The Economist goes on to say that the five nuclear powers have:\n\n       at least all signed the treaty banning further nuclear \n     tests and have stopped producing more highly enriched uranium \n     and plutonium; India flatly refuses to do either.\n\n  Experts believe that this deal could allow India to vastly increase \nits production of nuclear weapons from about 6 a year to about 50 a \nyear. What a contribution this Senate is making to world peace. I am \nabsolutely stunned. We are going to have 50 nuclear weapons, perhaps, \nmade in India, touching off an arms race in the region. That would not \nbe in any country's interests, including our own.\n  Secretary Rice has argued that we are not helping India's nuclear \nweapons program because only a small amount of India's indigenous \nuranium would be needed for India's military weapons program. But \nlisten to what the Congressional Research Service says:\n\n       The question for the United States is not whether India \n     intends to ramp up its weapons program with freed-up uranium, \n     but whether the U.S. and other states' actions create a new \n     capability for India to do so.\n\n  We call this fungible--fungible uranium. This should concern every \nsingle Senator, but unfortunately it doesn't appear to. It should \nconcern every Senator who believes that the proliferation of nuclear \nmaterials is the most dangerous issue facing the country today and that \nis why I have supported all the amendments. Unfortunately, these \namendments were defeated. They would have required the President to \ncertify that this deal does not assist or encourage India to produce \nadditional fissile material for weapons.\n  The amendment I am offering addresses a second area where the \nadministration has failed to receive commitments from India and that \nhas to do with India's military-to-military relationships with Iran.\n  Last spring, at the very same time that the President, our President, \nwas in India to sign the United States-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation \nAgreement, two Iranian warships were visiting the headquarters of the \nIndian Navy's Southern Command. At the very same time that President \nBush was in India to sign the United States-India Civil\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\nNuclear Cooperation Agreement, two Iranian warships were soliciting the \nheadquarters of the Indian Navy's Southern Command. These warships were \nparticipating in a training program under the military cooperation \nagreement with Tehran that was signed in 2003.\n  The fact that India would conduct training exercises with the world's \nleading state sponsor of terrorism while the President of the United \nStates is visiting New Delhi is simply unbelievable. My amendment says \nthat the President may not provide civil nuclear assistance to India \nuntil he certifies that India has agreed to suspend military-to-\nmilitary cooperation with Iran so long as the Government of Iran \ncontinues to support international terrorism.\n  My amendment does not say they can never have this deal. But it says \nthey must not cooperate, military to military, with Iran until the day \nIran is taken off the list of terrorists.\n\n  According to a March 2006 Defense News article:\n\n       In 2003 India and Iran signed a strategic agreement to \n     cooperate in defense and other matters. The deal was cemented \n     by the visit of then Iran President Mohammed Khatami to the \n     Republic Day parade in New Delhi, an honor usually reserved \n     for key allies. India still considers Iran to be a key ally \n     and this agreement on military cooperation is still in place, \n     even though Iranian actions are leading to the deaths of \n     American soldiers in Iraq as we speak.\n\n  General Casey has said that Iran is using surrogates to conduct \nterrorist operations, both against us and against the Iraqi people. He \nwent on to say:\n\n       We are quite confident that the Iranians, through the \n     special operations forces, are providing weapons, IED \n     technology and training to Shia extremist groups in Iraq.\n\n  Of particular concern is the fact that Iran is providing a type of \nIED, or roadside bomb, that has a shaped charge and is particularly \ndeadly.\n  So don't you think that if we are giving India this deal of a \nlifetime to receive nuclear technology from us, the least they could do \nis sign an agreement not to have military-to-military exercises and \nrelationships with a country that is, in essence, bringing death and \ndestruction to our sons and daughters in the United States military?\n  For more than 20 years, Iran has been the world's leading state \nsponsor of terrorism. It supports Hezbollah, several Palestinian terror \ngroups such as Hamas and, according to the State Department, Iran is \nalso:\n\n       . . . unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qaida members \n     it detained in 2003 and has resisted numerous calls to \n     transfer custody of its al-Qaida detainees to their countries \n     of origin or to third countries for interrogation and/or \n     trial.\n\n  It seems to me we should convince our friend--India--to suspend its \nmilitary-to-military cooperation with Iran. The Boxer amendment will \nhave that result, because they want this deal and I believe they would \nact to cut off these military-to-military relationships.\n  It is also very important to point out that the United States has \nalready sanctioned Indian entities and individuals for missiles and \nWMD-related transfers to Iran. In 2004, the United States imposed \nsanctions on two Indian scientists for nuclear-related transfers to \nIran. Both scientists were high-ranking officials in the Nuclear Power \nCorporation of India, Limited. In December 2005, sanctions were imposed \non two Indian chemical companies for transfer of chemical-related items \nto Iran, and as recently as last July, sanctions were imposed on two \nmore chemical manufacturers in India for transfers to Iran. In May \n2005, India passed a law on weapons of mass destruction and their \ndelivery systems. But according to CRS, the administration has not yet \nassessed India's export control law and regulation, and\n\n       . . . some observers have stated that India does not have \n     the necessary regulations in place to implement the law, and \n     that India's resources for implementation are remarkably \n     limited.\n\n  In other words, they have a Weapons Control Act, but experts believe \nthey are not enforcing it. History tells us that they, in fact, have \nacted wrongly, to pass on technologies that are harmful, to Iran. So it \nseems to me, with this history, my colleagues should be supporting this \namendment. I believe they should be and I regret that I need to offer \nit. I thought it would be accepted. I thought it would not be a \nproblem. That it would be treated in many ways is obvious. The \nPresident, it seems to me, should have made severing military ties with \nIran a precondition to civil nuclear cooperation. But, unfortunately, \nthe United States is giving away more than it received in this deal.\n\n  My friends who want to desperately see this passed tonight are voting \ndown amendment after amendment. And we are taking a deal in which, as \nformer Senator Nunn said, ``India was a lot better negotiator than we \nwere.''\n  That is Sam Nunn. We know how hard he worked with the current \nchairman of this committee to stop nuclear proliferation. What did he \nsay of this agreement? ``India was a lot better negotiator than we \nwere.''\n  So those of us on the Senate floor who are trying to get a better \ndeal, who are trying to change this deal, are being voted down--boom, \nboom, boom. We are taking a deal that Sam Nunn said essentially they \n``bested'' us on.\n  I come from a State with a huge Indian population. Our Indo-Americans \nare prominent in our State. I support strong relations with India. \nIndia is the world's largest democracy. It is so important for us to \nwork together to promote our mutual interests.\n  I am proud to be a member of the Senate India Caucus and have nothing \nbut the utmost respect for the Indian people. But this deal is not a \ngood deal for America. This deal is not a good deal for the world.\n  Proponents of this legislation say our bilateral relationship with \nIndia is important. I agree with them. I have great hopes for the \nfuture of our two nations. It is so important that we work together. \nBut somebody tell me how we are better off when we have an India that \ncan build up to maybe 50 bombs.\n  Somebody explain to me how we are better off when we don't even have \na clause in here that says that India has to receive military-to-\nmilitary relationships with Iran before this goes ahead. Somebody \nexplain it to me. I don't think it has been explained.\n  I am happy the Harkin amendment was adopted. It says that India has \nto work with us to make sure Iran doesn't get a nuclear capability, as \nthey are trying to do now. If we adopted that amendment, why can't you \nadopt this amendment which simply says shut off those military-to-\nmilitary agreements between India and Iran before this goes forward?\n  I wish the administration would have worked harder to craft a better \ndeal, a more balanced deal that would have been a net win for \nnonproliferation, while securing India's commitment to suspend its \nmilitary relationship with Iran.\n  As Robert Einhorn, a nonproliferation expert at the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies, told the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on which I am so proud to serve, ``the deal was concluded in \ngreat haste, driven by the calendar of the Bush-Singh meetings rather \nthan by the seriousness and complexity of the task at hand.'' Everybody \nknows it. We knew it at the time. And I had hoped we could then make \nthis a better deal.\n  I have worked hard. I have tried. We have lost amendment after \namendment after amendment. It is so regrettable. It is regrettable that \nwe rushed into this agreement. But we have a chance to improve this \nagreement in behalf of the Boxer amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have listened carefully, as all Members \ndo, to the distinguished Senator from California, who is such a \nvaluable member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And she has \nexpressed some of the views which are contained in her statement this \nevening during the very important hearings the committee conducted.\n  I will just say very clearly that Members on both sides of the aisle \nin committee felt that there were improvements that could occur with \nregard to the agreement, even if the agreement was negotiated in a \nfairly short period of time. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has \ntaken ample time to work through this with the administration as well \nas with each other. I regret that we did not have unanimity in the \ncommittee on final passage. A vote of 16 to 2, however, indicated a \nvery strong coming together, which clearly\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\nhas been expressed on the floor of the Senate today in the votes on \nvarious amendments.\n  But I must say that the amendment offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia is, in my judgment, a killer amendment. It goes far beyond \nthe scope of the July 18 Joint Statement issued by President Bush and \nPrime Minister Singh.\n  The amendment as written would not permit the U.S.-India agreement to \ngo into effect until India abandoned its military-to-military contacts \nwith Iran. This is a killer condition that, if adopted by Congress, \nwould require renegotiation of the agreement.\n  Few, if any, Members of Congress disagree with the sentiment \nexpressed in this amendment; namely, that Iran is a destabilizing force \nin the Middle East. As former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \nrecently wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n       Everything returns to the challenge of Iran. It trains, \n     finances and equips Hezbollah, the state within a state in \n     Lebanon. It finances and supports Moqtada al-Sadr's militia, \n     the state within a state in Iraq. It works on a nuclear \n     weapons program which would drive nuclear proliferation out \n     of control and provides a safety net for the systemic \n     destruction of at least the regional order.\n\n  Iran is a critical challenge to U.S. diplomacy and global security. \nIn this difficult environment the U.S. must cultivate a strong \nmultilateral response to Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and support \nfor terrorism. An effective solution to the Iranian threat must include \nIndia. Holding New Delhi to a different standard than our closest \nallies or other nations we engage in nuclear commerce does not appear \nto be the best way to secure their support.\n  On April 5, 2006, Secretary Rice testified before the Committee on \nForeign Relations that India has ``low level military-to-military \ncontacts.'' She noted ``that there are a number of countries that have \nrelations with Iran, and it's, of course, the sovereign right of a \ncountry to have relations with whomever they would like to have \nrelations.'' She argues that the U.S. ``is not going to do better in \npulling India toward us by insisting that they cut off relations with \nother states.'' She concluded that she didn't ``think that's going to \nwork very effectively.''\n\n  The Secretary of State argues that the international community is \nchanging its approach to Iran. She cites the exodus of banking and \nfinancial institutions. Perhaps most importantly she points out that \nIndia was the only member of the non-a1igned movement to vote for \nreferral of the Iran to the U.N. Security Council for its illegal \nnuclear program. This was an important development because India was a \nfounder and a longtime leader of the movement.\n  Let me be clear, this amendment will reverse the important trend of \ncountries distancing themselves from Tehran and future Indian \nmultilateral nonproliferation cooperation. Some experts have indicated \nthat this amendment could very well have the opposite effect, forcing \nNew Delhi away from the U.S.-Indian Agreement.\n  The administration has frequently made U.S. policy on Iran clear to \nthe Indian Government. The U.S. has consistently expressed our desire \nfor India's support of our efforts and policies. One of the unheralded \ndiplomatic accomplishments of the 2005 Joint Statement is India's \ncommitment to support international efforts to limit the spread of \nenrichment and reprocessing technologies, including to states such as \nIran.\n  I emphasize that point. If, in fact, we are deeply concerned--and I \nam, and the Senator from California certainly is--about the \ndevelopments in Iran of a nuclear program and the commitment of India \nto work with us, to limit that spread of enrichment and reprocessing is \nvery important. To deliberately take action which scuttles this \nagreement and indicates to the Indians that they can look elsewhere for \npartnership is to court disaster.\n  l am pleased that India is committed to being a responsible member of \nthe international community and it has made the decision that it is in \nits own national security interest to oppose Iran's weapons of mass \ndestruction program.\n  On a number of occasions the Indian-Iranian military relationship has \nbeen greatly exaggerated. This year an article alleged that India was \nproviding military training for Iranian sailors. Secretary Rice \nresponded that while Iranian ships have made port calls at India ports, \nshe reported that New Dehli had denied that Iranian sailors had been \ntrained in India.\n  It is unfortunate that the Senator from California constructed the \namendment in this manner. It would be more appropriate to address this \nissue in the sense of Congress section or as a statement of U.S. \npolicy. If the amendment was modified in this manner, I am prepared to \nrecommend that it be adopted by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, in \nits current form it makes it impossible for the President to meet the \nrequirement and thus implementation is impossible.\n  If this amendment is adopted, in my judgment, the United States-India \nagreement will be scuttled. That, I believe, would be a tragedy.\n  I urge Senators to vote against the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I wonder if the Chair would give me 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will yield whatever time the Senator will consume.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  The Senator stated it well. And I don't like to argue with my friend \nfrom California; I seldom ever win, and I am very uncomfortable because \nI consider her one of my best friends in this body. So it is an \nuncomfortable position to be in.\n  I want to make three points. The first is that right now, if India \nwere to engage in transferring any lethal weaponry to Iran, it would be \nin violation of our law. It would damage the relationship and \nfundamentally alter our relationship. It is existing U.S. law.\n  No country can transfer lethal weaponry to Iran and maintain our \nsupport. That is No. 1.\n  The second point I would like to make is with the underlying \nconcern--I know it is much broader than this--of my friend from \nCalifornia. I think if I read her correctly--and I may not be--somehow \nthis agreement is going to yield the prospect that India will be in a \nbetter position to transfer some kind of technology in this military-\nto-military relationship to Iran that will help Iran get the nuclear \ncapability.\n  The truth is, as the chairman has pointed out, they have entered into \nan agreement with us not to do that. But, secondly, they have voted in \nthe IAEA with the Board of Governors to sanction Iran, to take issue \nwith Iran, to report it to the U.N., and they voted with us in the U.N. \nSo they are openly taking on Iran in terms of the thing of greatest \nconcern to us all.\n  I know my friend spoke eloquently about the support of terrorism by \nIran. The implication is that any military-to-military assistance goes \ndirectly to helping the capability of the Iranians to help support \nHezbollah and other organizations that are terrorist organizations \naround the world.\n  I will make the following observation: She also stated accurately \nthat Indian entities have been sanctioned for transferring materials to \nIran. I must point out, so has Germany, so has the Spanish, so have \nEuropean allies of ours. They also had entities sanctioned. It is not \nunique to India that an organization would, in fact, provide assistance \nto Iran in a way that would generate United States sanctions. Spain is \nthe most recent offender.\n\n  I conclude by saying this is the hardest piece to swallow--not what \nthe Senator said, but what I am about to say is the hardest piece to \nswallow. Palmerston had the famous expression that countries don't have \npermanent friends, they have permanent interests.\n  Look where India resides and look where Iran resides. One of the \ncountries they are most concerned about is Pakistan. Now, it is not \nreasonable to assume that India and Iran would not want to have a \nmilitary relationship where they shared information and/or concerns \nrelative to Pakistan. So for them to forswear any kind of relationship \nat all with India that has a military or quasi-military relationship is \nto essentially suggest to them that they should not deal with a common \nenemy.\n  Look what we are doing. We are dealing with a country that we \nsanctioned\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\nbefore, that we have clearly decided is not a democratic country, that \nclearly has probably the largest percentage of jihadists residing in \nit, with, arguably, the least significant effort to deal with these \njihadists--the country of Pakistan. What are we doing? Because we have \npermanent interests, and our interests are that we have support in the \nwar against jihadists and al-Qaida and terrorist organizations, we are \ncooperating with a country we otherwise probably would not cooperate \nwith.\n  How would we feel if a European country or any other country around \nthe world said--or India said--we will not trade with you, the United \nStates of America, as long as you continue to have a military-to-\nmilitary relationship with Pakistan, a country that is, in fact, \nexporting--or if they are not exporting, at least cooperating with or \nturning a blind eye to the terrorist organizations that reside within \ntheir country? We would say, Wait a minute. You want to trade with us, \ntrade with us. You want to tell us whether out of our self-interest we \ncan cooperate with Pakistan--which is not what you call a model \ndemocracy--then we would say no.\n  The only generic point I want to make, I know of no evidence--it may \nexist, but I am unaware of it--where India is materially cooperating \nwith Iran in order for Iran to be able to better supply, support, and/\nor encourage terrorism. I know of no such interest and no such \ncircumstance. Maybe my friend may know what I do not. She may have \ngotten a recent briefing with the Intelligence Committee where somebody \nsaid that, but I am unaware of any such cooperation that has the net \neffect of promoting terror.\n  What I do know is we have built into the law now the ability to \nsanction India if, in fact, India does supply lethal weapons or was in \nany way cooperating with promoting Iran's nuclear program. Beyond that, \nit would break the spirit of the entire agreement we have with India. \nIf it came to light that somehow there was evidence that India was in \nany way cooperating with Iran's nuclear program, this deal is done. \nThis is over. It is finished. It is gone.\n  At the root of this overall agreement, which my colleague, \nunderstandably, does not like, the underlying issue here is this \nagreement between India and the United States. The underlying premise \nis based upon a notion of a maturing relationship based on trust that \nthey will not only not violate the letter but will not violate the \nspirit of this agreement.\n  Let me conclude by saying what the spirit of the agreement is. The \nspirit of the agreement is we are not going to do anything, United \nStates of America, that we would not otherwise be able to do; we will \nnot do anything with what you provide for us that will increase our \ncapacity, our ability, our desire, or our intent to deal with our \nnuclear program.\n  They have said straightforwardly at the same time, We are keeping our \nnuclear program. We ain't giving it up.\n  It is a little bit like us saying now--and this will be my last \nstatement--you know, Pakistan violated the law, Pakistan violated our \nlaw. It went out and it broke the deal and it did what India did. On \ntop of that, Pakistan was the largest proliferator in the history of \nthe world of nuclear capability through A.Q. Khan. And guess what. We \nare going to bite our nose off to spite our face. Now that we need \nPakistan in dealing with this war on terror, we are going to sanction \nPakistan, we are not going to cooperate with Pakistan, we are going to \ndo nothing with Pakistan even though we acknowledge that might give \ngreater sustenance to al-Qaida, bin Laden, the Taliban, et cetera.\n  Countries make hard choices. They are not neat and clean. I suggest \nif we are going to impose upon India a requirement to cease and desist \nwith any military-to-military relationships notwithstanding they have \ncommon enemies and common concerns with Iran, as bad as Iran is, \nnotwithstanding the fact that there is no evidence that they are \npromoting and/or giving the ability to support terrorism's greater \nthrust, notwithstanding the fact they have agreed to do everything they \ncan to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power, if we are going to \nsanction them this way, I ask the rhetorical question: Why wouldn't the \nrest of the world sanction us for our relationship with Pakistan. And \nwhy are we cooperating with Pakistan? If anybody in the deal is not the \nideal partner right now, it is Pakistan.\n  But what do we do? To steal a phrase from a former President that I \noften hear, comments we hear on CNN all the time, his comment always is \n``you got to accept life in the world as you find it.'' I am \nparaphrasing a former President. I think it is close to a quote. We \nhave to accept the world as we find it, make the best out of it, and \npromote our interest to the greatest extent. Sometimes it means we make \nless than perfect deals.\n  Had Chairman Lugar been President Lugar, had Senator Boxer been \nSenator Boxer, had I been their Secretary of State, I believe I could \nhave gotten a better deal than we got. But the fact is, we are where we \nare, as the old trade expression goes, and I believe the downside of \nrejecting this treaty is so much further down than any downside that \nflows from supporting this changed law allowing this to go forward. In \nthat sense, it is not a close call.\n  I suggest to my friend, I think everything she says has merit in the \nabstract. But we are living in the world we live in now based on the \nparameters we are looking at. I think this amendment, which would kill \nthe agreement, is not worth the candle because it would do that--not \nbecause it doesn't have underlying merit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Do we have any time remaining on the opposition side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. Let me \nsummarize by saying I visited Delhi in March right after the President \nhad signed the historic agreements. I walked into a meeting of \ndistinguished Indian officials asking if we could possibly confirm this \ntreaty, this agreement.\n  I knew nothing about it, so I did a tremendous amount of quick work \nwith our agency to check out what the dangers might be. They came back \nand they told me India was the one most least likely to engage in \nnuclear proliferation. They saw this as a tremendous opportunity for us \nto improve on our relations with a country that had for too long been \nin the Soviet/Russian sphere.\n  We have an opportunity to help them. They are a growing country. They \nhave many needs. Civil nuclear power is the one most important thing \nthey need because of their tremendous pollution problems. This enables \nus to help them reduce pollution. Not only are we interested in nuclear \nnonproliferation, we are interested in pollution nonproliferation. This \nmoves us forward.\n  Beyond that, securing a close relationship with India is one of our \nmost important steps toward developing a peaceful environment and \nprosperity in south Asia. This opportunity cannot be wasted.\n  This particular amendment, as has been stated, which is well-\nintentioned and reflects understandable concerns, is, nevertheless, a \npoison pill. Many countries have relations with Iran. We do not like \nthem. But many of those countries with which we have good working \nrelationships don't like our relations with Israel. We are not going to \nchange our relations with Israel. We are not going to stop helping \nthem. But we are going to continue to work with those countries.\n  As the Senator from Delaware has pointed out, we have relations with \nPakistan and there are lots of questions about that. If we want to work \nwith the Indians and develop a good relationship so they will not deal \nwith Iran, the best thing we can do is to defeat these poison pill \namendments and confirm the treaty so we will bring India and the United \nStates together.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendments and to support the \ntreaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will try not to take the full time, but I want to \nrespond to my colleagues.\n  The debate has been much ado about a very straightforward and simple\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\namendment. My amendment has nothing to do with the transfer of lethal \nweapons. My colleague Senator Biden talked about that. Nothing to do \nwith that. My amendment, in the real world, I don't believe could be \nseen as a killer amendment. It is a simple amendment.\n  My colleague Senator Bond is right. He says a lot of other countries \nhave relationships with Iran. No other country gets a deal like this \nwhere we give nuclear technology and there is absolutely no control on \nthe number of bombs India could build. Experts tell us it could be as \nmany as 50 a year. I don't think that makes the world safer.\n  But to help me with this treaty, to give my constituents a feeling \nthat we are protecting them, at the least, say you are getting this \ndeal, you are going to be able to build a lot of weapons with it, then \ncut off your military-to-military ties with the leading terrorist \nnation in the world--Iran--a nation that is at this very moment hurting \nour troops in the field in Iraq.\n  Now, my colleague Senator Biden, I agree with completely when he \nsays--and I do believe this--Senator Lugar, if President, would have \ncut a better deal. I could say Senator Biden, if President, could have \ncut a better deal, but we don't have a better deal. And I don't live in \na world where you sit back and say, oh, too bad. This isn't about \nbuying a piece of cake. We are not going to the store and buying a toy. \nIt is about giving nuclear technology to a country that has, in fact, \nbeen called out by our own country because it has in the past \ntransferred information about WMDs, nuclear weapons, missiles, to Iran. \nWe have called them out on that. So why can't we ask them simply to \nstop these military-to-military programs they have with Iran?\n  Again, when we stand up and say, gosh, this is a killer amendment, \nthey will walk away, it sounds weak to me. It does not sound as though \nwe are the strongest nation in the world. Who would walk away from this \ndeal? India is not a member of the NPT, not a signatory, and they are \ngetting all this information from the United States of America on \nnuclear civilian technology, with no cap on the number of bombs they \ncan build, and they are going to walk away from this because we simply \nask them not to have military-to-military cooperation with the world's \nleading sponsor of terrorism?\n  I don't get it. So I think my colleagues have made this complicated \nwhen it is really very simple. We do this deal with India, the least \nthey can do is cut off their military-to-military cooperation with \nIran.\n  With that, Mr. President, I conclude my remarks. I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would inquire of the Chair if the \nexisting order now calls for a 2-minute debate on the Feingold \namendment prior to a rollcall vote on that amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Further, I would ask the Chair for clarification: Does the \n2-minute debate then occur on the Boxer amendment, after the rollcall \nvote on Feingold?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Then, finally, an additional 2-minute debate before final \npassage of the bill, after the Boxer amendment is voted on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair for that clarification.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that--the first rollcall vote, \nwe understand, is 15 minutes--the subsequent rollcall votes be 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Senator Feingold is now recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5183\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to briefly recap what my \namendment does and why I believe it is important for the Senate to \nadopt it.\n  The amendment is very simple. It will require the President to make \ndeterminations that nothing in the nuclear cooperation agreement he \nnegotiates with India will contribute to India's nuclear weapons \nprogram. Both the United States and India have stated that expanding \nIndia's nuclear arsenal is not an objective of this agreement, and my \namendment simply makes those claims binding.\n  The United States is prohibited under our current obligations in the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to directly or indirectly assist the \nnuclear weapons programs of other states. My amendment simply makes \nclear that the United States is actually abiding by its international \ncommitments. It does not require the President to guarantee what India \nwill do; he simply must certify that he is satisfied the agreement will \nnot contribute to India's nuclear weapons program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me, in brief response, say I understand \nthe intent of the amendment. But the amendment uses the words, for \nexample, ``India cannot use United States-origin equipment . . . ,'' \n``India cannot replicate and subsequently use. . . .'' No one can \ncertify they cannot. It is possible they could. The question is whether \nwe are insisting that they not use it. We are insisting they are not \nusing it, and we have built into this agreement a requirement on the \npart of the administration to look at whether they are, in fact, doing \nit.\n  So the question is not whether they can or cannot. Anything can \nhappen. A President cannot certify it is not possible. That is what \n``cannot'' says. But he can certify to the best of his knowledge it is \nnot occurring. That is what we require. ``Cannot'' makes this a deal-\nbreaker. No President could certify it. ``Cannot'' translates into ``it \nis not possible to replicate, it is not possible to . . . ,'' and no \none can certify to that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain) and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nBoxer amendment.\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will be very brief. We are giving India \na one-of-a-kind deal that no one else gets: civilian nuclear technology \nand no cap on the number of bombs they can build.\n  The least we can do is ask them to cut off their military ties with \nthe biggest state sponsor of terrorism--Iran. Iran is building the IEDs \nthat are killing our soldiers in Iraq. The least we can do is ask the \nPresident to certify that they have cut off military-to-military \nrelationships with Iran.\n  Why is it important? Look at this Defense News: ``Indian Navy Trains \nIranian Sailors.''\n  We know they have these ties. If we really believe we are doing \nsomething good, we should at least expect India to cut off military \nties with the leading state sponsor of terrorism--Iran. I urge an \n``aye'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Iran is a critical challenge to the United \nStates, our diplomacy, our global security, but in this very difficult \nenvironment the United States must cultivate a strong multilateral \nresponse to Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons in support of terrorism.\n  I simply point out that India was the only member of the nonaligned \nmovement to vote for referral of Iran to the U.N. Security Council for \nits illegal nuclear program. Holding India to a different standard than \nall of our other closest allies or nations with whom we engage in \nnuclear commerce does not appear to be a good way to secure their \nsupport.\n  Let me be very clear: If this amendment is adopted, the India nuclear \nagreement is kaput. This is it. This is a killer amendment, and I ask \nfor Senators to vote no.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     nonproliferation consequences\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nUnited States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act, S. 3709. As \nI have said before, I believe strengthening the relationship between \nour two nations is an important strategic goal and this legislation \nhelps us take a dramatic step in this direction.\n  However, like many of my colleagues, I have concerns with potential \nnonproliferation consequences of this agreement. Much to my \ndisappointment, the administration has done very little to address \nthese concerns, instead, sending draft legislation to the Congress that \nwas essentially a blank check.\n  The managers of the bill, Senators Lugar and Biden, have done a \ntremendous job taking the administration's proposal and shaping it into \nmeaningful, bipartisan legislation. The bill now before the Senate \nhelps move us closer to India while addressing some key \nnonproliferation issues.\n  However, I remain concerned about the issue of nuclear testing. A \ndecision by the Indian Government to conduct such a test could trigger \nan arms race in South Asia that would be extremely dangerous and \ndestabilizing.\n  The good news is that the joint statement between President Bush and \nPrime Minister Singh of July 18, 2005 declared that India's unilateral \nmoratorium on nuclear testing will continue. I take Prime Minister \nSingh at his word, but also believe in following President Reagan's \nmantra of ``trust but verify.''\n  To this end, I am wondering if the chairman will take a few moments \nto clarify a couple matters concerning this legislation. Is it the \nmanagers' belief that section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act, AEA, will \napply prospectively to India--aside from the sections of the AEA that \nare explicitly amended by S. 3709?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. Under our bill, the \nfull force of section 129 would apply to any Indian detonation of a \nnuclear explosive device, any termination or abrogation of IAEA \nsafeguards by India, and material violation of IAEA safeguards by \nIndia, all would result under section 129 in the termination of nuclear \nexports to India.\n  Mr. OBAMA. On a related note, is it the chairman's interpretation of \nthe legislation that, in the event of a future nuclear test by the \nGovernment of India, nuclear power reactor fuel and equipment sales, \nand nuclear technology cooperation would terminate; other elements of \nthe United States-India nuclear agreement would likely terminate; and \nthe United States would have the right to demand the return of nuclear \nsupplies?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, under our bill, the only requirement which is waived \nis that in section 123.a(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, for full-\nscope safeguards. India's 123 agreement would still have to meet the \nrequirement of section 123.a(4), which requires that in the event of a \ntest by India of a nuclear explosive device the United States shall \nhave the right to request the return of supplies as you have \nstipulated.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. I offered an amendment that the managers have already \naccepted pertaining to the supply of nuclear power reactor fuel in \nsafeguarded, civilian nuclear facilities. To further clarify this \nissue, is it the managers' understanding that provision of a fuel to \nthe Government of India should be sized in a way to maintain a \ndeterrent to Indian nuclear testing, while also providing protections \nagainst short-term fluctuations in the supply of nuclear fuel? In other \nwords, is it your understanding that providing a fuel reserve to India \nis not intended to facilitate a resumption in nuclear testing?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, that is our understanding.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Does the chairman believe that, as this agreement moves \nforward to the Nuclear Suppliers Group, NSG, the United States should \nwork to ensure that other nations provide nuclear power reactor fuel in \na similar fashion?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, I hope that would be the case.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Finally, would the managers agree that section 105 of S. \n3709 requires that the President determine, prior to exercising the \nwaivers in section 104, that ``an agreement between India and the IAEA \nrequiring the application of safeguards in perpetuity in accordance \nwith IAEA standards, principles, and practices to civil nuclear \nfacilities, programs, and materials . . . has entered into force,'' and \nthat the\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\nmost logical approach, as U.S. officials have stated for the record, \nwould be to use the IAEA INFCIRC/66, Rev. 2 agreement as the model for \nIndia's safeguards agreement?\n  Mr. LUGAR. My understanding is that the administration, the IAEA, and \nparticipating governments in the NSG have all stated that they would \nprefer that any new Indian safeguards agreement be modeled on INFCIRC/\n66 Rev. 2.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the managers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to oppose this legislation.\n  One of the many lessons of the tragedy of September 11 is that \nAmerica's overarching national security interest is keeping nuclear \nmaterial and weapons out of the hands of terrorists. Nothing is more \nimportant for our national security than achieving this goal.\n  The international nuclear nonproliferation regime flawed though it \nmay be is our best hope of achieving this goal. While I believe America \nhas a clear interest in strengthening our relationship with India, I do \nnot believe it can, or should, be achieved by sidestepping nearly half \na century of international nonproliferation agreements. In the long \nrun, doing so will make America and the world more vulnerable to the \nperils of nuclear weapons.\n  One of the defining goals of my years in the Senate has been to \nsupport the important advances made by our country and the \ninternational community in limiting the perils of nuclear weapons \nacross the globe.\n  President Kennedy considered the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which \nrepresented an early and historic advance in nuclear nonproliferation, \nas one of his greatest accomplishments. On signing the documents of \nratification on October 7, 1963, President Kennedy said, ``This small \nstep toward safety can be followed by others longer and less limited, \nif also harder in the taking. With our courage and understanding \nenlarged by this achievement, let us press onward in quest of man's \nessential desire for peace.''\n  Since that agreement, further progress was made with the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, NPT, the SALT and START agreements, as well as \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. These agreements although far from \nperfect are essential to limiting the spread and use of nuclear \nweapons. They are the bedrock of our effort to ensure that the world \nwill never, ever again know the horrors of the use of nuclear weapons. \nThey took years to negotiate and implement, and we must be exceedingly \ncareful about dismantling or carving out exceptions to them for any \ncountry.\n  Supporters of this agreement argue that the international \nnonproliferation regime has not proved successful in every case--just \nlook at Iran and North Korea. And I accept the premise of the \nadministration's argument that the international arms control regime \nmay need to be modified or adapted to fit current times, and that we \nneed to find a way to address India.\n  However, we need to recognize that commitments under the NPT made by \nvirtually every nonnuclear state play an essential role in assisting \nthe international community in keeping a check on their nuclear \nprograms. And, before we make significant changes to the \nnonproliferation regime, we must be absolutely confident that we are \ndoing more good than harm and that we will be more likely not less \nlikely to limit the spread of nuclear weapons across the globe. I do \nnot believe that running roughshod over these agreements by carving out \nan exception for India is the way to achieve these goals.\n  General Brent Scowcroft cautioned that, ``I am concerned about a \ntrend that we see reflected in the United States-India nuclear deal \nwhere we try to address proliferation risks by assessing the character \nof regimes and governments. Such an approach also opens up divisions \namong the world's nuclear powers, with each making a list of \n``friends'' who can be trusted with nuclear technology and `foes' who \nare dangerous risks.''\n  Further, Robert Gallucci, the Dean of Georgetown University's School \nof Foreign Service, pointed out that, if we do approve this arrangement \nwith India, ``we will put at risk a world of very few nuclear weapon \nstates, and open the door to the true proliferation of nuclear weapons \nin the years ahead.''\n  Certainly, there are some advantages to the nonproliferation regime \nunder the proposed agreement. India would place a majority of its \ncurrent and future civilian reactors under international safeguards. \nIndia has agreed to abide by the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers \nGroup, and to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime. India has \nagreed not to test another nuclear device and has indicated that it \nwill work with the United States on concluding an international regime \nto stop the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. These \nare definitely positive steps.\n  However, India will not sign the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty and \nsubject its military facilities to international inspection, and this \nremains a major concern. Until now, as part of an effort to limit the \nspread of nuclear weapons across the globe, international arms control \nagreements and U.S. law have required full international safeguards on \ncivilian and military reactors before civilian nuclear energy could be \nprovided. These requirements exist to ensure that by assisting a \ncountry's civilian program, we are not freeing up supplies for an \nunsafeguarded nuclear weapons program. Under this agreement, however, \nnone of India's military reactors would be put under international \nsafeguards, but it would receive civilian nuclear energy anyway. In \nother words, India will obtain the benefits of the NPT, without the \nobligations required by it.\n  Additionally, despite India's stated commitment to conclude an \ninternational agreement to cut off the production of fissile material--\nthe essential component for making nuclear weapons--there is no \ntimeframe for concluding such an agreement, nor is there any binding \ncommitment for India to do so. United States, Russia, Great Britain, \nand France have agreed to a fissile material production cut-off for \nnuclear weapons, and India should as well. So we will knowingly permit \na country to benefit from civilian nuclear energy cooperation and \nmaintain an active, unsafeguarded program to construct, develop, and \nbuild nuclear weapons.\n  If we provide India with the benefits of nuclear nonproliferation \nagreements without requiring them to sign the NPT nuclear agreement or, \nat least, cease the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons, \nthere would be significant and harmful consequences for our global \nnonproliferation efforts.\n  It will embolden Iran to flout the will of the international \ncommunity. There could not be a worse moment to give India the green \nlight to build weapons with the blessing of the United States and the \ninternational community. The Iranians see a clear double standard. As \nIran's national security adviser said in March, ``The United States is \nimposing a contradictory theory of dual standards: though our NPT \nmembership entitles us to access to nuclear science and technology, it \nclaims that we will never have that right, whereas it cooperates with \nIndia, which does have the bomb but is not an NPT member.'' The \nIranians will undoubtedly use the double standard of India in Iran's \nefforts to break the will of the international community to achieve its \nnuclear aims.\n  Former Senator Sam Nunn stated that ``the U.S. India deal will likely \nmake it more difficult to get other nations to join us in stopping \nthreatening nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea.'' Similarly, \nZbigniew Brzezinski, points out that this deal ``will complicate the \nquest for a constructive resolution of the Iranian nuclear problem.''\n  Furthermore, this agreement will put the United States in the \nposition of indirectly supporting an arms race in South Asia. If the \nIndians or the administration could assure us that India had agreed, \nlike the United States, Russia, Great Britain, and France, to a fissile \nmaterial production cut-off for nuclear weapons, the concern would \ndiminish. We know that India currently has very limited uranium \nresources, which it now must dedicate to generating electric power. It \nis so short of uranium that it can only run its reactors at about two-\nthirds capacity. But that will change once India gains access to \nforeign uranium supplies for its civilian uses. The agreement would \nprovide India with sufficient uranium to supply its civilian reactors, \nfreeing up domestic supplies for military purposes. Former Senator Sam \nNunn\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\nwarns that ``India will no longer be forced to choose whether its own \nlimited uranium stocks should be used to support its civilian nuclear \nprogram or its nuclear weapons program.''\n  Some experts estimate that India could increase production from a \nhandful of weapons a year to 50 or more, if it could use its domestic \nproduction for its weapons program. How will China and Pakistan react \nto India's increasing nuclear stockpile, as well as to the enhanced \npotential to produce fissile material as a result of this new \ncooperation? India states it only wants to build up its nuclear arsenal \nto the ``minimum credible deterrence'' level before it stops building \nnuclear weapons, but we don't really know what India is likely to do. \nHow many more weapons will it need to reach that minimum credible \ndeterrence? 50? 100? 500? Will Pakistan and China respond by building \nmore weapons, too? Will the mad race for nuclear arms take on a life of \nits own, continuing to escalate with reckless abandon?\n  And what will happen with our other allies who are members of the \nnonproliferation regime? There is no doubt that the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty has played an essential role in the decisions \nof countries such as South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, and South Korea \nall allies of the United States--to stop pursuing their own nuclear \nweapons programs. But if we allow India to build nuclear weapons and \nenjoy civilian nuclear cooperation, will other U.S. friends and other \ncountries in the future follow India's lead and demand the same? If we \nargue that the decision about India was based on trust, how on Earth \nwill we be able to argue otherwise with these allies? They will accuse \nus rightly of having a double standard. I think we can all agree that \nthe fewer the countries with nuclear weapons the better for U.S. \nnational security, even if those aspiring countries are friendly toward \nthe United States.\n  President Jimmy Carter said in March that ``there is no doubt that \ncondoning avoidance of the NPT encourages the spread of nuclear \nweaponry. Japan, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, Argentina and many \nother technologically advanced nations have chosen to abide by the NPT \nto gain access to foreign nuclear technology. Why should they adhere to \nself-restraint if India rejects the same terms.''\n  And what will happen to the international supply of material to India \nif it does test another weapon? While I am reasonably confident that \nthe United States would terminate supplying nuclear materials and \ntechnology to India, there is a question whether the international \nregime particularly the Nuclear Suppliers Group would cease \ncooperation. Once the door to cooperation is opened to India, it may be \ndifficult to get other countries to agree to shut it again. The Indian \npress has suggested that if India tests again it would likely lose the \nUnited States as a supplier but would retain access to uranium from \nother sources. In fact, Indian Prime Minister Singh told his Parliament \nin August that if there were a disruption of uranium supplies to India, \nsuch as in result of India testing another device, that ``the United \nStates and India would jointly convene a group of friendly supplier \ncountries, Russia, France and the United Kingdom, aimed at restoring \nfuel supplies to India.'' This certainly should raise alarm bells. I \nknow Senator Obama has tried to address that problem with his amendment \nto the Senate bill, but all should be asking whether we should open the \ninternational spigot if we are uncertain about whether we can shut it \noff.\n  Much has been made of the foreign policy benefit to America of this \nagreement, but I reject fully--the notion that America's relationship \nwith India or the Indian American community--can or should be defined \nby this vote.\n  The United States and India have a multitude of ties, which are \ngrowing ever closer, ever stronger. In the last decade we have seen a \ndramatic improvement in bilateral relations.\n  India and America are the two largest democracies in the world. We \nshare deeply held, common values, including respect for human rights, \nthe rule of law, promoting peace, and prosperity in the world.\n  My family and I have long had an interest in India. My brothers--John \nand Bobby visited in 1951, and I am a friend of India. I work closely \nwith the Indian-American community to address hate crimes, immigration, \nand other issues that affect their daily lives.\n\n  President Kennedy was right when he characterized India as a ``great \nand vital hope of democracy in Asia.'' He rightfully exclaimed that \n``no thoughtful citizen'' could fail to recognize that India was a \ngreat and vital hope of democracy in Asia.\n  Today, India is the world's largest democracy and soon will be the \nworld's largest country. It has one of the fastest growing economies \nand plays a leading role in global affairs.\n  The United States and India are seeking to improve trade and \ninvestment ties. We are cooperating in key areas such as agriculture, \ntechnology, energy, and the environment. India's green revolution came \nfrom America and proved essential to ending massive starvation in \nIndia. Today, our countries are cooperating on the next green \nrevolution, to increase agricultural productivity and to help the \nenvironment.\n  Defense cooperation is increasing. Our militaries are conducting more \njoint exercises, India is purchasing more U.S. counterterrorism and \ndefense equipment, and in June 2005, the United States and India signed \na 10-year defense pact.\n  India, in recent years, has been the leader in sending students to \nstudy in the United States. Cultural links--whether food, movies, music \nor literature--are growing, too.\n  After September 11, the United States cooperated with India in \ndealing with international terrorism threats.\n  We are also working closely with India on public health threats, \nincluding HIV/AIDS and avian influenza.\n  Our relationship is strong today and will continue to grow. These \nties can and should continue to grow regardless of this agreement \nbecause it is in the interests of both of our countries.\n  But we need to be realistic about the foreign policy benefits of this \nagreement.\n  Naturally, we want the Indian Government to work with the United \nStates to advance our foreign policy objectives. But we need to be \nrealistic enough to know that India will follow a foreign policy that \nsuits its interest. We should not and cannot expect India to pursue a \npolicy that diverges from its national interests or not to pursue a \npolicy that is in its national interests.\n  Fortunately, India's national interests converge with ours on the \nvital national security issues. Neither country wants to see Iran \nacquire nuclear weapons and both are profoundly concerned by the \nterrorist threats. The tragic bombing in Mumbai in July where more than \n200 people were killed by terrorists underscored to Indians that \nterrorism is a real and present danger.\n  But we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that concluding a \nnuclear cooperative agreement with India will make it adopt policies \nregarding China, Iran, or others in the region or the world that are \ncontrary to its national interest.\n  Conversely, not concluding an agreement will not mean that India will \nforsake its national interests to spite the United States. India will \nnot confront China or Iran or any other country merely because the \nUnited States asks it to do so. India will do so only if it is in \nIndia's national interests. This is independent of whether or not there \nis nuclear cooperation in place.\n  Further, many have suggested that the U.S. nuclear industry will \nbenefit from this agreement with increased reactor sales to India. \nHowever, this is not the case. Neither the United States nor India has \nratified an international agreement to limit the civil liability for \nnuclear reactors.\n  Until both nations agree to limit the liability, the U.S. nuclear \nindustry will be hesitant to sell reactors to India. However, France \nand Russia have no such hesitations. Both have state-owned nuclear \nindustries, so it is much less likely that victims of a nuclear reactor \nfailure would be able to successfully sue for damages.\n  As we have seen at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Bhopal, the \nliability exposure for such accidents can be overwhelming, resulting in \nthousands of deaths and radiation exposure for millions of people. \nUnderstandably, the U.S. nuclear industry is reluctant to\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\nsell reactors to another country until their liability for such an \naccident is limited.\n  If we support this agreement without accompanying limitations on \nliability, we open the door for the French and the Russians to sell \nnuclear reactors to India but not for our own industry.\n  I also do not believe this is an issue the Congress should be voting \non now.\n  President Bush is asking us to trust him that the risks of this \nagreement will not materialize and that additional benefits will \nfollow--especially that India will cease fissile material production as \na result of a new treaty.\n  But with so many details unresolved and much up in the air, I see a \nvote for this legislation, which will permanently change U.S. law, as \ngiving the administration a blank check in concluding the negotiations \nwith India on a nuclear cooperation agreement and with the terms of \nsafeguard agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency and \nrevisions to the Nuclear Suppliers Group's guidelines.\n  Nuclear nonproliferation is too important to our national security to \ntake unnecessary risks. We should wait until the whole package has been \nnegotiated and until we have better answers to the questions I have \nraised about the implications of this agreement before we take this \nstep; for once we take the step of carving up the international \nnonproliferation regime, it is no easy matter to return if we find out \nwe have erred. This genie cannot be put back in the bottle.\n  I am particularly concerned that unpleasant answers will come out \nafter we have voted on the legislation. In an action that was eerily \nreminiscent of the White House's decision to withhold until after the \nvote on the Iraq war North Korea's admission about its nuclear weapons \nprogram, the State Department delayed a report on proliferation with \nIran until after the House had already approved this agreement. It \nturned out that there were two Indian companies on that report. \nFurther, the administration kept quiet on Pakistan's constructing a \nnuclear reactor that could be used in a regional arms race, making \nIndia more likely to ramp up its production of fissile material, using \nthe domestic production freed up by this agreement. And, as we learned \nthis week, Ambassador Negroponte has not yet provided answers to the \nForeign Relations Committee's questions on India's nonproliferation \nactivities.\n  We have the time and we have the responsibility to get this right. \nLet's be sure of what we are getting ourselves into.\n  If it can be shown with enough confidence that India will take steps \nto become a full-fledged member of the nonproliferation community and \nhas agreed to cut off production of fissile material, then I would \ncertainly vote in favor of the cooperation agreement. Until then, I \nwill be reserving my vote, looking for answers, and waiting to see the \nfinal agreement.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today the Senate is undertaking an important \ndebate on the India Agreement for Civil Nuclear Cooperation.\n  On July 18, 2005, President Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan \nSingh signed an agreement to resume full civilian nuclear cooperation \nfor the first time since India conducted its initial nuclear test in \n1974. Such an agreement will require changes to U.S. law and \naccommodations with the international community.\n  The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 assures the proper management of \nsource, special nuclear, and byproduct material. Several sections of \nthe AEA are at issue in this agreement, so I would like to take a \nmoment to explain the pertinent provisions.\n  Section 123 of the AEA limits the ability of the United States to \nenter into agreements with nonweapons states unless the agreement meets \na minimum of nine criteria, including a requirement that the recipient \ncountry has in place an agreement with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, IAEA, to safeguard in perpetuity nuclear material, equipment, \nand technology so that it will not be diverted for weapons use. This \ntype of agreement is known as a ``full-scope safeguards'' agreement. A \n123 Agreement is the precursor to any export license for the nuclear \nmaterials, equipment and technology.\n  Section 128 requires that any export license for nuclear materials, \ntechnology or equipment contain a requirement that the recipient \nnonnuclear weapons state maintain IAEA safeguards.\n  Section 129 of the AEA requires that any 123 Agreement or export \nlicense be terminated if the nonnuclear weapons state recipient \ndetonates a nuclear explosive device, terminates, abrogates, or \nviolates IAEA safeguards, or engages in activities that support \ndevelopment of a nuclear explosive device. Section 129 would also \nprohibit entrance into a section 123 Agreement with any nonnuclear \nweapons state that detonated a nuclear explosive device after 1978.\n  S. 3709, the bill we are considering today, establishes a mechanism \nwhereby the President may submit a 123 Agreement for civil nuclear \ncooperation with India, a nonweapons state under the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, to Congress for approval. However, this bill \nwould allow the President to waive certain requirements of section 123, \nsection 128, and portions of section 129, as long as the President \nmakes certain determinations that are set out in the bill.\n  India is the largest democracy in the world. Its economy is growing \nby 8 percent annually. Since the beginning of this century, United \nStates-India relations on issues from trade to defense have been \ngrowing stronger each year. The United States also benefits from a \nlarge Indian-American population. Rhode Island is home to a vibrant \nIndian community who contribute greatly to the State. I believe that \nthe United States should do all that it can to assist India and further \nstrengthen the partnership between the two countries.\n  However, this agreement does raise significant concerns. I believe \nthat proliferation of nuclear material is the greatest threat facing \nour country today. North Korea recently conducted its first nuclear \ntest. Iran seems intent on pursuing a nuclear program. Even efforts to \nreduce the overall size of the U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons \nstockpiles have stalled. While there has been some small progress in \nreducing the number of deployed nuclear warheads there has been no \nprogress in reducing the overall size of the U.S. nuclear weapons \nstockpile. There is great concern, therefore, that this agreement \nstrikes a blow to what remains of the international nuclear \nnonproliferation regime.\n  I, too, would share that concern, if the Senate had adopted the bill \nthe administration proposed. However, I believe that the Foreign \nRelations Committee, under the leadership of Senators Lugar and Biden, \nwho are certainly experts on these matters, have crafted a bill which, \nI believe, has sufficient safeguards. I think that they are trying to \nadapt the nonproliferation regime, not destroy it.\n  First, section 105 of this bill sets out a series of determinations \nthe President must make in writing when he submits the 123 Agreement. I \nbelieve these determinations will both provide a reasonable equivalent \nof full-scope safeguards and address several other concerns with \nrespect to the Indian nuclear program, including concerns that the \nagreement not facilitate or assist the Indian nuclear weapons program. \nFor the most part, the determinations reflect what India has committed \nto do in the July 2005 joint statement.\n  Probably the most important of the determinations in section 105 is \nthe fifth, which states, ``India is working with the United States to \nconclude a multilateral treaty on the cessation of the production of \nfissile materials.'' This determination breathes new life into efforts \nto achieve a Fissile Materials Cutoff Treaty, even driving the United \nStates back to the negotiating table. Determination number 5 is the one \nsingle element in this bill that could prevent further growth in \nIndia's nuclear weapons stockpile and could lead to real reductions. In \naddition, this certification may also work to eliminate the impasse \nbetween India and Pakistan whereby neither wants to be the first to \nadopt a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty.\n  Section 106 of S. 3709 would prohibit the export of equipment, \nmaterials and technologies related to uranium enrichment, spent nuclear \nfuel reprocessing, and the production of heavy water, unless the user \nis a multinational facility participating in IAEA approved reactor fuel \nprogram or the President\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\n``determines that the export or reexport will not improve India's \nability to produce nuclear weapons or fissile material for military \nuses.'' On several occasions administration witnesses clearly stated to \nthe Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. would not provide such \ntechnologies to India. As a result, it is not anticipated that the \npresidential exemption will be used.\n  Section 107 of the bill requires a program, which would include end-\nuse monitoring conditions as appropriate, to maintain accountability \nwith respect to nuclear materials, equipment, and technology sold, \nleased and exported, or re-exported to India. This provision would \nenhance confidence in India's efforts to ensure separation of its \ncivilian and military nuclear programs, facilities, materials and \npersonnel and also further ensure U.S. compliance with Article I of the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  S. 3709 also requires the President to provide the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and the House International Relations Committee \nwith updated information regarding India's compliance with \nnonproliferation commitments. Specifically, it would require the \nPresident to keep these committees informed of any material violation \nof India's nuclear nonproliferation commitments, the construction of \nany nuclear facilities in India, any significant changes in India's \nproduction of nuclear weapons or fissile materials, or changes in the \npurpose or status of India's non-declared facilities. The bill also \nrequires the President to submit an annual report on the implementation \nof civil nuclear commerce, India's compliance with its nonproliferation \ncommitments, and U.S. efforts and progress toward achieving India's \nfull participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative and \nadherence to the guidelines and policies of the Australia Group and the \nWassenaar Arrangement.\n  It is important that this bill would waive section 129 applicability \nfor any actions taken before July 18, 2005. If India detonated a \nnuclear device after the date of enactment the waiver authority would \ncease to be effective and the exports would be prohibited.\n  Another vitally important provision of S. 3709 is that it follows \ncurrent law and requires Congress to have a vote to approve any final \n123 Agreement. The House bill also has an approval process, but it is \nnot clear if that process requires a vote. The administration had \nproposed that a 123 Agreement with India would only require \ncongressional notification and a waiting period.\n  Because of the provisions I have just discussed, I believe I can \nsupport this bill. I would also note that passage of this bill is \nsimply the first step on a long road. If this bill passes the Senate, \nit must be conferenced with the House bill, which has different \nprovisions. If the conference report comes back with the Senate \nprovisions weakened, or absent, I may be obligated to vote against that \nreport.\n  Much more important is the substance of the 123 statement the \nPresident ultimately submits. I understand that this is an attempt to \nadapt the nonproliferation regime to a changing world. I will carefully \nexamine any 123 Agreement to ensure that it adequately addresses vital \nproliferation concerns.\n  But at this first step, I have hope that this agreement will lead to \ngreater cooperation on nonproliferation rather than less. With that \nhope, I will support S. 3709.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here to support the Lugar-Biden \nlegislation that would implement changes in law necessary to secure our \nNation's civil-nuclear agreement with India.\n  This is very important to our future for two reasons: No. 1, India is \none of the great powers of the 21st century, and this agreement \nrepresents an important step toward a new strategic partnership between \nour two countries; and No. 2, nuclear power is a source of clean energy \nthat is good for us, and it is good for India.\n  As we look at the beginning of this new century, we have witnessed \nthe emergence of three great powers or influences in the world--three \nmajor shifts that will help define the many years to come.\n  One is the rise of China. One is the emergence of a new political \nIslam. And the third is the arrival of India as a great power.\n  I asked Secretary Rice about these three new forces shaping the \ncoming century at the Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the United \nStates-India Civil Nuclear Agreement, and she agreed with my \nassessment.\n  And if you look at those three emerging forces, one presents the \ngreatest opportunity for us to be a partner, and that one is India: \nIndia, the largest democracy in the world; India, where English is an \nofficial language; India, where the legal system, like ours, is \ndescended from that of the British; and India, where a diverse ethnic \nand religious population has joined together to form one nation with a \ndemocratic government. India.\n  I was fortunate to travel to India earlier this year with a group of \nSenators led by Senator Enzi. We went to look at what India is doing to \nimprove its economic standing by improving its brainpower through \nbetter education and research and an emphasis on science and \ntechnology. And we saw a country that is rapidly advancing.\n  Both our President and this Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, are \nshowing real vision by recognizing that in this new century there may \nbe no more important two-country relationship than the one between the \nUnited States and India.\n  And we share an important strategic interest: we are facing the same \nsort of energy and environmental issues. India's needs are even more \nacute.\n  When I was there a few months ago, I was told that India hopes to \nbring online 50,000 MW over the next 10 years in order to meet demand.\n  That is an incredible figure. If each power plant has a capacity of \n500 MW, that is 100 new power plants. And they are going to build them \nwith us or without us.\n  The question for us is: What kind of power plants will they build? \nFrom an environmental perspective, the only technology that is ready to \ngo, today, to provide large amounts of reliable power without emitting \nnoxious gases into the air is nuclear power.\n  As new studies are emerging that India's air pollution and China's \nair pollution is also our air pollution because air pollution both \ndeposits locally and moves around the globe and that their greenhouse \ngases cause just as much global warming as our greenhouse gases, then \nit is in our interest for India to build nuclear power plants rather \nthan more dirty coal power plants that emit sulfur and nitrogen and \nmercury and carbon.\n  Seventy-two percent of India's electricity needs are currently \nprovided by coal-burning plants. Gas provides 12 percent; oil, 2 \npercent; nuclear, 3 percent; hydro, 10 percent, and renewables, 1 \npercent.\n  This agreement won't radically shift those numbers overnight, but \neach new nuclear powerplant is a powerplant that is not emitting \nnoxious gases into the air. It is one more powerplant that is not \nputting out sulfur or nitrogen or mercury or even carbon.\n  So, Mr. President, before us is legislation to implement the United \nStates-India Civil Nuclear Agreement. This is not an agreement about \nnuclear weapons--it is about cooperation for nuclear power. This is an \nagreement that puts us on the path to a new strategic partnership with \nIndia--one of the three great rising forces in this new century. And \nthis is an agreement that meets energy needs while being good for the \nenvironment.\n  I am glad that we have taken this matter up in a bipartisan manner \nand look forward to its passage today.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, the Senate has begun debate on S. \n3709, the United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act, \nwhich will help pave the way for our Nation to assist India in \nfulfilling its energy needs. I intend to vote in support of this \nlegislation.\n  The United States and India are bound together by deep mutual respect \nand our common efforts to work towards a democratic, free, and secure \nworld. As cochair of the Senate India Caucus, I have sought to \nstrengthen the ties that bind our two nations.\n  The legislation that emerged from the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee is a significant improvement over the implementing \nlegislation put forward by the administration in March. The \nadministration's initial proposal sought to undercut Congressional \nauthority by asking us to effectively approve an agreement before it\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\nhad even been negotiated with India and before India had reached its \nnuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, IAEA.\n   I carefully followed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's \nconsideration of this agreement. Senator Richard Lugar, the Foreign \nRelations Committee chairman, and Senator Joseph Biden, the Foreign \nRelations Committee ranking member, are to be commended for the \nseriousness with which they exercised their jurisdiction over this \nlegislation. Because of the efforts of Chairman Lugar and Ranking \nMember Biden, the bill before us today is much improved. This \nlegislation not only retains congressional prerogatives, but it also \nensures that Congress will not have to vote to approve a final \nagreement until every single nation in the Nuclear Suppliers Group. \nNSG, the global regime given the charge for ensuring the responsible \ntrade of nuclear technology, has agreed to permit the transfer of \npeaceful nuclear technology to India. By working through the NSG, we \nwill help strengthen both that group, as well as the greater \ninternational nonproliferation regime that is center stage as we \naddress the threats posed by the nuclear weapons programs of Iran and \nNorth Korea.\n  As India continues to grow stronger and to shoulder more of the \nresponsibilities that come with being a leading nation in the world, we \nmust continue to work towards greater cooperation with our Indian \nfriends to deal with our common challenges in security, energy, \neconomics, and health. I hope that this agreement is just one step on \nthat journey that our countries, and our people, are taking together.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in full support of S. 3709. The \npassage of this bill and the ultimate conclusion of the U.S.-India \nnuclear agreement will be instrumental in bringing our countries closer \ntogether after decades of estrangement. This outcome is not just \ndesirable but essential for U.S. national interests.\n  It is hard to overemphasize the importance of India's role in the \nworld today. Not only is India one of the most populous countries and \nfastest growing economies in the world, it is also the world's largest \ndemocracy that has long demonstrated a commitment to pluralism and rule \nof law and a rich intellectual and civilization heritage.\n  I applaud the efforts of both the Clinton and Bush administration in \nstrengthening our ties with India. Their efforts reflect the bipartisan \nspirit with which America extends its hand of friendship to India and \nthe importance that it places in getting this relationship right.\n  The U.S.-India nuclear deal significantly benefits both our \ncountries. It will help India meet its growing energy needs, fueling \nits economic growth and reducing the global demand and cost of fossil \nfuels. It will enhance U.S.-Indian technological and commercial \ncooperation with significant dividends for U.S. companies. And it will \nbolster our strategic partnership with India in Asia and beyond.\n  It also opens the window for greater oversight over India's civil \nnuclear program, drawing an important non-signatory to the \nNonproliferation Treaty into the broader nonproliferation system. This \nis a positive step for the U.S. in controlling the spread of nuclear \nmaterials and weapons and gaining an important ally in that fight.\n  But the flip side of this coin is that we are doing business with a \nnon-nuclear weapon state as defined by the NPT that does not have full-\nscope safeguards.\n  In doing so, the U.S. has overstepped domestic and international non-\nproliferation laws and norms. It has sent a signal that countries can \npursue and test nuclear weapons, as India did in 1998, and wear out \nU.S. opposition. And it may trigger a low-level arms race between India \nand Pakistan as India's uranium reserves are freed up for diversion to \nits weapons program.\n  Moreover, at a time when we are trying to roll back North Korea and \nIran's nuclear program, cutting a deal with India suggests that if you \nare on America's side, you can keep your nuclear weapons. Such double \nstandards are detrimental to America's interests and image.\n  What we ultimately need is not a country-specific approach to civil \nnuclear cooperation but a criteria-specific one. India has agreed to \nmeet some of these criteria but not all. Its nonproliferation record is \ninfinitely better than that of its neighbors, but far from perfect.\n  For now, the bill that is before the Senate carves out an exception \nfor India. As I said earlier, I will vote for this bill because I think \nour relationship with India is critical.\n  It is also important to highlight what should be one vital outgrowth \nof this relationship: halting the global production of fissile material \nthat can be used in a nuclear device.\n  S. 3709 calls for U.S.-Indian cooperation in pursuit of a \nmultilateral fissile material cutoff treaty. However, the reality is \nthat negotiations on such a treaty at the Geneva Conference on \nDisarmament have long been at a standstill due to many factors. These \ninclude linkages that countries have imposed with issues such as the \nmilitarization of space.\n  The proliferation dangers of increased fissile material stockpiles \nare well understood. Yet the current approach has failed to stop \nproduction.\n  That is why the United States needs to sit down with India and the \nother key handful of countries that have produced and are producing \nfissile material, and make a hard push for an interim non-\ndiscriminatory moratorium on fissile material production that is \napplicable to this grouping of states. This moratorium would remain in \neffect pending the entry into force of a multilateral treaty.\n  The advantage of this new format is that it allows for a smaller, \nmore relevant grouping with a singular agenda where the U.S. can \nimmediately introduce proposals it has already drafted for discussion.\n  If we are to seriously address the nuclear challenges we face today, \nwe need to break the deadlock in Geneva, think outside the box and \nfocus on this issue like a laser beam. We simply cannot have countries \nchurning out fissile material because it increases the chances of it \nfalling into the hands of terrorists and the buildup of nuclear \narsenals.\n  In this bill, the Senate calls for the President to make several \ndeterminations on whether India has taken certain steps before we can \nproceed with an agreement. The Senate must also set certain benchmarks \nfor our own government and ensure that it is upholding its \nresponsibilities as a global leader and a nuclear weapon state.\n  I can think of no better way of doing this than calling for fresh and \nmeaningful negotiations on halting fissile material production. Moving \nin this direction will strengthen the U.S.-India nuclear deal and make \nit a catalyst for positive change in the nonproliferation system.\n  In the end, the goal should be a strong U.S. India relationship and a \nnuclear deal that provides momentum toward strengthening the nuclear \nnonproliferation system.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last year President Bush and Indian Prime \nMinister Manmohan Singh ushered in a new era of cooperation between the \nUnited States and India on civilian nuclear energy. President Bush \npromised to seek the necessary changes in U.S. laws and policies to \nallow full cooperation and commerce in this area. In return, Prime \nMinister Singh has committed India to specific steps strengthening its \nadherence to various elements of the global nonproliferation regime. \nThis agreement marks a historic milestone for U.S. relations with \nIndia, one of our most important friends, a natural ally, and a country \nthat can be a close partner on a number of key issues including nuclear \nnonproliferation.\n  The legislation pending before us today is critically important \nbecause it sets the framework for Congress to consider a formal \npeaceful nuclear cooperation agreement with India under section 123 of \nthe Atomic Energy Act. The Foreign Relations Committee passed this bill \nwith strong bipartisan support shortly before the July 4th recess, and \nI hope the full Senate will follow suit. By passing this legislation, \nwe will not only move the United States and India one step closer to \nenergy cooperation but also send a clear message that a strong United \nStates-India relationship is vital to both of our nations.\n  More and more, this bond is built on the bedrock of natural \naffinities--on\n\n[[Page S11027]]\n\nshared interests and shared values. And it is no wonder--our two \ncountries are natural partners. We should be partners in the war on \nterror, in the spread of democracy, in religious tolerance, in \nadvancing technology, and in bringing stability and balance to Asia. In \nthe post-9/11 world, we share interests and we share threats. India \nafter all sees more terror attacks every year than any other country.\n  For a long time, South Asians and Americans have been extremely \nclose--thanks to so many families spilt between the two countries and \nsuch a vibrant Indian-American community here at home. But now at last \nour Governments are finally catching up to our people and bringing our \ncountries together.\n  I have long believed that it is in the interest of the United States \nand India to expand our strategic relationship. In 1994 I took a trade \ndelegation from my home State of Massachusetts to India. It was clear \nto me that Cold War tensions had created a gulf between our nations \nthat didn't serve either country. I believed then that India could and \nshould be a critical American partner in South Asia. My subsequent \ntrips in 1999 and again earlier this year have only reinforced that \nview.\n  With its strategic location in South Asia and its experience in \nmaintaining a stable and religiously diverse democracy--India has \nnearly 150 Muslim citizens--India can be an important partner on a \nrange of issues, from combating the threat of terrorism and \nproliferation to promoting democracy and regional security. Cooperating \non the civilian nuclear front can help move this essential partnership \nforward.\n  I know from my discussions in India this past January with Prime \nMinister Singh and his National Security Adviser that they want our \nhelp in meeting India's energy needs. This is crucial if India is to \ncontinue to expand its economy and increase its stature as a major \nregional and global power. And they see this nuclear initiative, as we \ndo, as an important foundation for our bilateral relationship.\n  And everywhere I went, I kept hearing from political leaders and \nbusinessmen just how important they consider American investment in \nIndia's economic future--and not just in technology. India wants our \nhelp. They see this nuclear initiative as a cornerstone of economic \ndevelopment and sensible energy policy, and I see it as a great chance \nfor our countries to work together.\n  Civil nuclear cooperation is in India's interest, but it is also in \nours. That is why during my trip to India in January I was one of the \nfirst Senators to express my support for the civil nuclear initiative \nin principle. Since then, I have been committed to working with my \ncolleagues to find a way to make this deal work for all our interests. \nI am pleased that we have accomplished that with the legislation \napproved by the committee.\n  Obviously, there are ramifications for our nonproliferation efforts \nbecause for the first time we are agreeing to engage in nuclear \ncooperation with a country that has a nuclear weapons program but is \nnot a party to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty or bound by its \nobligations. We cannot gloss over the fact that this is an \nunprecedented step. But it is not one taken lightly. I am convinced \nthat this exception for India makes sense, despite its real costs, \ngiven India's record as a trustworthy steward of nuclear materials and \ntechnologies.\n  India can be an important ally in our global nonproliferation \nefforts, as demonstrated by their voting with us in the International \nAtomic Energy Agency to try to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. And, of \ncourse, India is critical to any regional effort to cap fissile \nmaterial production. India has made a number of positive commitments \nwith respect to its nuclear program, such as separating its civil and \nmilitary facilities, putting more of its civilian facilities under IAEA \nsafeguards, and working with the United States to achieve a \nmultilateral fissile material cutoff treaty.\n  I believe this bill we are considering today will encourage India to \nfulfill these commitments while still allowing for timely consideration \nby Congress of the bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement--the so-\ncalled section 123 agreement--when it is concluded by Indian and \nAmerican negotiators. As I said when Secretary Rice testified before \nthe committee on this deal in early April, it is critical for us to see \nthe safeguards agreement that India reaches with the IAEA before taking \naction on the section 123 agreement between us and India. This bill \nensures that we will. I am pleased that it includes my language \nclarifying that India's safeguards agreement with the IAEA must provide \nfor safeguards ``in perpetuity,'' as India has said it would.\n  Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican Senator from Michigan, used to say \nthat partisan politics ought to stop at the water's edge. Crafting this \nlegislation was not easy, but I am pleased to say that we have thus far \nmet Vandenberg's challenge. And we must continue to do so.\n  To reach agreement, we had to balance a number of critically \nimportant interests: building a strong and comprehensive relationship \nwith India, furthering our global nonproliferation efforts, and \nprotecting congressional prerogatives to act on nuclear cooperation \nagreements between the United States and other countries. I recognize \nthat there are aspects of this legislation that some on both sides of \nthe debate wish had come out differently, but on the whole, I believe \nthe legislation the committee has sent to the Senate is a good-faith--\nand ultimately successful--effort to meet those needs.\n  One of the most important aspects of the balance in the bill before \nus is the requirement that Congress review the formal peaceful nuclear \ncooperation agreement with India, which must be submitted under section \n123 of the Atomic Energy Act. The bill passed by the House includes \nprocedures which would deny Congress a full right of review. Such an \napproach would undermine the balance we have struck in this bill. I \nbelieve it is essential that the Senate conferees insist upon the \nprocedures in the Senate bill for the consideration of the 123 \nagreement. The Senate bill is a good bill, and our goal should be to \nenact as much of it as possible.\n  We have taken an important step forward for one of our most promising \nand important relationships in the years to come.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor this bill.\n  The proposed agreement will mark a momentous change in U.S. and \nglobal nuclear policy, in my view for the better. It will give India \ndue recognition as a global power, and it will deepen the bilateral \ncommercial and strategic relationship that the United States enjoys \nwith the world's largest democracy.\n  Beyond these commercial and strategic benefits, this deal will bring \nIndia into the mainstream of the global nonproliferation system for the \nfirst time in its nuclear history. This bill includes a number of \nnonproliferation-related provisions, including a requirement that the \nU.S.-India agreement will not enter into force unless and until India \nand the International Atomic Energy Agency negotiate and conclude an \ninspection agreement. It also includes a requirement that the U.S.-\nIndia agreement will not enter into force unless and until India and \nthe IAEA negotiate and conclude a safeguards agreement. Further, it \nrequires that the U.S.-India agreement will not enter into force unless \nand until the Nuclear Suppliers Group reaches consensus on nuclear \ntrade with India and bans U.S. export of uranium enrichment and \nreprocessing technologies under any U.S.-India agreement.\n  This agreement will benefit the economic, strategic, and security \ninterests of the United States, and I offer my strong support for it \nand congratulate my colleagues, Senator Lugar and Senator Biden, for \ncompleting this important legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 3709, the \nUnited States-India, Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act, \nlegislation which will permit the United States to export nuclear \nmaterial to India for peaceful purposes.\n  I applaud President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice for taking this bold, new and welcome approach to America's \nbilateral relations with India. For too long our relations with India \nand Pakistan have resembled a zero-sum game--by helping one nation, we \nhave been perceived as hurting the other.\n\n[[Page S11028]]\n\n  This agreement helps to liberate U.S. policy from this false choice; \nthe United States can and should enjoy positive relations with both \nnations. This bill will broaden and deepen America's emerging strategic \npartnership with India.\n  This legislation is also part of a broader framework for the United \nStates and India to work together on many issues, including energy, \ndefense cooperation, anti-terrorism efforts and the promotion of \ndemocracy. S. 3709 will strengthen the world's security by expanding \nthe reach of international non-proliferation efforts, and will increase \ntransparency about India's civilian nuclear program.\n  In addition, this bill will boost America's energy security by \nhelping India meet its growing energy needs with nuclear power. With a \npopulation over one billion, India has greatly increased the demand for \nenergy, helping to raise energy prices on the world market. The more \npower India can get from other sources, the less Americans will have to \npay for energy here at home.\n  This bill will also foster economic growth in America by opening up \nnew opportunities for American companies to do business in India's \ncivilian nuclear sector. By passing this legislation, my colleagues \nwill help create new jobs for Americans and new markets for American \nfirms.\n  I want to commend my good friend from the neighboring State of \nIndiana, Senator Lugar, for his sponsorship of this bill and his \nsuccessful shepherding of it through the Senate.\n  Mr. President, improving U.S.-Indian ties is long overdue. After all, \nAmerica and India are the worlds two largest democracies. As President \nBush continues to champion the spread of democracy abroad, it is \nentirely fitting that our two countries should continue to strengthen \nour strategic partnership, as a model for the world of what democracies \ncan accomplish when they work together in peace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the unanimous consent order provides for 1 \nminute on each side. I will forego my minute, but I would like to yield \nto the distinguished leader, who is here. He wants to make a comment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just for the information of my colleagues, \nthis will be the last rollcall vote tonight. The plans will be on \nMonday, December 4, to be back in session, and in all likelihood we \nwill not be voting until the late afternoon of December 5. Everybody \nstay posted. We will keep you apprised of the future plans.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we relinquish all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``United States-India \n     Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 102.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``United States Additional \n     Protocol Implementation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) The proliferation of nuclear weapons and other nuclear \n     explosive devices poses a grave threat to the national \n     security of the United States and its vital national \n     interests.\n       (2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has proven \n     critical to limiting such proliferation.\n       (3) For the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be \n     effective, each of the non-nuclear-weapon State Parties must \n     conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA, \n     and such agreements must be honored and enforced.\n       (4) Recent events emphasize the urgency of strengthening \n     the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the \n     safeguards system. This can best be accomplished by providing \n     IAEA inspectors with more information about, and broader \n     access to, nuclear activities within the territory of non-\n     nuclear-weapon State Parties.\n       (5) The proposed scope of such expanded information and \n     access has been negotiated by the member states of the IAEA \n     in the form of a Model Additional Protocol to its existing \n     safeguards agreements, and universal acceptance of Additional \n     Protocols by non-nuclear weapons states is essential to \n     enhancing the effectiveness of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty.\n       (6) On June 12, 1998, the United States, as a nuclear-\n     weapon State Party, signed an Additional Protocol that is \n     based on the Model Additional Protocol, but which also \n     contains measures, consistent with its existing safeguards \n     agreements with its members, that protect the right of the \n     United States to exclude the application of IAEA safeguards \n     to locations and activities with direct national security \n     significance or to locations or information associated with \n     such activities.\n       (7) Implementation of the Additional Protocol in the United \n     States in a manner consistent with United States obligations \n     under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty may encourage \n     other parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, \n     especially non-nuclear-weapon State Parties, to conclude \n     Additional Protocols and thereby strengthen the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty safeguards system and help reduce the \n     threat of nuclear proliferation, which is of direct and \n     substantial benefit to the United States.\n       (8) Implementation of the Additional Protocol by the United \n     States is not required and is completely voluntary given its \n     status as a nuclear-weapon State Party, but the United States \n     has acceded to the Additional Protocol to demonstrate its \n     commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and to \n     make United States civil nuclear activities available to the \n     same IAEA inspections as are applied in the case of non-\n     nuclear-weapon State Parties.\n       (9) In accordance with the national security exclusion \n     contained in Article 1.b of its Additional Protocol, the \n     United States will not allow any inspection activities, nor \n     make any declaration of any information with respect to, \n     locations, information, and activities of direct national \n     security significance to the United States.\n       (10) Implementation of the Additional Protocol will conform \n     to the principles set forth in the letter of April 30, 2002, \n     from the United States Permanent Representative to the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency and the Vienna Office of \n     the United Nations to the Director General of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n     SEC. 203.

S. 3709 is returned to the \ncalendar.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Senate has taken a historic step in \napproving the United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation \nAct. This is critically important. Passage of the bill takes one more \nimportant step toward a vibrant and exciting relationship between our \ntwo great democracies. I thank all Senators for their cooperation in \ncompleting the Senate's consideration in such a short period of time. I \nthank especially Senator Biden for his strong support and cooperation. \nThis has been truly a bipartisan effort from the beginning until final \npassage. We are committed to continuing this effort through the \nconference process.\n  Before yielding the floor, let me publicly thank Tom Moore of the \nmajority staff and Ed Levine of the minority staff. They have become \nexperts on the United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy and \nCooperation Act. They have assisted the committee professionally and \nskillfully in helping craft the bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

I \nthink it is an enormously positive step forward on our relationships.\n  I commend the chairman and ranking member and the leader for bringing \nup this topic. I believe this is going to help us cement the \nrelationship back and forth with us and India. It is important that we \ndo this. It will help environmentally and help energy-wise but, more \nimportantly, I believe it will be a very important strategic \nrelationship. This is a key movement forward. I hope we can move it \nforward through the conference committee. I hope we can get it to the \nPresident in short order and show India and the rest of the world this \nbudding, growing, strengthening relationship back and forth.\n  I commend Chairman Lugar for such insightful and supportive \nleadership on such an important topic.\n  I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my honor and privilege today to \npay tribute to Sergeant First Class Robert Lee ``Bobby'' Hollar, Jr. \nSergeant Hollar served his country as a civilian and soldier and \nultimately gave his life to protect our Nation. Sergeant Hollar served \nin E Troop, 108th Cavalry, 48th Brigade of the Georgia National Guard, \nand was deployed to Iraq in May 2005 in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  On September 1, 2005, an improvised explosive device struck Sergeant \nHollar's vehicle while he was on patrol outside of Baghdad, and he died \nof severe injuries later that day. Sergeant Hollar is survived by his \nwife Amanda and two sons.\n  Throughout Sergeant Hollar's 10 years of courageous service in the \nU.S. Air Force, and during his service in Operations Desert Storm and \nDesert Shield, he was awarded numerous service and achievement medals. \nAlso, Sergeant Hollar was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and the \nBronze Star.\n  Sergeant Hollar's duties in Iraq went beyond the daily routine of a \nsoldier. Sergeant Hollar was a pen pal with the fourth grade class at \nCrescent Middle School in Griffin, GA. To these students, Sergeant \nHollar was a real-life ``G.I. Joe,'' and his letters and visits with \nthem have forever touched their lives.\n  When Sergeant Hollar wasn't on active duty, he lived with his family \nin Thomaston, GA, and was employed by the United States Postal Service \nas a postal carrier.\n  Sergeant Hollar made his community and Nation better through selfless \ndedication to his career in public service with the Georgia National \nGuard and the U.S. Post Office. I have been contacted by many members \nof his community, and I am proud to join in as part of their campaign \nto name the Thomaston Post Office in his honor, and to be an original \ncosponsor of S. 4050, a bill to designate the facility of the Postal \nService located at 103 East Thompson Street in Thomaston, GA, as the \n``Sergeant First Class Robert Lee `Bobby' Hollar, Jr. Post Office \nBuilding''.\n  I believe this is a simple yet lasting, way to recognize Sergeant \nHollar's service and sacrifice to our country.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Chambliss pertaining to the submission of S.

Smykowski\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary young man who gave his life in\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\nservice to our Nation--Marine Sgt Mark T. Smykowski from Mentor, OH. On \nJune 6, 2006, Sergeant Smykowski died when a roadside bomb exploded \nnear his military vehicle in Fallujah, Iraq. He was 23-years-old.\n  Mark was an outstanding marine who had a true sense of compassion for \nothers. He cared deeply for his family and friends, and they remember \nhim as someone who struck a chord with everyone he met. Although Mark \nwas only 23-years-old when he died, he unquestionably lived life to the \nfullest.\n  Mark grew up in Mentor, OH, graduating from Mentor High School in \n2000. He was the oldest member of a group of young Marines known as the \n``Mentor Seven.'' The seven of them were a close and tight-knit group, \nand all but one had skated together on the Mentor High School hockey \nteam. Mark inspired his fellow marines from Mentor, and they in turn \ninspired him.\n  Friend, Brian Halan describes Mark as someone who was simply ``cut \nfrom a different cloth.'' He said:\n\n       I'll always remember that no matter what we were doing, \n     Mark could make the best of anything.\n\n  According to Jack Smeltz, Mark's hockey coach at Mentor High School, \nMark was ``an example of what a young person should be, as far as \nappreciation of freedom and all it stands for.''\n  Mark's father, Bert, recalls that when it came time to get things \ndone, no one was more diligent and focused than Mark. As a marine, he \ntook the toughest assignments--paratrooper school and sniper school. \nAnd, after enlisting for a second time, he began training with a \nreconnaissance unit. Reconnaissance is one of the most difficult jobs \nin the military, involving scout swimming, helicopter and submarine \ninsertion and extraction techniques, and assault climbing. But for \nMark, it was just another challenge--and another opportunity to serve \nhis Nation.\n  Those who knew Mark all agree that he was the model of what a marine \nshould be. Fittingly, that is what he actually became--after boot camp \nhe was selected to be a poster model for the Marines Corps. Naturally, \nhis younger brothers teased him ruthlessly about it.\n  According to his mom, Mark was good looking--and knew it. During a \ncareer fair in high school, Diana saw two Marines recruiters. \n``Couldn't you just see Mark in that uniform?'' she asked her husband, \nKen. Apparently, Mark could because by the time Diana and Ken reached \nthe table, he had already signed up.\n  Mark was so much more, though, than an outstanding marine and a \nhandsome face. His compassion for others was unparalleled. He was \nsimply one of those people who cares deeply and passionately about the \nneeds of those around him. His comrades in Iraq recall the special bond \nhe formed with Iraqis--particularly the Iraqi children. He became \nsomething of an ambassador and would distribute toys and clothes to the \nIraqi children. His unit often joked that when it came time for the \nIraqi elections, it would be Mark's name at the top of the ballot.\n  ``Mark was one of those marines who cared about the impact he had on \nthe people of Iraq,'' said 1LT Craig Q. Reese, Mark's platoon \ncommander. ``I cannot count the number of times when I was with him \nwhen an Iraqi would recognize him from his last deployment and smile. I \nsaw first hand the influence he had on this culture. He was truly \nattempting to make a difference.''\n  Mark's mother Diana has pictures of Mark with his arms around Iraqis, \nand one in which he is surrounded by almost 25 children. But, what she \nrecalls most is a moment that she calls ``life changing.'' Worried \nabout Mark's safety, she had demanded to know ``what the plan is over \nthere?''\n  Mark's reply had been quiet and confident. ``This mission is going to \ntake us years, Mom,'' he'd said. ``These people have been brutalized \nfor years. We have to work with the children. We have to get the kids \nto trust us.''\n  Mark's friends gave him many nicknames--``Tango'' because he was tall \nand gangly and ``Jacks'' because he always wore a jacket of the \nCleveland Lumberjacks, the city's International Hockey League team. \nBut, perhaps the most meaningful name is the one given to him by the \nIraqi children. To them, he was simply ``Mr. Ski.''\n  Throughout his time in Iraq, Mark was undoubtedly supported by his \nstrong sense of faith. The last time Diana spoke with her son, she \nasked him if he were scared, and he said yes. She then asked, ``Mark, \nare you OK with God?'' He replied, ``Mom, you don't have to worry. I'm \ngood to go with God.''\n  Mark will be missed by all who knew him. His friends and family \nrepeatedly describe him as an extraordinary individual, who was so \ndevoted to the Marines Corps. Pastor Tim Davis, speaking at Mark's \nmemorial service, described him as ``a gentleman who loved his country \nand really believed in what he did.''\n  Mark's service to our Nation earned him many awards, such as the Navy \nand Marine Corps Achievement Medal with Combat Distinguishing Device, \nCombat Action Ribbon, and the Meritorious Unit Commendation. But, the \nhighest honor he earned was the respect and admiration of those who \nknew him. Mark's life has truly been an inspiration for others. His \nyounger brother, Darren, a Marine scout sniper, said, ``I always did \neverything he did and went everywhere he went.'' And just this past \nsummer, Mark's younger brother Kenny followed in his footsteps and also \nenlisted in the Marines.\n  Indeed the world is a better place because Mark Smykowski was in it, \nand I am honored that I was able to attend his burial service at \nArlington National Cemetery. He will forever be known for his sincere \ndesire to help others, his willingness to act, and his dedication to \nhis friends, family, community, and country.\n  I conclude with the words of Mark's close friend, Matthew Neath:\n\n       I know if he had to do it all over again, regardless of the \n     outcome, he wouldn't change a thing.\n\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep Mark's family in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n               Private First Class Timothy J. Hines, Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, this evening I rise to remember a brave young man, who \ngave his life in service to our Nation--Army PFC Timothy J. Hines, Jr., \nfrom Fairfield, OH. Private First Class Hines was wounded on June 19, \n2005. He was riding in a military vehicle when a roadside bomb exploded \nnear his convoy in Baghdad, Iraq. Severely injured, he was transferred \nto the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC, for \ntreatment. Tragically, he passed away from his injuries a month later \non July 14, 2005. He was 21 years of age at the time.\n  Growing up in Fairfield, Tim, as he was known by friends and family, \ncame to love two things: basketball and Katy Wessel. He and Katy met \nwhile they were both high school freshmen at Cincinnati Christian \nSchool. Katy's father Jim remembers that when he first met Tim, he \ncould immediately tell that the boy was ``smitten'' with his daughter. \nIn Jim's words, that made Tim ``public enemy number one.''\n  But, that didn't stop Tim. Before long, he and Katy were high school \nsweethearts. And Jim, himself, came to view Tim as a friend and as a \nson.\n  Tim graduated from Cincinnati Christian School in 2002. Headmaster \nWayne Beaver remembers that he was always positive--someone whose \n``classmates all liked him.'' Tim and Katy got married after \ngraduation, and Tim then enlisted in the Army in 2003. He was assigned \nto the 720th Battalion, 89th Military Police Brigade, 64th Military \nPolice Unit, based in Fort Worth, TX.\n  Tim's unit shipped out to Iraq in February 2005. Although he found it \nhard to leave his family and friends, he knew he was doing the right \nthing. According to Katy, ``he knew the obligation he had to his \ncountry.''\n  Indeed, Tim was a soldier devoted to his mission and to our Nation. \nBut, he also joined the Army out of a desire to protect those whom he \nloved. In the words of a sergeant in Tim's unit:\n\n       I knew that I'd come upon a special soldier with great \n     potential, whose character and values were rooted in his love \n     of his family, god, and friends. I believe he wanted to go to \n     Iraq not out of duty, but out of love for others.\n\n  Tim's twin sister, Jenni, remembers that he was a great brother and \nfriend--someone who was always looking out for her. And that is also \nwhat Tim was doing as a soldier--looking out for his friends, his \nfamily, and his country. His service to our country\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\nearned him the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and the Army Good Conduct \nMedal.\n  Those who knew Tim remember him as someone who always wanted to make \nothers laugh. His wife Katy says that he packed a lot of love into his \nlife and simply had a spark that drew people close to him. In photos, \nyou can see he was always smiling or trying to make someone else smile.\n  Tim enjoyed playing basketball. It was a passion he shared with his \nbest friend, Tim Hester. While in Iraq, Tim would e-mail Hester about \nthe one-on-one games they would play when he returned. Hester describes \nTim as someone who was funny, kind, and loving. He said:\n\n       Tim was always making people laugh. He was always joking \n     around. That was one of my favorite parts about Tim. We could \n     always just joke around. But, we also had serious times \n     together. You know, when things were going wrong, we were \n     there for each other.\n\n  Tim's father-in-law says it was a treat to watch Tim with the family \nhe loved so much. He said:\n\n       Timothy James Hines, Jr. was a true hero. He's my hero. His \n     faith in God, his dedication to his family, his love of life, \n     his courage and strength, and his service to his country have \n     profoundly and forever impacted me.\n\n  Even in Tim's darkest hour, he was thinking of his family first. His \nmother-in-law Kathi tells the story of when Tim was wounded in Iraq:\n\n       A buddy who stayed with him while they waited for help said \n     all he talked about was [his wife] Katy, [his 2 year-old \n     daughter] Lily, and the coming baby. He's very devoted to his \n     family. He's the kind of young man any mother would want her \n     daughter to marry.\n\n  Tragically, Tim died before the birth of his son, Noah.\n  As Ohioans have done so often in the past, the community has rallied \naround Tim's family, offering comfort and support. More than 400 \nmourners attended his funeral to pay their respects to this fallen \nsoldier. And an anonymous donor gave a full scholarship to Cincinnati \nChristian School, Tim and Katy's alma mater, for the education of their \nchildren.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues the words of Army BG Patrick \nO'Reilly, who spoke at Tim's funeral. This is what he said:\n\n       It's soldiers like Timothy Hines who serve and guard our \n     way of life. But, it's not just the soldier who pays the \n     price for freedom. The families also give so much, and you \n     too have sacrificed.\n\n  I would also like to share what Tim's wife Katy has said about her \nhusband--truly the love of her life:\n\n       Tim was a fighter. He fought hard for his country, family, \n     and ultimately, his life. He was a loyal husband and father \n     and an incredible American. There is a price for freedom, and \n     Tim paid the ultimate price. Now he is in the loving arms of \n     God.\n\n  I am honored that I had the opportunity to attend Tim's funeral, \nwhere his family and friends talked about his warmth, his humor, and \nhis desire to protect those he loved. He was a man we all aspire to \nbe--someone devoted to his family, his community, and his country. My \nwife Fran and I will continue to keep his family in our thoughts and in \nour prayers.\n\n\n                 Lance Corporal William Brett Wightman\n\n  Mr. President, this evening I rise to honor a fallen hero who gave \nhis life during Operation Iraqi Freedom--LCpl William Brett Wightman, \nfrom Sabina, OH. He died on August 3, 2005, when a roadside bomb \nexploded under his military vehicle in Iraq. He was 22 years of age at \nthe time.\n  Brett--as he was called by family and friends--was a true example of \nwhat it means to be a ``hometown hero.'' Sabina is a small village in \nClinton County, OH, not too far from my home. The high school Brett \nattended--East Clinton High School--is carved out of surrounding \nfields, fields of farmland. Brett will never be forgotten there. He was \nprom king, a star on the basketball and track and field teams, and \ncaptain of the school's football team, the Astros. He played fullback. \nHe wore No. 44.\n  Everyone who knew Brett agrees that he died doing what he wanted to \ndo--serving our Nation. Becoming a member of the military had been his \ndream ever since he was a little boy. Brett's aunt Missy said that \nBrett ``would play with those G.I. Joes and he'd say `I'm going to grow \nup and be one of those guys.' All of his life, that's all he would talk \nabout.''\n  Brett joined the Marines while he was still a junior in high school--\nyoung enough that he needed his parents to come with him to enlist and \ngive their permission. The Reserves unit Brett served with was Lima \nCompany--Marine Force Reserve's 3rd Battalion, 25th Marine Regiment, \n4th Marine Division, based in Columbus, OH. Their story, of course, is \none that I have talked about on this Senate floor before and one that \nhas touched hearts in Ohio and all across our country. On the day Brett \ndied, 13 other men in his unit died alongside him. It was a tragedy \nfelt by the entire State, and by our Nation.\n  Family members said Brett was proud of being a marine and was \nplanning to reenlist. His goal was to rise to the very top of the \nservice. As his stepsister Stephanie Finley said:\n\n       When I talked to him a month ago, he said he loved what he \n     was doing. He said he would go back if he had to.\n\n  According to his mother, Pam, she received a letter from her son that \nshe will cherish forever. In it, he described finding a child while \nsearching Iraqi houses for material to make improvised explosive \ndevices. The child was chained to the wall, and it was Brett and his \nfellow marines who rescued him. It was a day of the utmost importance \nfor Brett, and this is how he described it:\n\n       One of the kids was chained up to a wall by his ankle with \n     a dead lock. He looked like he had been there for months. If \n     anyone tells you we shouldn't be over here they should have \n     seen how happy this kid was when I cut him loose.\n\n  After signing his letter, Brett wrote ``P.S.--Hang in there.'' This \nwas typical of Brett, according to his family. Even while serving his \ncountry overseas, he was more concerned about others than himself. \nBrett's friends and former teammates describe him as a person who would \ndo anything for you. His stepsister Stephanie said:\n\n       It didn't take Iraq for him to be a hero to me. He'll \n     always be my hero.\n\n  Brett was committed to the Corps and the other marines in his unit. \nWhile serving in Iraq, he received the news that his grandmother had \npassed away. Although deeply saddened, Brett wrote that he would have \nto wait to take the time to grieve. In his words, he had ``to watch out \nfor my Marines.'' According to his mother, this letter encapsulated \neverything that Brett was about. ``He would do anything for anybody at \nany time,'' she said.\n  Brett's father, Keith, agreed:\n\n       Things like that just make you feel that your child has \n     grown up to be responsible,'' he said. ``He did what he had \n     to do. Not many kids his age take on the responsibilities of \n     the world. Every man and woman in the service is taking that \n     on.\n\n  Brett's Aunt Missy said that Brett's life ``was just beginning, with \na lot of ambition and a lot of hope. Unfortunately, it's been cut short \n. . . [but] we know that he [was] happy, doing what he wanted to do all \nhis life.''\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, Brett's death was truly a \nloss for the entire Sabina community, the entire Clinton County \ncommunity. In a local bar named The Crow Bar, a lone can of beer stands \non a shelf. ``This beer is for Brett,'' reads an attached sign.\n  Before his Reserve unit was activated, Brett was working as a \ncarpenter for a local home construction company. He was close to his \ncoworkers, one of whom was a fan of Michigan-Ohio State's football \nteam. Before a Michigan/Ohio State game, Brett made a bet with him that \nthe Buckeyes would win. They did win, and Brett enjoyed his winnings--\nthe privilege of frying his friend's Michigan shirt on the grill.\n  Barb Howard is the mother of one of Brett's hometown friends. She \nremembers Brett and other neighborhood youngsters lounging around her \nhouse after their pee-wee sports games, eating food and watching \nmovies. This group of boys remained friends while playing high school \nsports, and Brett became like a son to her. ``It's like a piece of you \nis gone,'' Barb reflected.\n  Justin Stewart plays football for the Astros. He said he had admired \nBrett ever since the third grade, when the older Brett would help him \nwith his pee-wee football drills. ``I am proud of him,'' Justin said. \n``I am just happy he was over there fighting.''\n  As captain of the East Clinton football team, Brett was more than a \nsupportive teammate--he was a leader\n\n[[Page S11037]]\n\nwith responsibility. This focus on teamwork and this commitment to \nhelping others explain Brett's desire to become a marine, and also \nexplains what kind of marine he became.\n  Brett's funeral was on the football field at East Clinton High \nSchool, and over 1,000 mourners attended to salute the young \nmarine. Rev. Carey Hilterbran, who had known Brett since he was a boy, \nassured the crowd that it was not a day for sorrow--Brett had died \nliving his dream. ``[Brett] wasn't afraid,'' he said. ``He had a good \nmindset, and he knew what he wanted to do.'' While Reverend Hilterbran \nwas speaking, the members of the Astros football team--wearing their \nred and white jerseys--stood silently at attention.\n\n  Schuyler Streber was one of Brett's football teammates. In his words, \nthe world is going to be a lesser place without Brett Wightman in it. \nStanding on the East Clinton football field, Schuyler said that \n``sometimes you want to laugh because of some of the things we did out \nhere together, and [sometimes] you want to cry because of the more \nemotional times. And to think I'm here right now and he's not--that's \nsomething that's hard to face. . . . We'll all miss him very much.''\n  Duane Richard is a young artist who did not personally know Brett \nWightman. But he was so moved by the young Marine's sacrifice that he \npainted a 30-foot-wide mural of Brett on the side of Duane's parents' \nbarn. He lined the image with 13 American flags--one for each of the \nLima Marines killed during the roadside bombing. The barn is along Snow \nHill road in Sabina, and people stop everyday to gaze at the mural and \ntake pictures.\n  The artwork reflects Brett's honor and courage, as well as the great \nrespect that his fellow Americans have for his sacrifice. In Duane's \nwords, Brett was a ``true American hero.''\n  Brett Wightman put his life on the line to preserve the freedoms that \nwe Americans hold dear. He cherished hometown values and the importance \nof helping those around him. His family and friends will never forget \nhim. ``Brett will never be in the past,'' as his mother Pam so \nbeautifully said.\n  Indeed, Brett will never be forgotten. My wife, Fran, and I continue \nto keep Brett and his family in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, those were three of the most beautiful \ntributes I have heard any of our colleagues give about the men and \nwomen who have died in service to this country. It was truly a \ntestament to the strength of the Senator from Ohio, his caring and \ncompassion for the people of Ohio that he and his team would take the \ntime to compile such beautiful memories of these three young men and to \nshare them with us in the Congressional Record as he did. I thank him \nfor those beautiful tributes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11037-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ROYALTY RELIEF\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to speak about amendment No. 5189 \nthat is pending to the Agriculture Appropriations bill.\n  According to the unanimous consent agreement entered into a few \nmoments ago, when we return in December we will take up an amendment by \nSenator Conrad and I will have time after that amendment to speak again \nabout this issue. It is an issue that I believe we have an opportunity \nto resolve before this Congress comes to an end. According to the \nschedule we are operating under, we only have a few more weeks to get \nour work done. There is a great deal of work that has to be done and a \nfew things that can in fact be done on a bipartisan basis. This is one \nof them.\n  Both leaders have expressed their commitment to helping the Senate \nresolve the issue of expanded offshore drilling so we can provide more \noil and gas for a country that is running short.\n  Four States--Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama, America's \nenergy coast--have been proudly hosting this industry for over 60 \nyears. We have contributed literally billions of barrels of oil, \ntrillions of cubic feet of gas, and much money from the royalties paid \nhas gone to the Treasury. But this is a problem we have to solve. It \ngoes back to the 1998-1999 lease arrangements entered into by Minerals \nManagement. This has been widely reported. It has also been the subject \nof several hearings in the Senate and the House.\n  Very simply, the Department made a series of mistakes. Those mistakes \nare being looked at to determine how and when and under what \ncircumstances. But the fact is, although all the facts are not out yet, \nwe do know that a serious mistake was made. When these contracts were \nentered into, there was no price threshold in them. When my predecessor \nBennett Johnston wrote the Royalty Relief Act, which he did with some \nof his colleagues, it was always intended to be an incentive if the \nprice of oil was low. At the time the bill was written, the price of \noil was $17 a barrel. We wish that were true today. But it was true \nback in the early to mid-1980s, when this bill was written.\n  As the process went on and these leases were entered into, the price \nthreshold was left out. So now the price of oil is $70 a barrel, or it \nhas been recently, and what happened was, because the thresholds were \nnot in there, the companies didn't have to pay royalties. The bottom \nline is, we have lost to date $1.3 billion. It is estimated that we \ncould lose as much as $10 to $12 billion; that is, the Federal \nTreasury.\n  My amendment has already been filed. If the Senate agrees to the \namendment, it will fix that situation without violating contracts. We \nhave established a way for Minerals Management to basically renegotiate \nthe contracts. The taxpayers could then recover that money, and a \nportion of the money would then be used for the coastal restoration \nefforts so desperately needed in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nAlabama in the next few years. If this amendment is passed, coupled \nwith the bill we have already passed, we will have some immediate \nfunding to begin the project of saving our wetlands and securing the \nenergy infrastructure that is a tremendous asset to the Nation. This \nisn't just about helping Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. \nThis is about protecting a great coastal wetland that came under \ntremendous challenge with Katrina and Rita and will come under \nchallenges again. We most certainly can recover this money, $11 \nbillion, that does belong to the taxpayer. It was a mistake, a very bad \nmistake that was made. We can recover some of that money and most of it \ncan go to deficit reduction. If anyone hasn't noticed lately, we have \nquite a deficit to tackle. Some of this money could go to deficit \nreduction, and some of it could go to the States under a program \nalready authorized, already supported in a bipartisan way, already in \nthe law, called the OCS Program where this money would be directed.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing me to speak tonight. I have filed \nthe amendment so Members could consider it on our break through the \nholiday and come back and try to restore this money to the Treasury, \nhelp take the deficit down, and let's get started saving these wetlands \nand protecting the coast which is so vital to the economic future of \nthe Nation.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I hope the people of \nher home State are watching carefully. Senator Landrieu, even before \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, worked very hard for her State. But since \nthen, it has been nonstop. She is not the only one. There are many \nelected officials who are doing everything they can to help the \nfamilies and businesses and others who were devastated. But I commend \nher to be here so late at night speaking up for her State again. I hope \nshe is successful with her amendment which would bring resources to her \nState that are badly needed as post-Katrina construction continues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11037-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11037-S11038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR MIKE DeWINE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a few moments ago, our colleague from the \nState of Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine, gave tribute to three Ohioans who \nlost their lives in Iraq. I listened to these carefully and I hope \nothers did as well. They were beautiful life stories, beautifully \nwritten, beautifully spoken by\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\nthe Senator. I went up to him afterwards and asked him how many Ohioans \nhad lost their lives in Iraq. He said the number was 140. He has given \n90 tributes on the floor and hopes before he leaves the Senate in a few \nweeks to finish the last 50. He is determined to get it done as a \ntribute to these families. He said: It is about all we can do, isn't \nit? He is right. It says a lot about Mike DeWine, a lot that many of us \nalready knew.\n  I came to Congress with Mike in 1982. I recall we were both elected \nto the House of Representatives. I was from the central part of \nIllinois and he was from Ohio. We had a dinner at the White House. I \nrecall that his wife Fran, who had just had a baby a few days before, \ncame in her beautiful gown with her husband Mike in a tuxedo, carrying \na basket with their baby in it. They sat down next to Loretta and \nmyself for dinner with President Reagan that night. I have joked about \nthat because I met that little girl recently. She has grown up now, and \nwe remembered the first time we ever laid eyes on her.\n  Mike and I have worked on so many things--the global AIDS epidemic. \nHe has been my go-to guy on the Republican side of the aisle. When I \nhad absolutely given up any hope of passing legislation for hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to save hundreds of millions of lives, Mike managed \nto help out in many different ways.\n  He invited me once to travel to Haiti with him. Haiti is a DeWine \nfamily project. Mike and Fran have made over 15 trips to that poor \nisland and have met with so many people there in orphanages and on \nstreets trying to help them. There is a little school in Port-au-\nPrince, the Becky DeWine school, named after Mike and Fran's late \ndaughter. They have poured more love and resources into that school for \nsome of the poorest kids on this planet than we could ever count. They \nworked together with Father Tom of Hands Together and so many other \ngreat charities that have done such work.\n  As I listened to Mike tonight give his tributes to these Ohio \nsoldiers, I was reminded what a quality individual he is. Elections \ncome and go. People win and people lose. But the quality of Mike \nDeWine's service to the Senate on behalf of the people of Ohio is \nwritten large in the history of this institution.\n  I thank him for his friendship and for his leadership. I wish him, \nFran, and the entire family the very best in whatever their future \nendeavors might entail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11038-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR PAUL WELLSTONE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a few moments there will be a number of \nresolutions offered on the floor of the Senate on a variety of \ndifferent issues. Some of them have been spoken to. A resolution which \nI have offered is related to the fact that we are in the fourth year of \nan anniversary of the death of our colleague Senator Paul Wellstone of \nMinnesota.\n  I look back on a career of service in the House and Senate and \nremember a handful of very special people who passed on or left this \ninstitution. One of those was Paul Wellstone. What an extraordinary \nfellow. The most unlikely Senator you would ever see. He just didn't \nlook the part at all. Maybe that is why he did so well in Minnesota and \nwas so effective here. He was cut from a different mold. He used to sit \nback here in the last row, and he would stand and speak. He would stand \nin the middle of the aisle as he spoke and would kind of saunter \naround. He had a back injury from wrestling. He loved wrestling; not \nthe kind you see on television but real collegiate wrestling. His \ninvolvement in wrestling cost him some back injuries that haunted him \nhis entire life. So he would walk with a kind of a cantered gait as he \nwent back and forth on the aisle and all around the Senate.\n  But people didn't remember that part. They remembered what he had to \nsay and they remembered what was in his heart. Paul Wellstone used to \nsay that he thought there were two necessary ingredients for success in \npublic service. One was hard work; the other was passion. He had both \nof them. Nobody worked harder for everything he believed in and for his \nState of Minnesota, and nobody came to these issues with more passion.\n\n  I can recall the last time I saw him. He was a few feet away from me \nhere. It was the night we cast our vote on the Iraqi war. It was a vote \nthat was a hard one. Nobody cared for Saddam Hussein. Nobody wanted to \nsee him continue in power. We certainly wanted to protect our country. \nBut there were genuine concerns felt by many of us as to whether we \nreally understood what lie ahead in that war, the threat to the United \nStates, and whether we were being told everything we needed to know.\n  Twenty-three of us voted against the war that night. I was one, Paul \nWellstone was another. It was even later than now that night, and I \ncame to the well on the floor to say goodbye to Paul because we were \nboth off for the reelection campaigns of 4 years ago. I came over to \nwish him well, and I said, ``Paul, I hope that vote doesn't cost you \nthe election.'' He said, ``You know, it is OK if it does because that \nis what I believe and that is who I am. The people of Minnesota would \nexpect nothing less from me.'' It was the last time I ever saw him. He \nwent home, and within 2 weeks he was killed in a plane crash with his \nwife and staff members.\n  I went up to the memorial service for Paul. There was an amazing \nturnout at the University of Minnesota in tribute to this small-in-\nstature but great-in-service Senator from Minnesota. The one thing that \nhe returned to over and over again was the issue of fairness and equal \ntreatment for those suffering from mental illness. Paul's family had \nbeen stricken with mental illness, and hardly any family in America has \nbeen spared. He knew firsthand what it meant to suffer from mental \nillness and not be able to afford a doctor's care or the medicine \nneeded by people who are suffering from it. He worked with Senator \nDomenici from New Mexico, a Republican, on passage of legislation for \nequal treatment under health insurance for those suffering from mental \nillness.\n  The Surgeon General determined in a 1999 report that mental illness \nis largely biologically based and effective treatments exist. It is a \ndisease that can be treated. In 1996, Senators Domenici and Wellstone \nchampioned a bill requiring insurers to offer mental health care and to \noffer comparable benefit caps for mental health and physical health. \nBut there was a big loophole in the bill, and they knew it. The bill \ndidn't require group health plans to include mental health coverage as \na benefit. Even with the 1996 law in place and 22 States mandating full \nparity, mental health services continued to be subject to higher \nlimitations than other health treatments.\n  The parity law in place that I referred to expires at the end of this \nyear. I hoped 4 years ago, when we were caught up in the emotions of \nPaul's death, that we would come back and pass legislation that he \ncalled for and worked for with Senator Domenici. Four years have passed \nand it hasn't happened. Many people continue to suffer, continue to go \nwithout the basic care they need.\n  Resolutions come and go, and very few people pay much attention to \nthem. I don't think this will be a lead line in any newspaper in \nAmerica, but the purpose of this resolution is to put the Senate on \nnotice that it has been the fourth anniversary of the death of a man we \nloved in the Senate, Paul Wellstone, and also to urge us to remember \nhis mission in the Senate when it came to mental health. The purpose \nclause of this resolution reads:\n\n       Congress should act to end discrimination against citizens \n     of the United States who live with a mental illness by \n     enacting legislation to provide for the coverage of mental \n     health benefits with respect to health insurance coverage.\n\n  I would like the language to be stronger, but I understand this was \nthe best we could do this evening. We can prove that Paul Wellstone was \nright and that we care about his legacy by enacting this legislation \nwhen we return. I will be working with Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, \nand all of my colleagues to do our best to make sure that does occur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11038-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11038-S11040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight because during \nthe break, I sat and watched ``60 Minutes'' with my wife one evening. \nDuring the\n\n[[Page S11039]]\n\ncourse of the program, there was a segment on the horrible situation \nthat is now occurring in Darfur in the nation of Sudan on the continent \nof Africa. I have been blessed and lucky to visit Africa several times. \nI am drawn back every time I leave. I think I have to get back there; \nthere is so much more I need to see. I don't know whether it is that it \nis the cradle of civilization and that is where the first remnants of \nearly human life have been found, but Africa draws you back to those \nroots and origins.\n  The last time, I took a trip with Senator Brownback of Kansas. We \nwent to Rwanda, which, of course, is a country that conjures \nimmediately an image of horrible death and suffering. Over 10 years \nago, genocide occurred in Rwanda. We look back now on the deaths of \nhundreds of thousands of innocent people and realize that the United \nStates basically stood by idly and watched that occur. President Bill \nClinton was in office at the time and was urged by many Members of \nCongress, including my predecessor, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, to \nsend some type of military force to try to stop the killing.\n  When we visited Rwanda, Senator Brownback and I stayed in the now \nfamous Rwanda Hotel, known as Des Mille Collines, which means a \nthousand hills. It is in the city of Kigali in Rwanda. As we stayed \nthere and I saw this hotel, having seen the movie, I was haunted by the \nimages of that movie, how that hotel had become a refuge during the \ngenocide and people streamed in from all over Rwanda because they \nknew this hotel manager was doing his best to protect them. They were \ndrinking water, after the regular supplies were cut off, out of the \nswimming pool because it was the only place to turn. As I looked down \nat the pool, I could not imagine people scrambling along the edges of \nthe pool to find water for themselves and their children. As you walked \nthrough the halls, you thought of the people huddling there and praying \nthey would not be beaten or macheted to death at any given moment.\n\n  Down the hill from the hotel is a Catholic church--a red brick \nchurch, simple and plain. I went in there early in the morning and \nlooked inside as those who were waiting for mass gathered. I thought: \nThis is an interesting gathering place at 6 a.m. I went back to the \nhotel and asked about it. It turns out that 1,200 people were killed in \nthat church. They were seeking asylum and refuge in the church, and the \npeople who were determined to kill them came in and hacked them to \ndeath on the stones of the very church I visited. That was 10 years \nago. We did nothing. We could not even bring ourselves in America to \nuse the word ``genocide'' to describe what was going on.\n  I think President Clinton would be the first to admit that this is \none of the chapters of his Presidency that he is not proud to recount. \nHe has personally gone there to apologize that the United States didn't \ndo more.\n  Mr. President, let's fast-forward to today. Today is not Rwanda. \nToday it is Darfur. I come to the floor today to talk about the ongoing \ntragedy in Darfur, Sudan, and to report that amidst all of the sad \ncomments about what is happening there, a ray of hope broke through \ntoday.\n  Darfur is in a distant corner of the world, but it is familiar to \nmillions of us in America. It has come home to many of us through news \nstories and photos about women being brutalized, families murdered, and \nvillages being burned. The violence has gone on for over 3 years.\n  The U.N. news service reports from yesterday describe more attacks by \nthe jingaweit militia in south Darfur. More villages were burned and \nmore crops were destroyed. The U.N. news reports describe how \nhumanitarian personnel in west Darfur had to be evacuated because of \ngrowing threats to their safety. And violence in Darfur has spread to \nneighboring eastern Chad and the Central African Republic. At least \n200,000 people have died. More than 2 million people have been \ndisplaced from their homes. Today, 4.5 million people are at risk in \nDarfur and eastern Chad. Hundreds of thousands are in desperate need \nbut beyond the reach of humanitarian organizations. As I said, this has \ngone on for more than 3 years.\n  Last May, the Sudanese Government signed a peace agreement with one \nof the major rebel groups that it had been battling, but violence since \nthen has only increased. In that agreement, the Khartoum Government \npromised to disarm the jingaweit, which have terrorized Darfur. Instead \nof disarming them, the Government in Khartoum is remobilizing and \nrearming the militias. They have even given these militiamen, who were \nkilling and burning and raping and pillaging, uniforms to wear.\n  On November 5, a reporter for Reuters news organization described the \nimpact of this remobilization of the militia:\n\n       Arab militias on horses and camels wearing pristine \n     uniforms and carrying brand new guns attacked three villages, \n     killing dozens, mostly children. One witness told the \n     reporter, ``They took the babies and children from their \n     mother's arms, beat the women and shot the children. . . .'' \n     And they said to the mothers, ``We are killing your sons and \n     when you have more, we will come and kill them, too.''\n\n  The U.N. Security Council has passed resolutions condemning the \nviolence and authorizing a U.N. peacekeeping mission of more than \n20,000 troops. But the Government of Sudan has refused to allow the \npeacekeepers in the country. Presently, there are 7,000 African Union \nmonitors in Darfur, but they are outnumbered by Sudanese forces by 200 \nto 1. The African Union forces do not have the mandate or the means to \nprotect people, although some commanders have tried to make a \ndifference in their local areas.\n  Rwandan peacekeepers have been among the most effective in Darfur. \nMaybe the memory of their own genocide brings them to this mission of \nmercy. They are also among the most frustrated that they cannot do more \nand the world refuses to engage.\n  Twelve years ago, Canadian General Romeo Dallaire was a U.N. \ncommander stationed in Rwanda during the genocide I have described. He \nbegged for more troops from all over the world. He begged for more \nammunition. He begged for the authority to stop the killing in Rwanda. \nHe was ignored. He got nothing. Hundreds of thousands of people died \nneedlessly. He managed to save some, but for the most part he could \nonly stand helplessly watching as a witness to the slaughter.\n  Today, Rwandan peacekeepers lack the means and the authority to stop \nanother genocide. Like Dallaire, they need the world to act. What is \nneeded is a much larger, more robust peacekeeping force, and it is \nneeded urgently right now.\n  Eric Reeves, a professor of literature who has become the unofficial \nchronicler and probably the foremost expert on the genocide in Darfur, \nwrites:\n\n       The people of Darfur have been abandoned. Given how clearly \n     and predictably genocidal events have unfolded over most of \n     the past three and a half years, this failure now exceeds in \n     all too many ways the shameful international acquiescence \n     before the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.\n\n  Those are the words of Mr. Reeves.\n  U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan today convened a high-level meeting \nin Ethiopia to find a way beyond this impasse and to finally break \nthrough with help for these people. U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan, Andrew \nNatsios, is there. So are representatives from the other permanent \nmembers of the Security Council, the Arab League, and the European \nUnion. The Sudanese Government is also officially attending. They are \nthere to find a way to get peacekeepers on the ground in Sudan in a \nsection of that country as large as the State of Texas.\n  Whether the peacekeepers come under the U.N. title or through some \nother combination with the African Union, they are desperately needed. \nThe title doesn't mean much; it is the mission that counts. It must be \nlarge enough, well equipped enough, and with the mandate and authority \nto protect the people of Darfur.\n  The latest news reports indicate that they may have made progress in \ntheir meeting, and we pray to God they did. Kofi Annan announced today \nthat Sudan has accepted in principle a United Nations-African Union \nmission in Darfur, but there has been no agreement as to the number of \ntroops that will be accepted and deployed.\n  I hope this is truly a breakthrough and not more empty rhetoric from \nthe Government of Sudan.\n  Today's news reports are full of new killings in Darfur. The Darfur \npeacekeeping force must have the capability, the numbers, and the \nauthority\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\nto preempt, prevent, deter, and respond to attacks on civilians and to \nprotect the camps of those who have been displaced. There must be a \nclear timetable to make this happen, and it must start now. The \nviolence in Darfur has spilled beyond its borders. Villages in Chad are \nburning.\n  For too long the world has done too little. I hope today's reports \nrepresent a breakthrough that Sudan will, indeed, accept the \npeacekeeping mission that is so badly needed in Darfur.\n  Mr. President, we never know if any word spoken on the floor of the \nSenate or even heard or noticed will make a difference. I guess the \npurpose of my speech this evening is for my own satisfaction. I sat \nthere with my wife, and we watched that ``60 Minutes'' program about \nthese helpless people who are the victims of this genocide in Darfur, \nand she turned to me and said: Isn't there something you can do?\n  Well, I gave a speech. I wish I could do more. I wish I had the power \nof the President. I wish I had the power of the United Nations. I wish \nI had the power to send the troops to protect these poor people. But \nwhen the record is written of this time, I hope it is written that at \nleast we spoke up, at least we spoke the word ``genocide,'' a word we \nwere even afraid to mouth during the Rwandan crisis.\n  We know what is happening. In just a few short days, many of us will \nbe sitting around with our families giving thanks for all the blessings \nwe have in this great country, and we have so many: our wealth, our \nprosperity, our happiness, our families. I hope for a moment that the \npeople of this country will reflect on the less fortunate and remember \nthis tiny country, Sudan, and this great continent of Africa that is \nnow sadly the site of the first serious genocide of the 21st century. \nWe need to do so much more.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise before you today to honor a \ngreat humanitarian and fellow Kentuckian, Eula Hall.\n  Over 30 years ago Ms. Hall opened a medical clinic in Pike County, \nKY, at a time when very few people had medical insurance. Such is her \ndedication to the people of eastern Kentucky she soon gave up her home \nto house the expanding clinic, moving herself and her young family into \nmuch smaller housing.\n  At 78 years old Ms. Hall continues to work in the clinic every day, \nusually starting at 8 in the morning and going late into the evening.\n  Recently the Kentucky General Assembly passed a resolution to rename \nKentucky highway 979 the Eula Hall Highway. On October 24, 2006 The \nPike County News Express profiled Eula Hall and her accomplishments and \nsacrifices for the people of Kentucky.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the \nRecord and that the entire Senate join me in paying respect to this \nbeloved Kentuckian.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n           [From the Pike County News Express, Oct. 24, 2006]\n\n      KY 979 Through Mud Creek To Be Renamed ``Eula Hall Highway''\n\n       Friday, October 27, at 1:30 in the afternoon, friends and \n     colleagues of Eula Hall are invited to gather at the Mud \n     Creek Clinic on KY 979 at Grethel to celebrate the life and \n     accomplishments of a brave mountain woman. As a result of a \n     resolution passed unanimously by the Kentucky General \n     Assembly the entire road KY 979 from Harold to Hi Hat--will \n     be re-named Eula Hall Highway. The resolution was introduced \n     by State Rep. Chuck Meade and State Senator Johnny Ray \n     Turner.\n       For the past 40 years, Eula Hall had probably traveled Mud \n     Creek--Kentucky Route 979--more than anyone else. She was a \n     woman with a mission to bring quality health care to people \n     who had no medical insurance and not enough money to pay for \n     things like visits to the doctor, shots, prescription \n     medicine, much less surgery, physical therapy, and other more \n     expensive treatments and procedures. She's made it her life's \n     work to make sure that no one within her reach goes without \n     the basic health care they need to live full productive \n     lives.\n       And now that road where it all started, the two-lane state \n     highway that runs through Mud Creek from Harold to Hi Hat, \n     will be renamed Eula Hall highway in honor of the woman who \n     brought hope and healing to thousands. ``She had little \n     education. She had no financial resources of her own. She had \n     five children to raise by herself. By all accounts her life \n     should have barely been noticed outside of the family and \n     close friends,'' said Sara George, Information Officer for \n     Highway District 12. ``But if you think like that, you don't \n     think like Eula Hall. She never met a problem she couldn't \n     face head on, never met a person she couldn't relate to, and \n     never took `no' for an answer when it came to the health and \n     well being of the people of her neck of the woods. She is \n     humble, yet tough; gracious yet tenacious; and she is \n     probably the most revered, respected, and loved person in Mud \n     Creek, and rightly so.''\n       Eula looks at her life from a practical viewpoint. \n     ``Nothing won't happen if you sit back and watch the \n     suffering of other people.'' It's a simple motto and one that \n     she lives by.\n       More than 30 years ago, Hall opened the Mud Creek Clinic in \n     Floyd County to serve the needs of people without health \n     insurance or money to pay their doctors' bills. ``I seen so \n     much suffering, since I was a little girl. There was no \n     affordable health care at all for people without health \n     insurance, people without money. We just stayed home, sick or \n     whatever. People died for lack of a tetanus shot or \n     something,'' she told the Courier Journal last year.\n       The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet's Executive Director \n     for Highway District 12, Danl Hall, will emcee a ceremony \n     that will feature speakers such as Senator Turner, Rep. \n     Meade, Social Security Administration Area District Manager \n     Jim Kelly and Big Sandy Health Care CEO Ancil Lewis. U.S. \n     Congressman Hal Rogers will be represented by Tonya Conn.\n       Born in Greasy Creek in Pike County, Eula didn't start \n     school until she was nine years old. She remembers crying on \n     her last day of the eighth grade because she knew she \n     couldn't continue her education. The closest high school was \n     about 20 miles away, and there was no school bus that came \n     that far out in the county. She had six brothers and sisters; \n     her parents didn't have a car; and as farm workers they \n     certainly didn't have the money for boarding school or \n     college.\n       Years later, as a young mother raising five children on her \n     own, she realized anew the terrible toll that lack of proper \n     health care took on people without money or insurance. She \n     organized screening using medical students from UK and \n     Vanderbilt as well as volunteer nurses and physicians. They \n     found undiagnosed tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis (black lung), \n     diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. In 1973 she \n     managed to get a clinic licensed to operate on Mud Creek in \n     Floyd County. The Mud Creek Clinic opened in a rented house \n     on Tinker Fork, which it quickly outgrew. Hall moved the \n     facility to her own home on Mink Branch. Her house was bigger \n     and easier to get to. But it meant moving her family into a \n     mobile home.\n       Eula Hall picked up patients and took them home because \n     many of them had no transportation, or at least none that was \n     reliable. She delivered food and medicine. Now she even works \n     to get people their rightful Social Security and other \n     benefits, winning more cases than some attorneys, according \n     to many observers.\n       By 1977 the clinic merged with Big Sandy Health Care, which \n     remains its parent organization today.\n       Five years later, the clinic burned to the ground. ``We \n     didn't miss a day,'' Hall recalled. ``We set up shop on a \n     picnic table under the trees.''\n       The new Mud Creek Clinic opened in 1984, thanks to $320,000 \n     from the Appalachian Regional Commission and dozens of quilt \n     raffles, chicken and dumpling dinners, a radio-thon, and \n     other local fundraising efforts.\n       Now there are 24 employees, including two full-time \n     physicians, a full-time certified physician assistant, and a \n     part-time doctor. The clinic is housed in a modern brick \n     building with another facility behind it that houses a dental \n     clinic and food pantry. Eula Hall is 78 years old, but still \n     goes to work at 8 o'clock every morning.\n       Last year Eula was presented an honorary doctorate from \n     Berea College at the same ceremony which honored Archbishop \n     Desmond Tutu, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. She also \n     holds an honorary doctorate from Trinity College, Harford, \n     Connecticut, and one from the Pikeville College School of \n     Osteopathic Medicine.\n       ``I appreciate (the awards),'' she said. ``But I never done \n     anything to get awards. I do it because I need to. Somebody \n     needs to.''\n       Clinic patients, neighbors and friends, and many local \n     elected and appointed government officials will come together \n     on Friday\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\n     to honor Eula Hall once again, this time by naming in her \n     honor the road she's traveled so many years. The public is \n     invited to attend and join Eula afterwards for a reception \n     hosted by Big Sandy Health Care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11041-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SELDON SHORT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a good friend and \nfellow Kentuckian, Seldon Short, who with his wife Janet has worked for \nthe Kentucky Mountain Holiness Association for the past 49 years and in \nradio for the past 55.\n  Mr. Short began his career in broadcasting in 1951 at WMTC-AM, a \nsmall radio station in Vancleve, KY. Throughout his time in radio Mr. \nShort ran the gauntlet of progress, keeping up with the technological \nchanges of the last half century from 78-rpm vinyl records to cassette \ntapes to satellite delivery, while also expanding his own radio \nstation. After Mr. Short became general manager in 1978, his small AM \nstation grew from 1000 watts to 5000 watts, and in 1991 switched over \nto the FM dial.\n  Upon his retirement from WMTC-FM this October, Mr. Short was awarded \nthe J.T. Whitlock Life Member Award from the Kentucky Broadcasters \nAssociation for his commitment and dedication to the field of \nbroadcasting.\n  On October 12, 2006, The Breathitt County Voice published an article \nhighlighting Mr. Short's contributions to his community. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record and \nthat the entire Senate join me in paying respect to this beloved \nKentuckian.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From The Breathitt County Voice, Oct. 12, 2006]\n\n    ``A Blessing to Breathitt County''--Seldon & Janet Short Retire\n\n                            (By Jeff Noble)\n\n       All around the room Seldon Short could see friends. Dozens \n     of them came out on a Friday night to say ``thank you'' to \n     him and his wife Janet. Even after he suffered crippling \n     injuries in a horrible car crash a few years back, he smiles. \n     Even after Janet suffered debilitating illness from an \n     operation some time ago, she remains upbeat.\n       And they're not bitter. Because of their resiliency, Seldon \n     and Janet Short's faith and love of people keeps them above \n     the rollercoaster that is life. ``It does our hearts good to \n     see all these people we've served,'' Seldon said during a \n     retirement party for him and his wife inside the dining hall \n     of Mt. Carmel High School. ``You look around and it's amazing \n     how wonderful life really is. Janet and I will be married 50 \n     years next June. We've been blessed with four children and \n     six grandchildren. And we have a lifetime of memories. God's \n     been good to us, and because of that, we keep going.''\n       Janet gently squeezed her husband's hand as she spoke of \n     the outpouring of love their friends provided at the party. \n     ``It's so nice to see all these people. People I've worked \n     with, people who helped babysit for my children when I was on \n     the radio, people who we love and cherish. I'm just thankful \n     the Lord has seen us through during this time, and sometimes, \n     it was rough.'' Then she looked admiringly at Seldon and \n     spoke softly with a smile. ``Seldon, he's a great guy. I \n     don't know what I'd do without him. He's wonderful. I can't \n     brag on him enough.''\n       Neither could some in the room, like his old friend Robert \n     Cundiff. ``Seldon loves people. But he is also a shy \n     person,'' getting a laugh out of the crowd as he spoke. He \n     then told a story about his old buddy, who, like Cundiff, \n     graduated from Mt. Carmel and the former Kentucky Mountain \n     Bible Institute (now Kentucky Mountain Bible College). ``For \n     instance, in the cafeteria, Seldon was so shy, he wouldn't \n     even say `Pass the biscuits.' Can you imagine Seldon doing \n     that?'' It was a remark that brought the house down. Cundiff \n     then thanked Seldon for being the ``founding father of the \n     Mt. Carmel Former Students Association--our alumni \n     association. Thank you, my old friend.''\n       Not to be outdone, several of Janet's friends and co-\n     workers came to bring yellow roses to her, and to spin some \n     stories about Mrs. Short and her work she and her husband did \n     at WMTC Radio. ``While I played piano, I remember Janet \n     reading poems over the radio station,'' said Donna Woodring. \n     ``Sometimes they would be quite inspiring, sometimes they \n     would be whimsical. She was always delightful.'' Carlene \n     Light recalled another moment. ``Janet loved to cook, and she \n     loved to watch you eat. That's why I'm overweight.'' After \n     getting laughs from the audience, Carlene went on to say, \n     ``What's so great about this couple is that Seldon and Janet \n     are focused on people.'' It was a statement echoed by Faith \n     Amspaugh. ``In fact, my children, who are all grown, still \n     call them Uncle Seldon and Aunt Janet.''\n       For many years, Seldon and Janet wore many hats working for \n     the Kentucky Mountain Holiness Association. He was with KMHA \n     for 49 years, while Janet worked for 40 years. Of that time, \n     Seldon served as Vice-President of KMHA, as well as positions \n     on the Jackson Kiwanis Club, the Jackson Independent School \n     board, the pastor of two churches (Wolverine for 23 years and \n     Bach Memorial for 18 years), and as a board member of the \n     Kentucky Broadcasters Association (KBA). From his humble \n     beginnings as a part-time announcer in 1951, Seldon returned \n     to WMTC full-time in 1954-55. After going to Asbury College, \n     he came back for good to the radio station in 1958.\n       He and Janet had a heart for radio, and remained with the \n     station for many years. Seldon became General Manager of WMTC \n     in 1978, saw the station's signal on 730 AM go from 1,000 \n     watts to 5,000 watts, and was at the creation of WMTC-FM, as \n     it went on the air at 99.9 in 1991. ``I did a lot of live \n     programs back then. There was no tape as we know it today. \n     Recorded shows were on big, heavy 78 RPM vinyl discs. Then we \n     got old-fashioned recorders that weren't plastic, but \n     paperback. Then we went to reel-to-reel tape recorders, \n     cassette recorders, CD's and satellite delivery. Today is all \n     computerized.'' Then Short pointed his finger up at the sky \n     and said, ``What hasn't changed is the commitment to serving \n     people. I still think trying to be of service to the area you \n     cover is still the most important thing you can do as a \n     broadcaster. You still need to respond to their wants, their \n     needs, their requests and their hunger for information.''\n       That same hunger for service came to his successor, \n     Jennifer Cox. ``The Shorts welcomed me to WMTC. I had never \n     worked at a family environment. And I learned from a reliable \n     source.'' Cox, who succeeded Seldon as General Manager in \n     June of this year, got misty-eyed when she spoke of him. ``He \n     did live radio and has gone through the computer age. \n     Everything I know he taught me. Because of Seldon and his \n     vision, we at WMTC are where we are today. I thank him for \n     his leadership and kindness.'' At that point, Cox presented \n     Seldon with the J. T. Whitlock Life Member Award from the \n     Kentucky Broadcasters Association. ``J. T. was a great friend \n     of mine,'' Seldon said of the late, long-time Executive \n     Secretary-Treasurer of the KBA. ``He was a great friend of \n     the small broadcaster, like us, and he had a great heart for \n     people, and serving those people who listened to him.''\n       As some 50 of their friends munched on cake and \n     refreshments in the dining hall, the Shorts listened as the \n     current President of KMHA reminded the crowd that despite \n     their adversities, Seldon and Janet were not bitter about \n     their experiences. ``Both of them are not quitters,'' said \n     Dr. Philip Speas. ``The Shorts are made out of good stuff. \n     They're made of good metal. They've been a real illustration \n     of patience. They are a blessing to Breathitt County.''\n       Toward the end of the reception, Seldon got up out of his \n     wheelchair and looked at the room again. His friends, like \n     Rev. and Mrs. Wilfred Fisher, and his children and \n     grandchildren, were all standing and applauding. The cheering \n     died down. His wife was in tears. He was too, as he softly \n     told them, all his friends for life, ``Thank you. God has \n     really blessed us through these long, wonderful years, and \n     all of you have graced us with your friendship. Despite our \n     difficulties, we'd do it all over again. God's grace has been \n     sufficient. It's been a good life.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11041-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11041-S11042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THANKSGIVING 2006\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, next week, Americans across our great land \nwill be celebrating one of our oldest and most beloved holidays, \nThanksgiving.\n  What a great and glorious holiday this is--a truly and uniquely \nAmerican holiday. It is a day for giving thanks. A day devoted to \nfamily, to country, and to God. A day of eating turkey, sweet potatoes, \nmashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, dressing, and pumpkin pie. It is a \nday of parades, football games, and the beginning of the Christmas \nholiday season.\n  It is a day of family gatherings. Unfortunately, in too many homes \nthis year, and as in the past 5 years, there will be too many empty \nseats at the dinner table. I hope everyone listening will join me in \npraying for our sons and daughters who are in harm's way in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, in praying for the eternal salvation of those who have \ndied in these costly conflicts, and in praying for the speedy recovery \nof those who have been wounded. While we cannot hope to fill those \nempty chairs, we can hope that our prayers and our love and support \nwill help to ease the sorrow at those tables.\n  Even with the turmoil of the past year and with so many of our sons \nand daughters in faraway lands, we still have so much for which to be \nthankful.\n  We are thankful for the Pilgrims--that courageous group of men and \nwomen who, in 1621, left their homes, crossed a mighty ocean, and \nsettled in a strange, unknown wilderness so they could go to church so \nthey could worship God as they pleased.\n  After months of privation, suffering, hunger, sickness and death, \nthese men and women had a great feast to thank\n\n[[Page S11042]]\n\nGod for being good to them. Think about it. With all the brutal \nhardships they had endured, with all the death and suffering they \nendured, they took time to have a great feast to thank Almighty God for \nbeing good to them. In the process, they gave us our first Thanksgiving\n  We are thankful for the heritage of liberty bequeathed to us by our \nancestors. We are thankful for the wisdom and the foresight of our \nFounding Fathers who bestowed to us a form of government unique in \nhistory, with its three strong pillars of executive, legislative, and \njudicial branches, each balanced and checked against one another.\n  In fact, Mr. President, that is the very point I want to emphasize. \nThe very first national observance of Thanksgiving, which came in 1789, \nwas to thank Almighty God for His role in creating our great country, \nand His assistance in the forming of our Constitution.\n  This happened when, in the very first Congress in 1789, \nRepresentative Elias Boudinot of New Jersey moved that a day of \nthanksgiving be held to thank God for giving the American people the \nopportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their newly won \nfreedoms.\n  The resolution, as approved by both Houses of the Congress, requested \nthat a ``joint committee of both Houses be directed to wait upon the \npresident of the United States, to request that he recommend to the \npeople of the United States a day of public thanksgiving.''\n  On September 26, 1789, the first Senate agreed to the House \nresolution, and a few days later a joint congressional committee \ndelivered to President Washington a resolution ``desiring the president \nof the United States to recommend a day of general thanksgiving.''\n  Within a few days, on October 3, President Washington issued the \nfirst national thanksgiving proclamation. Our first and perhaps our \ngreatest President proclaimed Thursday, November 26, 1789, to be a day \nof national thanksgiving.\n  That proclamation is a fascinating and informative document. It \nbegins by proclaiming that, ``it is the duty of all nations to \nacknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be \ngrateful for His benefits, and humbly implore His protection and \nfavor.''\n  The Father of our country left no doubt about his belief that our \nNation was not simply the creation of mere mortals but was, in fact, \nguided by a Divine Hand. As if to emphasize this point, his \nproclamation went on to praise ``that great and glorious Being who is \nthe beneficent author of all the good that was, that is, or that will \nbe.'' He exhorted the people of his young Republic to express their \ngratitude to Almighty God for his protection of them through the \nRevolutionary War. He wrote: ``We may then all unite in rendering unto \nHim our sincere and humble thanks for His kind care and protection of \nthe people of this country previous to their becoming a nation.''\n  That was George Washington. That was the basis of our first national \nThanksgiving.\n  But he was not through. This was a Thanksgiving proclamation, so he \nproceeded to give thanks. He asked the American people to be thankful \nto Almighty God for ``the civil and religious liberty with which we are \nblessed.''\n  And he asked the American people to be thankful ``for the peaceable \nand rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish \nconstitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and \nparticularly the national one now lately instituted.''\n  I hope everyone caught that. President Washington was thanking the \nGood Lord for the Constitution that created the American Government.\n  At the request of our first President, citizens throughout the land \nassembled in churches on November 26, 1789, and thanked God for their \ngovernment and asked Him for His Guidance in the years ahead. As for \nPresident Washington, he spent the day worshiping at an Episcopal \nchurch in Manhattan.\n  As you celebrate this Thanksgiving, enjoy your families. Enjoy your \nThanksgiving feasts. Enjoy your football games and your parades.\n  But like President Washington, you might want to think about \nattending church on this great and glorious day and give thanks for our \nmany blessings. Like President Washington, you may want to thank God \nfor watching over the United States and for His assistance in the \ncreation of our Constitution, our Nation's most basic and sacred \ndocument, which has guided and protected our country for more than 200 \nyears, through world wars, great depressions, and bitter, divisive \nelections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11042-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11042-S11045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Private First Class Jeffrey Shaffer\n\n  Mr. LINCOLN. Mr. President, it is my honor to rise today to pay \ntribute to one of Arkansas' fallen heroes, PFC Jeffrey Shaffer, who \ngave his life serving our country in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  By all accounts from family and friends, Private First Class Shaffer \nlived his life to the fullest. For this young man, that meant caring \nfor others, having fun, and making people laugh, even when confronted \nwith life's challenges. The image of a tough soldier masked the side \nmost familiar to his loved ones, that of a more playful young man who \npulled pranks and brought laughter to lives of others. His stepfather, \nMark Adams, recalls a golf outing where neither he nor Jeff was playing \nparticularly well. Rather than suffer through the rest of the game, and \nto the surprise of Mark, Private First Class Shaffer jumped in the \nwater and began collecting golf balls. Mark had never had more fun \nplaying golf. The day was a testament to the effect Private First Class \nShaffer often had on others.\n  But he also had a humble, more serious side and a deep sense of \ncommitment to his country. While working for his uncle's masonry \ncontracting business in Harrison, AR, he took time to earn his GED. \nShortly thereafter, and to the surprise of many in his family, he \njoined the U.S. Army in February 2005. The tragic events of September \n11 changed how he viewed the world and motivated him to serve in the \nmilitary. For Private First Class Shaffer, serving in the Army was a \nway he could contribute to the safety of his family and security of all \nAmericans.\n  The 20-year-old was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry \nRegiment, 1st Armored Division. After being stationed in Germany, \nPrivate First Class Shaffer was deployed to Kuwait and later Iraq. \nWitnessing close friends lose their lives in Iraq, he was never naive \nabout the dangerous realities of war. He believed whatever happened to \nhim was God's will and often told this to his mother to calm her fears. \nPrivate First Class Shaffer's life ended on September 13, 2006, after a \nroadside bomb detonated near his Bradley assault vehicle.\n  On September 16, family, friends, and fellow soldiers gathered at \nCalvary Baptist Church in Waco, TX, to pay tribute to the life and \nlegacy of Jeffrey Shaffer. I am proud to pay tribute to him today and \nam thankful for his service to our country. He leaves behind a 2-year-\nold daughter, Makayla Grace, who I hope will one day know that her \nfather took full advantage of what life had to offer and brought untold \nhappiness to those around him. My thoughts and prayers are with her, \nJeffrey's parents, his aunt and uncle, and all those who knew and loved \nhim.\n\n\n                   Lance Corporal Kyle Wesley Powell\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I want to bring to the Senate's attention \nthe loss of a young man of great promise from my home State of \nColorado: Marine LCpl Kyle Wesley Powell. A member of Unit C Co, 1st \nCombat Engineer Battalion, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary \nForce out of Camp Pendleton, Lance Corporal Powell was killed earlier \nthis month in Fallujah, Iraq.\n  Kyle Powell was a native of Colorado Springs. He was an Eagle Scout \nwho graduated from Cheyenne Mountain High School, and joined the Marine \nCorps in September 2003. Lance Corporal Powell was on his third tour as \na marine in Iraq. During his second tour, he received the Navy \nAchievement Medal after a bunker which he had designed and constructed \nabsorbed an attack of several enemy rocket-propelled grenades, \nprotecting the marines within it.\n  In fact, just a few days before his passing, Lance Corporal Powell \nhad saved the life of another fellow marine, applying a tourniquet and \nfiring his weapon at the enemy until they could be rescued.\n  What jumps out about Lance Corporal Powell is that when people speak\n\n[[Page S11043]]\n\nof him, one word keeps coming up: leader.\n  ``He was always, always ready to go and lead from the front,'' said \nLTC Wayne Sinclair, commander of the 1st CEB.\n  In fact, at the time of his untimely loss, Lance Corporal Powell was \nleading a convoy moving to help extract a group of fellow marines from \nhostile territory. He was conducting a mine sweep when he was killed, \nlikely saving the lives of five other marines who were behind him in a \nhumvee.\n  I noted before that Lance Corporal Powell was on his third tour in \nIraq. But it should be noted that he went on this third tour by choice: \nin August, he chose to lead by example. He volunteered to go to Iraq \nbecause his unit was short of others to send overseas.\n  At a time when so many of our young men and women are preoccupied \nwith the coming course schedules at colleges and universities, Kyle \nPowell was focused on helping the people of Iraq.\n  Kyle's parents, Nancy and David are former Army officers, and they \nknow firsthand the dangers their son faced. They know the same pride he \nfelt in doing the work that by all accounts he truly loved.\n  Nancy and David, our Nation mourns the loss of your son with you. We \ncelebrate his service to our Nation, his willingness to always \nselflessly step to the front and lead so that others, be they in his \nunit or half a world away in his hometown, would be safer. Our Nation \nis humbled by his heroism, and we hope your grief is soothed by knowing \nthat his sacrifice is forever appreciated by every American.\n\n\n                   LIEUTENANT COLONEL ERIC J. KRUGER\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to recall the life and service \nof Army LTC Eric J. Kruger, who was killed near Baghdad earlier this \nmonth. He was the highest-ranking officer from Fort Carson, CO, to be \nkilled in Iraq and had only been there a few days.\n  Colonel Kruger was deputy commander of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team \nout of Fort Carson, which has recently been deployed to Iraq. \nPreviously, Colonel Kruger had served a year in Afghanistan and less \nthan 10 months after returning to the States and connecting with 2BCT \nwas redeployed as part of an advance team to prepare for 2BCT's \ndeployment to the area.\n  Colonel Kruger was a graduate of North Garland High in Texas and \nearned a bachelor's degree in political science and master's degree in \nliberal arts from Southern Methodist University in his home State \nbefore joining the U.S. Army in 1989. Colonel Kruger completed airborne \nand Ranger training.\n  As a soldier, Eric Kruger was of notable and rare distinction: during \nhis service he had earned the Bronze Star, numerous Meritorious Service \nAwards and an Army Commendation medal. He was a man of deep patriotism \nand conviction in his job. He believed in making the world a better \nplace and acted to help make that vision a reality.\n  But it is the testimony of those with whom he served that helps \nilluminate the extraordinary character of Colonel Kruger. One fellow \nsoldier from Fort Carson remembered him as ``a wonderful man and a \ngreat leader. Everyone who knew him loved him.'' A staff sergeant who \nserved under him said that Colonel Kruger was ``one of the few \nleaders'' who helped her realize her life's path was with the U.S. \nArmy: ``Sir, your excitement, passion, and outstanding leadership moved \nme in my military career,'' she wrote. Another staff sergeant spoke of \nKruger's respect for his fellow man, remembering that when he first met \nColonel Kruger, ``Even though he vastly outranked me, he always treated \nme and all others with a vast respect and kindness.''\n  A fellow officer who served with Colonel Kruger in Afghanistan \nrecalled his commitment to his family. ``Eric was a good man, a fine \nsoldier and a loving father. We often spoke of our families, and I \nremember being struck by his dedication to his family and his concern \nfor their wellbeing.'' There is no doubt: Colonel Kruger cared deeply \nabout his fellow man and dedicated his life to serving others.\n  To Colonel Kruger's wife Sara and their four children, Caitlin, \nJoshua, Christian, and Elise: You and Eric are in our prayers, today \nand always. May you find peace and solace in this time of grief, \nknowing that Eric's service to this Nation will not be forgotten. The \nmany lives he positively shaped as an officer and American are tributes \nto his leadership and to your support of his efforts. For this, our \nentire Nation is grateful.\n  Colonel Eric Kruger was an unquestionable hero, a leader whom each of \nus can admire and who can inspire every Member of this body to redouble \nour efforts on behalf of him and every one of our Nation's veterans and \nmen and women serving in uniform.\n\n\n                         California Casualties\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I would like to address the recent enactment \nof the Unlawful Internet Gambling and Enforcement Act of 2006. Due to \nprocedural considerations at the end of the regular session, this law \nwas enacted as title VIII of H.R. 4954, a bill focused on port \nsecurity. But I want the record to show that I have been working to \npass this law for more than 10 years, with the support of many \ncolleagues. Indeed, the Senators serving as conferees for the port \nsecurity bill accepted including the Internet gambling title, as did \nthe leadership on both sides of the aisle. And this July, the House of \nRepresentatives voted 317-93 in favor of a bill containing not only \nidentical enforcement measures to those that were recently enacted, but \nalso including the more controversial Wire Act amendments.\n  Over the last five Congresses, a stand-alone Internet gambling bill \nhas been passed by at least one Chamber of Congress, every time by \noverwhelming bipartisan votes. The last time an Internet gambling bill \ncame before the whole Senate, it was passed by unanimous consent. \nUnfortunately, the Jack Abramoff scandal corrupted the process for that \nbill in the House of Representatives. Since then, the full Senate has \nnot had the opportunity to vote on more recent legislation repeatedly \npassed by more than three-quarters of the House. So I greatly \nappreciate the assistance of the majority leader and the conferees in \nfinally getting this long-overdue law to the President's desk.\n  The National Association of Attorneys General--NAAG--first approached \nme in 1995 about the problem of Internet gambling. The State attorneys \ngeneral were concerned about the evasion and erosion of State laws by \ngambling websites operating beyond the reach of State law enforcement. \nI heeded NAAG's request and introduced the first Internet gambling bill \nlate that year to increase Federal enforcement of gambling laws.\n  Over the next 10 years, Senate and House Committees repeatedly held \nhearings and markups. We listened to the experts about what types of \nenforcement would be effective or impractical, and revised the \nlegislation in response. In 1999, the congressionally commissioned \nNational Gambling Impact Study Commission Report recommended that law \nenforcement target the payment systems to combat illegal offshore \ngambling, so that is the approach we adopted.\n  I have worked closely with Representative Jim Leach, former chair of \nthe House Financial Services Committee, a very capable and thoughtful \ncolleague who will be greatly missed in future Congresses. \nRepresentative Mike Oxley, who succeeded Mr. Leach as Financial \nServices chairman a few years ago, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, \nchairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, and Representative \nBob Goodlatte, who sponsored the bill scuttled by Jack Abramoff, have \nall helped shape Internet gambling legislation over the last several \nyears.\n  Why has Congress been so supportive of Internet gambling legislation \nfor so long? Because offshore operators have been flouting American \nlaws for personal gain. They have been giving Americans the false \nimpression that these activities are legal. They have been profiteering \nfrom this. The Federal Government has long given States the right to \nprohibit or limit gambling activities for the protection of the public, \nbut offshore Web sites have been ignoring and circumventing the State \nlaws. State law enforcement officials and Congress refused to stand \nidly by as our laws were evaded and eroded.\n  How could an illegal activity become so pervasive? Knowing that their \nbusinesses are illegal in the United States and many other countries, \nInternet-gambling businesses have set up shop in countries with very \nfew gambling regulations, such as Antigua and Costa Rica. These small \ncountries benefit from the billions of dollars of profit generated by \ntheir local gambling operators. So when the United States tries to \nprosecute a criminal violation of its gambling laws, these countries \nare not interested in extraditing their wealthiest residents. The \nUnited States is thwarted in its efforts to enforce its criminal laws \nagainst offshore gambling businesses.\n  Some say that, instead of trying to enforce the law, we should \nlegalize and regulate online gambling. Why does this approach have so \nlittle support in Congress? Because Internet gambling is a scourge to \nsociety, leading to addiction and bankruptcy, and enticing young people \ninto a gambling lifestyle.\n  Internet gambling is highly addictive. Online gambling is available \n24/7 from almost any location. Fast and continuous play, often financed \nby credit, allows online gamblers to rapidly lose tens of thousands of \ndollars, leading to bankruptcy, family devastation, and criminal \nactivity. It is easy to conceal the addiction because an online gambler \ndoes not need to leave home or the office to gamble, and shows no \nphysical signs of addictive behavior like an alcohol or drug addict \ndoes.\n  Various recent studies show that Internet gamblers are two to three \ntimes more likely to become addicted than brick-and-mortar gamblers. \nOne study of students at the University of Connecticut found that 74 \npercent of Internet gamblers were problem or pathological gamblers. The \nAnnenberg Public Policy Center's 2005 National Annenberg Risk Survey of \nYouth--NARSY--surveyed 900 young people between 14 and 22 and found \nthat 54 percent of youth who gamble online at\n\n[[Page S11046]]\n\nleast once a week are problem gamblers, and that card players exhibit \nthe most symptoms of gambling addiction.\n  Internet gambling entices young people into a gambling lifestyle. \nYoung people who are accustomed to playing video games for hours on end \nare particularly likely to be enticed by the games and to lack a \nrealistic perception of the consequences of gambling for money. \nConversely, traditional casinos appeal to mature adults: according to a \nrecent survey by the American Gaming Association, 75 percent of casino \ncustomers are over 40 years old. Internet gambling appeals to the \nopposite demographic: at least 70 percent of Internet gamblers are \nunder 40 according to the AGA, and they did not even count the millions \nof online gamblers who are under 21. Also, Internet gambling appears to \nbe a gateway drug. According to that same survey, Internet gamblers are \ntwice as likely to engage in traditional gambling than the general \npopulation. So the rise of online gambling is fertilizing the soil for \nan explosion of gambling addictions in this country.\n  The United Kingdom is in the midst of an effort to legalize and \nregulate online gambling, including efforts to prevent youth and \nproblem gambling. This effort is not going well. A report commissioned \nby the British Government was issued a few weeks ago. The report admits \nthat most gambling operators choose jurisdictions where there is very \nlittle regulation on their activities. This creates a race to the \nbottom, where gambling operators in a few countries can offer services \nthat flout the laws of almost every other jurisdiction.\n\n  The new law confronts the problem of online gambling in three ways. \nFirst, it transforms violations of State gambling laws into a Federal \ncrime as soon as the gambling operator receives money for the \ntransaction. Second, it authorizes Federal and State attorneys general \nto enjoin persons who enable violations of the law, such as a person \nrunning advertisements for illegal Web sites. Third, it requires \npayment systems to block payments for illegal online gambling.\n  The new Federal criminal law is already having a positive effect. The \npublicly traded online gambling companies, who have to answer to \nfinancial institutions and other investors, have quickly withdrawn from \nthe U.S. market.\n  Some Web sites continue to deceive the American public about the \nlegality of online gambling, State and Federal law enforcement are now \nempowered to enjoin advertising for these illegal websites, and any \nother support services within their reach. Payment blocking is \nnecessary to reduce Internet gambling and make it clear to the American \npublic that this activity is illegal.\n  The payment blocking requirements will not become effective until the \nTreasury Department and the Federal Reserve issue regulations. The \nstatutory deadline for these regulations is August 10, 2007. I urge the \nTreasury Department and the Federal Reserve to issue these regulations \non time, and to make them strong.\n  Most online gambling websites use third-party offshore payment \nsystems to receive money from U.S. customers, because many U.S. \nfinancial institutions have already been blocking payments to these Web \nsites for years. When a U.S. credit card or bank sends money to one of \nthese services, the U.S. financial institution does not know how the \nmoney will be used. On the other hand, the third-party payers know the \nmoney in their accounts is being used for online gambling by U.S. \ncustomers. Therefore, these third-party payers are knowingly aiding and \nabetting a criminal act when they send funds from U.S. customer \naccounts to online gambling companies.\n  Firepay has appropriately chosen to stop making these illegal \npayments for American customers, even though it operates out of \nIreland. The regulations need to make sure that law-abiding companies \nsuch as Firepay are protected, while third-party payers who knowingly \naid and abet criminal activity are effectively sanctioned.\n  I would also note that this law empowers payment systems to make \nstrong efforts to stop the use of their systems for online gambling. To \nthat end, section 5364(d) of the new law protects entities from civil \nliability for blocking restricted transactions, or if they mistakenly \nblock, prevent, or prohibit legal transactions when attempting, in good \nfaith, to comply with the law. At the same time, section 5364(b)(4) \nclarifies that the government will attempt to draft the regulations to \ncatch as few legal transactions as possible.\n  The key is implementing the most effective and efficient enforcement \nmeasures that are reasonably possible. We have not sat idly by while \nunscrupulous operators profiteer from evading our laws and perpetrating \nfraud on the public. We have worked long and hard to defend the letter \nand the purpose of State and Federal gambling laws, and now we ask the \nexecutive branch to help us finish the job. Strong regulations for \npayment systems will cut off most fund transfers to offshore online \ngambling operators and destroy U.S. markets. By drastically reducing \nthe availability of Internet gambling in the U.S., we will reduce new \naddictions and violations of the law.\n  This is why, this year, 49 State attorneys general, as well as the \nNational District Attorneys Association, Federal Criminal \nInvestigators, and Fraternal Order of Police wrote in support of this \nlaw. These law enforcement groups were not alone. They were joined by \nextraordinarily diverse groups that are concerned about the effect that \nonline gambling has on society and the rule of law.\n  First, sports organizations are concerned about preserving the \nintegrity of athletic competitions, and want to protect them from \nperceptions of corruption or a culture of gambling. This is why the \nNational Football League, National Collegiate Athletic Association, \nMajor League Baseball, National Basketball Association, and National \nHockey League all actively supported the law.\n  Second, financial institutions are concerned about Internet \ngambling's association with money laundering, uncollectible consumer \ndebt, and use of their systems for criminal activity. This is why the \nAmerican Bankers Association, America's Community Bankers, and \nSecurities Industry of America, joined by individual companies such as \nAmerican Express, Citigroup, and PayPal, wrote in support of the law.\n  Third, religious groups and family welfare groups are concerned about \nthe devastating effects that gambling addiction can have on families. \nThis is why this law was supported by a broad range of civic \norganizations, from mainline churches such as the United Methodist \nChurch and the National Council of Churches, to coalitions such as the \nNational Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, to conservative family \ngroups such as the Family Research Council and Concerned Women for \nAmerica.\n  This is why I am proud that this legislation was finally enacted. As \nall these diverse groups recognized, online gambling is a threat to \ncivic society for many reasons. Failing to enforce laws that are meant \nto diminish this threat undermines the rule of law itself. But today we \nstand ready to reclaim the power to enforce the law, and I ask for the \nhelp of the Treasury Department and other executive agencies to secure \nthis victory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11046-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11046-S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WORLD WAR II VETERANS OF FRANKFORT, KANSAS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the valor and \ngreat sacrifice of the citizens in Frankfort, KS. Frankfort is a small \ntown in northeast Kansas. It is a thriving rural community of \napproximately 855 people. In the early 1940s, just as today, Frankfort \nwas teeming with good Americans, Americans who answered the call of \nduty and fought so that their fellow Americans could live in freedom.\n  But that alone is not what makes Frankfort notable. Brave men and \nwomen from small towns, big cities, and everywhere in America have \nserved our Nation in the Armed Forces. Many have made the ultimate \nsacrifice.\n  What makes this town, then home to approximately 1,800 people, \nnotable is the solemn fact that 32 brave men from Frankfort and the \nsurrounding farmland gave their lives in World War II. Based on records \nfrom local county newspapers of that time, it is concluded that the \nFrankfort community lost more men in World War II than any other town \nof similar size. This\n\n[[Page S11047]]\n\nfact imparts both a deep sense of pride for the bravery and commitment \nof these young Kansans and also sadness for the great loss of life that \nis inherent in times of war.\n  During my years in public service, I have experienced many \nopportunities to meet some amazing people and hear the incredible \nstories that truly define America. This is exactly how I have come to \nlearn of this incredible contribution to our Nation's security. Frank \nBenteman, a World War II Army veteran, shared this story. Mr. Benteman, \nnow 80 years old, is from Frankfort and was part of this ``greatest \ngeneration'' who served. It was Mr. Benteman who continues to honor \nthose who went before by remembering their sacrifice and honoring their \nmemory. I am pleased to work along with Frank Benteman to honor the \nheroes of Frankfort, KS, by entering their names into the Congressional \nRecord in recognition of their ultimate sacrifice to a grateful nation.\n  The brave men from Frankfort, KS, who gave their lives in the great \nSecond World War include Willard A.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to commemorate an \nimportant event that took place on Veterans Day weekend. On November \n10, the Marine Corps Birthday, I was privileged to give the annual \naddress at the revered Iwo Jima Memorial, and then to attend the \ndedication of the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, VA.\n  This marvelous dedication featured remarks from President Bush, \nPresident of the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation General (Ret.) Ron \nChristmas and the distinguished news anchor and former marine, Jim \nLehrer. They were joined by thousands of fellow marines--past and \npresent--including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, GEN Pete Pace, \nCommandant of the Marine Corps Michael Hagee and former Senators John \nGlenn and Chuck Robb.\n  Especially moving was President Bush conferring our Nation's highest \nmilitary decoration, the Medal of Honor, posthumously, on Cpl Jason \nDunham, who was tragically killed outside the Iraqi town of Karabilah \nin 2004.\n  For all who worked tirelessly to construct this wonderful museum that \nhighlights the Marine Corps experience, that dedication ceremony became \na tribute of a lifetime for all marines.\n  On this week of Veterans' Day, and the Marine Corps Birthday, we \nremind ourselves that we are here solely because of the sacrifices of \nmen and women who for 231 years now have worn our Nation's uniform to \npreserve our freedoms against outside enemies.\n  Like the ``Devil Dogs'' of Belleau Wood, today's generation of \nLeathernecks--from the Commandant to the newest recruit at Parris \nIsland--have answered one of the highest callings: serving as a marine \nfor the greatest Nation on Earth.\n  As President Reagan famously observed, ``some people spend an entire \nlifetime wondering if they have made a difference. Marines don't have \nthat problem.''\n  My good friend of many years, Jim Lehrer, gave a particularly \ninspired speech at the museum dedication that captured the fundamental \nnature of what it means to be a marine, and how that experience shaped \nhim, as it did all of us, in our lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his inspiring speech be printed in the \nRecord as a tribute to all marines, former or current, around the \nworld.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Tribute To Marines\n\n                            (By Jim Lehrer)\n\n       Mr. President, generals, colonels, majors, captains, \n     lieutenants, warrant officers, sergeants, corporals, \n     privates, ladies and gentlemen.\n       We are the Marines. And in this museum, our story is told. \n     It is a single, monumental story, made up of 231 years of \n     many separate stories of heroism and courage, of dedication \n     and sacrifice, of service to our country and to our corps, of \n     honor and loyalty to each other in war and in peace; 231 \n     years of professionalism and pride, of squared corners and \n     squared-away lockers, perfect salutes and good haircuts, \n     well-shined shoes, and eyes right, 231 years of Semper Fis \n     and DIs.\n       First time I came to Quantico was 51 years ago. I came as \n     an officer candidate, a PLC on the train from Washington, \n     having just traveled from Texas on the first airplane ride of \n     my life. On the orders of a drill instructor, a DI, I fell in \n     at attention with 40 other candidates on the platform at the \n     train station over at Quantico.\n       And the DI told us to answer up, ``Here, sir!'' when our \n     name was called. And he got to mine, and he said, ``Le-here-\n     er-er.'' And, like some kind of idiot, I blurted out, ``It's \n     pronounced Lehrer, sir!''\n       There was silence, absolute silence. And then I heard the \n     terrifying click, click, click of leather heels on the deck \n     of that train station platform coming in my direction. And \n     suddenly there he was, the DI, right in front of me, his face \n     right up in mine. And I paraphrase and cleanse it up a bit, \n     but he said, ``Candidate, if I say your name is Little Bo \n     Peep, your name is Little Bo Peep!''\n       ``Do you hear me?'' Oh, I heard him all right. And I think \n     it was at that very moment that I really became a United \n     States Marine.\n       I'm still one today, and I will remain one forever, as did \n     my late father, and as is my older and only brother.\n       I came from a family of Marines into the family of Marines. \n     My father served in the 1920s under the great Smedley Butler \n     right here at Quantico. He saw combat in Haiti and came out a \n     corporal. My brother and I were both 1950s Cold War Marines \n     in the Third Marine Division in the Far East.\n       Since our corps was founded on this day in 1775, there have \n     been more than 4 million men and women who have worn the \n     uniform of a United States Marine. This museum is about all \n     of them, including us three ``Le-here-er-ers,'' and even the \n     Little Bo Peeps. That's because this museum is about what it \n     means to be a Marine, no matter the time, the length, place, \n     rank, or nature of the service.\n       It's about the shared experience and the shared knowledge \n     that comes from being a U.S. Marine, such as knowing that you \n     are only as strong and as safe as the person on your right \n     and on your left; that a well-trained and motivated human \n     being can accomplish almost anything; that being pushed to do \n     your very best is a godsend; that an order is an order, a \n     duty is a duty, that responsibility goes down the chain of \n     command, as well as up, as do loyalty and respect; that \n     leadership can be taught, so can bearing, discipline and \n     honor; that ``follow me'' really does mean ``follow me''; and \n     that that Semper Fidelis really does mean ``always \n     faithful''; and that the Marines hymn is so much more than \n     just a song.\n       My Marine experience helped shape who I am now personally \n     and professionally, and I am grateful for that on an almost \n     daily basis. And I often find myself wishing everyone had a \n     similar opportunity, to learn about shared dependence, \n     loyalty, responsibility to and for others, about mutual \n     respect and honor, and about the power of appealing to the \n     best that's in us as human beings, not the worst.\n       As a journalist, there has been one overriding effect of my \n     Marine experience: While debates over sending Americans into \n     harm's way are always about issues of foreign policy, \n     geopolitics and sometimes even politics-politics, for me, \n     they are also always about young lance corporals and second \n     lieutenants and other very real people in all branches of the \n     U.S. military, people with names, ranks, serial numbers, \n     faces, families, and futures that may never be.\n       When Marines stand for or sing the Marines' hymn, as we \n     will at the conclusion of this ceremony, it's never for \n     ourselves personally. It's always for the Marines who went \n     before us, with us, and after us, first and foremost for \n     those who gave their lives,\n\n[[Page S11048]]\n\n     their health, their everything at places such as Tripoli, \n     Belleau Wood, Haiti, Wake Island, Guadalcanal, Peleliu, Iwo \n     Jima, Chosin, Inchon, Danang, Khe Sahn, Beirut, and Baghdad, \n     Fallujah and Ramadi.\n       The death rate among Marines in Iraq has been more than \n     double that of the other services. That's a first-to-fight, \n     first-wave pattern that has pretty much held since the \n     Revolutionary War, when 49 of the very first U.S. Marines of \n     our country died in combat. Their mission was aboard ship; \n     there are still Marines who serve at sea.\n       There are others who fly and maintain jets and helicopters, \n     man the artillery, operate tanks and trucks, feed and supply \n     the troops, compute and collate, train and inspect, march and \n     make music, recruit, guard and escort, radio and communicate, \n     patrol and snipe, as well as save tsunami, earthquake and \n     other disaster victims around the world, collect toys at \n     Christmastime for American kids in need, stage a marathon run \n     through Washington, D.C., for charity, or do whatever else \n     needs to be done, particularly if the need is for it to be \n     done well and be done immediately.\n       We are the Marines. And in the language of the rifle range, \n     we are always ready on the right, ready on the left, all \n     ready on the firing line, whatever kind of firing is \n     required, and wherever that line may be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11048-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CELEBRATING THE 99TH INFANTRY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this past August, the surviving members of \nthe 99th Infantry Division met together in Fort Mitchell, KY. Of this \ndivision, only a few remain. But the survivors and their widows \ngathered in August to complete the final chapter of the story of this \nexceptional group of Americans.\n  The Battle of the Bulge is well known to most Americans, but the \nefforts and triumphs of the 99th Infantry are less well recognized. \nThese men played a crucial role in the eventual Allied victory, though \nfew knew it at the time. This battle is best described by Professor \nStephen Ambrose, the preeminent World War II historian who provides a \nsnapshot of their efforts in an article in the Military History \nQuarterly. Ambrose describes the scene along Elsenborn Ridge:\n\n       To the north, between Monschau and Losheim, the U.S. 99th \n     Infantry Division, newly arrived in Europe, and the 2nd \n     Infantry Division . . . did not simply delay the German \n     advance but stopped it along the critical point of the whole \n     battle, Elsenborn Ridge. The low ridge . . . was the main \n     objective of Sepp Dietrich's 6th Panzer Army. Elsenborn Ridge \n     was the Little Round Top of the battle. The German General \n     Dietrich drove his units mercilessly, but he could not take \n     it due to the steadfastness of the American resolve and the \n     sheer courage of these brave men facing the ultimate test in \n     brutal conditions.\n\n  Ambrose adds,\n\n       ``In the vast literature of the Battle of the Bulge, \n     Elsenborn Ridge always yields pride of place to the far more \n     famous action . . . at Bastogne. Everyone knows about the \n     101st Airborne at Bastogne; almost no one knows even the \n     names of the 99th and 2nd Infantries. Yet it was along \n     Elsenborn Ridge . . . that these two ordinary infantry \n     divisions, largely out of touch with their commands, \n     outnumbered 5 to 1 and worse, outgunned and surprised, \n     managed to stop the Germans in their main line of advance. \n     The Germans never did take the Ridge.\n\n  Their heroic stand at Elsenborn Ridge helped turn the tide at the \nBattle of the Bulge, where we suffered some 80,000 casualties. Although \nmany of the 99th have passed on, their tradition remains strong, \nespecially among their descendents.\n  Mr. George Pedersen, a distinguished Virginia businessman, is the \nnephew of 99th Infantry soldier, SGT Arnie Goa. Like most of his fellow \nsoldiers of this little known but critically important action, Sergeant \nGoa has passed into history, but his legacy lives on, and George \nPedersen thought it important to commemorate his uncle and the soldiers \nof the 99th, so he volunteered to underwrite the reunion, paving the \nway for the remaining soldiers and their families to meet, exchange \nstories, and complete that final chapter of distinguished service to \ntheir Nation.\n  Many of these fine men may have passed, but in a very real sense, \nSergeant Goa's spirit, and the spirit of his fellow soldiers, lives on \nin the lives and sacrifices of our young men and women in uniform who \nserve our country today. I know that these veterans of that long ago \nbattle would all be immensely proud of those who now follow in their \nfootsteps. I commend these veterans and their families for their great \ncontribution to each of us, and I commend Mr. Pedersen for his \ncontribution to their memories.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11048-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SUBMITTAL OF INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE REPORT\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate National \nAdoption Day.\n  As a mother, I understand the joy and the meaning that raising a \nchild can bring to one's life. I also understand the importance that a \nstable home can play in a child's development. Each year, National \nAdoption Day offers us all an opportunity to not only reflect on the \nbenefits that adoption can bring but also to raise awareness of the \nthousands of children across our Nation who are still awaiting stable, \nnurturing, and loving homes and families.\n  Last year, 227 events were held on National Adoption Day in 45 \nStates. In the process, over 3,000 adoptions were finalized. At \nSaturday's celebration in Hot Springs, AR, and at similar events across \nthe country, we all hope to build on that success as hundreds of \nvolunteers take time out of their schedules to help place children in \npermanent homes.\n  In my State of Arkansas, our judges, courts, and child advocates have \nworked tirelessly on behalf of our State's foster children. In \nconsultation with them and in cooperation with my colleagues, I have \ndone all I can to ensure our adoption process is as efficient as \npossible. With an estimated 118,000 children across our country in \nfoster care and awaiting adoption, I urge my colleagues to continue \nworking together on behalf of these children. The opportunity to grow \nup in a nurturing, loving, and stable family is something that none of \nus should take for granted. It is our duty in this Congress to ensure \nthat these children are not denied this opportunity but given timely \nplacement with the home and the family that each and every one of them \ndeserve.\n  I would also like to once again express my support and offer my \nheartfelt gratitude not only to the volunteers in Arkansas and across \nthe country who make National Adoption Day the success it is but also \nto the selfless men and women who work every day on behalf of America's \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11048-4", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11048-S11049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INFLAMMATORY BREAST CANCER\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to make my colleagues aware \nof inflammatory breast cancer, IBC, the least common but most \naggressive type of breast cancer. Although IBC accounts for 1 to 5 \npercent of all breast cancer cases in the United States, it is an \nespecially aggressive and rare form of breast cancer.\n  The unique symptoms of IBC can result in misdiagnoses or late \ndiagnoses. IBC often presents with similar symptoms as mastitis, a type \nof breast infection. The disease also occurs more frequently in younger \nwomen. Physicians may believe these young women are at lower risk for \nbreast cancer and might misdiagnose their symptoms. Unfortunately, \nthese delays in correct diagnosis result in the sad fact that IBC is \nmore likely to have metastasized at the time of diagnosis than non-\n\n[[Page S11049]]\n\nIBC cases. IBC is also an especially aggressive form of breast cancer. \nAs a result, the survival rate for patients with IBC is significantly \nlower than those with non-IBC breast cancer.\n  These sobering facts tell us that education and awareness about this \nrare cancer are desperately needed so that women are quickly and \nproperly diagnosed. My home State of Washington is making important \nstrides in this direction. In fact, Washington State recently \ncelebrated Inflammatory Breast Cancer Awareness Week, thanks to the \nforesight of Governor Christine Gregoire and the hard work of \nWashington's IBC advocates. This special observance goes a long way in \nraising awareness about IBC in my home State.\n  Efforts such as Washington State's awareness week are a good start, \nbut more education and awareness are needed for both patients and their \nphysicians. We also must increase access to screening, especially for \nlow-income women. One important step that Congress can take to increase \nthese efforts is to pass S. 1687, the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection Program Reauthorization Act of 2005. For all \ntypes of breast cancer--but especially for IBC--early detection is \ncritical to catching cancer early before it spreads. I am working with \nChairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy to bring this bill up for a \nvote in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and it is \nmy hope that we can pass this bill before the end of the 109th \nCongress.\n  In closing, I commend the efforts of Governor Gregoire and the IBC \nadvocates in Washington State. I am committed to making the Federal \nGovernment a strong partner in these efforts by increasing awareness \nand access to screening. Together, we can help ensure that every woman \ngets screened for breast cancer and that she and her doctor have access \nto the latest medical research.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of the proclamation from Washington State to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, except for nonmelanoma skin cancers, breast cancer \n     is the most common cancer among woman, and is the second \n     leading cause of cancer death in women, exceeded only by lung \n     cancer; and\n       Whereas, Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) is the most \n     aggressive form of breast cancer and has a faster doubling \n     time than other breast cancers; and\n       Whereas, the total number of breast cancer cases diagnosed \n     for 2005 was 210,000, and of that number, six percent were \n     IBC; and\n       Whereas, symptoms of IBC are similar to those of mastitis, \n     a benign breast infection, and because IEC usually grows in \n     nests or sheets rather than a solid tumor, it can spread \n     throughout the breast without a detectable lump. It is \n     usually not detected by mammograms or ultrasounds unless \n     there is a defined tumor; and\n       Whereas, laboratory based research on IBC has been limited \n     because little, if any, pretreatment tumor tissue is \n     available for research; and\n       Whereas, we recognize the courage and strength of women \n     battling IBC, and the families and friend's who love and \n     support them, and our state is grateful for the hard work and \n     commitment of our dedicated researchers and medical \n     professionals; and\n       Whereas, with continued effort, we can raise any awareness \n     of IBC and find new ways to prevent and treat this deadly \n     disease;\n       Now, therefore, I, Christine O. Gregoire, Governor of the \n     state of Washington, do hereby proclaim October 1-7, 2006, as \n     Inflammatory Breast Cancer Awareness Week in Washington \n     State, and I urge all citizens to join me in this special \n     observance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11049-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PRESERVING CRIME VICTIMS' RESTITUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nFeinstein and cosponsor the Preserving Crime Victims' Restitution Act \nof 2006.\n  When a criminal defendant pleads guilty or is found guilty by a jury \nof his peers but dies before sentencing or while his case is on appeal, \nthe defendant's victims should not sustain a financial loss and the \ndefendant's estate should not profit from his crimes. The judicially \ncreated doctrine of abatement provides, however, ``that the death of a \ncriminal defendant pending an appeal of his or her case abates, ab \ninitio, the entire criminal proceeding.''\n\n  In its most extreme form, the scope of the doctrine can be \nbreathtaking. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held \nin United States v. Parsons:\n\n       [T]he appeal does not just disappear, and the case is not \n     merely dismissed. Instead, everything associated with the \n     case is extinguished, leaving the defendant ``as if he had \n     never been indicted or convicted.''\n\n  Common sense requires that punishments like imprisonment or \nprobationary supervision terminate once a defendant dies. But when a \ncriminal conviction involves remedial measures such as restitution to \nthe victims of the crime or implicates civil forfeiture of property \nconnected with the crime, we shouldn't pretend that nothing ever \nhappened. A convicted defendant's death while his case is pending may \ncheat the hangman, and it may cheat the jailer--but it shouldn't cheat \nthe victims.\n  Taking a criminal case to trial and obtaining a conviction can \ninvolve thousands of hours of work and a huge commitment of resources. \nIn the recent conviction of Ken Lay, for example, the trial took nearly \n4 months and cost the taxpayers millions of dollars. When a criminal \nconviction involves financial restitution to the victims of the crime \nor when the conviction could be used in a later civil law suit, those \neffects of the conviction should not be erased by the death of the \ndefendant. It is wrong to force the victims or the government to start \nover from scratch.\n  The Preserving Crime Victims' Restitution Act addresses the \nunnecessary and unfair effects of the abatement doctrine. It preserves \nrestitution and the potential use of a criminal conviction. in later \ncivil proceedings such as civil forfeiture, while protecting a \ndefendant's rights.\n  If a defendant dies after pleading guilty or being found guilty by a \njury, restitution and the use of the conviction in civil proceedings \nwill be permitted. In such cases, the bill allows the defendant's \nestate to step into his shoes and continue to defend the conviction. \nThe estate can appear on behalf of the defendant at sentencing, and it \ncan file post-trial motions. The estate can also appeal the conviction.\n  This assures that the integrity of the criminal and appellate process \nis preserved and that there is an adequate opportunity to challenge the \nvalidity of a conviction and ensure that justice has been done. \nBasically, under this bill, the criminal and appellate process move \nforward with respect to restitution and use of a conviction in later \ncivil proceedings just as though the defendant were still alive.\n  Ultimately, the Preserving Crime Victims' Restitution Act is about \nfairness. It is fair to victims--who too often get overlooked in the \ncriminal process. It is fair to the Government--which may have \ncommitted enormous time and resources to obtaining a conviction. And it \nis fair to the defendant's estate--which should be allowed to represent \nthe defendant's interests and contest the Government's case but should \nnot be allowed to profit from crime simply because a defendant dies.\n  I hope we can move quickly to pass the Preserving Crime Victims' \nRestitution Act of 2006, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11049-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11049-S11051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HELP COMMITTEE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the message from this election is clear. \nThere is little doubt that the American people want a change of course \nin Iraq. But they also want a government that stands with them and \ntheir families as they look to the future--jobs that reward their hard \nwork, health care that is good and affordable, and education that \ncontinues to open the door to the American dream for all of our \ncitizens.\n  That was the agenda of the voters in this election and it will be the \nagenda of our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee when we \nconvene in the new year. And with Senator Reid as our majority leader, \nAmerica's families will see great progress on the issues that they care \nmost about.\n  Yesterday, Democrats selected the membership of our committee. Every \nmember is an experienced legislator with a deep commitment to working \nfamilies and a solid record for getting things done.\n  So I welcome back Senator Dodd, Senator Harkin, Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Murray, Senator Jack Reed, and Senator \nClinton. And I welcome our new members:\n\n[[Page S11050]]\n\nSenator Obama, Senator-elect Sanders, and Senator-elect Brown.\n  I am also grateful to continue working together with Chairman Enzi. \nThe gavel may change hands, but our partnership will not. He is a true \nleader and has set the standard for fairness and statesmanship, and I \nlook forward to working with him on the many issues before the \ncommittee in the next Congress.\n  My first priority will be to increase the minimum wage. Americans are \nworking harder than ever, but millions of hard-working men and women \nacross the country aren't getting their fair share. We are not \nrewarding work fairly anymore, and working families are falling behind.\n  The minimum wage has been stuck at $5.15 an hour for almost 10 years. \nA minimum wage worker who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year still \nmakes just $10,700 a year--$6,000 below the poverty line for a family \nof three. In this era of skyrocketing costs, these hard-working \nAmericans are forced to make impossible choices--between paying the \nrent or buying food, between paying for gas or paying the doctor.\n  Americans understand fairness, and they know this is unfair. That is \nwhy the American people took the battle into their own hands this year. \nThey pounded the pavements for months to put minimum wage increases on \nthe ballot in six States this year. And all six of these ballot \ninitiatives passed by decisive margins. If there is one message from \nthis election that emerged loud and clear, it is that no one who works \nfor a living should have to live in poverty.\n  Raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour will benefit almost 15 \nmillion Americans. It will help more than 7.3 million children whose \nparents will receive a raise.\n  Minimum wage workers serve in many of the most difficult and most \nimportant jobs in our society. They care for children in day care \ncenters, and for the elderly in nursing homes. They clean office \nbuildings, hotel rooms, and restaurants across the country. They are \nmen and women of dignity, and they deserve a fair wage that respects \nthe dignity of their work. It is long past time to give minimum wage \nworkers a raise.\n  Another high priority is to remove the barriers to lifesaving stem \ncell research.\n  We are in the era of the life sciences, and no area of medical \nresearch has more promise than stem cell research to speed the search \nfor new cures for diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, cancer, and many other \nserious illnesses.\n  Thanks to the courage of leaders such as Michael J. Fox, the people \nof Missouri last week chose hope over fear by approving a \nconstitutional amendment to allow stem cell research.\n  Congress should learn from that example. Last year, a broad \nbipartisan majority approved legislation to tear down the barriers that \nhave kept NIH scientists from realizing the full potential of this \nresearch. That bill was rejected by the President, but hope can never \nbe vetoed.\n  We will be back again and again next year until we succeed in \noverturning the restrictions on stem cell research that hinder the \nsearch for new cures, and delay the day when the hope of a better \nfuture becomes a reality for patients across America.\n  We must also address the crisis in college affordability that affects \nevery low and middle income family and that threatens our economic \nprogress. It is more important than ever for our citizens to have a \ncollege education so they can compete in the global economy and have a \nfair chance at the American Dream. But because of soaring college \ncosts, stagnant student aid and heavy student loan debt, it is becoming \nincreasingly difficult for our citizens to get such an education.\n  Today, students and families are pinching every penny to save for \ncollege--but it is not enough. Each year, 400,000 low-income students \ndo not attend a 4-year college because of cost factors. Student debt is \nalso a barrier to the pursuit of vital but lower-paying professions \nlike teaching, public health, and social work.\n  Last year, we passed an increase in student aid through the Senate \nonly to see our proposals die in the House. With the House and Senate \nunder new management, next year we will provide needed help to families \nstruggling to put their children through college.\n  We will increase Pell Grants from $4,050 to $5,100. We will cap \ncollege loan payments to no more than 15 percent of your income. We \nwill cut student loan interest rates. We will reform the student loan \nprogram so it works for students and not just the banks. And we will \nuse the savings to increase student aid.\n  And at long last, we can no longer ignore the need for health care \nreform. We must reduce the cost of health and we must make it available \nto each and every American.\n  Every Member of the Senate, and their staffs, and every Federal \nemployee has a sense of security about health care that is denied to \nmillions of Americans. Members of Congress know that if we get sick, or \nif our children need medical care, our health insurance plan will cover \nvirtually all of the costs.\n  Tens of millions of our fellow citizens have no such guarantee. \nNearly 50 million Americans lack health care coverage entirely, and \ntens of millions more have inadequate coverage. In a nation with the \nbest doctors and finest hospitals in the world, it is profoundly wrong \nthat so many Americans suffer from illnesses that could have been \nprevented or treated more effectively--if only health care had been \navailable and affordable.\n  The time is long overdue to address the crisis in health care. \nBipartisan health care reform is possible, and our first step toward it \nshould be effective legislation to strengthen and reauthorize CHIP, the \nprogram that provides quality health care for 4 million children.\n  But our experience with health reform in Massachusetts showed that we \ncan do more. We proved that people from all parts of the political \nspectrum can come together to provide health care for all. So this, \ntoo, is one of our top goals for the coming Congress.\n  Together, we can--we must--make the promise of this century of the \nlife sciences a reality for all Americans by seeing that every American \nhas quality, affordable health care.\n  These are our top priorities for the new year, but they are not our \nonly priorities.\n  We must pass the CLASS Act and create a long-term care infrastructure \nin this country that will support every American's choice to live at \nhome and be part of their community. Every older or disabled American \nhas this right, and it is our job in Congress to provide them with the \nsupport they need to make this a reality.\n  We will strengthen early learning opportunities, starting at birth, \nfor each of our children. Prevention works in health care and it can \nwork in education as well.\n  We must also ensure that our schools are equipped to meet the \nchallenges of the global economy. Our Nation's future depends on many \nthings, but certainly one of the most important measures of the \nstrength of our democracy is the excellence of our public schools. This \nyear, we will revisit the reforms contained in the No Child Left Behind \nAct.\n  The law charted a sound course for American education four years ago, \nbut it is time for us to reshape our commitment and provide better \nsolutions for schools to respond to the challenges identified by the \nlaw. These reforms are right and we're ready to work with President \nBush, as we did 5 years ago. But given the many failures of \nimplementation by his administration and the meager commitments to \neducation reform in his budgets, the President has a high hurdle to \ncross to demonstrate that he is seriously committed to these reforms.\n  In addition, we must give workers a stronger voice in their own \nfutures and in meeting the needs of their families. We must protect \nworkers' right to join together and fight for better wages and working \nconditions, free from employer intimidation. Workers need opportunities \nto improve their skills through job training programs. And families \ndeserve paid sick days to care for loved ones without fear of losing \ntheir jobs.\n  Americans who have worked a lifetime to provide for their families \ndeserve to retire in dignity, not in poverty. We must ensure our \nretirement system works for all Americans, not just corporate \nexecutives.\n  We can make bipartisan progress, too, on measures that will improve\n\n[[Page S11051]]\n\nhealth care and reduce costs--not by denying services to patients, but \nby improving efficiency and effectiveness. Congress should aid doctors, \nhospitals, and patients to improve their use of electronic medical \nrecords, and we should explore responsible ways to reward the quality \nof health care, not just the quantity of care.\n  And we must fulfill our duty through our hearings and our legislative \nprogram to ensure that Government is working for the people, that we \nhave strong laws to keep workers safe on the job and that workers are \nfairly paid, that student loans work for students and not just the \nbanks, that students are protected from exploitation in the private \nstudent loan market, that prescription drugs we rely on and the food we \neat are safe, that the workers that risked their lives for others on 9/\n11 are cared for as they deal now with the illness and injury.\n  These will be my priorities as chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee next year. They come directly out of this \nelection where the American people spoke loud and clear. And I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to make important progress for \nAmerica's families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11051-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I remain deeply concerned about rising \ninstability and growing tension in Somalia. It is becoming clear that \nefforts to date have failed to sufficiently address the stand off \nbetween the Islamic courts and the transitional federal government, \nTFG, and now new tension between Ethiopia and Eritrea is threatening to \nengulf the entire region in a costly and devastating conflict. \nUnfortunately, rising instability in Somalia is having a direct effect \non stability throughout the region and, if left unchecked, will have a \nsignificant impact on our national security and the security of our \nfriends and allies.\n  As I have said many times before, it is imperative that the U.S. \nGovernment begin playing a leadership role in helping to stabilize \nSomalia and the region and that it do so immediately. We need a \ncomprehensive approach to engaging with regional actors, the \ninternational community, and the U.N. to find a permanent solution to \nthis crisis. Such an approach will contribute to stability throughout \nthe Horn of Africa and to our national security.\n  We can't do this successfully, of course, unless we create a \ncomprehensive approach and apply sufficient resources and attention to \nthis growing problem. I was pleased when the Senate passed an amendment \nI offered to the Defense authorization bill a few months ago that calls \nfor a comprehensive strategy for establishing long-term stability in \nSomalia. I believe, as do a number of colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, that the United States must develop a comprehensive strategy for \nSomalia that utilizes all facets of its power and capability and must \nramp up its diplomatic efforts throughout the region and the \ninternational community to bring this crisis to an end.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has yet to appoint a senior \ncoordinator for Somalia to pull together a strategy and to engage \nfulltime with international and regional partners in addressing this \ncrisis. There also appears to be a reluctance to put in place \nadditional personnel and resources needed to help execute this strategy \nand to contribute to international efforts to bring about a lasting \npeace throughout the region. Frustratingly, there has been reluctance \namong administration officials to work closely with Congress to \nidentify what additional resources are needed to address changing \nconditions in Somalia. I have asked repeatedly for a description of \nneeded resources and support that we in the U.S. Congress can provide \nto help address instability in Somalia and have yet to receive a \nsufficient response.\n  Meanwhile, conditions in Somalia are becoming more complex and more \ntroubling. According to a new United Nations report released this week, \nboth the ICU and the TFG are obtaining support from a range of outside \nactors. If this is true, it signals a dangerous mix of regional and \ninternational meddling that could ignite the entire region into a \ndevastating conflict. Recent statements by leaders throughout the \nregion, too, suggest that specific countries may be prepared to \nintervene outside of the context of a political solution or coordinated \ninternational intervention.\n  Our objectives must not be too lofty: we cannot hope to turn Somalia \ninto a peaceful and established democracy overnight. But we do need to \nestablish realistic goals and objectives and address this problem with \naggressive diplomacy and engagement--in Somalia, Nairobi, Addis Ababa, \nNew York, Brussels, Asmara, and throughout the Middle East. We must \nwork diligently to establish a robust political framework within which \nboth Somalia-specific and regional concerns can be addressed, and that \nwill help facilitate a broader arrangement that takes into account the \nrange of actors involved in this crisis. This framework must be \nsupported by the international community and key regional actors. It \nmust also take into consideration the very real security concerns of \nSomalia's neighbors.\n  Unfortunately, we have very little time. Conditions continue to \ndeteriorate, and we can't count on weak diplomatic efforts to get us \nwhat we need. Instability in Somalia has very real national security \nimplications for our country. Somalia remains what it has been for \nyears: a haven for known al-Qaida operatives and terrorist networks and \ncriminal networks that threaten U.S. interests. As we learned in \nAfghanistan, we cannot ignore the conditions that breed and empower \nextremist and terrorist organizations. Accordingly, it is essential \nthat we treat instability in Somalia like the true threat that it is. \nWe need to act quickly and decisively and as if American lives depend \non it. They do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11051-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11051-S11052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CELEBRATION OF THE 80TH BIRTHDAY OF EARL HOLDING\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dynamic \nman, my constituent, a loyal friend, loving husband and father, and a \nhighly successful businessman--Mr. Earl Holding. Earl is reaching a \nwonderful milestone, his 80th birthday, and I couldn't let this \noccasion pass without honoring him for the good he has accomplished \nthroughout his life.\n  Earl has accomplished feats in business in Utah and throughout our \nNation that few have ever achieved. He has made a lasting imprint on \nmany industries including petroleum, ranching, and the travel and hotel \nindustry. His work ethic, and inspirational leadership has literally \ntransformed the business landscape of our State. His acumen and \ntenacity are legendary and are admired by many.\n  Earl has not been alone in his success. In 1949, Earl married his \nbusiness partner, Carol Orme, and together they embarked on a \nremarkable life journey. These two humble individuals worked together \nto forge something real and lasting in all aspects of their lives. A \nstory is told of their early years that I believe poignantly displays \nthe dedication they both have always demonstrated. Their wedding night \nat the Temple Square Hotel in Salt Lake City reached an early end when \nthey left at 5:00 a.m. to take their irrigation turn at their orchard.\n  In 1952, Earl and Carol accepted the responsibility of managing and \ninvesting in Little America, a service station and motel located in a \nremote area of western Wyoming. At the time Little America was \nunprofitable. In just 2 short years, through hard work, perseverance, \nand tenacity, the Holdings were able to turn Little America into the \nlargest and highest volume service station in the United States.\n  From this beginning, the Little America Hotels and hotel properties \nled by Earl have became a favorite place for thousands of travelers \nthroughout the Western United States. In fact, in preparation for the \n2002 Winter Olympic Games, Earl personally undertook a mission to build \nthe first five-star hotel in Utah. His dream became a reality with the \ndevelopment and building of the Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City. \nThis property is truly ``grand.'' It is beautiful from the top to the \nbottom and is a wonderful testament to Earl's dedication to quality and \nservice.\n  Earl's contribution to the travel and recreation arena doesn't end \nwith his hotel properties. He also owns and manages the Snowbasin ski \narea in Utah, the home of several Olympic races during the 2002 Olympic \nWinter\n\n[[Page S11052]]\n\nGames; and the Sun Valley resort in Idaho, repeatedly named the No. 1 \nski resort in America.\n  Earl's business holdings also include a large petroleum portfolio \nanchored by his purchase of Sinclair Oil in 1976. His innovative \nleadership in the petroleum industry has enabled Sinclair Oil to grow \nand is now one of the largest privately held, full integrated oil \ncompanies in America.\n  His leadership and dedication have been recognized many times through \nnumerous awards and honors, including an honorary doctorate degree from \nthe University of Utah, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \nScholars of the Smithsonian Institution's Award for Corporate \nCitizenship, appointments to the U.S. Postal Commission and the Salt \nLake Olympic Organizing Committee, and as president of the American \nIndependent Refiners Association.\n  Another hallmark of Earl's life has been his commitment to the \nthousands of employees he has hired throughout the years. Each \nChristmas season, Earl and Carol take the time to express personally \ntheir gratitude to each one of their 7,000 employees.\n  A famous orator, John Wesley, once stated: ``Do all the good you can, \nby all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places \nyou can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long \nas ever you can.''\n  This describes Earl Holding. His good works accomplished through 80 \nyears will be acknowledged and felt for generations to come. He is a \nliving example of courage, commitment, and dedication. Hard work has \nnever deterred him, and integrity has always been his guiding beacon.\n  Mr. President, I consider it a great honor to call Earl Holding a \nfriend. He is an exceptional human being whose footprints will last for \nyears. His success has not been achieved with one single magnificent \naccomplishment but through a journey of good work and exceptional \nleadership. I pay tribute to him today and hope my colleagues will join \nwith me in wishing him a very happy 80th birthday!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11052-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RECOGNITION OF PROFESSORS OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

MILTON FRIEDMAN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to take the \nopportunity to honor the life of a great American economist, Dr. Milton \nFriedman, who passed away today.\n  In his 94 years, he lead an intellectual movement at the University \nof Chicago focused on the failure of government intervention in the \nmarket process, wrote extensively on both economics and public policy, \nserved on the President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force \nand the President's Commission on White House Fellows, served on \nPresident Ronald Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board, and served as \npresident of American Economic Association, the Western Economic \nAssociation, and the Mont Pelerin Society. Dr. Friedman was awarded the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, the National Medal of Science, and the \nNobel Prize in economic sciences.\n  Dr. Friedman was a prominent defender of the free market and small \ngovernment. A critic of the Federal Reserve, he argued that the \nmisguided\n\n[[Page S11053]]\n\npolicies of the directors of the Federal Reserve, through contraction \nof the money supply, prolonged and worsened the effects of the Great \nDepression.\n  I believe Dr. Friedman's greatness was not in being an academic but \nin taking economic principles, and his immovable convictions, to \neveryday people through his books, columns, public television series, \nspeeches, and television appearances.\n  To truly honor the life and achievements of Dr. Milton Friedman, we \nshould heed the lesson he dedicated much of his life to: the free \nsociety and the free economy are both essential and inseparable. In his \nbook ``Capitalism and Freedom,'' Friedman reminds us that, ``Economic \narrangements play a dual role in the promotion of a free society. On \nthe one hand, freedom in economic arrangements is itself a component of \nfreedom broadly understood, so economic freedom is an end in itself. In \nthe second place, economic freedom is also an indispensable means \ntoward the achievement of political freedom.''.\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I wish to note the passing \nand celebrate the life of Milton Friedman.\n  Nobel laureate Friedman was an economist whose work expanded academia \nto influence Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Alan Greenspan, Ben S. \nBernanke, and many others. If I may dare to join such company, he also \ninfluenced me.\n  Friedman argued that the goal of monetary policy should be long-term, \nstable growth in the supply of money. He championed individual \ninitiative and deregulation and influenced decisions from severing the \ndollar from gold to ending the military draft.\n  The Wall Street Journal today quoted Carnegie Mellon University \nProfessor Allan H. Meltzer as saying ``It's hard to think of anyone \nwho's had more of a direct influence on social and economic policy in \nthis generation.''\n  The PBS airing of his 10-part series ``Free to Choose,'' a defense of \nfree market economics, made a huge impression on me. I watched them all \nand learned much.\n  Friedman was born in 1912. After graduating from high school before \nhis 16th birthday, Friedman won a scholarship to Rutgers University. He \nlater studied at the University of Chicago, where he met his future \nwife, Rose Director. Friedman graduated with a master's degree from the \nUniversity of Chicago in 1933 and earned a doctorate from Columbia \nUniversity in 1946. He served as an economic adviser during Barry \nGoldwater's Presidential campaign, won the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom in 1988, and was most recently a senior research fellow at the \nHoover Institution.\n  His contribution to our country was vast, and I mourn his \npassing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11053-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MURRAY STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Murray \nState University in honor of their recognition by the annual U.S. News \nand World Report America's Best Colleges issue. By constantly striving \nfor academic excellence and inspiring their students to succeed, the \nfaculty of this institute of higher education continues to provide the \ntools needed to ensure a bright future for all graduates.\n  Every year, thousands of schools are surveyed by U.S. News, and the \nrankings are based on expert opinion about academic program quality and \nstatistics that measure the quality of a school's faculty, research, \nand students. The information gathered is consolidated and measured to \ndetermine individual college ranking in the final report.\n  Murray State University has a long history of academic excellence and \ncontinues to excel in enriching the academic careers of the students \nwho attend. The school was ranked sixth in the South as a ``Top \nPublic'' university. In addition, Murray was ranked 15th in the South \namong public and private universities in the individual category of \n``Best Masters Universities.'' The 10,000 students who attend this \nschool are ensured a successful academic career with diverse degree \nprograms and exceptional faculty support.\n  I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in congratulating Murray \nState University on their exceptional academic accomplishments. \nAchievements such as this bring great pride to the entire Bluegrass \nState. It is a true example of Kentucky at its finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11053-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

This is a prestigious program that \nhonors and awards the most influential undergraduate instructors in the \ncountry.\n  Since 1981, the U.S. Professors of the Year program has saluted \nexceptional professors who have demonstrated a heightened dedication to \nteaching, commitment to students, and creative instructional techniques \nand methods. The program is sponsored by the Council for the \nAdvancement and Support of Education which collaborates with multiple \nhigher-education associations to direct and promote the program.\n  As a professor of chemistry at Georgetown College in Georgetown, KY, \nDr. Wiseman uses innovative teaching methods to help his students \nunderstand the complexities of chemistry, a subject many find \nchallenging. He has developed games and animation exercises as well as \na unique grading system to address the diverse needs of his students. \nBy introducing and applying creative educating tactics along with \nstandard science research methods to assist his students, Dr. Wiseman \npersonifies everything an educator should strive for in their career.\n  I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in thanking Dr. Wiseman for \nhis dedication and commitment to the education of America's future. In \norder for our society to continue to advance in the right direction, we \nmust have professors like Dr. Wiseman in our institutions of higher \nlearning, in our communities, and in our lives.

For the past 9 years she has held the position of vice president, \nRAND Corporation, and director of Project AIR FORCE, one of the \nprincipal research divisions of this famous think tank.\n  For 60 years, Project AIR FORCE, originally called Project RAND, has \nprovided independent and objective analysis on issues of major concern \nto the U.S. Air Force. During her tenure as its director, Mrs. Crawford \nbuilt and sustained an outstanding research team, expanded the research \nagenda, and further cemented RAND's strategic relationship with the Air \nForce's senior leaders.\n  Among her many honors, Mrs. Crawford has twice been awarded the Air \nForce's Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service. In 2003, she \nreceived both the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Air Force \nAnalytic Community and the Lieutenant General Glenn Kent Leadership \nAward.\n  In October 2006, Mrs. Crawford stepped down from her administrative \nroles in Project AIR FORCE, but she will continue to act as a senior \nadvisor to RAND's chief executive officer and as a senior mentor on the \nUSAF Scientific Advisory Board, where she has served since 1988.\n  It is my pleasure and privilege to thank Natalie Crawford for her \nextraordinary contributions to preserving America's national security. \nThe dedication and energy she has shown in her four-decade career \ndemonstrate the highest ideals of service and commitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11053-4", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11053-S11054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING DR. DAVID E. JANSSEN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I honor Dr. David E. \nJanssen, who is retiring after an impressive career spanning 40 years \nas a public servant in the State of California.\n  Dr. Janssen is retiring as chief administrative officer of the county \nof Los Angeles where he has served with distinction since August 1996. \nI extend to him my sincere congratulations for the decades of dedicated \nservice that he has given to his Nation, his State, and his county.\n\n[[Page S11054]]\n\n  For the past decade, Dr. Janssen has played an invaluable role in \nhelping the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors accomplish its \nFederal and State legislative priorities.\n  While his many accomplishments are too numerous to list here, his \nmost recent efforts clearly demonstrate just how much he has meant to \nLos Angeles county and my State over his entire career.\n  Dr. Janssen has advocated closely on important Medicaid reform \nproposals and helped to improve the flexibility of Federal foster care \nfunds.\n  He coordinated and developed advocacy strategies with local \ngovernment and housing and community development groups in the Los \nAngeles region to protect vital community development block grant \nfunds.\n  Working to improve the county's health system, Dr. Janssen helped \nassure critical Federal funding guarantees and assisted in creating an \naction plan in the event of an avian flu epidemic. He also collaborated \nwith the State's congressional delegation, Governor Arnold \nSchwarzenegger, and the administration to secure funding for Martin \nLuther King/Charles R. Drew Medical Center--King/Drew--in south Los \nAngeles, preserving critical, life-saving services, and ensuring that \nthe patients served by King/Drew continue to have access to care.\n  In an issue that is of utmost importance to my State, he worked \nclosely with key administration officials and members of Congress to \nensure that Los Angeles Air Force Base would not be closed or \nrealigned.\n  In terms of homeland security, Dr. Janssen led the county in working \nto boost funding and increase the allocation of first responder grants \nto local governments. Likewise, he supported legislation to adopt a \nthreat-based formula that directs homeland security funds where they \nare needed most.\n  These are just some of Dr. Janssen's significant accomplishments on \nbehalf of Los Angeles county and the State of California. As he \nretires, I extend my gratitude to him for his many contributions \nthroughout a distinguished career. With sincere best wishes, I \ncongratulate him upon his retirement from public service. I am pleased \nto join his many coworkers, family, friends, and associates in wishing \nhim health, happiness, and good fortune in all his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11054-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHUCK LARSON, SR.\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the joys of my job as a \nSenator is working closely with talented, dedicated Iowans from all \nwalks of life. One of those exceptional people is Chuck Larson, Sr., \nU.S. attorney for the Northern District of Iowa. With his retirement \nnext month, he will conclude an extraordinary career in public service \nspanning nearly four decades.\n  Chuck has dedicated his life to the law and public safety, as \ndirector of Iowa public safety in the 1970s, as a consultant in Saudi \nArabia to the Kingdom's Highway Patrol Project in the early 1980s, as \ndirector of the Governor's Office of Drug Control Policy, and as a \nmember of the President's Drug Free Communities Committee. In December, \nhe will complete two terms as U.S. attorney for the Northern District \nof Iowa.\n  My staff and I have worked closely with Chuck for many years. I could \ncite many examples of his leadership and professional excellence, but \none instance stands out in particular. Some time ago, my office was \ncontacted by members of an Iowa jurisdiction where various law \nenforcement agencies and key players in the community were not \ncommunicating effectively, leading to an increase in drug and gang \nactivity. My staff contacted Chuck, and he intervened in that community \npersonally and directly. He set up meetings with community members and \nlaw enforcement agencies and brought them together in a positive \nspirit. Today, that community is considered a national model for \ncooperation in the fight against drugs and gangs. And one thing that \nall groups in the community agree on is that it was Chuck's leadership \nand personal skills--going above and beyond his job description--that \nled to this success. Thanks to Chuck's work in that community and cross \nmy State, Iowa is a better, safer place to live, work, and raise a \nfamily. Indeed, there is no doubt in my mind that Chuck's dedicated \nwork is one big reason why Iowa has one of the lowest crime rates in \nthe United States.\n  One key to Chuck's success is that he speaks with the authority of a \nseasoned veteran of decades on the front line fighting crime and \nimproving public safety. Throughout his distinguished career, he has \nput public service above personal gain. We have all heard the saying \nthat ``you get what you pay for.'' But in Iowa, when it comes to U.S. \nattorneys, that is not the case. We get far better than we pay for. \nDespite modest salaries, Iowa has been blessed with U.S. attorneys of \nthe highest caliber. And most folks in Iowa know this and appreciate \nit. We hold our law enforcement professionals--from police officers \nright up to the highest ranking prosecutors--in special esteem. And we \nare grateful for the excellence, professionalism, and long hours that \nthey bring to their jobs.\n  I will miss Chuck's counsel and his can-do, cooperative attitude. My \nstaff and I have turned to him again and again over the years, and he \nhas never let us down. It has meant so much to be able to rely on \nsomeone of his caliber for authoritative answers and prompt action.\n  Though I am sorry to see Chuck go, I know how much he is looking \nforward to spending more time with his family--his wife Ellen and his \nchildren and grandchildren. I am grateful for his decades of truly \ndistinguished and brilliant public service, and I wish him the very \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11054-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REDFIELD FIRE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to remember the fire \nthat devastated the community of Redfield, SD, on November 16, 1986. \nThough there was a tragic loss of life and many families saw their \nproperty and possessions destroyed, the community was able to come \ntogether to help each other through those difficult times and to \nultimately rebuild and thrive.\n  The fire began sometime prior to 4:30 that morning and was reported \nby Dawn Waldner. Soon local police and firefighters were on the scene, \nbut the blaze proved uncontrollable. It was in the process of consuming \nan apartment building with 31 apartments and many of the downtown \nbusinesses in Redfield. The fire was so hot that it cracked the windows \nof any building in the vicinity of the flames. The Senior Citizens \nCenter, Crawford Furniture, Coast to Coast hardware, Blaine St. Clair's \nbusiness office, American Family Insurance, KQKD Radio, and a TV repair \nshop were among the businesses that were destroyed or damaged.\n  The day's greatest loss, however, was the life of young Rebecca \nNelson, who was just over a year old. She was trapped in the burning \napartment building, and though people on the scene made heroic efforts \nto save her, they could not discover her in time. Civilian Gene \nFreshour and police sergeant Dave Dosch both risked their lives by \ngoing into the building without masks to search for the child. \nFirefighters Bob Tiff, Jim Haider, Ron Eimers, and Rich Gruenwald \nformed a search team, also risking their lives, in the attempt to find \nRebecca. Despite the brave actions of all those involved in the effort, \nshe could not be rescued.\n  The fire burned so hot that firefighters said they could see the \nwater evaporating before it even hit the fire. The tar on the streets \nmelted, and ammunition in the hardware store was set off. By the time \nthe embers were cold, over a million gallons of water had been used \nputting it out. It wasn't long, though, before the community came \ntogether to start the hard work of healing and rebuilding.\n  With the help of two community development block grants, the city was \nable to purchase much of the damaged property. Over 580 truckloads of \ndebris were taken from the area, but new businesses have moved in and \nprospered. The site also is home to a memorial to Rebecca Nelson. There \nwill be a memorial service in memory of the events of the day on \nNovember 16, 2006, at Siegling's Parking Lot, near the Rebecca Nelson \nMemorial. I extend my deepest condolences to those who suffered losses \nin the fire and commend the community for their unity and perseverance \nin rebounding from this disaster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11054-3", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11054-S11055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BIGHORN CENTER TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nBighorn\n\n[[Page S11055]]\n\nCenter for Public Policy and to recognize the work of a great \nColoradan, the Bighorn Center's CEO and founder, Rutt Bridges.\n  The Bighorn Center for Public Policy was created in 1999 in an effort \nto provide Colorado with a truly nonpartisan organization that \nidentifies, develops, and advocates public policies to enrich the \nquality of life in the State of Colorado. Over the past 7 years, the \nBighorn Center has brought together leaders from both sides of the \naisle to find real solutions to Colorado's ever-changing public policy \nneeds.\n  Rutt Bridges is a close friend and colleague. He is a man who \nunderstands the value of hard work and authentic leadership, and it has \nbeen my pleasure to work with him over the years to improve Colorado.\n  More than 25 years ago, Mr. Bridges and his wife moved to Colorado \nand founded a small software company that used emerging computer \ntechnology to search for oil. With his ambition and intelligence, Mr. \nBridges revolutionized the oil exploration business. His small software \ncompany quickly grew from 3 employees to over 70. When he sold his \ncompany in 1994, he committed himself to doing good for Colorado, and \nhe has maintained that commitment to this day.\n  The Bighorn Center's list of accomplishments is impressive. As \nColorado attorney general, I worked with the Bighorn Center to develop \nthe Colorado Anti-Bully Project. The Bighorn Center and Mr. Bridges are \nmost well-known, however, for Colorado's telemarketing no-call list, \npassed in 2001 by Colorado's General Assembly. I am most proud of \nworking with Rutt and the Center to help develop this landmark consumer \nprotection law. Taking on special interests and supplying grassroots \npolitical pressure, the Bighorn Center was the driving force in making \nit easy for Coloradans to choose to block intrusive and unwanted \ntelemarketing calls.\n  Mr. Bridges and the Bighorn Center did not stop there and have often \nworked behind the scenes to encourage more campaign finance disclosure, \nconvene meetings to discuss Colorado's budget issues, and create a DNA \nfingerprinting database for all criminals.\n  The Bighorn Center also created the Bighorn Leadership Development \nProgram, directed by another distinguished Coloradan, Brenda Morrison. \nThis bipartisan program has effectively recruited and trained over 200 \nyoung leaders to work for a better Colorado.\n  I am proud of the accomplishments of the Bighorn Center for Public \nPolicy, and I applaud Mr. Bridges, Ms. Morrison, and other staff at the \nBighorn Center for their dedication to making Colorado a better place \nto live. While the Bighorn Center is closing its doors, its legacy and \nthe work of these civic-minded Coloradans will continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11055-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               ENROLLED BILL AND JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on November 16, 2006, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill and \njoint resolution:\n\n       H.R. 6326.

A bill to prohibit departments, agencies, and other \ninstrumentalities of the Federal Government from providing assistance \nto an entity for the development of course material or the provision of \ninstruction on human development and sexuality, if such material or \ninstruction will include medically inaccurate information, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce and discuss my \nbill, the ``Guarantee of Medical Accuracy in Sex Education Act.''\n  My bill would require that federally-funded sex education/abstinence \nonly programs contain medically accurate and factual information as \npart of any course instruction.\n  During the past few years, there has been an increase in the number \nof federally funded programs using curricula that provide medically \ninaccurate or misleading information.\n  Some of these medical inaccuracies include teaching young people that \nHIV can be transmitted by sweat and tears, citing failure rates of \ncondoms as high as 69 percent, as well as giving inaccurate symptoms \nand outcomes of sexually transmitted diseases. In addition, some \nfederally funded programs\n\n[[Page S11059]]\n\nprovided erroneous information about basic scientific facts, for \nexample, stating that human cells have 24 chromosomes from each parent \nwhen in fact the number is 23.\n  Inaccurate information regarding contraception and STD/HIV prevention \ncan make sex education both dangerous and counterproductive. \nResponsible sex education, by contrast, is an important component of a \nstrategy to reduce unintended pregnancies, decrease the number of \nabortions, and mitigate the incidence of STD's.\n  Instruction regarding sexual health and reproduction that includes \ninaccurate or biased information is not only irresponsible, but it is \nalso dangerous, and it puts our young people at risk for unintended \npregnancy and disease.\n  I urge my colleagues to support medically accurate sex-education--\nprograms that helps young people to develop the proper understanding of \ntheir sexuality, so they can make responsible decisions throughout \ntheir lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4059\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Guarantee of Medical \n     Accuracy in Sex Education Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) A 2006 Government Accountability Office report entitled \n     ``Abstinence Education: Efforts to Assess the Accuracy and \n     Effectiveness of Federally Funded Programs'' finds that the \n     Department of Health and Human Services does not review the \n     content of the major federally funded abstinence-only \n     education programs for accuracy.\n       (2) All federally funded programs aimed at helping young \n     people make healthy decisions regarding their relationships \n     and sexual health should include medically accurate \n     information.\n       (3) A 2004 report from the Minority Office of the Committee \n     on Government Reform of the House of Representatives found \n     serious medical inaccuracies associated with a large majority \n     of federally funded abstinence-only-until-marriage programs.\n       (4) The Society for Adolescent Medicine (SAM) found in a \n     2006 position paper that abstinence-only-until-marriage \n     programs ``provide incomplete and/or misleading information'' \n     and states that ``efforts to promote abstinence should be \n     based on sound science''.\n       (5) The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     have also expressed ``the importance of ensuring that all \n     federally funded sexuality education programs include \n     information that is medically accurate and complete''.\n       (6) The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) believes that \n     ``children and adolescents need accurate and comprehensive \n     education about sexuality to practice healthy sexual behavior \n     as adults''.\n       (7) The American Public Health Association (APHA) \n     ``recognize[s] that sexuality is a normal, healthy aspect of \n     human development . . . and that individuals of all ages \n     require complete and accurate information about all aspects \n     of sexuality''. APHA ``endorses the right of children and \n     youth to receive comprehensive sexuality education that \n     includes facts, information, and data and that demonstrates \n     an appreciation of racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity''.\n       (8) The American Medical Association ``urges schools to \n     implement comprehensive, developmentally appropriate \n     sexuality education programs that are based on rigorous, peer \n     reviewed science''.\n       (9) Over 1 billion dollars in citizen taxpayer money has \n     been spent on abstinence-only-until-marriage programs in the \n     past quarter century without significant monitoring of the \n     content of these programs in order to guarantee they contain \n     medically accurate information and exclude inaccurate data.\n\n     SEC. 3. MEDICALLY INACCURATE SEX EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Requirements.--A department, agency, or other \n     instrumentality of the Federal Government shall not provide \n     funds or other assistance to an entity for the development of \n     course material or the provision of instruction on human \n     development and sexuality, including any sex education, \n     family life education, abstinence education, comprehensive \n     health education, or character education, if such material or \n     instruction will include medically inaccurate information. \n     Before providing such funds or other assistance, the \n     department, agency, or instrumentality shall require a \n     sufficient assurance that such material or instruction will \n     not include medically inaccurate information.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this Act, the term ``medically \n     inaccurate information'' means information related to \n     medical, psychiatric, psychological, empirical, or \n     statistical statements that is unsupported or contradicted by \n     peer-reviewed research by leading medical, psychological, \n     psychiatric, and public health organizations and agencies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 4060. A bill to amend the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to \nimprove and enhance due process and appellate procedures, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President: I rise to introduce the Effective Terrorists \nProsecution Act of 2006. This legislation would make critically \nimportant changes to the measure that Congress narrowly approved on \nSeptember 29, the Mi1itary Commissions Act of 2006. Let me be clear \nfrom the outset of my remarks. I will take a backseat to no one when it \ncomes to defending our country against terrorism. I fully support the \nuse of military commissions to protect U.S. intelligence and expedite \njudicial proceedings vital to military action under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice. Unlike the Administration, I trust the United States \nmilitary and our legal system to arbitrate decisions related to enemy \ncombatants.\n  I strongly believe that terrorists who seek to destroy America must \nbe punished for any wrongs they commit against this country. But in my \nview, in order to sustain America's moral authority and win a lasting \nvictory against our enemies, such punishment must be meted out only in \naccordance with the rule of law.\n  My legislation provides essential legal tools for our war on terror \nin seven key ways: It restores the writ of habeas corpus for \nindividuals held in U.S. custody. It narrows the definition of unlawful \nenemy combatant to individuals who directly participate in hostilities \nagainst the United States who are not lawful combatants. It prevents \nthe use of evidence in court gained through the unreliable and immoral \npractices of torture and coercion. It empowers military judges to \nexclude hearsay evidence they deem to be unreliable. It authorizes the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to review decisions by the \nmilitary commissions. It limits the authority of the President to \ninterpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions and \nmakes that authority subject to congressional and judicial oversight. \nFinally, it provides for expedited judicial review of the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006 to determine the constitutionality of its \nprovisions.\n  Before I elaborate on each of these critical points, let me simply \nunderscore the point that for more than 200 years, our Nation has \nserved as a shining example in its promotion of civil and human rights \nthroughout the world. Denial of basic legal proceedings to individuals \nheld in the custody of the United States has raised questions over our \nbasic adherence to the U.S. Constitution and also diminished our \nreputation around the world. American citizens are questioning their \nown government's judgments, terrorists are citing American abuses to \nrecruit new loyalists, and American servicemembers fear detention \noverseas under similarly abusive conditions in violation of their human \nrights.\n  Supporters of the administration's law may say that to speak out \nagainst its enactment is being soft on terrorism. Not only is this \nsentiment wholly inaccurate, it underestimates a fundamental strength \nof our Nation and the best defense against terrorists--respect for the \nrule of law.\n  For instance, the administration-backed law eliminates the principle \nof habeas corpus which has served as the backbone of common law since \nbefore the Magna Carta in the 13th century. Under the writ of habeas \ncorpus independent courts may review the legality of custody decisions. \nMy legislation would restore this basic tenet in the context of \nmilitary commissions.\n  The administration's approach allows the President to remove anyone \nhe so chooses from America's standard jurisprudence and designate him \nor her as an ``unlawful enemy combatant'' if he has engaged in \nhostilities or supported hostilities against the United States. Such \nindividuals are subject to arrest and detention indefinitely without \ncharge. In contrast, my legislation allows the designation of \n``unlawful enemy combatants'' only for those individuals engaged in \narmed conflict against the United States. This provision seeks to \ncurtail potential abuse of the enemy combatant designation so that \nholding individuals in detention indefinitely without a trial will \nprove\n\n[[Page S11060]]\n\nto be the exception rather than the norm.\n  Also, unlike the law backed by the administration, my bill further \npromotes humane treatment of military personnel by prohibiting the use \nof evidence gained by coercion in a trial. Such a provision is \ncritically important for two reasons. First, the use of torture has \nbeen proven ineffective in interrogations when a detainee simply says \nwhat he believes an interrogator wants to hear in order to stop the \ntorture. Second it deprives foreign militaries the ability to cite U.S. \nactions to justify their own misconduct toward future American POWs.\n  My bill grants discretion to military judges to exclude hearsay \nevidence determined to be unreliable. Under my legislation, judges are \ngiven discretion in the event that classified evidence has a bearing on \nthe innocence of an individual, but is excluded due to national \nsecurity concerns and declassified alternatives are insufficient. \nAmerica's military judges have been fully trained and prepared to \nhandle classified information. The Bush administration's failure to \nrecognize this fact is an insult to the men and women of our military's \nbench and an affront to the U.S. military legal system. Moreover, my \nbill properly grants the Armed Forces judicial review of these \ndecisions unlike the administration's law which denies the United \nStates Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces the right to hearing \nmilitary commission appeals.\n  And, just as important as restoring our commitment in the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice, my legislation would also reaffirm America's \ncommitment to the contents of the Geneva Conventions. In contrast, the \nAdministration's Military Commissions Act gives unprecedented authority \nto the president to define what interrogation techniques constitute \n``grave breaches'' of the Geneva Conventions. The United States \nPresident should not have the right to unilaterally define the legal \nboundaries of torture. The United States Congress has ratified \nuniversally recognized conventions prohibiting such conduct, and the \nPresident should recognize them as the law of the land. Indeed, there \nis a lesson to be learned in the events of the last 6 years, \nparticularly in the case of Abu Ghraib, when not only was our Nation's \nreputation tarnished, but our commitment to the rule of law was \ncredibly called into question. This is not the America our Nation's \ngreatest generations have long fought for. Our country would have been \nbetter served if we had looked to the pages of history to guide us \nthrough this national crisis.\n  Just 60 years ago, the United States confronted the daunting task of \nbringing history's most despicable war criminals to justice. In \ndetermining how to deal with Nazi leaders guilty of grave atrocities, \nour country never forgot its pivotal role as the leader of the free \nworld. There were strong and persuasive voices crying for the execution \nof these men who had commanded, with ruthless efficiency, the slaughter \nof 6 million innocent Jews and 5 million other innocent men, women, and \nchildren. Why should these men who had extinguished so many lives be \ngiven a trial at all? Why should they not be subjected to the same fate \nto which they had subjected countless innocent people? Why not just \nshoot them, as Winston Churchill wanted? Why not just give in to legal \nscholars, who said there was no court, no judge, no laws, and no \nprecedent?\n  Why not? Because, as I have recounted on this floor on several \noccasions, America has always stood for something more. Our leaders at \nNuremberg, including the young prosecutor Thomas Dodd, my father, \nrejected the certainty of execution for the uncertainty of a trial. In \ndoing so, we reaffirmed the ideal that this Nation should never tailor \nits eternal principles to the conflict of the moment, because if we \ndid, we would be walking in the footsteps of the enemies we despised.\n  Almost 60 years to the day after the Nuremberg verdicts, Congress \npassed the Military Commissions Act, with the support of the \nadministration which steps away from the high principles established at \nNuremberg and honored in the decades since. In my view, this law has \ndishonored our Nation's proud history.\n  Indeed, to watch the Senate, on the anniversary of Nuremberg, negate \nthese great principles and traditions was one of the saddest days I \nhave seen in a quarter century of service in this body. It pains me to \nno end to have seen the administration and its allies rush this bill \nthrough Congress in the days before an election with hopes of \nexploiting Americans' fears of a terrorist attack. This administration \nwould have the American people believe that the war on terror requires \na choice between protecting America from terrorism and upholding the \nbasic tenets upon which our country was founded--but not both. This \ncanard is untrue and frankly negligent.\n  I believe that the United States Congress made a crucial mistake. And \nthat is why the final provision in my bill is perhaps the most \nimportant one--it will ensure that each of the provisions of the \nadministration's Military Commission Act is quickly reviewed by our \nNation's courts, and appropriately evaluated for their \nconstitutionality. I do not pretend to have all the answers regarding \nthe legality and probity of this highly controversial statute. But I \nbelieve it is essential for America's security and moral authority to \nallow those best qualified to make these judgments--members of our \nesteemed judiciary--to have an opportunity to overturn the most \negregious provisions of this Act.\n  In turn, we in Congress have our own obligation, to work in a \nbipartisan way to repair the damage that has been done, to protect our \ninternational reputation, to preserve our domestic traditions, and to \nprovide a successful mechanism to improve and enhance the tools \nrequired by the global war on terror.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the consequences if we fail to \ncorrect the mistakes that have been made. I hope that Congress and the \nadministration will take a serious look at my proposal and work with me \nto improve the current system, for the sake of our security, our \ninternational standing, and our commitment to the rule of law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4060\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Effective Terrorists \n     Prosecution Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to create, adopt, and implement rigorous and \nvoluntary American education content standards in mathematics and \nscience covering kindergarten through grade 12, to provide for the \nassessment of student proficiency bench marked against such standards, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Standards to \nProvide Educational Access for Kids (SPEAK) Act. This bill will create, \nadopt, and implement voluntary core American education content \nstandards in math and science while incentivizing states to adopt them.\n  America's leadership, economic, and national security rest on our \ncommitment to educate and prepare our youth to succeed in a global \neconomy. The key to succeeding in this endeavor is to have high \nexpectations for all American students as they progress through our \nnation's schools.\n  Currently there are 50 different sets of academic standards, 50 State \nassessments, and 50 definitions of proficiency under the No Child Left \nBehind Act. As a result of varied standards, exams and proficiency \nlevels, America's highly mobile student-aged population moves through \nthe nation's schools gaining widely varying levels of knowledge, skills \nand preparedness. And yet, in order for the United States to compete in \na global economy, we must strengthen our educational expectations for \nall American children--we must compete as one Nation.\n  Recent international comparisons show that American students have \nsignificant shortcomings in math and science. Many lack the basic \nskills required for college or the workplace. This affects our economic \nand national security: It holds us back in the global marketplace and \nrisks ceding our competitive edge. This is unacceptable.\n  America was founded on the notion of ensuring equity in opportunity \nfor all. And yet, we risk both when we allow different students in \ndifferent states to graduate from high school with very different \neducations. We live\n\n[[Page S11062]]\n\nin a Nation with an unacceptably high high school dropout rate. We live \nin a nation where 8th graders in some states score more than 30 points \nhigher on tests of basic science knowledge than students in other \nstates. I ask my colleagues today what equality of opportunity we have \nunder such circumstances.\n  This is where American standards come in. Voluntary, core American \nstandards in math and science are the first step in ensuring that all \nAmerican students are given the same opportunity to learn to a high \nstandard no matter where they reside. They will allow for meaningful \ncomparisons of student academic achievement across states, help ensure \nthat American students are academically qualified to enter college, or \ntraining for the civilian or military workforce, and, help ensure that \nstudents are better prepared to compete in the global marketplace. \nUniform standards are a first step in maintaining America's competitive \nand national security edge.\n  While I realize there will be resistance to such efforts, education \nis after all a state endeavor; we cannot ignore that at the end of the \nday America competes as one country on the global marketplace. This \ndoes not mean that I am asking States to cede their authority in \neducation. What the bill simply proposes is that we the convening power \nof the federal government to develop standards and then provide states \nwith incentives to adopt them.\n  At the end of the day, this is a voluntary measure. States will \nchoose whether or not to participate. States that do participate, while \nrequired to adopt the American standards, will be given the flexibility \nto make them their own. They will have the option to add additional \ncontent requirements, they will have final say in how coursework is \nsequenced, and, ultimately, States and districts will still be the ones \ndeveloping the curriculum, choosing the textbooks and administering the \ntests. The standards provided for under this legislation will simply \nserve as a common core.\n  Here is what the SPEAK Act will do. It will task the National \nAssessment Governing Board (NAGB) with creating rigorous and voluntary \ncore American education content standards in math and science for \ngrades K-12. It will require that such standards be anchored in the \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress' (NAEP) math and science \nframeworks. It will ensure that such standards are internationally \ncompetitive and comparable to the best standards in the world. It will \ndevelop rigorous achievement levels. It will ensure that varying \ndevelopmental levels of students are taken into account in the \ndevelopment of such standards. It will provide for periodic review and \nupdate of such standards. It will allow participating States the \nflexibility to add additional standards to the core. And, it \nestablishes an American standards Incentive Fund to incentivize states \nto adopt the standards. Among the benefits of participating is a huge \ninfusion of funds for states to bolster their K-12 data systems.\n  What I propose today is a first step. A first step in regaining our \ncompetitive edge. A first step in ensuring that all American students \nhave the opportunity to receive a first class, high-quality, \ncompetitive education. I am hoping that the bill I introduce today will \nat the very least spark a discussion. A discussion about what it is \nthat we want for future generations and how we will set along the path \nto get it to them.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the SPEAK Act \nand look forward to resuming the discussion and reintroducing this \nimportant initiative in the coming Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4061\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Standards to Provide \n     Educational Access for Kids Act'' or the ``SPEAK Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Throughout the years, educators and policymakers have \n     consistently embraced standards as the mechanism to ensure \n     that every student, no matter what school the student \n     attends, masters the skills and develops the knowledge needed \n     to participate in a global economy.\n       (2) Recent international comparisons make clear that \n     students in the United States have significant shortcomings \n     in mathematics and science, yet a high level of scientific \n     and mathematics literacy is essential to societal innovations \n     and advancements.\n       (3) With more than 50 different sets of academic content \n     standards, 50 State academic assessments, and 50 definitions \n     of proficiency under section 1111(b) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)), there is \n     great variability in the measures, standards, and benchmarks \n     for academic achievement in mathematics and science.\n       (4) Variation in State standards and the accompanying \n     measures of proficiency make it difficult for parents and \n     teachers to meaningfully gauge how well their children are \n     learning mathematics and science in comparison to their peers \n     internationally or here at home.\n       (5) The disparity in the rigor of standards across States \n     results in test results that tell the public little about how \n     schools are performing and progressing, as States with low \n     standards or low proficiency scores may appear to be doing \n     much better than States with more rigorous standards or \n     higher requirements for proficiency.\n       (6) As a result, the United States' highly mobile student-\n     aged population moves through the Nation's schools gaining \n     widely varying levels of knowledge, skills, and preparedness.\n       (7) In order for the United States to compete in a global \n     economy, the country needs to strengthen its educational \n     expectations for all children.\n       (8) To compete, the people of the United States must \n     compare themselves against international benchmarks.\n       (9) Grounded in a real world analysis and international \n     comparisons of what students need to succeed in work and \n     college, rigorous and voluntary core American education \n     content standards will keep the United States economically \n     competitive and ensure that the children of the United States \n     are given the same opportunity to learn to a high standard no \n     matter where they reside.\n       (10) Rigorous and voluntary core American education content \n     standards in mathematics and science will enable students to \n     succeed in academic settings across States while ensuring an \n     American edge in the global marketplace.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to freeze non-defense discretionary spending at \nfiscal year 2007 levels effective in fiscal year 2008; to the Committee \non the Budget.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am here to work on what should be an \narea of widespread, bipartisan agreement with the introduction of the \nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2006. Many, many people in both parties \nprofess the need to reduce our Government's spending. When I hear \nindividuals waxing poetic about the need for fiscal discipline, I \nusually offer a simple, one-sentence amendment to restore some \ndiscretionary spending discipline, but you should see my friends on the \nother side of the aisle run for the hills when someone proposes we \nactually do something about it. When the moment comes to move from mere \nwords to real action on fiscal discipline, over and over I have \nconfronted nearly united opposition to it on the other side of the \naisle.\n  Last year we did make some progress on our shared goal. We actually \nheld last year's non-security discretionary spending down below the \nrate of inflation. Let me repeat that: We actually held last year's \nnon-security spending, over which we had discretion, down below the \nrate of inflation.\n  Again, we are faced with the same task.\n  The President agrees that we must hold down spending and has proposed \nto hold down discretionary spending. The Budget Committee agrees we \nmust hold down spending and has proposed to hold down discretionary \nspending. The American people agree we must hold down spending. Senator \nDorgan has said that we need to provide spending cuts in a significant \nmanner. Senator Feingold has said, ``We also need to continue to cut \nspending in Federal programs. . . .'' Senator Levin stated how we need \nto cut spending when he advocated that ``Discretionary spending . . . \n[be] frozen for 5 years.'' It seems that both parties agree that we \nmust hold down discretionary spending.\n  Well, let's hold down discretionary spending.\n  I will read the one sentence that is really the entirety of this \nbill. I'm sure everyone in this body is familiar with it now--nearly \nall of my friends on the other side of the aisle have voted against it \ntwice in the last twelve months, usually at a time when they are \npromoting fiscal discipline. It says: ``Beginning with fiscal year 2008 \nand thereafter, all non-defense, non-trost-fund, discretionary spending \nshall not exceed the previous fiscal year's levels without a two-thirds \nvote.'' This is simply a cap on discretionary spending.\n  It is very simple, cut and dry, something that can pass. I hope those \nindividuals who have a more complicated approach to this will recognize \nthis is something that is doable.\n  I want to focus briefly on one point in the President's most recent \nbudget proposal. President Bush wisely sent us a budget that encourages \nlong-term fiscal constraint by including several budget process and \nprogram oversight reforms, including setting enforceable limits on \ntotal spending to stabilize budget growth in the long-term. Simply put, \nthe President proposes that we put in place a process by which we can \ncontrol discretionary spending.\n  I have been working on a solution to the massive problem of \ngovernment spending with this simple language for quite some time. I \nhave actually wanted to offer it previously on appropriations bills, \nbut held off. I offered it as an amendment last November and again this \nyear in March. It has been defeated every time I offer it--every single \ntime. It's usually defeated by nearly unanimous opposition on the other \nside of the aisle. And what's more, they usually vote against it in a \ndebate during which they cry foul of deficits and declare the need for \nfiscal restraint. It's astounding how much rhetoric we hear about the \nneed to hold down spending and the need for fiscal\n\n[[Page S11065]]\n\nrestraint. I guess for some, it truly is much easier said than done.\n  So, I am offering it again.\n  I will restate the crux of this bill, the Fiscal Responsibility Act \nof 2006, one more time before I close: ``Beginning with fiscal year \n2008 and thereafter, all non-defense, non-trust-fund, discretionary \nspending shall not exceed the previous fiscal year's levels without a \ntwo-thirds vote.'' Folks, it's that easy. I ask that you join me in \nholding down spending.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4062\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for additional section 8 vouchers, to \nreauthorize the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Affordable \nHousing Expansion and Public Safety Act to address some of the housing \naffordability issues faced by my constituents and by Americans around \nthe country, including unaffordable rental burdens, lack of safe and \naffordable housing stock, and public safety concerns in public and \nfederally assisted housing. My legislation is fully offset, while also \nproviding over $3 billion in deficit reduction.\n  Increasing numbers of Americans are facing housing affordability \nchallenges, whether they are renters or homeowners. But the housing \naffordability burden falls most heavily on low-income renters \nthroughout our country. Ensuring that all Americans have safe and \nsecure housing is about more than just providing families with \nsomewhere to live, however. Safe and decent housing provides children \nwith stable environments, and research has shown that students achieve \nat higher rates if they have secure housing. Affordable housing allows \nfamilies to spend more of their income on life's other necessities \nincluding groceries, health care, and education costs as well as save \nmoney for their futures. I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites \naround my State about their concerns about the lack of affordable \nhousing, homelessness, and the increasingly severe cost burdens that \nfamilies have to undertake in order to afford housing.\n  Unfortunately, affordable housing is becoming less, not more, \navailable in the United States. Research shows that the number of \nfamilies facing severe housing cost burdens grew by almost two million \nhouseholds between 2001 and 2004. Additionally, one in three families \nspends more than thirty percent of their earnings on housing costs. The \nNational Alliance to End Homelessness reports that at least 500,000 \nAmericans are homeless every day and two million to three million \nAmericans are homeless for various lengths of time each year. Cities, \ntowns, and rural communities across the country are confronting a lack \nof affordable housing for their citizens. This is not an issue that \nconfronts just one region of the Nation or one group of Americans. \nDecent and affordable housing is so essential to the well-being of \nAmericans that the Federal Government must provide adequate assistance \nto our citizens to ensure that all Americans can afford to live in safe \nand affordable housing.\n  Congress has created effective affordable housing and community \ndevelopment programs, but as is the case with many of the Federal \nsocial programs, these housing programs are inadequately funded and do \nnot meet the need in our communities. We in Congress must do what we \ncan to ensure these programs are properly funded, while taking into \naccount the tight fiscal constraints we are facing.\n  The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, originally created in \n1974, is now the largest Federal housing program in terms of HUD's \nbudget with approximately two million vouchers currently authorized. \nYet the current number of vouchers does not come close to meeting the \ndemand that exists in communities around our country. In my State of \nWisconsin, the city of Milwaukee opened up their Section 8 waiting list \nfor the first time since 1999 earlier this year for twenty four hours \nand received more than 17,000 applications. The city of Madison has not \naccepted new applications for Section 8 in over three years and reports \nthat hundreds of families are on the waiting list.\n  Unfortunately, situations like this exist around the country. \nAccording to the 2005 U.S. Conference of Mayors Hunger and Homelessness \nSurvey, close to 5,000 people are on the Section 8 waiting list in \nBoston. Detroit has not taken applications for the past two years and \ncurrently has a waiting list of over 9,000 people. Phoenix closed its \nwaiting list in 2005 and reported that 30,000 families were on its \nwaiting list. In certain cities, waiting lists are years long and \naccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the typical \nwaiting period for a voucher was two and a half years in 2003. Given \nthese statistics, it is clear there is the need for more Section 8 \nvouchers than currently exist.\n  While there are certainly areas of the Section 8 program that need to \nbe examined and perhaps reformed, a number of different government \nagencies and advocacy organizations all cite the effectiveness of \nSection 8 in assisting low-income families in meeting some of their \nhousing needs. In 2002, the Government Accountability Office determined \nthat the total cost of a one-bedroom housing unit through the Section 8 \nprogram costs less than it would through other federal housing \nprograms. The same year, the Bipartisan Millennial Housing Commission \nreported to Congress that the Section 8 program is ``flexible, cost-\neffective, and successful in its mission.''\n  The Commission further stated that the vouchers ``should continue to \nbe the linchpin of a national policy providing very low-income renters \naccess to the privately owned housing stock.'' The Commission also \ncalled for funding for substantial annual increments of vouchers for \nfamilies who need housing assistance. This recommendation echoes the \ncalls by advocates around the country, many of whom have called for \n100,000 new, or incremental, Section 8 vouchers to be funded annually \nby Congress.\n  My bill takes this first step, calling for the funding of 100,000 \nincremental vouchers in fiscal year 2007. I have identified enough \nfunds in my offsets to provide money for the renewal of these 100,000 \nvouchers for the next decade. While this increase does not meet the \ntotal demand that exists out there for Section 8 vouchers, I believe it \nis a strong first step. My legislation is fully offset and if it were \npassed in its current form, would provide for the immediate funding of \nthese vouchers. I believe Congress should take the time to examine \nwhere other spending could be cut in order to continue to provide \nsizeable annual increases in new vouchers for the Section 8 program. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, incremental vouchers \nhave not been funded since fiscal year 2002. During the past three to \nfour years, the need for Federal housing assistance has grown and it \nwill continue to grow in future years. We need to make a commitment to \nfind the resources in our budget to ensure continued and increased \nfunding for Section 8 vouchers.\n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\n  We should examine doing more than just providing more money for \nSection 8. There have been numerous stories in my home State of \nWisconsin about various concerns with the Section 8 program, ranging \nfrom potential discrimination on the part of landlords in declining to \nrent to Section 8 voucher holders to the administrative burdens \nlandlords face when participating in the Section 8 program. \nAdditionally, there are substantial concerns with the funding formula \nthe Bush Administration is currently using for the Section 8 program. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the 110th Congress to \naddress these and other issues and make the Section 8 program more \neffective, more secure, and more accessible to citizens throughout the \ncountry.\n  But providing rental assistance is not the only answer to solving the \nhousing affordability problem in our country. We must also work to \nincrease the availability of affordable housing stock in our \ncommunities through facilitating production of housing units affordable \nto extremely low and very low income Americans. The HOME Investments \nPartnership Program, more commonly known as HOME, was created in 1990 \nto assist states and local communities in producing affordable housing \nfor low income families. HOME is a grant program that allows \nparticipating jurisdictions the flexibility to use funds for new \nproduction, preservation, and rehabilitation of existing housing stock. \nHOME is an effective federal program that is used in concert with other \nexisting housing programs to provide affordable housing units for low \nincome Americans throughout the country.\n  According to recent data from HUD, since fiscal year 1992, over $23 \nbillion has been allocated through the HOME program to participating \njurisdictions around the country. There have been over 800,000 units \ncommitted, including over 200,000 new construction units. HUD reports \nthat over 700,000 units have been completed or funded. Communities in \nmy State of Wisconsin have received over $370 million since 1992 and \nhave seen over 20,000 housing units completed since 1992. Cities and \nStates around the country are able to report numerous success stories \nin part due to the HOME funding that has been allocated to \nparticipating jurisdictions since 1992. The Bipartisan Millennial \nHousing Commission found that the HOME program is highly successful and \nrecommended a substantial increase in funding for HOME in 2002.\n  Unfortunately, for the past two fiscal years, the HOME program has \nseen a decline in funding. In fiscal year 2005, HOME was funded at $1.9 \nbillion and in fiscal year 2006, HOME was funded at a little more than \n$1.7 billion. As a result of this decline in funding, all participating \njurisdictions in Wisconsin saw a decline in HOME dollars, with some \njurisdictions seeing a decline of more than six percent. We need to \nensure these funding cuts to HOME do not continue in the future and we \nmust provide more targeted resources within HOME for the people most in \nneed.\n  But Mr. President, as successful as the HOME program is, more needs \nto be done to assist extremely low income families. My legislation \nseeks to target additional resources to the Americans most in need by \nusing the HOME structure to distribute new funding to participating \njurisdictions with the requirement that these participating \njurisdictions use these set-aside dollars to produce, rehab, or \npreserve affordable housing for extremely low income families, or \npeople at 30 percent of area median income or below.\n  As we all know, extremely low income households face the most severe \naffordable housing cost burdens of any Americans. According to data \nfrom HUD and the American Housing Survey, 56 percent of extremely low \nincome renter households deal with severe affordability housing issues \nwhile only 25 percent of these renters are not burdened with \naffordability concerns. HUD also found that half of all extremely low \nincome owner households are severely burdened by affordability \nconcerns. Data shows more than 75 percent of renter households with \nsevere housing affordability burdens are extremely low income families \nand more than half of extremely low income households pay at least half \nof their income on housing. The Bipartisan Millennial Housing \nCommission has stated that ``the most serious housing problem in \nAmerica is the mismatch between the number of extremely low income \nrenter households and the number of units available to them with \nacceptable quality and affordable rents.'' The Commission also noted \nthat there is no federal program solely for the preservation or \nproduction of housing for extremely low or moderate income families.\n  Because of these severe burdens and the high cost of providing safe \nand affordable housing to families at 30 percent or below of area \nmedian income, my bill would provide $400 million annually on top of \nthe money that Congress already appropriates through HOME. I have heard \nfrom a number of housing advocates in Wisconsin that we have effective \nhousing programs but the programs are not funded adequately. This is \nwhy I decided to administer this funding through the HOME program; \nlocal communities are familiar with the requirements and regulations of \nthe HOME program and I think it is important not to place unnecessary \nand new administrative hurdles on local cities and communities.\n\n  Participating jurisdictions will be able to use this new funding \nunder the eligible uses currently allowed by HOME to best meet the \nneeds of the extremely low income families in their respective \ncommunities. But participating jurisdictions must certify that this \nfunding is going to extremely low income households and must report on \nhow the funds are being utilized in their communities. Funds are \nintended to be distributed on a pro-rata basis to ensure participating \njurisdictions around the country receive funding. I also require that \nthe Secretary notify participating jurisdictions that this new funding \nfor extremely low income households in no way excuses such \njurisdictions from continuing to use existing HOME dollars to serve \nextremely low income families. It is my hope that this extra funding \nwill provide an increased incentive to local cities and communities to \ndedicate more resources to producing and preserving affordable housing \nfor the most vulnerable Americans.\n  My bill would also reauthorize a critical crime-fighting grant \nprogram: the Public and Assisted Housing Crime and Drug Elimination \nProgram, formerly known as ``PHDEP.'' Unfortunately, the PHDEP program \nhas not been funded since 2001, and its statutory authorization expired \nin 2003. It is time to bring back this important grant program, which \nprovided much-needed public safety resources to public housing \nauthorities and their tenants. My legislation would authorize $200 \nmillion per year for five years for this program.\n  After more than a decade of declining crime rates, new FBI statistics \nindicate that 2005 brought an overall increase in violent crime across \nthe country, and particularly in the Midwest. Nationwide, violent crime \nincreased 2.3 percent between 2004 and 2005, and in the Midwest, \nviolent crime increased 5.6 percent between 2004 and 2005. Housing \nauthorities and others providing assisted housing are feeling the \neffects of this shift, but just as the crime rate is rising, their \nresources to fight back are dwindling. We need to provide them with \nfunding targeted at preventing and reducing violent and drug-related \ncrime, so that they can provide a safe living environment for their \ntenants.\n  Reauthorizing the Public and Assisted Housing Crime and Drug \nElimination Program should not be controversial. The program has long \nenjoyed bipartisan support. It was first sponsored by Senator \nLautenberg in 1988, and first implemented in 1989 under then-Housing \nand Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp. When in effect, it funded \nnumerous crime-fighting measures in housing authorities all over the \ncountry.\n  In Milwaukee, grants under this program funded a variety of important \nprograms. It provided funding to the Housing Authority of the City of \nMilwaukee to hire public safety officers who are on site 24 hours a day \nto respond to calls and intervene when problems arise, and who work \ncollaboratively with local law enforcement agencies. According to the \nHousing Authority, by the time the PHDEP program was defunded, public \nsafety officers were responding to more than 8,000 calls per year, \ndealing quickly and effectively with thefts, drug use and\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\nsales, and other problems. Grants under the program also allowed the \nHousing Authority in Milwaukee to conduct crime prevention programs \nthrough the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Milwaukee and other on-site \nagencies, providing youths and others living in public housing with a \nvariety of educational, job training and life skill programs.\n  When the PHDEP program was defunded during the fiscal year 2002 \nbudget cycle, the Administration argued that crime-fighting measures \nshould be funded through the Public Housing Operating Fund and promised \nan increase in that Fund to account for part of the loss of PHDEP \nfunds. That allowed some programs previously funded under PHDEP to \ncontinue for a few years. But now there is a significant shortfall in \nthe Operating Fund and HUD is proposing limits on how capital funds can \nbe used, and housing authorities nationwide--including in Milwaukee--\nhave been faced with tough decisions, including cutting some or all of \ntheir crime reduction programs.\n  It is time for Congress to step in and reauthorize these grants. \nEveryone deserves a safe place to live, and we should help provide \nhousing authorities and other federally assisted low-income housing \nentities with the resources they need to provide that to their tenants.\n  But we can do more than just provide public housing authorities with \ngrant money. The Federal government also needs to provide more \nresources to help housing authorities spend those funds in the most \neffective way possible. That is why my legislation also contains \nseveral provisions to enhance the effectiveness of this grant program. \nIt would: Require HUD's Office of Policy Development & Research (PD) \nto conduct a review of existing research on crime fighting measures and \nissue a report within six months identifying effective programs, \nproviding an important resource to public housing authorities; require \nPD to work with housing authorities, social scientists and others to \ndevelop and implement a plan to conduct rigorous scientific evaluation \nof crime reduction and prevention strategies funded by the grant \nprogram that have not previously been subject to that type of \nevaluation, giving housing authorities yet another source of \ninformation about effective strategies for combating crime; and require \nHUD to report to Congress within four years, based on what it learns \nfrom existing research and evaluations of grantee programs, on the most \neffective ways to prevent and reduce crime in public and assisted \nhousing environments, the ways in which it has provided related \nguidance to help grant applicants, and any suggestions for improving \nthe effectiveness of the program going forward.\n  As with any grant program, it is essential that HUD monitor the use \nof the grants and that grantees be required to report regularly on \ntheir activities, as was required by HUD regulations when the program \nwas defunded. The bill also clarifies the types of activities that can \nbe funded through the grant program to ensure that funds are not used \ninappropriately.\n  My bill also includes a sense of the Senate provision calling on \nCongress to create a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. At the \noutset, I want to commend my colleagues in the Senate, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Reed, and others for all their work on advancing the cause of a \nNational Affordable Housing Trust fund. I look forward to working with \nthem and others in the 110th to push for the creation of such a trust \nfund.\n  I agree with my colleagues that such a trust fund should have the \ngoal of supplying 1,500,000 new affordable housing units over the next \n10 years. It should also contain sufficient income targeting to reflect \nthe housing affordability burdens faced by extremely low income and \nvery low income families and contain enough flexibility to allow local \ncommunities to produce, preserve, and rehabilitate affordable housing \nunits while ensuring that such affordable housing development fosters \nthe creation of healthy and sustainable communities.\n  Hundreds of local housing trust funds have been created in cities and \nstates throughout the country, including recently in the city of \nMilwaukee. I want to commend the community members in Milwaukee for \nworking to address the housing affordability issues that the city faces \nand it is my hope that we in Congress can do our part to help \nWisconsin's communities and communities around the country provide safe \nand affordable housing to all Americans.\n  This bill is the third of four proposals I am introducing this year \nto address some of the domestic issues that have been raised with me \nover the years by my constituents, some of them at the listening \nsessions I hold annually in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties. Previous \nproposals addressed health care reform and the trade deficit.\n  This Nation faces a severe shortage of affordable housing for our \nmost vulnerable citizens. Shelter is one of our most basic needs, and, \nunfortunately, too many Wisconsinites and people around the country are \nstruggling to afford a place to live for themselves and their families. \nThis legislation does not solve all the affordable housing issues that \ncommunities are facing, but I believe it is a good first step. This \nissue is about more than providing a roof over a family's head, \nhowever. Good housing and healthy communities lead to better jobs, \nbetter educational outcomes, and better futures for all Americans. \nLocal communities, States, and the Federal Government must work \ntogether to dedicate more effective resources toward ensuring that all \nAmericans have a safe and decent place to live. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the next Congress to advance my bill and \nother housing initiatives and work towards meeting the goal of \naffordable housing and healthy communities for all Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4063\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the amendments made by the No Child Left \nBehind Act of 2001; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I introduce the Improving No Child \nLeft Behind--INCLB--Act. As a father and a legislator, I am committed \nto advocating for public education in Idaho and throughout the Nation. \nEnsuring that every child receives a good education is one of my top \npriorities. President Bush's sweeping education reforms included in the \nNo Child Left Behind Act have had measurable positive effects on many \nstudents across the country, and I support the law's objective of \nensuring that every child achieves his or her potential.\n  However, given time to observe the implementation of the law, it is \nnow appropriate to review opportunities for needed improvements to the \nunderlying program. After conferring with a number of organizations in \nIdaho and at the national level, I have identified implementation \nconcerns that seem common to various stakeholder groups. In response, I \nhave created the Improving No Child Left Behind Act. This bill contains \na number of workable, commonsense modifications to the law. These \nprovisions preserve the major focus on student achievement and \naccountability and, at the same time, ensure that schools and school \ndistricts are accurately and fairly assessed. The act ensures that \nlocal schools and districts have more flexibility and control in \neducating our Nation's children. The goal of the act is expressed in \nits name: to improve No Child Left Behind.\n  The bill does a number of things: INCLB would allow supplemental \nservices like tutoring to be offered to students sooner than they are \ncurrently available; INCLB would provide flexibility for States to use \nadditional types of assessment models for measuring student progress; \nINCLB grants States more flexibility in assessing students with \ndisabilities; INCLB would ensure more fair and accurate assessments of \nLimited English Proficiency--LEP--students; INCLB would create a \nstudent testing participation range, providing flexibility for \nuncontrollable variations in student attendance; INCLB would allow \nschools to target resources to those student populations who need the \nmost attention by applying sanctions only when the same student group \nfails to make adequate progress in the same subject for two consecutive \nyears; and INCLB would ensure that students are counted properly and \naccurately in assessment and reporting systems.\n  Taken together, these provisions reflect a realistic assessment of \nboth the strengths and weaknesses of No Child Left Behind. While there \nmay be many issues that divide us, our responsibility in education is \nclear. We must promote successful, meaningful public education for our \nchildren. The INCLB Act will ensure that INCLB continues to be an \navenue to success for educators and students throughout Idaho and the \nNation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 4065. A bill to direct the Attorney General to conduct a study on \nthe feasibility of collecting crime data relating to the occurrence of \nschool-related crime in elementary schools and secondary schools; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Accurate \nCrime Trends for School Act, a bill that is critical in protecting our \nchildren from crimes within their schools.\n  Each day, parents send their children off to school with a sense of \nsecurity that they are spending their day in a classroom free from \ndanger. The latest outbreaks of school violence and crimes are a clear \nreminder that this is not always the case. While the majority of our \nschools are safe, some parents send their children off to school only \nto find that their child has become the victim of a crime.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act requires States and local educational \nagencies to publicly report criminal activity in our schools, based on \ntheir own reports and best-guess surveys. However, there is no Federal \ncrime reporting and tracking system for K-12 schools in the United \nStates.\n  I strongly believe that accurate data on the crimes occurring in our \nschools will help us develop preventative measures and effectively \naddress crimes occurring in our nation's classrooms.\n  My bill, the Accurate Crime Trends (``ACT'') for Schools Act, directs \nthe Attorney General, in consultation with the FBI and the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, to determine the \nfeasibility of expanding the National Incidents Based Reporting System \n(``NIBRS'') to include information on K-12 school-related crime. NIBRS \nis the FBI's comprehensive, detailed crime reporting system. It \nprovides a greater capability of reporting the details of crimes than \nself-reporting or surveys do.\n  I want it to be clear that expanding NIBRS would not create a new \nlevel of bureaucracy. This bill would neither bring the FBI into our \nschools, nor place any new requirements or new burdens upon educators. \nExpanding NIBRS would use existing crime reporting infrastructures to \ncollect specific K-12 crime data, allowing us to improve the safety of \nour kids in school.\n  This year The Office of the New York State Comptroller released a \nstudy that underscored the need for such legislation. The report showed \nthat at schools sampled, 80 percent of documented incidents of crimes \nwent unreported to the State, with a number of\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\nthese instances being serious crimes. This is the type of information \nthat we need that we are not currently getting.\n  As a parent, I truly believe it is imperative to be made aware of any \ncrime that takes place in our children's schools. Our parents, \neducators, and children need and deserve a sense of comfort and \nsecurity from their schools. When we have accurate data on what is \noccurring in our school, we will be able to develop effective policies \nto make sure our schools are safe. This bill is a critical first step \nin achieving this goal.\n  The infrastructure for collecting this data is already in place. All \nwe have to do is determine the best way to utilize it. The Accurate \nCrime Trends for Schools Act will accomplish just that.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4065\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

STUDY AND REPORT.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Attorney General shall, after consultation \n     with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and \n     the International Association of Chiefs of Police, conduct a \n     study to determine the feasibility of expanding the National \n     Incident-Based Reporting System to include information on the \n     occurrence of school-related crime in elementary schools and \n     secondary schools. Such study shall include the \n     identification and evaluation of methods that may be used to \n     collect and report such information.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a \n     report containing the results of the study conducted under \n     subsection (a) to the appropriate committees of Congress.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``elementary \n     school'' and ``secondary school'' have the meanings given the \n     terms in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out \n     section 2, $250,000 for fiscal year 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Byrd, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Roberts, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \n        Enzi, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 4067. A bill to provide for secondary transmissions of distant \nnetwork signals for private home viewing by certain satellite carriers; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nSatellite Consumer Protection Act of 2006, and I am proud that Senators \nInouye, Snowe, Allard, Rockefeller, and Byrd, Pryor, Enzi, and Clinton \nare among those joining me in sponsoring this important bill. I regret \nthe necessity of this legislation, but I am determined to protect \nconsumers--especially consumers in rural areas such as Vermont.\n  This is a pro-consumer, bipartisan bill that addresses a problem that \nsoon will face millions of Americans who subscribe to satellite TV \nservices. I realize full well that this bill may not please the major \ncorporations affected by this remedy, but its intent is not to help \ncorporations, but to help home satellite viewers.\n  A Federal court recently found that EchoStar willfully, flagrantly \nand repeatedly violated Federal law, and I believe that EchoStar should \nbe held to account for its decade of illegal activity. The situation is \nultimately quite complicated, but the simplest version is this: \nEchoStar has been bringing distant network signals to areas that did \nnot need satellite to provide access to that programming. But the \npenalty for such actions is harsh, and the court that heard the lawsuit \nhad no choice: EchoStar will be required to stop retransmitting any \ndistant signals. EchoStar flouted the law, but it is consumers who will \nsuffer. Unless we pass this bill, many rural subscribers around the \ncountry will lose access to news and entertainment programming from the \nfree, over-the-air broadcast networks.\n  The Satellite Consumer Protection Act is a practical, narrow, and--\nmost importantly--pro-consumer solution to a problem of Echo Star's \ncreation. The court-issued injunction, set to take effect December 1, \nwill prohibit EchoStar from providing any distant network stations to \nany of its customers. Under the Satellite Consumer Protection Act, the \ninjunction will apply to the roughly 95 percent of the country where \nEchoStar provides residents their local, over-the-air stations. Our \nlegislation would only permit EchoStar to bring in distant network \nstations in three situations. First, where local stations are not \navailable from a satellite provider, EchoStar could bring in a distant \nnetwork station if it compensates the local station. Second, in areas \nthat do not have affiliates of all four networks, EchoStar could bring \nin a distant signal of the missing network affiliate because no local \nstation would be harmed. Third, stations from neighboring localities \nthat are considered ``significantly viewed'' by the Federal \nCommunications Commission, and are generally treated as local stations, \ncould be carried.\n  This legislation would not be complete without an enforcement \nprovision that will truly curb EchoStar's practice of illegally \nproviding copyrighted content. The Satellite Consumer Protection Act \ntherefore imposes real monetary penalties for violating the Act and \nrequires EchoStar to put sufficient funds in escrow with the copyright \noffice to cover any future violations.\n  This bipartisan bill respects the legitimate interests of \nbroadcasters who have been harmed by EchoStar's actions, while it \nserves the interests of the people who are the innocent bystanders and \nthe real victims of this emerging problem: the consumers who are paying \nfor these services.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4067\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Satellite Consumer \n     Protection Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues Senators Leahy and Allard in introducing the Satellite \nConsumer Protection Act of 2006. I am pleased that Senators Byrd, \nInouye, Salazar, Snowe, Roberts, Enzi, and Ensign are original \ncosponsors.\n  I want to thank Senator Leahy for his leadership on this issue. This \nbill builds upon the hard work and legislative language that \nCongressman Rick Boucher (D-VA) and I originally developed. Congressman \nBoucher has been invaluable in making all sure that all interested \nparties work together to protect consumers, and I must thank him for \nall of his hard work on this issue.\n  We have introduced this legislation to protect consumers who through \nno fault of their own can no longer receive network television signals \nfrom DISH Network. Our constituents have lost this right because of a \nnationwide legal battle between DISH Network and television \nbroadcasters. The Court found that DISH Network had violated the law \nand imposed a penalty. This decision impacted thousands of my \nconstituent and I believe that Congress needed to restore the ability \nof these consumers to receive network signals. For many rural West \nVirginians, cable television is not available.\n  We have a looming crisis on our hands and Congress must pass our bill \nimmediately. We have a duty to our consumers to minimize the disruption \nto their daily lives, and our bill allows those consumers who do not \nhave the ability to get local television stations in their area to \ncontinue to receive distant signals.\n  Again, I urge quick adoption of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11071-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11071-S11074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 4070. A bill to exempt children of certain Filipino World War II \nveterans from the numerical limitations on immigrant visas; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it has long been evident that our \nimmigration system needs to be reformed, and the current debate on \nimmigration is long overdue. I am pleased that this body is addressing \nthis important issue in such a comprehensive manner. However, if the \nSenate's debate on immigration is to be truly comprehensive, it must \naddress not only its better-known propositions and factors but also its \nlesser-known ones as well.\n  My bill seeks to address and resolve an immigration issue that, while \nrooted in a set of historical circumstance more than seven decades old, \nremains unresolved to this day. It is an issue of great concern to \nFilipino World War II veterans and to Filipino Americans, and it ought \nto be an issue of great concern to all American veterans and citizens \nwith an interest in justice and fairness.\n  Before I discuss the specifics of my bill, I would first like to \nthank my dear friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, \nDaniel K. Inouye, for cosponsoring this bill. In the 101st Congress, \nSenator Inouye authored Section 405 of the Immigration Act of 1990, \nwhich provided for the naturalization of Filipino World War II \nveterans. Senator Inouye has a long history of being involved in this \nimportant effort and it is an honor to have his support on my bill \ntoday.\n  To understand the significance of this bill, it is important to first \nprovide some background about the historical circumstances that got us \nto where we are today.\n  In 1941, on the basis of 1934 legislation enacted prior to Philippine \nindependence, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive \norder. Through this order, President Roosevelt invoked his authority to \n``call and order into the service of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates,'' including ``all of the organized military forces of the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.'' This order drafted \nmore than 200,000 Filipino citizens into the United States military. \nUnder the\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\ncommand of General Douglas MacArthur, Filipino soldiers fought \nalongside American soldiers in the defense of our country.\n  Throughout the course of World War II, these Filipino soldiers proved \nthemselves to be courageous and honorable comrades in arms as they \nhelped the United States fulfill its mission. There was no question \nthat they would be treated the same as American troops.\n  These Filipino soldiers are war heroes, and deserved to be treated as \nsuch. They provided active duty service on behalf of the U.S. military, \nwhich should have qualified them for the same benefits as other active-\nduty veterans. Congress betrayed these veterans by enacting the First \nSupplemental Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act in 1946, which \nincluded a rider that conditioned an appropriation of $200 million, for \nthe benefit of the postwar Philippine Army, on the basis that service \nin the Commonwealth Army should not be deemed to have been service in \nthe Armed Forces of the United States.\n  Commonwealth Army members were those called into the service of the \nUnited States Armed Forces for the Far East. These members served \nbetween July 26, 1941, and June 30, 1946. Similarly, Congress enacted \nthe Second Supplemental Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act, which \nprovided that service in the New Philippine Scouts was not deemed to be \nservice in the U.S. military.\n  New Philippine Scouts were Filipino citizens who served with the \nUnited States Armed Forces with the consent of the Philippine \ngovernment. They served between October 6, 1945, and June 30, 1947.\n  These veterans are now in their eighties and nineties. Of the 200,000 \nFilipino veterans that served in World War II, close to 49,000 survive. \nSome of these veterans receive U.S. benefits, some do not. By 2010, it \nis estimated that there will be just 20,000 survivors.\n  With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990, the courage of the \nmany Filipino soldiers who fought alongside our troops during World War \nII was finally recognized by our government, and Filipino veterans were \noffered the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. According to the \nformer Immigration and Naturalization Service, about 15,000 Filipino \nveterans live in the U.S. and became citizens between 1941 and 1995 \nunder the authority of the Immigration Act of 1990. Between that time \nabout 11,000 veterans who live in the Philippines were successfully \nnaturalized. These thousands of Filipino veterans clearly wished to \nspend their golden years in the United States, and I am pleased that \nthe 1990 Immigration reform efforts provided them the opportunity to do \nso.\n  Unfortunately, the offer did not extend to the adult sons and \ndaughters of these veterans. As a result, the Filipino veterans who \nfought on behalf of America, and who now live in American and continue \nto contribute to America, must do so alone. Due to a backlog in the \nissuing of visas, many of the children of these veterans have waited \nmore than twenty years before being able to obtain an immigrant visa.\n  My bill, by exempting children of certain Filipino World War II \nveterans from the numerical limitation on immigrant visas, will ensure \nthat our Filipino World War II veterans can enjoy and be supported by \ntheir family members in their twilight years. I believe it is a simple \nyet profound way that this country may honor the sacrifices made more \nthan six decades ago by these war heroes.\n  I urge my colleagues to honor the valiant contributions of Filipino \nWorld War II veterans to our Nation by supporting my bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 4071. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe placed-in-service date requirement for low-income housing credit \nbuildings and bonus depreciation property and the period for \nrehabilitation expenditures in the Gulf Opportunity Zone; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the people of New Orleans and the rest \nof the Gulf Coast have been working hard to rebuild their communities \nand the economy of the region. The Gulf Opportunity (GO) Zone \nlegislation that the Congress passed and the President signed into law \nat the end of last year, has contributed greatly to the rebuilding \nefforts.\n  The benefits of this legislation have been tremendous so far. \nHundreds of businesses, large and small, will be able to take advantage \nof tax incentives made possible by the GO Zone bill. These include a \nbonus depreciation provision that allows businesses to take a 50 \npercent depreciation deduction in the first year on new plant or \nequipment in the GO Zone. This has helped jump start our recovery by \ngiving businesses the incentive to invest quickly in the GO Zone.\n  The GO Zone Act also increased the amount of low income housing tax \ncredits available to GO Zone states. The Louisiana Housing Finance \nAgency reports that it has awarded more than $80 million in low income \nhousing tax credits. These credits will be leveraged to finance 195 \nrental housing developments for working families.\n  The GO Zone also included an increased rehabilitation tax credit to \nencourage the preservation and rehabilitation of historic structures. \nWe have many beautiful, old buildings in New Orleans and along the \nGulf. They are part of our heritage and as we rebuild we want to \npreserve that heritage.\n  The problem with the GO Zone Act is that these tax benefits have \nlimits in terms of the time that they are available for our rebuilding. \nMost require that any plant and equipment, or the housing financed by \nthe tax credits, must be placed in service by the end of 2008--that is \nonly two years away. The rehabilitation tax credit is also only \navailable until the end of 2008. The problem with this is that our \nrecovery is going to take longer. In Louisiana we are rebuilding an \nentire city essentially from scratch. Whole communities were wiped out \nin Mississippi. We have never seen a recovery like the one we are \nattempting in the Gulf.\n  The placed in service date is particularly difficult for the low \nincome housing tax credits. It can take years to get together all of \nthe financing for housing developments and even more time for \nconstruction. The current placed in service date effectively makes any \ncredits allocated in 2008 unusable because it would be nearly \nimpossible to get a building financed and constructed by the end of the \nyear.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to extend the placed in service \ndates for the various GO Zone tax benefits for an additional two years. \nThis will give us more time to take full advantage of the opportunities \nthe GO Zone legislation has given us. Our recovery is proceeding \nsteadily, but it will take time. We do not want to diminish the impact \nthese tax credits will have on our recovery by artificially limiting \ntheir availability. My bill would make these credits available for a \nlonger period of time so that the recovery in the Gulf will be \nsustained.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4071\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to address ongoing small business and homeowner needs \nin\n\n[[Page S11073]]\n\nthe Gulf Coast States impacted by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita; \nto the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU: Mr. President, I come to the floor today to highlight \nthe ongoing needs of our small businesses and homeowners in the Gulf \nCoast who were devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In Louisiana \nalone, these disasters claimed 1,464 lives, destroyed more than 200,000 \nhomes and 18,000 businesses and inflicted $25 billion in uninsured \nlosses. Many of my colleagues here in the Senate have been down to \nLouisiana and have seen firsthand the size and scope of the \ndestruction. The Congress has been very generous in providing billions \nof Federal recovery dollars as well as valuable Gulf Opportunity (GO) \nZone tax incentives to help spur recovery in the region. These \nresources will be key in the recovery of the region but there are \nadditional needs on the ground that still must be addressed. That is \nwhy I am proud to introduce a bill today, the Gulf Coast Back to \nBusiness and Homes Act of 2006, which I believe, addresses these \nproblems and shows our small businesses and homeowners that the Federal \ngovernment is responsive to their needs. I am happy that my colleague, \nSenator Kerry, Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business & \nEntrepreneurship Committee, has joined me by cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Katrina was the most destructive hurricane ever to hit the United \nStates. The next month, in September, Hurricane Rita hit the Louisiana \nand Texas coast. It was the second most powerful hurricane ever to hit \nthe United States, wreaking havoc on the southwestern part of my state \nand the east Texas coast. This one-two punch devastated Louisiana \nlives, communities and jobs, stretching from Cameron Parish in the west \nto Plaquemines Parish in the east.\n  We are now rebuilding our State and the wide variety of communities \nthat were devastated by Rita and Katrina, areas representing a diverse \nmix of population, income and cultures. We hope to restore the region's \nuniqueness and its greatness. To do that, we need to rebuild our local \neconomies now and far into the future.\n  My State estimates that there were 71,000 businesses in the Katrina \nand Rita disaster zones. As I mentioned, a total of 18,752 of these \nbusinesses were catastrophically destroyed. However, on a wider scale, \naccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, over 125,000 small and \nmedium-sized businesses in the Gulf region were disrupted by Katrina \nand Rita. Many of these businesses have yet to resume operations and \nothers are struggling to survive. We will never succeed without these \nsmall businesses. They will be the key to the revitalization of the \nGulf Coast. We also cannot succeed if our homeowners are being buried \nunder red tape and regulations.\n  The people who work for the Small Business Administration and FEMA \nare dedicated and interested to help in the recovery of our region. \nHowever, these individuals are operating under a system which is \ninadequate and, in some cases, unresponsive to needs on the ground.\n  I come to the floor today to introduce a bill which provides \ncommonsense solutions to get the Federal assistance to our struggling \nbusinesses and homeowners. If we don't help them now, building a strong \nGulf Coast will be all the more difficult if residents cannot rebuild \ntheir homes and businesses cannot open their doors.\n  After talking to the business leaders and small businesses in my \nState, there are two things that they need right now: access to capital \nand additional time to repay their SBA Disaster loans. For homeowners, \nthey are still encountering an SBA which is only disbursing small \namounts of loan funds for home rebuilding. The SBA is also deducting \nproceeds from State-administered housing recovery grants to payoff \nexisting SBA Disaster home loans. I understand the SBA is just doing \nits job and following the current laws, but I believe this is a \nsituation where the current laws are actually hurting taxpayers in \ntheir efforts to fully recover.\n  For example, under current law, the SBA cannot disburse more than \n$10,000 for an approved Disaster Loan without showing collateral. This \nis to limit the loss to the SBA in the event that a loan defaults. \nHowever, this disbursement amount has not been increased since 1998 and \nthese days, $10,000 is not enough to get a business up and running or \nto allow a homeowner to start making repairs. Our bill increases this \ncollateral requirement for Katrina and Rita Disaster Loans from $10,000 \nto $35,000.\n  To address the lack of access to capital for our businesses, the bill \nincludes a provision to provide funds to Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Texas to help small businesses now. Not three months from \nnow, but as quickly as possible. We are asking for $100 million so that \nbusinesses can have money they need to repair, rebuild, and pay their \nemployees until they get back up and running again. The States know \nwhat the needs of their affected businesses are and we want to provide \nthem with this money so they can start helping businesses now.\n  Many businesses and homeowners are also coming up on the end of their \nstandard one-year deferment of payment on principal and interest on \ntheir SBA Disaster Loans. For most disasters, one-year is more than \nenough time for borrowers to get back on their feet. But for disasters \non the scale of Katrina and Rita, one-year came and went, with \ncommunities just now seeing gas stations open and some homeowners are \njust now returning to rebuild their homes. This is a unique situation \nand for French Quarter businesses, where tourism is down 85 percent \nfrom pre-Katrina levels, to require them to start making payments on a \n$50,000 loan is virtually impossible if there are no customers! \nHomeowners too are experiencing widespread uncertainty and I believe \nthe current one-year deferment requires serious reconsideration. That \nis why this bill gives borrowers an additional year to get their lives \nin order--allow residents to begin fixing their homes and allow \nbusinesses the time for economic activity to pick back up.\n  For homeowners in Louisiana, the State is doing its part by setting \nup the Louisiana Road Home program, to provide homeowners with up to \n$150,000 in grant proceeds for uninsured losses on their properties. \nHowever, many applicants are concerned because under the Stafford and \nSmall Business Acts, the SBA is required to ensure there are no \n`duplication of benefits' provided to disaster victims. This means that \nSBA must review every file which received an SBA Disaster Loan, and if \nthere is deemed to be a duplication, deduct the duplication amount from \nthe grant proceeds. As I said, I want the SBA to ensure taxpayers funds \nare used wisely, but at the same time, I want to ensure that all \nresidents are able to get the funds they need to rebuild their homes.\n  Under the current scenario, some residents who have additional \nuninsured losses, are being required to still pay back these grant \nproceeds. This is because many SBA loss inspections were done right \nafter the storms in 2005, but since then building/labor costs have \nincreased dramatically, and this is not reflected in the SBA verified \nloss. Borrowers are able to request a loan modification from SBA, but \nmany residents who waited months and months for SBA to respond, are \nwary to go through the process again, especially if there is a prospect \nthey will be declined for the increased loan amount. I can't blame them \nbecause there is enough uncertainty down there right now. Personally, I \nwould also be hesitant to go through the SBA loan process again if I \nhad to fill out as much paperwork as my constituents have had to fill \nout, and to receive constant requests for more information once they \nthink they are done with submitting information.\n  For this reason, this bill provides the SBA Administrator the \nflexibility to consider this `duplication of benefits' to be, rather \nthan the entire SBA loan amount, to instead be the difference between \nthe Federal Government's subsidized interest rate on the loan and the \nmarket rate at which the borrower could have borrowed such funds. This \nprovides borrowers with additional funds for rebuilding while retaining \nthe Federal Government's financial responsibility to taxpayers.\n  In introducing this bill today, I am hopeful it sends the signal to \nGulf Coast residents and businesses that Congress has not forgotten \nabout them. Congress has done a great deal during\n\n[[Page S11074]]\n\nthe 109th Congress to help disaster victims, but that does mean we \nshould just write off recurring problems to the responsibility of \nstates or disaster victims themselves. I believe that both the \nleadership on the Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship \nas well as the new SBA Administrator, Steve Preston, are receptive to \naddressing these ongoing needs in the Gulf Coast. I look forward to \nworking closely with them in the coming weeks to provide substantive \nand lasting solutions for our small businesses and homeowners.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4072\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to exempt children of certain Filipino World War II \nveterans from the numerical limitations on immigrant visas; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it has long been evident that our \nimmigration system needs to be reformed, and the current debate on \nimmigration is long overdue. I am pleased that this body is addressing \nthis important issue in such a comprehensive manner. However, if the \nSenate's debate on immigration is to be truly comprehensive, it must \naddress not only its better-known propositions and factors but also its \nlesser-known ones as well.\n  My bill seeks to address and resolve an immigration issue that, while \nrooted in a set of historical circumstance more than seven decades old, \nremains unresolved to this day. It is an issue of great concern to \nFilipino World War II veterans and to Filipino Americans, and it ought \nto be an issue of great concern to all American veterans and citizens \nwith an interest in justice and fairness.\n  Before I discuss the specifics of my bill, I would first like to \nthank my dear friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, \nDaniel K. Inouye, for cosponsoring this bill. In the 101st Congress, \nSenator Inouye authored Section 405 of the Immigration Act of 1990, \nwhich provided for the naturalization of Filipino World War II \nveterans. Senator Inouye has a long history of being involved in this \nimportant effort and it is an honor to have his support on my bill \ntoday.\n  To understand the significance of this bill, it is important to first \nprovide some background about the historical circumstances that got us \nto where we are today.\n  In 1941, on the basis of 1934 legislation enacted prior to Philippine \nindependence, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive \norder. Through this order, President Roosevelt invoked his authority to \n``call and order into the service of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates,'' including ``all of the organized military forces of the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.'' This order drafted \nmore than 200,000 Filipino citizens into the United States military. \nUnder the\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\ncommand of General Douglas MacArthur, Filipino soldiers fought \nalongside American soldiers in the defense of our country.\n  Throughout the course of World War II, these Filipino soldiers proved \nthemselves to be courageous and honorable comrades in arms as they \nhelped the United States fulfill its mission. There was no question \nthat they would be treated the same as American troops.\n  These Filipino soldiers are war heroes, and deserved to be treated as \nsuch. They provided active duty service on behalf of the U.S. military, \nwhich should have qualified them for the same benefits as other active-\nduty veterans. Congress betrayed these veterans by enacting the First \nSupplemental Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act in 1946, which \nincluded a rider that conditioned an appropriation of $200 million, for \nthe benefit of the postwar Philippine Army, on the basis that service \nin the Commonwealth Army should not be deemed to have been service in \nthe Armed Forces of the United States.\n  Commonwealth Army members were those called into the service of the \nUnited States Armed Forces for the Far East. These members served \nbetween July 26, 1941, and June 30, 1946. Similarly, Congress enacted \nthe Second Supplemental Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act, which \nprovided that service in the New Philippine Scouts was not deemed to be \nservice in the U.S. military.\n  New Philippine Scouts were Filipino citizens who served with the \nUnited States Armed Forces with the consent of the Philippine \ngovernment. They served between October 6, 1945, and June 30, 1947.\n  These veterans are now in their eighties and nineties. Of the 200,000 \nFilipino veterans that served in World War II, close to 49,000 survive. \nSome of these veterans receive U.S. benefits, some do not. By 2010, it \nis estimated that there will be just 20,000 survivors.\n  With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990, the courage of the \nmany Filipino soldiers who fought alongside our troops during World War \nII was finally recognized by our government, and Filipino veterans were \noffered the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. According to the \nformer Immigration and Naturalization Service, about 15,000 Filipino \nveterans live in the U.S. and became citizens between 1941 and 1995 \nunder the authority of the Immigration Act of 1990. Between that time \nabout 11,000 veterans who live in the Philippines were successfully \nnaturalized. These thousands of Filipino veterans clearly wished to \nspend their golden years in the United States, and I am pleased that \nthe 1990 Immigration reform efforts provided them the opportunity to do \nso.\n  Unfortunately, the offer did not extend to the adult sons and \ndaughters of these veterans. As a result, the Filipino veterans who \nfought on behalf of America, and who now live in American and continue \nto contribute to America, must do so alone. Due to a backlog in the \nissuing of visas, many of the children of these veterans have waited \nmore than twenty years before being able to obtain an immigrant visa.\n  My bill, by exempting children of certain Filipino World War II \nveterans from the numerical limitation on immigrant visas, will ensure \nthat our Filipino World War II veterans can enjoy and be supported by \ntheir family members in their twilight years. I believe it is a simple \nyet profound way that this country may honor the sacrifices made more \nthan six decades ago by these war heroes.\n  I urge my colleagues to honor the valiant contributions of Filipino \nWorld War II veterans to our Nation by supporting my bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 4071. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe placed-in-service date requirement for low-income housing credit \nbuildings and bonus depreciation property and the period for \nrehabilitation expenditures in the Gulf Opportunity Zone; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the people of New Orleans and the rest \nof the Gulf Coast have been working hard to rebuild their communities \nand the economy of the region. The Gulf Opportunity (GO) Zone \nlegislation that the Congress passed and the President signed into law \nat the end of last year, has contributed greatly to the rebuilding \nefforts.\n  The benefits of this legislation have been tremendous so far. \nHundreds of businesses, large and small, will be able to take advantage \nof tax incentives made possible by the GO Zone bill. These include a \nbonus depreciation provision that allows businesses to take a 50 \npercent depreciation deduction in the first year on new plant or \nequipment in the GO Zone. This has helped jump start our recovery by \ngiving businesses the incentive to invest quickly in the GO Zone.\n  The GO Zone Act also increased the amount of low income housing tax \ncredits available to GO Zone states. The Louisiana Housing Finance \nAgency reports that it has awarded more than $80 million in low income \nhousing tax credits. These credits will be leveraged to finance 195 \nrental housing developments for working families.\n  The GO Zone also included an increased rehabilitation tax credit to \nencourage the preservation and rehabilitation of historic structures. \nWe have many beautiful, old buildings in New Orleans and along the \nGulf. They are part of our heritage and as we rebuild we want to \npreserve that heritage.\n  The problem with the GO Zone Act is that these tax benefits have \nlimits in terms of the time that they are available for our rebuilding. \nMost require that any plant and equipment, or the housing financed by \nthe tax credits, must be placed in service by the end of 2008--that is \nonly two years away. The rehabilitation tax credit is also only \navailable until the end of 2008. The problem with this is that our \nrecovery is going to take longer. In Louisiana we are rebuilding an \nentire city essentially from scratch. Whole communities were wiped out \nin Mississippi. We have never seen a recovery like the one we are \nattempting in the Gulf.\n  The placed in service date is particularly difficult for the low \nincome housing tax credits. It can take years to get together all of \nthe financing for housing developments and even more time for \nconstruction. The current placed in service date effectively makes any \ncredits allocated in 2008 unusable because it would be nearly \nimpossible to get a building financed and constructed by the end of the \nyear.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to extend the placed in service \ndates for the various GO Zone tax benefits for an additional two years. \nThis will give us more time to take full advantage of the opportunities \nthe GO Zone legislation has given us. Our recovery is proceeding \nsteadily, but it will take time. We do not want to diminish the impact \nthese tax credits will have on our recovery by artificially limiting \ntheir availability. My bill would make these credits available for a \nlonger period of time so that the recovery in the Gulf will be \nsustained.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4071\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to address ongoing small business and homeowner needs \nin\n\n[[Page S11073]]\n\nthe Gulf Coast States impacted by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita; \nto the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU: Mr. President, I come to the floor today to highlight \nthe ongoing needs of our small businesses and homeowners in the Gulf \nCoast who were devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In Louisiana \nalone, these disasters claimed 1,464 lives, destroyed more than 200,000 \nhomes and 18,000 businesses and inflicted $25 billion in uninsured \nlosses. Many of my colleagues here in the Senate have been down to \nLouisiana and have seen firsthand the size and scope of the \ndestruction. The Congress has been very generous in providing billions \nof Federal recovery dollars as well as valuable Gulf Opportunity (GO) \nZone tax incentives to help spur recovery in the region. These \nresources will be key in the recovery of the region but there are \nadditional needs on the ground that still must be addressed. That is \nwhy I am proud to introduce a bill today, the Gulf Coast Back to \nBusiness and Homes Act of 2006, which I believe, addresses these \nproblems and shows our small businesses and homeowners that the Federal \ngovernment is responsive to their needs. I am happy that my colleague, \nSenator Kerry, Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business & \nEntrepreneurship Committee, has joined me by cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Katrina was the most destructive hurricane ever to hit the United \nStates. The next month, in September, Hurricane Rita hit the Louisiana \nand Texas coast. It was the second most powerful hurricane ever to hit \nthe United States, wreaking havoc on the southwestern part of my state \nand the east Texas coast. This one-two punch devastated Louisiana \nlives, communities and jobs, stretching from Cameron Parish in the west \nto Plaquemines Parish in the east.\n  We are now rebuilding our State and the wide variety of communities \nthat were devastated by Rita and Katrina, areas representing a diverse \nmix of population, income and cultures. We hope to restore the region's \nuniqueness and its greatness. To do that, we need to rebuild our local \neconomies now and far into the future.\n  My State estimates that there were 71,000 businesses in the Katrina \nand Rita disaster zones. As I mentioned, a total of 18,752 of these \nbusinesses were catastrophically destroyed. However, on a wider scale, \naccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, over 125,000 small and \nmedium-sized businesses in the Gulf region were disrupted by Katrina \nand Rita. Many of these businesses have yet to resume operations and \nothers are struggling to survive. We will never succeed without these \nsmall businesses. They will be the key to the revitalization of the \nGulf Coast. We also cannot succeed if our homeowners are being buried \nunder red tape and regulations.\n  The people who work for the Small Business Administration and FEMA \nare dedicated and interested to help in the recovery of our region. \nHowever, these individuals are operating under a system which is \ninadequate and, in some cases, unresponsive to needs on the ground.\n  I come to the floor today to introduce a bill which provides \ncommonsense solutions to get the Federal assistance to our struggling \nbusinesses and homeowners. If we don't help them now, building a strong \nGulf Coast will be all the more difficult if residents cannot rebuild \ntheir homes and businesses cannot open their doors.\n  After talking to the business leaders and small businesses in my \nState, there are two things that they need right now: access to capital \nand additional time to repay their SBA Disaster loans. For homeowners, \nthey are still encountering an SBA which is only disbursing small \namounts of loan funds for home rebuilding. The SBA is also deducting \nproceeds from State-administered housing recovery grants to payoff \nexisting SBA Disaster home loans. I understand the SBA is just doing \nits job and following the current laws, but I believe this is a \nsituation where the current laws are actually hurting taxpayers in \ntheir efforts to fully recover.\n  For example, under current law, the SBA cannot disburse more than \n$10,000 for an approved Disaster Loan without showing collateral. This \nis to limit the loss to the SBA in the event that a loan defaults. \nHowever, this disbursement amount has not been increased since 1998 and \nthese days, $10,000 is not enough to get a business up and running or \nto allow a homeowner to start making repairs. Our bill increases this \ncollateral requirement for Katrina and Rita Disaster Loans from $10,000 \nto $35,000.\n  To address the lack of access to capital for our businesses, the bill \nincludes a provision to provide funds to Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Texas to help small businesses now. Not three months from \nnow, but as quickly as possible. We are asking for $100 million so that \nbusinesses can have money they need to repair, rebuild, and pay their \nemployees until they get back up and running again. The States know \nwhat the needs of their affected businesses are and we want to provide \nthem with this money so they can start helping businesses now.\n  Many businesses and homeowners are also coming up on the end of their \nstandard one-year deferment of payment on principal and interest on \ntheir SBA Disaster Loans. For most disasters, one-year is more than \nenough time for borrowers to get back on their feet. But for disasters \non the scale of Katrina and Rita, one-year came and went, with \ncommunities just now seeing gas stations open and some homeowners are \njust now returning to rebuild their homes. This is a unique situation \nand for French Quarter businesses, where tourism is down 85 percent \nfrom pre-Katrina levels, to require them to start making payments on a \n$50,000 loan is virtually impossible if there are no customers! \nHomeowners too are experiencing widespread uncertainty and I believe \nthe current one-year deferment requires serious reconsideration. That \nis why this bill gives borrowers an additional year to get their lives \nin order--allow residents to begin fixing their homes and allow \nbusinesses the time for economic activity to pick back up.\n  For homeowners in Louisiana, the State is doing its part by setting \nup the Louisiana Road Home program, to provide homeowners with up to \n$150,000 in grant proceeds for uninsured losses on their properties. \nHowever, many applicants are concerned because under the Stafford and \nSmall Business Acts, the SBA is required to ensure there are no \n`duplication of benefits' provided to disaster victims. This means that \nSBA must review every file which received an SBA Disaster Loan, and if \nthere is deemed to be a duplication, deduct the duplication amount from \nthe grant proceeds. As I said, I want the SBA to ensure taxpayers funds \nare used wisely, but at the same time, I want to ensure that all \nresidents are able to get the funds they need to rebuild their homes.\n  Under the current scenario, some residents who have additional \nuninsured losses, are being required to still pay back these grant \nproceeds. This is because many SBA loss inspections were done right \nafter the storms in 2005, but since then building/labor costs have \nincreased dramatically, and this is not reflected in the SBA verified \nloss. Borrowers are able to request a loan modification from SBA, but \nmany residents who waited months and months for SBA to respond, are \nwary to go through the process again, especially if there is a prospect \nthey will be declined for the increased loan amount. I can't blame them \nbecause there is enough uncertainty down there right now. Personally, I \nwould also be hesitant to go through the SBA loan process again if I \nhad to fill out as much paperwork as my constituents have had to fill \nout, and to receive constant requests for more information once they \nthink they are done with submitting information.\n  For this reason, this bill provides the SBA Administrator the \nflexibility to consider this `duplication of benefits' to be, rather \nthan the entire SBA loan amount, to instead be the difference between \nthe Federal Government's subsidized interest rate on the loan and the \nmarket rate at which the borrower could have borrowed such funds. This \nprovides borrowers with additional funds for rebuilding while retaining \nthe Federal Government's financial responsibility to taxpayers.\n  In introducing this bill today, I am hopeful it sends the signal to \nGulf Coast residents and businesses that Congress has not forgotten \nabout them. Congress has done a great deal during\n\n[[Page S11074]]\n\nthe 109th Congress to help disaster victims, but that does mean we \nshould just write off recurring problems to the responsibility of \nstates or disaster victims themselves. I believe that both the \nleadership on the Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship \nas well as the new SBA Administrator, Steve Preston, are receptive to \naddressing these ongoing needs in the Gulf Coast. I look forward to \nworking closely with them in the coming weeks to provide substantive \nand lasting solutions for our small businesses and homeowners.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4072\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to exempt children of certain Filipino World War II \nveterans from the numerical limitations on immigrant visas; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it has long been evident that our \nimmigration system needs to be reformed, and the current debate on \nimmigration is long overdue. I am pleased that this body is addressing \nthis important issue in such a comprehensive manner. However, if the \nSenate's debate on immigration is to be truly comprehensive, it must \naddress not only its better-known propositions and factors but also its \nlesser-known ones as well.\n  My bill seeks to address and resolve an immigration issue that, while \nrooted in a set of historical circumstance more than seven decades old, \nremains unresolved to this day. It is an issue of great concern to \nFilipino World War II veterans and to Filipino Americans, and it ought \nto be an issue of great concern to all American veterans and citizens \nwith an interest in justice and fairness.\n  Before I discuss the specifics of my bill, I would first like to \nthank my dear friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, \nDaniel K. Inouye, for cosponsoring this bill. In the 101st Congress, \nSenator Inouye authored Section 405 of the Immigration Act of 1990, \nwhich provided for the naturalization of Filipino World War II \nveterans. Senator Inouye has a long history of being involved in this \nimportant effort and it is an honor to have his support on my bill \ntoday.\n  To understand the significance of this bill, it is important to first \nprovide some background about the historical circumstances that got us \nto where we are today.\n  In 1941, on the basis of 1934 legislation enacted prior to Philippine \nindependence, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive \norder. Through this order, President Roosevelt invoked his authority to \n``call and order into the service of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates,'' including ``all of the organized military forces of the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.'' This order drafted \nmore than 200,000 Filipino citizens into the United States military. \nUnder the\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\ncommand of General Douglas MacArthur, Filipino soldiers fought \nalongside American soldiers in the defense of our country.\n  Throughout the course of World War II, these Filipino soldiers proved \nthemselves to be courageous and honorable comrades in arms as they \nhelped the United States fulfill its mission. There was no question \nthat they would be treated the same as American troops.\n  These Filipino soldiers are war heroes, and deserved to be treated as \nsuch. They provided active duty service on behalf of the U.S. military, \nwhich should have qualified them for the same benefits as other active-\nduty veterans. Congress betrayed these veterans by enacting the First \nSupplemental Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act in 1946, which \nincluded a rider that conditioned an appropriation of $200 million, for \nthe benefit of the postwar Philippine Army, on the basis that service \nin the Commonwealth Army should not be deemed to have been service in \nthe Armed Forces of the United States.\n  Commonwealth Army members were those called into the service of the \nUnited States Armed Forces for the Far East. These members served \nbetween July 26, 1941, and June 30, 1946. Similarly, Congress enacted \nthe Second Supplemental Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act, which \nprovided that service in the New Philippine Scouts was not deemed to be \nservice in the U.S. military.\n  New Philippine Scouts were Filipino citizens who served with the \nUnited States Armed Forces with the consent of the Philippine \ngovernment. They served between October 6, 1945, and June 30, 1947.\n  These veterans are now in their eighties and nineties. Of the 200,000 \nFilipino veterans that served in World War II, close to 49,000 survive. \nSome of these veterans receive U.S. benefits, some do not. By 2010, it \nis estimated that there will be just 20,000 survivors.\n  With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990, the courage of the \nmany Filipino soldiers who fought alongside our troops during World War \nII was finally recognized by our government, and Filipino veterans were \noffered the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. According to the \nformer Immigration and Naturalization Service, about 15,000 Filipino \nveterans live in the U.S. and became citizens between 1941 and 1995 \nunder the authority of the Immigration Act of 1990. Between that time \nabout 11,000 veterans who live in the Philippines were successfully \nnaturalized. These thousands of Filipino veterans clearly wished to \nspend their golden years in the United States, and I am pleased that \nthe 1990 Immigration reform efforts provided them the opportunity to do \nso.\n  Unfortunately, the offer did not extend to the adult sons and \ndaughters of these veterans. As a result, the Filipino veterans who \nfought on behalf of America, and who now live in American and continue \nto contribute to America, must do so alone. Due to a backlog in the \nissuing of visas, many of the children of these veterans have waited \nmore than twenty years before being able to obtain an immigrant visa.\n  My bill, by exempting children of certain Filipino World War II \nveterans from the numerical limitation on immigrant visas, will ensure \nthat our Filipino World War II veterans can enjoy and be supported by \ntheir family members in their twilight years. I believe it is a simple \nyet profound way that this country may honor the sacrifices made more \nthan six decades ago by these war heroes.\n  I urge my colleagues to honor the valiant contributions of Filipino \nWorld War II veterans to our Nation by supporting my bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 4071. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe placed-in-service date requirement for low-income housing credit \nbuildings and bonus depreciation property and the period for \nrehabilitation expenditures in the Gulf Opportunity Zone; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the people of New Orleans and the rest \nof the Gulf Coast have been working hard to rebuild their communities \nand the economy of the region. The Gulf Opportunity (GO) Zone \nlegislation that the Congress passed and the President signed into law \nat the end of last year, has contributed greatly to the rebuilding \nefforts.\n  The benefits of this legislation have been tremendous so far. \nHundreds of businesses, large and small, will be able to take advantage \nof tax incentives made possible by the GO Zone bill. These include a \nbonus depreciation provision that allows businesses to take a 50 \npercent depreciation deduction in the first year on new plant or \nequipment in the GO Zone. This has helped jump start our recovery by \ngiving businesses the incentive to invest quickly in the GO Zone.\n  The GO Zone Act also increased the amount of low income housing tax \ncredits available to GO Zone states. The Louisiana Housing Finance \nAgency reports that it has awarded more than $80 million in low income \nhousing tax credits. These credits will be leveraged to finance 195 \nrental housing developments for working families.\n  The GO Zone also included an increased rehabilitation tax credit to \nencourage the preservation and rehabilitation of historic structures. \nWe have many beautiful, old buildings in New Orleans and along the \nGulf. They are part of our heritage and as we rebuild we want to \npreserve that heritage.\n  The problem with the GO Zone Act is that these tax benefits have \nlimits in terms of the time that they are available for our rebuilding. \nMost require that any plant and equipment, or the housing financed by \nthe tax credits, must be placed in service by the end of 2008--that is \nonly two years away. The rehabilitation tax credit is also only \navailable until the end of 2008. The problem with this is that our \nrecovery is going to take longer. In Louisiana we are rebuilding an \nentire city essentially from scratch. Whole communities were wiped out \nin Mississippi. We have never seen a recovery like the one we are \nattempting in the Gulf.\n  The placed in service date is particularly difficult for the low \nincome housing tax credits. It can take years to get together all of \nthe financing for housing developments and even more time for \nconstruction. The current placed in service date effectively makes any \ncredits allocated in 2008 unusable because it would be nearly \nimpossible to get a building financed and constructed by the end of the \nyear.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to extend the placed in service \ndates for the various GO Zone tax benefits for an additional two years. \nThis will give us more time to take full advantage of the opportunities \nthe GO Zone legislation has given us. Our recovery is proceeding \nsteadily, but it will take time. We do not want to diminish the impact \nthese tax credits will have on our recovery by artificially limiting \ntheir availability. My bill would make these credits available for a \nlonger period of time so that the recovery in the Gulf will be \nsustained.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4071\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to address ongoing small business and homeowner needs \nin\n\n[[Page S11073]]\n\nthe Gulf Coast States impacted by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita; \nto the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU: Mr. President, I come to the floor today to highlight \nthe ongoing needs of our small businesses and homeowners in the Gulf \nCoast who were devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In Louisiana \nalone, these disasters claimed 1,464 lives, destroyed more than 200,000 \nhomes and 18,000 businesses and inflicted $25 billion in uninsured \nlosses. Many of my colleagues here in the Senate have been down to \nLouisiana and have seen firsthand the size and scope of the \ndestruction. The Congress has been very generous in providing billions \nof Federal recovery dollars as well as valuable Gulf Opportunity (GO) \nZone tax incentives to help spur recovery in the region. These \nresources will be key in the recovery of the region but there are \nadditional needs on the ground that still must be addressed. That is \nwhy I am proud to introduce a bill today, the Gulf Coast Back to \nBusiness and Homes Act of 2006, which I believe, addresses these \nproblems and shows our small businesses and homeowners that the Federal \ngovernment is responsive to their needs. I am happy that my colleague, \nSenator Kerry, Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business & \nEntrepreneurship Committee, has joined me by cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Katrina was the most destructive hurricane ever to hit the United \nStates. The next month, in September, Hurricane Rita hit the Louisiana \nand Texas coast. It was the second most powerful hurricane ever to hit \nthe United States, wreaking havoc on the southwestern part of my state \nand the east Texas coast. This one-two punch devastated Louisiana \nlives, communities and jobs, stretching from Cameron Parish in the west \nto Plaquemines Parish in the east.\n  We are now rebuilding our State and the wide variety of communities \nthat were devastated by Rita and Katrina, areas representing a diverse \nmix of population, income and cultures. We hope to restore the region's \nuniqueness and its greatness. To do that, we need to rebuild our local \neconomies now and far into the future.\n  My State estimates that there were 71,000 businesses in the Katrina \nand Rita disaster zones. As I mentioned, a total of 18,752 of these \nbusinesses were catastrophically destroyed. However, on a wider scale, \naccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, over 125,000 small and \nmedium-sized businesses in the Gulf region were disrupted by Katrina \nand Rita. Many of these businesses have yet to resume operations and \nothers are struggling to survive. We will never succeed without these \nsmall businesses. They will be the key to the revitalization of the \nGulf Coast. We also cannot succeed if our homeowners are being buried \nunder red tape and regulations.\n  The people who work for the Small Business Administration and FEMA \nare dedicated and interested to help in the recovery of our region. \nHowever, these individuals are operating under a system which is \ninadequate and, in some cases, unresponsive to needs on the ground.\n  I come to the floor today to introduce a bill which provides \ncommonsense solutions to get the Federal assistance to our struggling \nbusinesses and homeowners. If we don't help them now, building a strong \nGulf Coast will be all the more difficult if residents cannot rebuild \ntheir homes and businesses cannot open their doors.\n  After talking to the business leaders and small businesses in my \nState, there are two things that they need right now: access to capital \nand additional time to repay their SBA Disaster loans. For homeowners, \nthey are still encountering an SBA which is only disbursing small \namounts of loan funds for home rebuilding. The SBA is also deducting \nproceeds from State-administered housing recovery grants to payoff \nexisting SBA Disaster home loans. I understand the SBA is just doing \nits job and following the current laws, but I believe this is a \nsituation where the current laws are actually hurting taxpayers in \ntheir efforts to fully recover.\n  For example, under current law, the SBA cannot disburse more than \n$10,000 for an approved Disaster Loan without showing collateral. This \nis to limit the loss to the SBA in the event that a loan defaults. \nHowever, this disbursement amount has not been increased since 1998 and \nthese days, $10,000 is not enough to get a business up and running or \nto allow a homeowner to start making repairs. Our bill increases this \ncollateral requirement for Katrina and Rita Disaster Loans from $10,000 \nto $35,000.\n  To address the lack of access to capital for our businesses, the bill \nincludes a provision to provide funds to Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Texas to help small businesses now. Not three months from \nnow, but as quickly as possible. We are asking for $100 million so that \nbusinesses can have money they need to repair, rebuild, and pay their \nemployees until they get back up and running again. The States know \nwhat the needs of their affected businesses are and we want to provide \nthem with this money so they can start helping businesses now.\n  Many businesses and homeowners are also coming up on the end of their \nstandard one-year deferment of payment on principal and interest on \ntheir SBA Disaster Loans. For most disasters, one-year is more than \nenough time for borrowers to get back on their feet. But for disasters \non the scale of Katrina and Rita, one-year came and went, with \ncommunities just now seeing gas stations open and some homeowners are \njust now returning to rebuild their homes. This is a unique situation \nand for French Quarter businesses, where tourism is down 85 percent \nfrom pre-Katrina levels, to require them to start making payments on a \n$50,000 loan is virtually impossible if there are no customers! \nHomeowners too are experiencing widespread uncertainty and I believe \nthe current one-year deferment requires serious reconsideration. That \nis why this bill gives borrowers an additional year to get their lives \nin order--allow residents to begin fixing their homes and allow \nbusinesses the time for economic activity to pick back up.\n  For homeowners in Louisiana, the State is doing its part by setting \nup the Louisiana Road Home program, to provide homeowners with up to \n$150,000 in grant proceeds for uninsured losses on their properties. \nHowever, many applicants are concerned because under the Stafford and \nSmall Business Acts, the SBA is required to ensure there are no \n`duplication of benefits' provided to disaster victims. This means that \nSBA must review every file which received an SBA Disaster Loan, and if \nthere is deemed to be a duplication, deduct the duplication amount from \nthe grant proceeds. As I said, I want the SBA to ensure taxpayers funds \nare used wisely, but at the same time, I want to ensure that all \nresidents are able to get the funds they need to rebuild their homes.\n  Under the current scenario, some residents who have additional \nuninsured losses, are being required to still pay back these grant \nproceeds. This is because many SBA loss inspections were done right \nafter the storms in 2005, but since then building/labor costs have \nincreased dramatically, and this is not reflected in the SBA verified \nloss. Borrowers are able to request a loan modification from SBA, but \nmany residents who waited months and months for SBA to respond, are \nwary to go through the process again, especially if there is a prospect \nthey will be declined for the increased loan amount. I can't blame them \nbecause there is enough uncertainty down there right now. Personally, I \nwould also be hesitant to go through the SBA loan process again if I \nhad to fill out as much paperwork as my constituents have had to fill \nout, and to receive constant requests for more information once they \nthink they are done with submitting information.\n  For this reason, this bill provides the SBA Administrator the \nflexibility to consider this `duplication of benefits' to be, rather \nthan the entire SBA loan amount, to instead be the difference between \nthe Federal Government's subsidized interest rate on the loan and the \nmarket rate at which the borrower could have borrowed such funds. This \nprovides borrowers with additional funds for rebuilding while retaining \nthe Federal Government's financial responsibility to taxpayers.\n  In introducing this bill today, I am hopeful it sends the signal to \nGulf Coast residents and businesses that Congress has not forgotten \nabout them. Congress has done a great deal during\n\n[[Page S11074]]\n\nthe 109th Congress to help disaster victims, but that does mean we \nshould just write off recurring problems to the responsibility of \nstates or disaster victims themselves. I believe that both the \nleadership on the Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship \nas well as the new SBA Administrator, Steve Preston, are receptive to \naddressing these ongoing needs in the Gulf Coast. I look forward to \nworking closely with them in the coming weeks to provide substantive \nand lasting solutions for our small businesses and homeowners.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4072\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 516\n\n       Whereas motor vehicle travel is the primary means of \n     transportation in the United States;\n       Whereas everyone on the roads and highways needs to drive \n     more safely to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from \n     motor vehicle accidents;\n       Whereas the death of almost 43,000 people a year in more \n     than 6 million highway crashes in the United States has been \n     called an epidemic by Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta;\n       Whereas according to the National Highway Transportation \n     Safety Administration, wearing a seat belt saved 15,434 lives \n     in 2004 and 15,632 lives in 2005; and\n       Whereas the Sunday after Thanksgiving is the busiest \n     highway traffic day of the year: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) encourages--\n       (A) high schools, colleges, universities, administrators, \n     teachers, primary schools, and secondary schools to launch \n     campus-wide educational campaigns to urge students to be \n     careful about safety when driving;\n       (B) national trucking firms to alert their drivers to be \n     especially focused on driving safely during the heaviest \n     traffic day of the year, and to publicize the importance of \n     the day using Citizen's band (CB) radios and in truck stops \n     across the Nation;\n       (C) clergy to remind their members to travel safely when \n     attending services and gatherings;\n       (D) law enforcement personnel to remind drivers and \n     passengers to drive particularly safely on the Sunday after \n     Thanksgiving; and\n       (E) everyone to use the Sunday after Thanksgiving as an \n     opportunity to educate themselves about highway safety; and\n       (2) designates November 26, 2006, as ``Drive Safer \n     Sunday''.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution to \ndesignate Sunday, November 26, 2006, as Drive Safer Sunday.\n  Motor vehicle travel is the primary source of travel in the United \nStates and statistics show that the Sunday after Thanksgiving is the \nbusiest highway traffic day of the year. Too many holidays end \ntragically due to the careless and reckless behavior of motorists and I \nhope that this resolution will raise awareness and help save lives. It \nshould also serve as a reminder to those traveling over Thanksgiving \nholidays and all year long to be vigilant, alert, and careful.\n  Steve and Susan Owings are constituents of mine in Atlanta, GA. In \n2002, their son Cullum Owings was in a fatal crash on the Sunday after \nThanksgiving while traveling back to college. This resolution is in \nhonor of Cullum, and designed with the hope that other families like \nthe Owings, will not have to suffer such a tragic loss.\n  According to the Georgia Governor's Office of Highway Safety, our \nGeorgia roads had 348,040 crashes with 1,744 fatalities in 2005. Two of \nthe major contributing factors to the loss of life in these crashes \nwere speeding and unrestrained passengers.\n  According to the National Highway Transportation Safety \nAdministration,\n  An estimated 15,434 lives in 2004 and 15,632 lives in 2005 were saved \nas a result of passengers wearing their seatbelts.\n  Safety belts, when used, reduce the risk of fatal injury to front \nseat passenger car occupants by 45 percent.\n  Six out of 10 children who died in passenger vehicle crashes were \nunbelted.\n  At least 4 percent of automobile crashes are the result of distracted \ndriving.\n  An average 119 people died each day as a result of motor crashes in \n2005--an average of one every 12 minutes.\n  From 1975 through 2005, an estimated 211,128 lives were saved by \nsafety belts.\n  From 1975 through 2005, an estimated 7,896 lives were saved by child \nrestraints.\n  In 2005, 68 percent of pickup drivers killed in traffic crashes were \nnot using a safety belt.\n  With families traveling to see relatives and students nationwide \ntrying to get back to school, America's highways and interstates are \nhighly congested and present many opportunities for dangerous or fatal \naccidents. This resolution encourages automobile drivers, truckers, \npassengers, and law enforcement agencies to work together to make the \nhighways a safer place this Sunday after Thanksgiving. It also \nencourages all Americans to slow down, wear their seatbelts, use \nsignals, and be aware of all the other cars and trucks on the road. It \nis my hope that we can all work together to reduce the number of \ninjuries and fatalities that result from car crashes while keeping \nfamilies happy and together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11075-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 616--AUTHORIZING THE MAJORITY LEADER AND ONE STAFF \nMEMBER TO TRAVEL TO MEXICO FOR THE INAUGURATION OF THE NEW PRESIDENT OF \n                 MEXICO SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 2, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nrecognizing November as National Lung Cancer Awareness Month. It is \nimportant for Americans to recognize the large number of individuals \nwho are diagnosed with and die from lung cancer each year. This \nresolution is a reminder to all Americans to help raise awareness about \nlung cancer, including the importance of early detection and treatment \nof this dreadful disease.\n  In the United States, nearly 125,000 Americans die from lung, \ntrachea, and bronchus cancer each year. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control, CDC, lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer \ndeaths nationally for men and women. More American women will die from \nlung cancer than die from breast cancer each year. The disease kills \nmore individuals than breast, prostate, colon, liver, and kidney \ncancers combined. In my home state of Georgia this year alone, more \nthan 6,200 Georgians will be diagnosed\n\n[[Page S11076]]\n\nwith and almost 5,000 will die from lung cancer.\n  The best way to decrease the amount of diagnosis and deaths per year \nfrom lung cancer is for Americans not to smoke. According to the CDC, \ncigarette smoking is harmful to human health and plays a major role in \n90 percent of all lung cancer deaths. The sooner that a person quits \nsmoking, the greater chance that person has of not contracting lung \ncancer.\n  For the fiscal year 2007, the National Institutes of Health, NIH, \nwill spend an estimated $285 million, and the National Cancer \nInstitute, NCI, will spend $261 million on lung cancer research. This \nmoney will be spent to reduce the risk of contracting the disease and \nfind a cure for lung cancer. As our Nation continues the fight against \ncancer, it is important for Congress to provide continued support to \nthe NIH and NCI in order to find a cure for this terrible disease and \nreach our goal of eliminating suffering and death from cancer by 2015. \nThrough advancements in science and research, cancer has become one of \nthe most preventable and increasingly curable life threatening \ndiseases. As a cancer survivor, I will be the first to tell you that \nprevention and detection greatly increases your chances of survival. It \nis my hope that recognizing November as National Lung Cancer Awareness \nMonth will remind everyone that maintaining a healthy lifestyle coupled \nwith early detection through screening greatly reduces the risk of \ncancer.\n  I commend the Lung Cancer Alliance of Georgia on all of their hard \nwork in helping to raise awareness regarding this deadly disease. The \nLung Cancer Alliance of Georgia has been at the forefront in organizing \nthe state movement to combat lung cancer, releasing a state report card \nfor Georgia that brings to light many specific problems our state has \nin relation to lung cancer. It is important to bring these problems to \nthe forefront in order to work together to help reduce the rate of lung \ncancer incidence and deaths. I commend my friend Ed Levitt, his wife \nLinda, and Lung Cancer Alliance of Georgia, for all of their hard work \nin making lung cancer awareness a top priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/16/senate-section/article/S11076-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 618--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 26, 2006, AS ``DRIVE SAFER \n                                SUNDAY''\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself and Mr. Isakson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) The proliferation of nuclear weapons and other nuclear \n     explosive devices poses a grave threat to the national \n     security of the United States and its vital national \n     interests.\n       (2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has proven \n     critical to limiting such proliferation.\n       (3) For the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be \n     effective, each of the non-nuclear-weapon State Parties must \n     conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA, \n     and such agreements must be honored and enforced.\n       (4) Recent events emphasize the urgency of strengthening \n     the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the \n     safeguards system. This can best be accomplished by providing \n     IAEA inspectors with more information about, and broader \n     access to, nuclear activities within the territory of non-\n     nuclear-weapon State Parties.\n       (5) The proposed scope of such expanded information and \n     access has been negotiated by the member states of the IAEA \n     in the form of a Model Additional Protocol to its existing \n     safeguards agreements, and universal acceptance of Additional \n     Protocols by non-nuclear weapons states is essential to \n     enhancing the effectiveness of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty.\n       (6) On June 12, 1998, the United States, as a nuclear-\n     weapon State Party, signed an Additional Protocol that is \n     based on the Model Additional Protocol, but which also \n     contains measures, consistent with its existing safeguards \n     agreements with its members, that protect the right of the \n     United States to exclude the application of IAEA safeguards \n     to locations and activities with direct national security \n     significance or to locations or information associated with \n     such activities.\n       (7) Implementation of the Additional Protocol in the United \n     States in a manner consistent with United States obligations \n     under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty may encourage \n     other parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, \n     especially non-nuclear-weapon State Parties, to conclude \n     Additional Protocols and thereby strengthen the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty safeguards system and help reduce the \n     threat of nuclear proliferation, which is of direct and \n     substantial benefit to the United States.\n       (8) Implementation of the Additional Protocol by the United \n     States is not required and is completely voluntary given its \n     status as a nuclear-weapon State Party, but the United States \n     has acceded to the Additional Protocol to demonstrate its \n     commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and to \n     make United States civil nuclear activities available to the \n     same IAEA inspections as are applied in the case of non-\n     nuclear-weapon State Parties.\n       (9) In accordance with the national security exclusion \n     contained in Article 1.b of its Additional Protocol, the \n     United States will not allow any inspection activities, nor \n     make any declaration of any information with respect to, \n     locations, information, and activities of direct national \n     security significance to the United States.\n       (10) Implementation of the Additional Protocol will conform \n     to the principles set forth in the letter of April 30, 2002, \n     from the United States Permanent Representative to the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency and the Vienna Office of \n     the United Nations to the Director General of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, on October 26, 2006, the Esperanza \nfire engulfed five firefighters dispatched to battle an uncontrollable \nblaze. All five firefighters died as a result.\n  Before it was extinguished, the fire consumed more than 40,000 acres \nof the southern California foothills and destroyed more than 30 homes. \nBut while the forests will eventually return and the homes will be \nrebuilt, we can never reclaim the lives of our fallen firefighters.\n  Today I am cosponsoring a resolution with Senator Boxer to honor the \nfirefighters and other public servants who bravely responded to the \nEsperanza fire.\n  On November 5, 2006, I delivered a eulogy at the Memorial Service in \nSan Bernardino, CA, held in honor of the five firefighters who lost \ntheir lives in the fire. I believe it is appropriate at this time to \nenter these remarks into the Congressional Record:\n\n\n[[Page S11097]]\n\n\n       I'm here to express gratitude to the five brave \n     firefighters who lost their lives in the battle against the \n     Esperanza fire.\n       They gave the ultimate sacrifice. Their heroism will not be \n     forgotten and so do their families' sacrifice as well.\n       My heart goes out to you, mothers and fathers, sisters and \n     brothers, sons and daughters of the five firefighters who \n     perished from Engine Crew 57: Captain Mark Loutzenhiser, Jess \n     McLean, Jason McKay, Daniel Hoover-Najera, and Pablo Cerda.\n       These five men were on the front lines, protecting \n     thousands of lives and tens of thousands of acres, when they \n     were overwhelmed by the fire's flames.\n       They are truly heroes.\n       Mark Loutzenhiser, Engine Captain, was 43 years old. He had \n     21 years of service as a firefighter. Mark was loved and \n     respected by so many in the Idyllwild community.\n       To Maria, I know little can be said that mutes grief and \n     overwhelming loss with one exception--five beautiful \n     children--Mark and Maria's enduring legacy.\n       To your five children, Jacob, Teesha, Savannah, and the \n     twins Kyle and Seth, I say this: Your dad was a true hero. He \n     was a coach, a mentor, a friend. He is great in all our eyes.\n       And to Mark's parents, Russ and Polly: You can be so proud \n     of his contributions. He made a difference. He leaves a \n     legacy: a grateful community--a wife--five children.\n       Jess McLean, Fire Engine Operator, was 27 years old. He had \n     seven years of experience.\n       To his mother, Cecilia: Jess was a thoughtful young man, a \n     model son. I am so sorry for your loss.\n       Jess's wife, Karen: You were married just three years ago. \n     But those three years are packed with memories, dreams shared \n     and you will find new strength because of these years.\n       Jason McKay, Assistant Fire Engine Operator, 27 years old. \n     He had five years of Forest Service experience.\n       To Bonnie McKay, Jason's mother, you know that Jason lived \n     out his boyhood dream of becoming a fireman.\n       To his fiance, Staci Burger, you know Jason as a brave and \n     decent man. Carry that with you, always.\n       Daniel Hoover-Najera, Firefighter, 20 years old and in his \n     second season of firefighting. As a young man, he was \n     determined to one day grow up and become a firefighter.\n       To his mother Gloria Ayala, his stepfather Efren Ayala, his \n     father and stepmother, Tim and Lisa Hoover, his brother \n     Michael, his sister Monica, and his grandfather Patrick \n     Najera, who helped raise him: I say this: Daniel will be \n     missed by all those who knew him. He was a passionate young \n     man, full of many talents, hopes and dreams. He was taken too \n     young. But he leaves a strong heritage--hold onto it.\n       Pablo Cerda, 23 years old when he lost his life in his \n     second season with the Forest Service.\n       To his father, Pablo, your son graduated from Riverside \n     Community College's fire academy only last May. He paid his \n     own way. His services, his terrible burns will not be \n     forgotten by any of us.\n       And to his older sister, Claudia, your brother Pablo will \n     be remembered for his strength and dedication. Be proud of \n     him always.\n       The deaths of these five members of the Engine 57 crew \n     represent a tremendous loss for this community, our State, \n     and the nation.\n       As we move forward from this painful tragedy, we must work \n     to protect ourselves from another fire like.\n       Just a few miles from here, in the mountains of the San \n     Bernardino National Forest, are over a half million acres of \n     bark beetle infested forest. Nestled among these trees are \n     the homes of roughly 150,000 people.\n       The five firefighters who lost their lives and the more \n     than 2,500 firefighters who fought this fire had to prevent \n     the flames from reaching the bark beetle infested areas, \n     which would have likely caused a catastrophic fire taking \n     with it, whole communities and thousands of homes.\n       Governor Schwarzenegger, Representatives Lewis, Bono, Baca \n     and I have fought for increased funding to protect our \n     communities from hazardous fuels.\n       We must recommit ourselves to this effort and remove these \n     dead and dying trees and non-native brush that present such a \n     great fire hazard.\n       And our firefighters must have the tools and training to do \n     their jobs.\n       To the 34 families who lost your homes. I say this: We will \n     help in any way we can. Our heartfelt feelings are extended \n     to you.\n       To the firefighters here today, we owe you no less. Know \n     that we value your service and commitment to fire prone \n     communities up and down the state.\n       Finally, in closing--to the families of these five brave \n     firefighters, I offer my sincerest and deepest condolences. \n     My heart is truly with you.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent a Feinstein amendment, which is at \nthe desk, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 595\n\n       Whereas the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was \n     founded on August 26, 1931, by Ernest Orlando Lawrence, \n     winner of the 1939 Nobel Prize in physics for his invention \n     of the cyclotron, a circular particle accelerator that opened \n     the door to modern high-energy physics;\n       Whereas the belief of Mr. Lawrence that scientific research \n     is best done through teams of individuals with different \n     fields of expertise left a legacy that has yielded rich \n     dividends for the United States in basic knowledge and \n     applied technology;\n       Whereas that distinguished legacy of accomplishment \n     includes 10 Nobel Laureates associated with the Lawrence \n     Berkeley National Laboratory, and a dozen scientists of the \n     Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who have won the \n     National Medal of Science;\n       Whereas, in 2006, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory \n     continues to be used to conduct research across a wide range \n     of scientific disciplines with key efforts in fundamental \n     studies of the universe, quantitative biology, nanoscience, \n     new energy systems, environmental solutions, and the use of \n     integrated computing as a tool for discovery;\n       Whereas scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National \n     Laboratory discovered the revolutionary new truth of the \n     accelerating expansion of the universe, are pioneering the \n     promising new scientific field of synthetic biology, and are \n     harnessing the secrets of the genome to help solve the grand \n     challenges of the world;\n       Whereas, through those accomplishments and others, \n     including finding the antiproton, advancing energy efficiency \n     and conservation technologies, deciphering the photosynthetic \n     process, pioneering the field of nuclear medicine, and \n     spearheading the development of alternative energy sources, \n     scientists of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have \n     played a critical role in advancing the world leadership of \n     the United States in fundamental and applied sciences;\n       Whereas the national scientific user facilities of the \n     Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory provide the highest \n     level of scientific, engineering, and technical support to \n     thousands of scientists each year whose published works \n     continue to consistently enrich their respective research \n     fields;\n       Whereas the newest user facility of the Lawrence Berkeley \n     National Laboratory, the Molecular Foundry, opened its doors \n     on March 24, 2006, to enable the design, synthesis, and \n     characterization of nanoscale materials, thereby opening the \n     door to unimagined scientific and technological advancements;\n       Whereas the Advanced Light Source of the Lawrence Berkeley \n     National Laboratory is a\n\n[[Page S11098]]\n\n     national user facility that generates intense light for \n     scientific and technological research that, among other \n     accomplishments, has helped reveal how bacteria resist \n     antibiotics, how inexpensive and efficient solar cells can be \n     fabricated, and how unique substances like quasicrystals \n     possess properties never before seen by humans;\n       Whereas the National Center for Electron Microscopy of the \n     Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory houses several of the \n     most advanced microscopes and tools for microcharacterization \n     in the world, including the One-Angstrom Microscope and the \n     Spin Polarized Low-Energy Electron Microscope, that allow \n     scientists to gain a basic scientific understanding of new \n     energy-efficient materials, as well as to analyze the \n     behavior of materials such as magnets, superconductors, \n     ceramics, and high-temperature alloys;
