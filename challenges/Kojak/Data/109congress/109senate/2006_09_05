Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 5631, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5631) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30th, 2007, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n\n                   recognition of the majority leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have a short statement to make, and then \nI will reframe what I expect to happen over the course of this week and \nin the near future.\n  Similar to many of my colleagues, I spent the month traveling the \ncountry. I began in Tennessee and ended in Tennessee. I visited a \nnumber of States, from the west coast to the east coast, from \nWashington State to Florida. At each stop, I spent a lot of time doing \nwhat I hope, and I am sure, all of my colleagues did, listening, \nlistening very carefully to what the American people are thinking and \nwhat they are feeling.\n  As I summarize and step away from the messages that were sent to me, \nit is pretty clear how we need to spend the next 4 weeks in the Senate \nbefore taking a break before the elections themselves. I will recite a \nfew of the items and point out the direction that will lead us into the \nnext several weeks.\n  I listened carefully, and again and again people confirmed what I \nalready knew: The Republican-led policies that we put into place are, \nindeed, working. To begin with, although despite derision from my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, the economy continues to \ngrow. As we saw yet again last week, month after month we consistently \nhave added new jobs. Productivity, the driving impetus that raises the \nstandards of living, continues to accelerate, continues to go up. We \nhave faced down many adverse developments, many adverse events in the \npast few years, including the 2001 recession, the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, corporate governance scandals, and more recently, the \ndevastating hurricanes and substantial increases in the cost of energy.\n  People do feel the rising cost of energy at the pump each day. They \nfeel the rising cost of health care.\n  As Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke pointed out last week, \ndespite all of these obstacles, our economy continues to advance and \ncontinues to grow. I am convinced, as are the constituents I met with \nduring each stop across the country, the economic security we enjoy is \ndue in large part to the Republican-led policies of tax relief and \nfiscal restraint we have implemented.\n  What is forefront in the minds of the American people is the economy; \neven more so is security--yes, economic security but security in \ngeneral.\n  From Georgia to California, and each stop in between, the people I \nmet want reassurance. They want to know when their family boards a \nplane, for example, on vacation or going to Disneyland, that plane will \nbe safe.\n\n[[Page S8910]]\n\nThey want to know, when they hop on the subway or the Metro to go to \nwork, that train will be safe. They want to know, when they fill up \ntheir gas tank, the money in their wallet is not going to end up in the \nhands of some terrorist overseas.\n  I share these same concerns. That is why we have set a very \naggressive agenda for the remainder of this session that does focus on \nfighting and winning this war on terror.\n  Last week, one of my colleagues said that 99 percent of Democrats \nwant to fight a strong war on terror. This week we will hold this \nSenate to that as we continue to debate Defense appropriations.\n  Our troops provide us an invaluable service. They fight daily on \nbehalf of those enduring principles of freedom and liberty. For their \ninvaluable service, we owe them the very best of resources.\n\n  The Defense appropriations bill is crucial to fighting a strong war \non terror and to winning it. The bill provides our soldiers with the \nresources, the training, the technology, the equipment, the authorities \nthey need to win the war on terror.\n  I encourage each of my colleagues to demonstrate their commitment to \nfighting and winning a strong war on terror by engaging in a productive \ndebate, a debate that is on point and focused on how we can keep our \ntroops strong to win this war.\n  At the end of the debate, I hope each and every one of my colleagues \nwill join me in demonstrating our commitment to our troops, our \ncommitment to strengthening and maintaining and enhancing our security \nat home and their commitment to winning the war on terror by voting to \npass the Defense appropriations bill.\n  But there is more we in the Senate can and will do to help alleviate \nthe concerns and fears the American people have about security and \nwinning the war on terror. We need to strengthen port security. After \nmonths of negotiations on this critical issue, it is time to act. We \nneed to pass the Homeland Security appropriations conference report. We \nneed to confirm critical security nominees such as John Bolton, U.S. \nambassador to the U.N.; Alice Fisher, DOJ's Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Criminal Division; Kenneth Wainstein, first Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for DOJ's new National Security Division.\n  We need to address the Supreme Court Hamdan decision, authorizing \nmilitary commissions for terrorist combatants.\n  We need to send an energy package to the President so we can reduce \nthat dangerous dependence on foreign sources of oil. Let's face it, we \nhave a serious threat to our national security when nearly 60 percent \nof the oil we consume comes from foreign countries.\n  We need to strengthen the Terrorist Surveillance Program by \nmodernizing the important Intelligence Surveillance Act definition of \n``electronic surveillance'' and ``communication'' and by enhancing \ncongressional oversight. We need to consider legislation that builds on \nthe progress we made last year with the bioterror bill, by further \nrefining and enhancing our defenses against nontraditional terrorist \nattacks. We need to secure America's prosperity by bringing budget \nprocess reform to the Senate and by finalizing a very exciting \nbipartisan competitiveness agenda package.\n  We need to continue securing America's health by bringing health \ninformation technology legislation to conference. We must continue to \nsecure America's values by promoting sound Government that begins with \nfulfilling our constitutional duty of advice and consent by bringing \nmore judicial nominations to the Senate for confirmation.\n  And it continues with addressing Internet gambling. As it is now, \nthis industry threatens to undermine the quality of life of millions of \nAmericans by bringing an addictive behavior right into our living \nrooms.\n  As you can see, we have a lot on our plate. Bipartisan support on \neach of these issues is absolutely necessary. It is election time. The \ntendency is to make everything political. For the American people, we \nneed to rise above this. We need to come together. We need to work \ntogether on these important issues that so dramatically impact the \nsecurity of the American people, the security of our homeland.\n  As we learned last year with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, on \nSeptember 11, almost 5 years ago, complacency and passiveness have no \nplace in the Senate. We must work together to ensure that we anticipate \nand address the problems facing everyday Americans. We must work \ntogether to keep America moving forward. We must work together to fight \nand, yes, win the war on terror.\n  Mr. President, let me take a final minute and update our colleagues \non the specific schedule for today.\n  Under the order, we are to immediately return to the consideration of \nthe Defense appropriations bill. We began this important funding \nmeasure prior to our adjournment. We were unable to finish it prior to \nthat recess. Although we do not have a unanimous consent agreement on \nthe bill, the Democratic leader agreed prior to the recess that we \nwould finish the bill no later than Wednesday of this week, although \ndiscussions prior to our beginning today's session indicate it may be \nThursday.\n  Chairman Stevens is here today occupying the chair and is ready to \nconsider amendments and make progress during today's session. I \nunderstand no one is ready, at this point, to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Therefore, I ask consent there be a period of morning business until \n2:30 today, with the time equally divided in the usual form; and \nfurther, that at the conclusion of that period, we resume consideration \nof the Defense appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as an additional reminder to Senators, this \nafternoon at 4:30 we will proceed to executive session for the \nconsideration of Kimberly Ann Moore to be a U.S. circuit court judge. A \nvote will occur at 5:30 on the confirmation of this judicial \nnomination.\n  Having said that, I expect a productive week as we wrap up our \nbusiness on the Defense appropriations bill.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           DoD Appropriations\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated in conversation with the \nPresiding Officer and the majority leader, I indicated that we, the \nDemocrats, would complete this bill in 2 days. We will do that. It will \nbe Thursday because today, for a lot of reasons, not the least of which \nis the weather, we will not have much time to work on it. We will \nfinish it Thursday. I indicated that to the manager of the bill and to \nthe distinguished majority leader.\n\n\n                           The Senate Family\n\n  Mr. President, we are a family in the Senate. That includes not only \nthe 100 Senators but the staff we have. Although he is off the Senate \nfloor now, Jack Hickman, who has worked for the Senate for many years \nand sits right in front of me, had knee surgery or knee replacement. As \na result of some things that do not work out as well as one could \nexpect, he became gravely ill. We are so happy that all worked out, \nthat he is now strong and healthy, and his knee works well, although \nthe surgery was very traumatic, especially the side effects.\n  We are glad Jack is back and he is healthy. He represents the Senate \nfamily that works long Senate hours with little recognition. This \nmorning you got a little recognition, which you deserve.\n\n\n                         Legislative Priorities\n\n  Mr. President, the Chaplain, this morning, said the thoughts that \nwere on my mind before coming here, and I certainly could not say them \nas well as he did, so I will read what he said in his own prayer:\n\n       Bless this legislative body today. Give Senators, during \n     these challenging times, the calmness of Your abiding \n     presence. Break the tensions of partisan divisions with the \n     soothing music of unified effort.\n\n  That phrase in the prayer says it all. We need to work together. I \nwant to focus on one thing, on one number, and that is 12. Twelve is \nvery likely the number of legislative days remaining in this Congress, \nthe 109th Congress. With the schedules we have kept in the past, we \nbasically work 3 days a week. We have 4 weeks, counting today. That \nleaves 12 days. In a normal year, in a\n\n[[Page S8911]]\n\nnormal Congress, it would be an enormous challenge to complete the work \nwe have ahead of us in 12 days.\n  In this Congress, which I have not said but which pundits and \neditorials have called the do-nothing Republican Congress, it is \nmission impossible. Think about all that remains to be done.\n  On the domestic front, the start of the new fiscal year is just days \naway. The Senate has yet to pass a single appropriations conference \nreport. There has not been a single appropriations bill sent to the \nPresident. There are 13 of them. Normally, we would have basically \ncompleted them by now, or at least have them all in conference. We in \nthe Senate have completed one appropriations bill.\n  With millions of children returning to school this week, this \nRepublican-controlled Congress has yet to pass an education funding \nbill. In addition, there are middle-class tax breaks that have been \nsidetracked. There has been a big detour. These need to be extended. \nWhy aren't they extended? There was an agreement before we left between \nthe House and the Senate conferees to have the so-called tax extenders \npassed. They agreed. But someone came up with an idea, as absurd as it \nnow sounds, that they would stick the tax extenders on a flawed minimum \nwage increase and, of course, estate tax repeal. It came here. We \nwasted a significant amount of time on it. The extenders were not \npassed. People are still waiting to have them passed. These are not \nextenders that help only Democrats, they help the country.\n  I had the head of the Business Roundtable call me. He said it is so \nimportant we pass the research and development tax credit. It was one \nof the extenders that did not pass because of this crazy idea to lump \nthem all together. As a result, we have nothing. We have no minimum \nwage increase. We did not do the extenders. And, of course, the \nAmerican people, they are not out there fighting for 8,100. That is who \nbenefits from the estate tax repeal. The American people knew this was \na foolish idea, and the Senate responded by making sure that so-called \n``trifecta,'' that we named ``defecta,'' did not pass.\n  The Medicare prescription drug bill needs to be fixed. Are we going \nto do that? Not likely. We have a crisis in health care. I used to talk \nabout 40 million people having no health insurance during this \nadministration. In these 6 years it has gone to 47 million Americans \nwith no health insurance, and millions more who are underinsured.\n  Energy: Because of the demand being lessened, energy costs have \ndropped a little bit in the last few weeks. But that has not taken away \nfrom the fact that we use 21 million barrels of oil every day in \nAmerica 7 days a week, and we import more than 60 percent of that. Are \nwe doing anything about that? No. Twelve days to do all these things.\n  On the national security front, just as much work remains to be done, \nif not more. We are a nation at war. We are still vulnerable 5 years \nafter 9/11, and we have yet to pass the Defense and Homeland Security \nbills. We are going to pass the Defense appropriations bill. We are \ngoing to do that sometime on Thursday. But we have to take that bill to \nconference, along with the other 12 appropriations bills before we can \nsend them to the President.\n  Because of delays by this Republican Congress, our borders remain \nopen and immigration reform remains stalled. There is also port \nsecurity to be considered, a phase II investigation where we had the \nassurance from the Republican leaders of the Intelligence Committee \nthat they could complete phase II. They have not done that. We still do \nnot know how the intelligence information was manipulated in an effort \nto take us to war in Iraq. The American people are entitled to that \ninformation.\n  Twelve days to finish all this work. And do you know what. It appears \nwe are not even going to try to finish the work. The Republican-\ndominated Congress is not even going to try to finish this work.\n  Today's New York Times has the headline: ``GOP Lawmakers Set Aside \nWork on Immigration.'' Sunday's Washington Post had a similar article \nentitled: ``GOP Focus on Security Issues to Sideline Other Matters.''\n  The papers report that Republicans plan to leave in September with \nimmigration undone, Medicare undone, ethics reform undone, and a budget \nundone. We do not have a budget. Then, after leaving here with nothing \ndone, they are going to go out and try to convince the American people \nthat after years of getting it so wrong, they now have the right \nprescription for our Nation's security.\n  Democrats welcome a national security debate. I hope we can have one. \nAmerica needs one. There is no excuse for the Senate not completing its \nwork. And I say, referring back to the Chaplain's prayer:\n\n       Give Senators, during these challenging times, the calmness \n     of Your abiding presence. Break the tensions of partisan \n     divisions with the soothing music of unified effort.\n\n  We want to work on a bipartisan basis to resolve the Hamdan decision. \nThat is how we bring these terrorists to justice. We want to work with \nour colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle to work something \nout on the domestic spying front.\n  There is no excuse for the Senate not completing its work. But if \nRepublicans want to work with Democrats during the next 4 weeks to \naddress the mistakes of national security, we welcome that. It is about \ntime. There is a reason the Senate faces this predicament. It is a \nreason we stare in the face: September 5. None of the people's \nlegislative priorities have been addressed in this Congress. It is \nbecause this do-nothing Republican Congress has wasted 20 months \navoiding the people's priorities so they could play partisan games \ninstead.\n  Think back over the last 2 years. Just take 2 years, not 4 years. We \nbegan, first of all, with a month-in and month-out debate dedicated to \nthe so-called nuclear option, the Republicans' attempt to rewrite \nSenate rules so we would be another House of Representatives; that we \nwould throw away the Constitution of the United States so the Federal \ncourts could be packed.\n\n  Then, instead of addressing the crisis in health care or the crisis \nin energy, the Republican Senate moved to pet issues of their political \nbase, such as the Terri Schiavo affair--a very personal issue that took \nan inordinate amount of time of the Congress. And, of course, we have \nspent weeks and weeks on a billion-dollar giveaway to repeal the estate \ntax to the richest of the rich.\n  This past summer was no different. The weeks in June and July were \ngiven to the marriage amendment and then flag desecration--two of the \nleast pressing issues facing Americans today. In fact, I was stunned to \nread in the Washington Post today that Circuit Judge Wilkinson, who was \nsaid to be in line to be the President's selection to go on the Supreme \nCourt, wrote an editorial saying: Do not amend the Constitution with \nthe marriage amendment. It is unnecessary. It is wrong. Let the States \ntake care of it.\n  Judge Wilkinson did that, one of the President's own: a waste of \ntime, the marriage amendment.\n  Then, the 1 week we worked in August was given to the Republicans' \ninfamous ``trifecta'' bill that I have spoken about earlier, the \n``defecta'' bill, as we call it. In the words of Republican Congressman \nZach Wamp, Republicans tried to ``outfox'' the country into repealing \nthe estate tax. Remember his famous quote: The only reason the \nDemocrats are mad is we outfoxed them.\n  In the end, it was the Republicans who were outfoxed.\n  With 20 months wasted and just 12 days ahead of us, it is time for a \nnew direction. We live in a very dangerous world. As we saw in Britain \nlast month, there are terrorists around the world who want to do damage \nto Americans. Unfortunately, there are too many politicians in \nWashington who want to divide the country and play politics with \nnational security instead of finding real solutions to keep America \nsafe.\n  Again the Chaplain:\n\n       Give Senators, during these challenging times, the calmness \n     of Your abiding presence. Break the tensions of partisan \n     divisions with the soothing music of unified effort.\n\n  That is what we need: unified effort. It time for a new direction.\n  Next week our country will mark a solemn anniversary: 5 years since \n9/11. I remember where I was on 9/11, right across the hall. Every \nTuesday Senator\n\n[[Page S8912]]\n\nDaschle had a leadership meeting. At 9 o'clock in the morning, \nSeptember 11, the towers were on fire. I saw them, as did all of \nAmerica. I remember where I was, and I will bet every American can \nremember where they were.\n  Five years after 9/11 America is less safe than it should be. Today, \nonly 5 or 6 percent of our ports are secure; cargo containers, 5 \npercent. Our chemical plants are vulnerable to attack. Our first \nresponders do not have the materials to be the best they could be.\n  Interoperability all over America is not there. The man responsible \nfor 9/11, Osama bin Laden, remains on the loose. The recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission have been ignored by the administration.\n  This is the Republican record of the last 5 years. It is no wonder, \nwith elections looming, they want to try to fix it in the next 12 days. \nDemocrats have a better plan to keep America safe. It is called real \nsecurity. It is tough, it is smart, and, as we laid out in a letter to \nPresident Bush yesterday, it starts by doing what the other side has \nrefused to do: change course in Iraq.\n  While Iraq was not part of the war on terror before we invaded, today \nit is emboldening terrorists and recruiting new ones. For 2 years, the \nRepublicans have been content to say ``stay the course'' in Iraq. They \nhave stood with President Bush when he says: We're not leaving Iraq as \nlong as I'm President.\n  That is wrong. They may think it is smart political strategy, but we \nknow from what is happening around the world it is a failed security \npolicy. Each day this Republican Government stays the course in Iraq, \nAmerica grows less safe.\n  Since we last met, 75 American soldiers have been killed. I do not \nknow how many have been wounded. It is approaching 21,000. My friend, \nthe distinguished minority whip, has focused on doing something about \nhead trauma with our veterans. In articles written this past week: 10 \npercent of those wounded have head trauma--10 percent. That means 2,100 \nprobably. And that is only those who now recognize they have it.\n\n  As we know, as all the articles have said, a lot of the problems \ndealing with one's ability to think come later. A lot of times you \ncan't see these head injuries, but these explosions cause the brain to \ndo things it is not capable of handling. Yet we have been turned down \nin getting financial help for these people who have been wounded in \nIraq.\n  Since we last met, I don't know how many Iraqi civilians have been \nkilled, well over 1,000. I don't know how many have been damaged for \nlife by their wounds. And since we last met, we have spent $12 billion \nof the taxpayers' money in Iraq on this mismanaged war. The Pentagon \nnow believes all the conditions exist for a civil war in Iraq. We have \na civil war in Iraq. When this many people are killed, it is a civil \nwar. The administration's most recent report to Congress says it is \nonly going to get worse.\n  Our military faces shortages of equipment and personnel that haven't \nbeen seen since Vietnam. Not a single Army nondeployed combat brigade \nis currently prepared to meet its wartime mission, and the chief of the \nNational Guard has said the Guard is ``even further behind or in an \neven more dire situation than the Army.'' At the same time, the war has \nemboldened regimes in North Korea and Iran, two countries which have \ngrown their nuclear arsenals during this administration's watch.\n  These are the consequences of staying the course in Iraq: We are less \nsafe, we face greater threats, and we are less prepared to meet them. \nThroughout this Congress, Democrats have come to the floor to demand--\nwe have done it on the Senate floor, in interviews, through speeches in \nour States, and press conferences--that the President change course in \nIraq; fight a better, smarter war on terror and secure the homeland; \nget good grades for the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, not \nfailed grades, as this administration has received.\n  Republicans have obstructed our efforts. We have offered amendment \nafter amendment, and they have turned them down on a separate, party-\nline vote--amendments to protect nuclear plants, chemical plants, \nnuclear-power-generating facilities, amendments to help first \nresponders--party-line votes, no. Republicans have obstructed our \nefforts and chosen to rubberstamp President Bush's failed security \nstrategy.\n  With just 12 legislative days left before the end of this Congress, I \nonce again ask my Republican colleagues: Is now the time for the Senate \nto hold President Bush accountable for his failed policies and demand a \nnew direction? With the 5-year anniversary of 9/11 fast approaching--\nnext Monday--it is time for America to refocus its efforts in the war \non terror by implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, \nchanging course in Iraq, and taking a smarter, better approach to \nhunting terrorists and preventing the next threat. We have 12 days to \nwork together, not as Democrats and Republicans but as Americans doing \neverything we can to keep America safe.\n  On this side of the aisle, we are willing to work on these national \nsecurity issues that we have read in the papers is what the Republicans \nwant to focus on. We welcome that. But let's do it on a bipartisan \nbasis so that when we finish our work, we are safer than when we \nstarted; not political diatribe, not an effort to embarrass one another \nbut reflecting on what the Chaplain said today:\n\n       Give Senators, during these challenging times, the calmness \n     of Your abiding presence. Break the tensions of partisan \n     divisions with the soothing music of a unified effort.\n\n  We look forward to a unified effort. We take the challenge of \nspending this month debating national security issues, if that is what \nthe majority chooses. In the meantime, we recognize what has not been \ndone with the domestic agenda, which is also extremely important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8912-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8912-S8914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AN AMPLE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I salute the Democratic leader for his \nopening remarks. This is the beginning of the September session of this \nCongress, as we roll toward the election. The majority leader has \nsuggested we will be here for perhaps 3 or 4 weeks. I hope we can work \ntogether, as Senator Reid suggested, in a bipartisan fashion. There is \ncertainly an ample agenda before us, a lot of things we should be \nconsidering.\n  I spent most of August traveling up and down Illinois, in the city of \nChicago and cities large and small. It is clear to me that there is \nmuch we need to do.\n  Yesterday was Labor Day. Yesterday I noted in the State of Illinois \nthat 330,000 workers are making less than what we are proposing as an \nincrease in the minimum wage. That means 330,000 individuals got up \nthis morning and went to work in Illinois, taking on some of the \ntougher jobs, some of the dirtier jobs, some of the jobs that demand \nmore time away from your family, and they are faced with a wage which \ncannot sustain their families.\n  Imagine living in a State governed by the Federal minimum wage of \n$5.15 an hour--the same wage, the same level of wage it was 9 years \nago. For 9 straight years, the Republican Congress and the Republican \nPresident have refused to increase the minimum wage for the lowest paid \nworkers in America. This breaks with tradition.\n  Historically, this was a bipartisan issue. We didn't quarrel between \nDemocrats and Republicans. We said: For goodness' sake, justice and \nfairness require that you give people who are working so hard for so \nlittle money an increase once in a while. The cost of living goes up; \nwe know that. But for 9 years, the Republicans have said no, no \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n\n  But there is an interesting thing to note. During that same 9-year \nperiod, when we have said that the lowest paid workers in America \nshould be stuck at making around $10,000 a year, Congress has voted \nitself an increase in pay of $31,000 a year. We say no to millions of \nAmerican workers, some of them single moms trying to raise their kids \nas best they can. We say no to increasing their minimum wage, and we \nincrease the salary of Members of Congress.\n  We have taken a stand on the Democratic side. It is not going to \nhappen this year. If the Republican majority\n\n[[Page S8913]]\n\nrefuses to increase the minimum wage for millions of these workers, \nthere will be no increase in congressional pay. It is a small thing, \nmaybe only symbolic, but it is an important symbol. Finally, Members of \nthe Senate and Members of Congress have to realize there are \nconsequences to their actions.\n  Yesterday, on Labor Day, I went to Rock Island, IL--one of our better \nLabor Day parades. Former Senator John Edwards was there. My colleague \nLane Evans, who is retiring from the House of Representatives, and a \nnumber of local people all came out to speak to those who gathered to \nrecognize the contributions of every working American. The No. 1 issue \nwas the minimum wage. We are lucky our Governor, Rod Blagojevich, has \nraised the minimum wage in Illinois by State law. Some States have done \nthat. They have given up on waiting for the Federal Government to do \nit.\n  If we want to do something before we leave for the November election, \nwouldn't it be good to return to those days when there was bipartisan \nsupport for an increase in the minimum wage? Couldn't we pass even this \nweek an increase in the minimum wage to $7.50 an hour phased in over a \nfew years? Shouldn't we at least say to these hard-working Americans \nthat we are going to give them a helping hand to raise their children \nand keep their families together, pay for daycare, pay for medicine, \nand food and clothing? That is something we could do.\n  There is something else we could do. We have a Medicare prescription \nPart D which provides the possibility of lowering the cost of \nprescription drugs to millions of seniors across America. Before we \nleave, on a bipartisan basis, why don't we say that the Medicare \nProgram can bargain with the pharmaceutical companies to get the best \nlow prices for seniors across America? That was a glaring omission in \nthe original bill. As a result, our seniors under this program are \npaying more today than they should. How do we know this? Because under \nthe Veterans' Administration policies, they bargained with the drug \ncompanies, and for the 22 most frequently prescribed drugs for seniors, \nthe VA price for those drugs is substantially lower than what seniors \nare paying today under the Medicare Program.\n  So why don't we, on a bipartisan basis, say that we will give to \nseniors across America the same benefit, the same helping hand that we \ngive to our veterans; that we will give them lower drug prices? Most of \nthese people we are talking about are on fixed incomes. They are trying \nto get by, and the cost of prescription drugs is going up. A helping \nhand for these Americans is something we can achieve, something we can \ndo. It is something we ought to focus on in a bipartisan effort in the \nclosing days of this session to really help those Americans.\n  There are so many other things we can do, and I sincerely hope that \nwe do. When you consider the national energy situation, we have noticed \nin the Midwest the price of gasoline started coming down again. I don't \nknow if other Members have noticed that. Interesting timing, isn't it? \nAs the vacation season ends and Americans are no longer driving across \nthe country with their families, burning up more gasoline, the price is \nstarting to come down. I would like to believe that this is a trend \nthat will continue and the prices will get much lower, but I am not \nconfident because what we have seen is that the oil companies that are \nrecording the highest profits in their history have the ability to \nraise these prices just as they raised them at gasoline stations around \nyour hometown. And we don't have any control in Washington. The best we \ncould get was a comment from the President and some of the Republican \ncongressional leaders about how unhappy they were with gasoline prices \nbut nothing more. There was no serious effort to penalize the oil \ncompanies that have run up these profits at the expense of families and \nbusinesses and farmers across America. We need a national energy \npolicy.\n  As I travel around my State and the country, it is very clear that \nelements of that policy are obvious to most people. We need to have \nmore fuel-efficient cars and trucks. The fuel economy of the vehicles \nwe drive will do more to lessen our dependence on foreign oil than \nanything else. Sixty percent of the oil we import goes right into the \ntank. So if we want to have a serious effort toward reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil, we need to have more fuel-efficient cars and \ntrucks.\n  I have tried three different times over the last 4 years to put in a \nnew CAFE standard for America so that the makers of these cars and \ntrucks will start building better cars and trucks with better \ntechnology that use less fuel. I can't get a majority, but I think the \nnumbers are starting to change. For the first time I am noting that \nsome of my Republican colleagues are seriously considering that \npossibility. We should do it. We could put in a new CAFE standard \nbefore we leave for the election and say to America: This is the \nimportant first step in moving us toward less dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Today, as we fill up our tanks, hand over our cash and credit cards \nto pay for it, understand that a portion of the money that we pay at \nthe gas station ends up in the hands of foreign governments, some of \nwhich are not on the same wavelength or on the same agenda as the \nUnited States when it comes to foreign policy. Sadly, some of the \ncountries that we are sending money to for oil are using the proceeds \nfrom that oil to support terrorism. That is unacceptable. We need to \nhave an energy policy which reduces our dependence on foreign oil and, \nin fact, burns less fuel when we drive our cars and trucks, not only \nsaving us money as individuals and families and businesses but also \nreducing pollution in the process and reducing the threat of global \nwarming.\n  A lot of families across Illinois come up to me and talk about the \ncost of health care. It has reached a point for some that is sad and \npainful and many times embarrassing. At one of my town meetings, a man \ncame up afterwards and said: I am one of those families, those \nuninsured families. I have a sick child. I worry about him. Anyone \nwould.\n  To think that we have reached a point in America where it is \nacceptable that more and more people have no coverage, no health \ninsurance, is something that is not consistent with the values of our \nNation. We should be working on a bipartisan basis to extend health \ninsurance--affordable, quality health insurance--to every American \nfamily. Estimates are that 48 million Americans are without health \ninsurance today, which is roughly 1 out of 6 Americans. That doesn't \ncount the millions who have health insurance that is worth little or \nnothing.\n  Why are we not taking this on? Why isn't this an issue on which \nCongress focuses? It could be a good bipartisan issue for us to work \non. When I think of what we have been considering over the last several \nmonths before the August recess, it is very clear to me that instead of \na clarion call from Capitol Hill to unite behind an inspired program \nthat really moves us forward as a nation, what we have heard is the \ndeath rattle of a Congress that is dominated by special interest groups \nand those who are looking for a political advantage as we approach the \nNovember 7 election.\n  The first special interest domination is obvious by the trifecta \nbill. If you go to a racetrack--and I have been to a few in Illinois--\nand you bet $2 on a trifecta, you know your odds of winning are very \nlow. It is a high-stakes bet. It is a high-risk bet. Many more people \nwill lose than will win. So it is the right name for the Republican \nprogram--the trifecta bill--that would give a tax break to the \nwealthiest families in America. Two-tenths of 1 percent--that is, 2 \nfamilies out of every 1,000--would get a tax break, and they are the \nwealthiest families in America.\n  Senator Frist and his colleagues on the Republican side have said \nthis is our highest priority. In the midst of a war when we are asking \nfor sacrifice from our brave soldiers, in the midst of a war in Iraq \nwhen we are asking the families of those soldiers who pray every night \nfor their safety to stand by our country, in the midst of a war in Iraq \nwhere we have spent over $300 billion, with no end in sight, as we \nfight a war that costs us up to $3 billion a week, which requires that \nwe cut back on spending at home for education and health care, in the \nmidst of this situation, this President and his Republican counterparts \nin Congress have identified as their highest priority cutting taxes for \nthe wealthiest people in America.\n\n[[Page S8914]]\n\n  This is the first President in the recorded history of the United \nStates of America to ever ask for a tax cut in a war, for obvious \nreasons. If you have a budget for the country and then a war on top of \nit, every other President in our history has understood that you cannot \ncut taxes. Most of them have raised taxes to try to pay for the war. \nBut not this President, not this Congress; they are cutting taxes in \nthe midst of a war, driving us deeper and deeper into deficit--a debt \nwhich our children and their children will carry for generations. That \nis not fiscally sound. It doesn't add up. To think that is a much \nhigher priority to many in the leadership on the other side of the \naisle is an indication of how far we have moved away from mainstream \nthinking in America.\n  A lot of people are dissatisfied with this country's direction. A \nrecent poll announced last week that two out of three people in America \nsay our Nation is on the wrong track, that we need a new direction, \nthat we can do better. We asked them: What is it you are thinking of \nwhen you speak of this? They say, No. 1, the war in Iraq. Something is \nwrong here. This is not what we were told we would get into. We were \npromised by this administration that removing Saddam Hussein would \nresult in the Iraqi people greeting us with open arms, that we would \nsee them move toward a democracy and set a standard for the rest of the \nworld. Well, here we are in the fourth year of this war, having lost so \nmany of our brave soldiers, and we are not close to that goal. There is \nno end in sight. The President's answer is a throwaway phrase: ``Just \nstay the course.''\n  The President has said that there won't be a serious discussion of \nremoving American troops under his watch. That is up to the next \nPresident, he said. That means waiting more than 2 years to really \nstart bringing American troops home. Is it any wonder the American \npeople are upset with that, that they think we need a new direction in \nIraq?\n  They understand that when it comes to the war on terrorism, we were \nattacked on 9/11 by al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, and the al-Qaida \nterrorists. I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee at that time. \nThe best estimates we had were that there were 20,000 of these willful \nkillers around the world who launched that attack on the United States. \nOur intelligence agencies report today that they estimate there are \n50,000 members of al-Qaida around the world. We know that before our \ninvasion of Iraq, there was virtually no evidence of al-Qaida in the \nnation of Iraq. Today, al-Qaida has become a potent force, sowing seeds \nof discord within Iraq and launching attacks against American soldiers. \nAl-Qaida's franchise has arrived in Iraq since we invaded.\n  So we have a big job ahead of us to make America safe in a dangerous \nworld, protect against terrorism. We should go back to where we \nstarted, when the overwhelming majority of the Senate voted to go after \nal-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. That is a mission not yet \naccomplished. We need to do more to go after al-Qaida. Unfortunately, \nthis administration has not focused the resources necessary. They have \ndisbanded the effort to find Osama bin Laden in the CIA, a special \ngroup put together for that purpose. I believe it is time to renew that \neffort, that commitment toward removing al-Qaida to make America safe.\n  Mr. President, as we see the agenda before us in the next few weeks, \nthere are several things we can move forward with on a bipartisan \nbasis: the minimum wage, doing something about Medicare prescription \nPart D, and making certain we move toward a nation with an energy \npolicy that will sustain the growth of our economy and not destroy the \nenvironment in which we live. We can accomplish these things--and we \nshould--in the days ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8914-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8914-S8915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when I came to Congress years ago, I had \nno idea that one of the major issues I would face and be involved in \nwas the tobacco industry. Now, I knew what tobacco had done to my \nfamily. I lost my father when he was 53 years old. He died of lung \ncancer. He smoked two packs of cigarettes a day. I was just a sophomore \nin high school when he died. I stood there by his bed at his last \nbreath and thought to myself, I hope I am smart enough to never be \naddicted to tobacco, because I have seen his young life destroyed by \nit.\n  I didn't swear to go against the tobacco companies. That sure wasn't \nthe reason I ran for office. But the time came, as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, when issues started presenting themselves \ninvolving tobacco. As they presented themselves, I recalled my personal \nand family experience with death and disease from tobacco, and I \ndecided to get involved.\n  About 15 or 16 years ago, I introduced a bill to ban smoking on \nairplanes. I was a Member of the House and didn't know any better, and \nI was told by the experts: You are going to lose; nobody beats the \ntobacco lobby; they are too powerful in this town. All of the \nleadership on both sides of the aisle in the House opposed my \namendment. To my great surprise, it passed anyway. It turns out that \nMembers of the House of Representatives, and ultimately Members of the \nSenate, are frequent fliers. They knew how ridiculous it was to have \nsmoking sections on airplanes and nonsmoking sections. Eventually, we \nreached a point where there was no smoking on airplanes. My colleague \nfrom New Jersey, Frank Lautenberg, carried this bill successfully in \nthe Senate. Together, we worked and banned smoking on airplanes.\n  A lot of things have happened in America since. Once we established \nthat it was unsafe to be exposed to secondhand smoke on airplanes, \npeople started asking the obvious questions: Is it safe in an office? \nIs it safe in a hospital? Is it safe on an Amtrak train or on a bus? \nAmerica started moving toward a new standard over the last 16 years, \nand I am happy to say there are now fewer and fewer places in America \nwhere you are exposed to secondhand smoke. Most smokers who are still \naddicted at least ask permission before lighting up. Most know it is \nbetter to go outside. That is a changing standard in America and one \nthat I believe has led to a healthier nation.\n  Make no mistake, while we have made progress in dealing with tobacco, \nthe tobacco companies have still been selling their deadly product. As \nthey sell that product, we learn more and more about their corporate \nstrategy. Let me read to you the opening line in an editorial last week \nwritten in Newsday, a publication in New York:\n\n       Lying is as natural to tobacco executives as breathing once \n     was to their customers.\n\n  They were reacting to last week's stunning disclosure that the \ntobacco industry is up to its same old tricks. During the last 6 years, \ncigarette manufacturers have steadily increased the level of nicotine \nsmokers inhale every time they smoke. Nicotine, of course, is that \naddictive chemical in the cigarettes which leads people to smoke even \nmore. During the same 6-year period of time, more and more cities and \nStates have been expanding protections for people to play and work away \nfrom secondhand smoke, while the industry has been loading up their \nproduct with more nicotine so that it is tougher to quit.\n  The Surgeon General of the United States found definitively that \nsecondhand smoke is dangerous. Of the 45 million Americans who still \nsmoke today, 70 percent say they want to quit. It is tough to quit. It \nis made even more difficult because the cigarette manufacturers put \nmore of the addictive nicotine chemical in the cigarettes. We know that \nnow. The tobacco industry was found guilty of racketeering, of \nintentionally manipulating nicotine levels to create more addiction to \ncigarettes. While they are running this advertising about how dangerous \nit is to smoke, to talk to your kids--while you see those ads on \ntelevision and see what is going on in newspapers and magazines, all \nthis advertising notwithstanding, they are pumping more and more of \nthis addictive nicotine into their product.\n  We passed in the Senate a provision that would have given the FDA the \nauthority to regulate cigarettes. It died in conference. Once it went \ninto a conference with the House of Representatives, they stopped it. \nSo this deadly product of tobacco and cigarettes continues to be the \nonly product in America that is widely sold and is not regulated by our \nGovernment. It is not regulated in terms of its contents or its \nmarketing or advertising. You would think that in a situation such as \nthis, the tobacco industry would have spent\n\n[[Page S8915]]\n\nthe last 6 years cringing over the feeling that their product was so \ndeadly. No, they decided to crank up the nicotine levels in popular \nbrands of cigarettes. They made their deadly product even harder to \nquit using. If you are one of the 70 percent of smokers who really want \nto quit, tried to quit and haven't been able to, thank the \nmanufacturers of that cigarette you are smoking; they made sure there \nis enough nicotine in every pack so that it is tough for you to stop \nyour addiction.\n  Of course, the cigarette industry won't even consider informing their \ncustomers of the higher levels of nicotine. Instead, the companies ran \nad campaigns promoting ``light'' and ``low tar'' brands--descriptions \nthat were meaningless and only misled people into buying and smoking \nmore cigarettes.\n  Newsday wasn't the only publication to speak out on this issue. The \nNew York Times wrote:\n\n       It is stunning to discover how easily this rogue industry \n     was able to increase public consumption of nicotine without \n     anyone knowing about it until Massachusetts blew the whistle. \n     . . .It is long past time for Congress to bring this damaging \n     and deceitful industry under Federal regulatory control.\n\n  You have to hand it to the cigarette makers. It is a great business \nplan. Every day, 4,000 teenagers take their first cigarette and start \nsmoking. They don't need to smoke very long before their bodies have \nabsorbed a lot of nicotine and they are on to an addiction. If you are \naddicted to cigarettes, of course, you want more of them.\n  The latest stand came several weeks after a Federal court found the \ncigarette makers guilty of racketeering. The Washington Post says of \nJudge Kessler's opinion that it:\n\n       . . . is moving and powerful. It is exhaustive in scope, \n     detailed and utterly convincing that the industry sought for \n     five decades to mislead the American people and Government \n     concerning the deadly consequences of smoking.\n\n  After several years of litigation against the industry by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, Judge Kessler found:\n\n       Defendants have marketed and sold their lethal product with \n     zeal, with deception, with the single-minded focus on their \n     financial success, and without regard for their human tragedy \n     or social costs that success exacted.\n\n  Two weeks after the strong rebuke of the industry's practices, the \ncigarette makers filed a motion with Judge Kessler. Do you know what \nthey wanted to know? They asked if her directive to stop misleading \ncustomers about light and low-tar labels on their cigarettes meant they \nhad to stop deceiving people overseas. They wanted to know if they \ncould still practice their deception of their products they sell around \nthe world, even though they have been told not to do it in the United \nStates. What a great industry.\n  The Washington Post this morning said:\n\n       (I)n a sign of the boundless rapaciousness of these \n     companies in marketing death, they had the temerity to ask \n     [the judge] not to apply her order ``to sales wholly outside \n     the United States.'' If we can't continue to defraud \n     Americans into killing themselves, they effectively asked, \n     can we at least keep suggesting to billions of people abroad \n     that some cigarettes are safer than others?\n\n  Think about that. They had the nerve to ask if they could sell this \nproduct overseas and continue to deceive when they have been stopped \nfrom doing so in the United States. If any doubts remain about this \nruling and the willingness of this industry to play fair, last week's \nnews put it to rest.\n  Nicotine levels spiked even while this trial was underway, and there \nwas no one--no industry representative, no Federal agency, no consumer \ngroup with access to the information--no one to question the cigarette \nmakers. If it were not for the State law and diligent health \nrequirements in Massachusetts, we still would not know.\n  The very helpful nicotine replacement products people use to help \nthem quit smoking are not very effective if the cigarettes they are \ntrying to give up are delivering much more nicotine.\n  Who is going to tell the consumers?\n  The cigarette makers have gotten away with this latest spike in \nnicotine, as they have gotten away with lies and deceptions in the \npast.\n  I have proposed, along with others, regulating this industry. It is \ntime for us to know the contents of this product, to market it in an \nhonest fashion, and to put meaningful warning labels on cigarette \npackages in the hopes that we can stop young people from taking up this \nhabit.\n  I have said, in my entire life, I have never heard a single parent \ncome to me and say: I have the greatest news in the world: My daughter \nhas decided to smoke. I have never heard that because parents know \nintuitively--and we all know intuitively--that it is the beginning of \nan addiction which can lead to compromised health and death.\n  I urge my colleagues who have turned their back on this tobacco issue \nfor too long to acknowledge what has happened with these decisions and \nwith this disclosure by the Massachusetts health department. We need to \ndo more. We need to regulate this product, and we need to protect \nAmerican consumers.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Mr. President, it is nice to be back after having nearly \na month break. It is a good opportunity to come back and see what the \nrest of the world is like. I think we have a lot of great challenges \nbefore us, and I hope we can accomplish a great deal. To do that, we \nare going to have to have some agreement among the folks here.\n  I am compelled to come to the Chamber because there has been a great \ndeal of criticism on the floor today of the Congress and the lack of \nactivity in the Congress over time, and certainly all of us agree we \ncould do more and we need to do more. In order to do that, we have to \ncome to some sort of an agreement.\n  One of the problems with getting things done with 55 votes is that \nanyone can object, and it takes 60 votes to override that, and we have \nhad a lot of that experience from our friends on the other side of the \naisle. So we need to do a great deal more than we have been able to do.\n  I am hopeful we can begin to talk more about issues. There is a \ndifference of view about issues. That is what the Senate is all about. \nThere are differences of views everywhere. We ought to talk about the \nissues and not just talk about politics. So I hope we can address those \nissues in a more direct way and not just simply be critical in order to \ntalk about the future in terms of the Congress. I am here to say we \nhaven't done all we would like to do. No one would argue with that. On \nthe other hand, we have accomplished quite a number of things over a \nperiod of time. We have a great deal to do and a great many challenges.\n  Securing the homeland has been one of the top issues, of course, \nbecause of the threats we have going back to 11 September and the \ncontinuing threats we hear about, whether it be in London or whether it \nbe in the Middle East. There is a terror problem in this world. We have \na PATRIOT Act that gives us much more strength to be able to deal with \nthe kinds of things that are going on. We have secured the borders much \nmore than we have in the past. Is there more to do? Absolutely. We have \n14,000 agents and 25,000 beds to deal with the problem at the border.\n  I am one who believes we ought to be doing something on immigration. \nI believe we ought to continue to tighten the border. We ought to \ninitiate efforts to define who is illegal and who isn't. We should be \nable to get employers to report whom they have as illegal and so on, \nand we need to do some of those things. I am not for giving amnesty, \nbut we can deal with the problems we have, and I hope we can come \ntogether and do some things. We have funded the war on terror, and \nthere is a war on terror.\n  Securing America's prosperity. We have heard a great deal about the \neconomy in the last few days with the latest reports. We have created \n5.3 million\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\njobs over the last couple of years. That is a lot of work. That is a \nlot of jobs. We have had a reduction in unemployment. We have had a \ngood deal more activity in the economic sector, and there is no \nquestion about that.\n  Now, some places are different from others. In my State, we have had \na great deal of economic opportunity. We have lower unemployment than \nwe have had for a very long time.\n  We have managed to reduce taxes. I think that is a good thing. That \nis what has encouraged the economy. That is what has created these new \njob opportunities.\n  We cut taxes by $70 billion. Most of us agree that we ought to be \nable to keep the taxes as low as we can and continue to provide the \nservices.\n  We have cut entitlement growth in terms of trying to deal with the \ndeficit. We need to do much more with the deficit, but we have cut \nentitlement growth--$100 billion in the 10 years to come.\n  There are things that we are doing. We have accomplished a good deal, \nalthough there is much more to do. There is no question about that. But \nwe ought to do it by planning together, by deciding together. The idea \nof just making this criticism doesn't get much done.\n  We have worked on energy. We have done a great deal on energy. \nCertainly we wish prices were still lower, but the fact is, we have had \nthe energy, and that is an interesting thing. With all the dislocation \nthere has been in the Middle East, with all the dependency we have had \non energy in the Middle East, we have still been able to keep our \nenergy supply going.\n  Now, interestingly enough, gas prices are going down. There are new \ndiscoveries in the gulf coast which we in the Congress opened recently. \nThat is a very important thing to help us with energy. It could create \na real opportunity for us to have lower energy prices. But the fact is, \nover time we have to find some new sources of energy.\n  We have an energy bill that is in place, an energy policy passed in \nthis Congress for the first time in years. Now, of course, we are \nworking on alternative sources.\n  Those do not happen overnight, so it will be 15 or 20 years before \nsome of these new sources become important, but they will be, and that \nis the kind of looking forward that I believe we have to have.\n  As a result of this Congress, we have an energy policy that is \nworking out for alternative sources, working out for more efficiency \nand more conservation in our use. We have to do that over time. There \nis no question about that.\n  These are very important things that have been done. If you just \nlisten to the media and listen to what sometimes is said here, as it \nwas this morning, you would think nothing has been done, and it has. As \nmuch as we want? Of course not. Everything we want? Of course not. \nNevertheless, a good deal has been done.\n  We have done some things in education. We increased the Pell grants \nfor math and science competitiveness. We continue to strengthen our \nschools. More funding has gone to education. We have done that here. \nThose are positive things that are changing our country.\n  We have had a good deal of trouble with lawsuits over a period of \ntime. We had some class action reform this past year, and bankruptcy \nreform, so people are treated better under the law.\n  We have had gun liability reform, which means a lot to many people.\n  I guess I continue to repeat myself, but I think it is so unfair to \nsay that things haven't been done, that we haven't done anything, the \ndo-nothing Congress. It is not true. Could we do more? Of course.\n  As I said, one of the reasons we have not done more is because, under \nthe system, the minority can object and can stop things from happening, \nand has a great deal.\n  We have done a good deal more with our infrastructure, with highways. \nWe have had great changes in that.\n  On health care--one of the things that is most important to us and \nwhich has great challenges--we have done a great deal with drugs, the \nPart D drug benefit. That gives more opportunities--83 percent of the \npeople in Wyoming who are eligible have signed up for the Part D health \ncare. I happen to work as cochairman of the group on rural health care. \nRural health care is a little different, and we have to take a look at \nsome of the problems that are different from metropolitan areas. We \nhave accomplished a great deal, having more providers be there. We have \nmade the cost payments equal in rural areas. So we have done a good \ndeal there. We have worked on adult stem cell therapy with cord blood. \nWe have done those things. There has been work on technology, work that \nneeded to be done.\n  On the Supreme Court, of course, two judges have been put on the \nSupreme Court, 14 circuit judges, and 34 district court judges. Does \nthat mean we have done nothing in the Congress? I don't believe that is \ntrue.\n  We have more to do. There is always that thought. I am disappointed \nwe have not moved faster on the appropriations bills. Traditionally, we \nshould be further along than we are. Part of the problem, of course, is \nthere are real problems with spending. We have to do something about \nspending. We can't continue to spend at the rate that we had to spend \nbecause we had emergencies, such as Katrina and such as the war on \nterror and Iraq. When you do that in your business or your family, you \nhave to change; go back and make the changes to pick up what you had to \ndo in the emergency. That is where we are now, seeking to make those \ndifferences.\n  Within Government we have done some lobbying reform. It needed to be \ndone. We have done some of that. We have worked on the Voting Rights \nAct.\n  I guess I am a little impatient, coming back from having worked in my \nState where people are reasonably happy with what is happening, and \nthen listening to the total negative reaction we have on the floor this \nmorning about having done nothing when that is not the case. Could we \ndo more? Of course, we should do more.\n  I will not take much more time, although it looks as if I could take \nas much time as I choose this morning. I am sure we will get on into \nit.\n  We have a lot of challenges. There is no question about that. \nHomeland security is one of those challenges. We have other things we \nneed to deal with. I wish we could deal with immigration. That is one \nof the things I would like to do.\n  I am very much involved in energy, in the Energy Committee. My State \nis an energy State. We have a lot to do there to move forward.\n  In any event, I guess I am really saying we need an attitude that is \na do-something attitude. We absolutely disagree about some of the \nissues. That is part of the system. We are going to have that as we are \ngetting into an election. That is part of the system. But we need to be \nhonest about the fact that we have done some things. We have things to \ndo, and we need to work together to get them done. It seems to me that \nis our challenge.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is good to see you, and it is good to \nbe back in the Senate with you and our colleagues. With tongue in \ncheek, people ask me what I like about the Senate. I draw an analogy \nabout when I was in elementary school. What I liked most about \nelementary school was recess. Now that I serve in the Senate, I am \nstill quite fond of recesses. It is a great time to go back home--\nwhether it is Texas, Delaware, or anywhere--and reconnect with the \nfolks we serve and with our families.\n  I just had an opportunity to talk to the Presiding Officer about what \nhe did. It is good to be back and to recharge the batteries and to \nfocus. Now that we are back, I look forward to doing that with you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Twelve years ago this summer, six Democratic centrist Senators pulled \ntogether to provide support for the founding and launching of something \ncalled Third Way. Third Way is a think tank which seeks to find a third \nway to\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\ndeal with some of the issues and some of the challenges that face us \ntoday--not necessarily a Democratic or Republican approach but a \ndifferent approach. Thinking outside of the box, every month or so \nThird Way presents smart people who come to work there with their ideas \nand their thoughts on what we might do or should be doing differently \nto move our country forward.\n  Just a few months ago, in one of the rooms outside of the Senate \nfloor, a number of our colleagues, joined by General Wesley Clark, \nCongressman Steny Hoyer, the Democratic whip from the House, and a \nwoman named Sharon Burke from Third Way, joined together to talk about \nthe path and the course our country is on and whether it is time for us \nto continue the course or stay the course or whether it is the right \ntime, in some ways at least, to change course.\n  Third Way has done great work, working particularly with the \nsituation in Afghanistan and Iraq, and offered some of their thoughts \nto us which are actually found in this document. It is not all that \nlong. It is a very well documented and very sobering assessment. Given \nthe source of their comments, I think it bears special attention. The \nworld changed on September 11. I know that, and I think we all know \nthat. In addition, the world has changed a whole lot since September \n11.\n  This report from Third Way shows in ways which I think are sobering \nand compelling that some of those changes have not been for the better.\n  I think if you ask most people in the Senate, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, what they think about me, among other things they might say, \nI think a number of them would say they have found me to be someone who \ngoes out of his way to try to bring people together, to try to find \ncommon ground, to try to come up with a better solution to the \nchallenges that we face day in and day out in this country and in the \nSenate.\n  I wish I could honestly say the same thing today about our President, \nbut I am sorry to say that I cannot. I wish that instead of trying to \npoliticize the war on terror and the situation in Iraq, or to insinuate \nthat Democrats don't have the strength to stand up to our enemy, that \nhe would sit down with us and talk about how we might move forward in \nIraq and around the world.\n  I am reminded of the 8 years when I was Governor of Delaware. Every \nweek that the Delaware Legislature was in session I would host, as my \npredecessor, Governor Mike Castle, and my successor, Governor Ruth Ann \nMinner have hosted every Tuesday, a bipartisan lunch for the leaders of \nthe house and senate. We would meet in the Governor's house, which was \nclose to the capitol, where we may have lunch together and talk for an \nhour or so, and then we would go to work for the legislative day. \nSometimes we would talk about our families, sports, or the weather. A \nlot of times we talked about the issues that were before us.\n  One of the questions I would often ask of Democratic and Republican \nleaders in the house and senate who were gathered there in the \nGovernor's house that particular day was whether they had criticism of \na policy or an issue that we would propose. I would ask them: What do \nyou think we should do? What do you like about what we are proposing \nand where do you think we could improve on our policies?\n  And with respect to some of the policies of this administration--the \nPresident's policies--in too many instances they haven't worked. At \nleast with respect to what is going on in Iraq today, they have not \nmade us any safer.\n  As one who served 23 years on active duty with the Reserve as a Naval \nflight officer, I served in a hot war in Vietnam and a Cold War for \nmany years after that. I love our troops. I love the folks in the Army, \nNavy, Air Force, and Marines, people in the Guard and Reserve who serve \nwith great distinction and honor. Anything I said or, frankly, we said \nas a group a few minutes ago when we released this report should be \nviewed as expressing our support and our thanks and gratitude for those \nserving us in harm's way together.\n\n  Back in 2003, it was estimated there were roughly over 5,000 \ninsurgents in Iraq. That was 3 years ago. Now we believe there are more \nthan 20,000 insurgents in Iraq. In Afghanistan, the number of Taliban \nattacks has skyrocketed in the past 3 years.\n  We learned this week that opium production is up almost 60 percent \nfrom last year. Listen to this: Afghanistan is now producing a third \nmore opium than the world's heroin addicts are crying out for. They are \nproducing more heroin in Afghanistan than this country and the rest of \nthe world can consume. Who is profiting from this drug trade? The \nTaliban and the Afghan insurgency who are trying to destabilize the \ngovernment we put in place.\n  Meanwhile, Iran and North Korea, emboldened by our distractions in \nIraq and the lack of effective diplomacy by the United States, are now \ndefying the international community in their pursuit of nuclear \nweapons.\n  It is clear, at least to me and I believe to a lot of the people I \ntalked to back in Delaware over the course of the last several weeks, \nthat we need a new direction from this President, from this \nadministration. At least so far we have not seen or planned to correct \nsome of the mistakes we have made to put us back on the right track.\n  None of us have all the answers. I don't; I don't believe any of us \ndo. But I do know one thing: Our President needs to get over his \nideological aversion to diplomacy if we are going to solve the other \nproblems facing us in Iraq and around the world.\n  As one of our American Ambassadors said to me not long ago when I was \noverseas: Just because we ignore someone doesn't mean they are going \naway.\n  With all due respect, I believe our President needs to reach out to \nthe international community, to moderate Arab governments, to broker an \nagreement between sectarian governments in Iraq to head off civil war.\n  When I was abroad this last December, I met with officials from \nIsrael, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq. I heard from a number \nof folks from a number of the countries, and the leaders of those \ncountries that we visited, that they have tribal relations--tribes in \nSaudi Arabia, for example; Jordan has tribal relations with the tribes \nin the country of Iraq. Saudis, Egyptians, and others are majority \nSunni, and they have relations there as well. Some of those countries \nhave a lot of money. A good deal of it is our money because we buy \ntheir oil products. They have a number of incentives not to want to see \nthat part of the world devolve into terrorism, to see Iraq become a \nhotbed of terrorism and to be destabilized. It is not in the interests \nof any of the countries I have mentioned and some I have not mentioned.\n  We have to be smart enough as a country and with our administration \nto call on the other countries to bring to bear not just their money to \nhelp the situation in Iraq but the relationships that their people have \nwith the tribes in Iraq and, frankly, with the Sunnis and with other \nelements of those of the population in Iraq. We need to work with our \nallies to establish a real and credible roadmap to peace in the Middle \nEast.\n  I remember having lunch about 15 months ago, in Washington on the \nother side of the Capitol, with Palestinian President Abbas, along with \nsome of our colleagues. He had been in office for 5 months. He was \nelected in January of last year. Over lunch, I asked: President Abbas, \nwhen do you think it would be an appropriate time for us, for this \ncountry, to put in the Middle East a high-level, full-time envoy, to \nwork every day to implement the roadmap to peace? When would be a good \ntime to do that?\n  This was June of last year. He had been elected January 6 last year. \nI will never forget what he said to me. He said: Five months ago.\n  I was convinced that day, convinced when I have gone to the Middle \nEast, I am convinced today that we have let a great opportunity slip \nthrough our fingers. One of the reasons the Taliban, al-Qaida or the \nother terrorist groups were able to recruit people to blow themselves \nup, to terrorize those countries and to try to kill the rest of us is \nbecause of their ability to point to the Middle East and say: Look at \nthe Americans, they are only for the Israelis. They have no interest in \nthe Palestinians having a homeland of their own.\n  To the extent we could have brokered over the last couple of years \nand put\n\n[[Page S8918]]\n\nthe kind of energy, time, and investment into getting a negotiated \nsettlement in the Middle East, as we have put other kinds of \ninvestments in Iraq and in Afghanistan, both we and those countries \nand, I think, our people and other people would be better off, but we \nhave missed that opportunity. My fear is we are missing it again today. \nThe roadmap for peace has become in the Middle East, at least for now, \na roadmap to war.\n  Let me close by saying what is needed in this capital, in this \ncountry, is leadership that fosters a cooperative spirit. That may be a \ntribal man's hope over peace, triumph over reality as we approach an \nelection 2 months out, but I believe that is what is needed--the kind \nof leadership that fosters a cooperative spirit. If we cannot get that \nleadership now before the election, my God, I hope we can find it when \nthis election is over. I hope our President can give us that kind of \nleadership and work with those who are anxious and willing to truly \nmake this country and the world a safer place during his 2 remaining \nyears in office.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr).

Mr. President, I was delighted to hear my friend and our \ncolleague from Delaware speak a few moments ago. I like and admire him \na great deal. I take him at his word when he says we ought to work more \nclosely together in a bipartisan spirit to solve the Nation's problems.\n  While I have said how much I have admired and respected him, I \ndisagree with him. That is what we are certainly at liberty to do in \nthe Senate. I hope we do not degenerate into disagreements being \npersonal or that disagreements, particularly when it comes to security \nmatters, cast aspersions on one's patriotism.\n  I certainly do not doubt the patriotism of those who disagree with \nour current policy in the global war on terror, but there are some \nimportant reasons why their policies would lead us down a path--\nassuming they have a policy or a plan--dangerous to this country's \nsecurity.\n  It is imperative for Members of the Senate, those who have been \nentrusted with this sacred responsibility to represent the American \npeople, the people of my State of Texas, all 23 million, it is \nimperative to explain to the American people the threat that confronts \nour Nation today from a national security perspective and the \nconsequences of our failing to deal with that threat in a way that will \nbe likely to accomplish peace and stability in troubled regions of the \nworld such as the Middle East.\n  I fear the big disagreement between some of my colleagues and I on \nthis issue has to do with a different perception of the threat and \nperhaps a different perception of what the consequences would be for \nfailing to deal with that threat, so I will talk about that for a \nmoment.\n  Contrary to what some of our colleagues have said, this threat that \nour Nation confronts is not limited to Iraq. It is not limited to \nAfghanistan. Indeed, some have spoken about the need to bring our \ntroops home from Iraq, as if, if we did so, all of our problems would \ngo away and the threat with which our Nation is confronted would simply \nevaporate. That is simply wishful thinking.\n  Indeed, some have said this is not a war at all, this is more of a \npolice action; this is something that is certainly not like World War \nII, when we knew who the enemy was and we knew the threat, or at least \nafter a while we finally learned what the threat was to civilization as \nwe know it.\n  This war is not limited to Iraq. So if we were to leave Iraq, the war \nwould not be over but merely take place in a different location--\nunfortunately, right back in the United States.\n  The threat is that of those who believe in an extreme version of one \nof the world's great religions and who believe this extremism--some \nhave called it Islamic fascism--this hijacking of one of the world's \ngreat religions has justified in their minds the killing of innocent \nmen, women, and children and the establishment ultimately of a \ntheocratic or religious State. It does not respect individual rights. \nIt does not respect the right to worship according to the dictates of \nyour own conscience. It certainly does not recognize freedom of speech \nand freedom of expression and certainly does not recognize the rights \nof women as equal members of society.\n  The important point I make is that some of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle who doubt we are at war, who doubt the global \nnature of the war, and who say if we were merely to bring our troops \nhome from Iraq the threat would evaporate, one of the mistakes they \nmake is they fail to perceive when this war started.\n  If you were to ask, I bet many of them would say the war started on \nSeptember 11, 2001. However, the war had long been raging against \nAmerica before September 11, 2001; America had simply failed to realize \nit. One useful date for identifying when the start of this war began \nwould be November 4, 1979. That was the date that 66 American citizens \nwere kidnapped and held hostage in the American embassy in Iran for a \nperiod of 444 days. Or you might say the war started in 1983, when 241 \nmarines were killed in the Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, by \nHezbollah--the same terrorist organization, a proxy of Iran through \nSyria, that recently rained down Katyusha rockets on northern Israel, \nthis same terrorist organization that has killed more American citizens \nthan any other in world history, save and except for al-Qaida. Or you \ncould say the war started in 1993, when al-Qaida engineered the bombing \nof the World Trade Center in a failed attempt to bring down that trade \ncenter, which they successfully accomplished 8 years later.\n  You could say part of that war that started, perhaps as far back as \n1979, continued when 17 American sailors were killed when the USS Cole \nwas bombed. And yes, the date we focus on the most, that had the most \ndramatic impact on us right here at home, was September 11, 2001, the \nfifth anniversary of which will be coming up in the next few days.\n  But some people act as if September 11, 2001, was the single and \nsolitary event that defined this war of Islamic extremists who hate our \nway of life and simply want to eliminate it from the face of the Earth, \nalong with our ally in the Middle East, Israel. They do not connect the \ndots to what happened in Beslan, Russia, at that school; Bali; Madrid; \nLondon; Mumbai--places where individuals, driven by this extremist \nideology, which says that men, women, and children are simply fair game \nin pursuit of their agenda--are driven with such hatred that they will \nmake no distinctions between armed citizens, military, people who can \ndefend themselves or not--and, yes, these are the same individuals \ndriven by the same ideology that recently rained down more than 2,000 \nrockets out of southern Lebanon into northern Israel. Hezbollah, \nsupplied by Syria and Iran, delivered these very rockets.\n  Some wonder why America is so determined to make sure Iran does not \nget nuclear weapons. One reason why it is so critical we stop President \nAhmadi-Nejad and his regime from getting nuclear weapons is: Do you \ndoubt for a minute that if Iran had nuclear weapons they could have \nsupplied Hezbollah to carry out those attacks on Israel they would have \nwithheld their hand, that they would have failed to use them? I have no \ndoubt in my mind that, based on this war against the West and against \nAmerica, and specifically that has been raging since 1979, that if \nterrorist states, and those who support Islamic extremism, Islamic \nfascism, if they had it within their power to supply biological, \nchemical or nuclear weapons to terrorists in order to accomplish their \ngoals, they would use them.\n  That is the challenge we must meet. A few months ago, my wife and I \nvisited the battlefield at Gettysburg,\n\n[[Page S8919]]\n\nwhere 50,000 American casualties suffered from wounds. Many died as a \nresult of that great conflict so many years ago. I was reminded at the \ntime that one of the greatest challenges Abraham Lincoln had at the \ntime of that battle was convincing the American people that the desire \nto maintain the Union, the need to maintain the Union, justified \ncontinuation of war until it was successfully concluded.\n  Our job, in some ways, is exactly the same today because there is no \nmilitary force on the face of the Earth that is more powerful than that \nof the U.S. military. We are simply the best, and no one else even \ncomes close. The only way the U.S. military can be defeated is if they \nlose the support of the American people and we simply tell them to quit \nand to withdraw.\n  I believe the consequences of our quitting and withdrawing or giving \nup in Iraq and in fighting this global war against Islamic extremism \nwould be disastrous to the American people. Rather than celebrating the \n5-year anniversary since September 11 with no other terrorist attacks \nactually successfully occurring on American soil, I am sure the tale \nwould be far different because we have chosen, through a number of \ndifferent measures, that we have undertaken--whether it is passing the \nPATRIOT Act; whether it is through the use of a terrorist surveillance \nprogram that intercepts international phone calls between terrorist \norganizations and their allies in the United States; whether it is \nrooting out terrorist financing networks, which take the money out of \nthe networks that actually fund terrorist attacks; whether it is the \ncapture and interrogation of unlawful enemy combatants and getting good \nactual intelligence from them in the Guantanamo Bay facility; whether \nit is the information gathering, intelligence gathering and sharing we \nhave done--all of these efforts since 9/11 have, I believe, \ncontributed, in large part, to America not suffering another terrorist \nattack on our own soil in the last 5 years.\n  I also believe the fact we are fighting this radical ideology abroad \nin places such as Afghanistan and Iraq is part of the reason we are not \nfighting that battle right here at home.\n  I believe we are in a time of choosing, certainly in a time of \ntesting. But we simply have a choice whether we want safety or we are \nwilling to live with the danger of terrorists able to strike at \nvirtually any time they wish, whether we believe strongly enough in our \nAmerican values of freedom or whether we are willing to cower under \nthis threat and live under tyranny, whether we believe strongly enough \nthat open, transparent societies and self-determination are important \nor whether we are willing to live in some sort of prisonlike lockdown. \nThis is a time for testing our determination. And this is a time of \nchoosing what kind of America we want.\n  I know one of the most basic impulses of every parent is to hope for \na better life for their children and grandchildren than they themselves \nperhaps had. That is one of the reasons why parents have worked so hard \nand pushed their children so hard to achieve and be successful, so that \nthey may enjoy the standard of living and the opportunities that living \nin the United States has to offer.\n  I certainly know that was the reason my parents worked hard, that my \nfather flew B-17s in World War II and knocked out Hitler's war machine \nbefore being captured as a prisoner of war. I believe the threat \nconfronting our country and our way of life--indeed, the entire Western \ncivilization--is equally as great as the threat faced by the ``Greatest \nGeneration,'' people such as my mother and father.\n  If we fail to point out to the American people what the threat is and \ngive it a name and to let the American people understand how the \nvarious conflicts in the Middle East and the terrorist attacks that \noccur around the world are not disparate and isolated events but, \nrather, part of the threat of Islamic extremism that will endanger the \nnext generation--which will change the very way of life of our children \nand grandchildren--unless we meet that threat, we will have failed to \nlive up to our responsibilities.\n  Some of our colleagues say we should merely leave Iraq, bring our \ntroops home as soon as possible. There is no one who wants our troops \nhome any faster than I do. But we have to do so based upon the ability \nof the Iraqis to provide their own security. That is why we continue to \ntrain hundreds of thousands of Iraqi police officers and soldiers so \nthey can provide that security. Sure, we could leave. We could leave \ntoday. But as General John Abizaid said, the head of Central Command: \nIf we leave now, they will follow us here.\n  If we were to leave before we had a reasonable opportunity for the \nIraqi people to provide for their own security and provide for their \nown government and self-determination, what would that say about the \nsacrifices of so many who have given so much to liberate the Iraqi \npeople from a terrible dictator, to provide the people of Afghanistan \nan opportunity to vote in free and fair elections for their own \nleaders? Would that have all been in vain?\n\n  What would come of America's word and our commitment, when we ask \nbrave Iraqis to step forward and to volunteer to serve in the police or \nin the army or to try to go about their life as much as possible by \nparticipating in free and fair elections, if we were to leave \nprematurely before they were able to provide for their own security, \nbefore they would be able to continue on the glidepath to self-\ndetermination and a better life?\n  Does anybody have any doubt that the criminals, that the jihadists, \nthat the sectarian violence would lay claim to those individuals, those \nbrave individuals who have allied themselves with America in an attempt \nto provide a peaceful and democratic Iraq?\n  What would it mean if we left immediately? Well, I think it would \nmean that, like Afghanistan--which was the launching pad for al-Qaida, \nwith a friendly government such as the Taliban--we would have another \nfailed state where terrorists could plan, finance, train, and then \nexport their terrorist attacks to places such as the United States.\n  Yes, I believe this is the test of our generation, just like my \nparents' generation, the ``Greatest Generation,'' met their test in \nWorld War II. And for the sake of the next generation, and generations \nbeyond, I pray we pass that test.\n  Some have said, and our colleagues earlier today said: What do we \nwant? We need to change. But they ask for change without any plan, \nwithout articulating what they would do differently, other than to \ncriticize the hard effort being undertaken by our men and women in \nuniform to bring about a peaceful and secure Iraq.\n  They say we need a new direction, but they are unwilling to identify \nwhat direction we ought to go. They claim the President has politicized \nthe war on terror. Well, I beg to differ. I believe this President has \ndone what he believes is his duty by identifying the threat and \nconfronting the threat and trying to make America a safer place. That \nis not politicizing the war on terror. That is telling the American \npeople what the facts are.\n  Some have suggested we ought to sit down with the terrorists and talk \nto them. Well, I think we have seen what kind of threat this ideology \nbreeds and why that is not an idea likely to be successful.\n  Some have gone so far as to say what has happened in Iraq has not \nmade us safer. But as I went down the various places where terrorists \nhave hit since September 11 all around the world, is there any doubt, \nbut for the efforts we have undertaken in this country, both here and \nabroad, and taking the fight on the offensive, that we would not be \ncelebrating the fifth anniversary of September 11 without another \nterrorist attack but, rather, we would be looking backward and saying, \nif we had only taken the threat more seriously, maybe we would have \navoided that terrorist attack which would have occurred but for those \nacts?\n  Some have said there have been a lot of mistakes in Iraq. Well, \nperhaps that is true. I am not sure of any war plan that survives the \nfirst shot. I know we are fighting an intelligent and adaptive and \nresourceful enemy who manipulates the media, who has learned how to use \nthe Internet to communicate, and who has attempted to attack our \ncountry and other countries time and time again.\n  I hope over this next month, before we recess for the November \nelection season, we are successful in identifying the nature of the \nthreat that confronts\n\n[[Page S8920]]\n\nour country, indeed, the free world, and we describe with clarity the \nconsequences of our failing to deal with it and that we demand that \nthose who are critical of what we are doing in fighting the global war \non terror explain to us precisely: What would you do differently and \nhow do you believe that would make us safer.\n  That is the debate I believe we owe the American people. That is the \ndebate I believe we owe the next generations that come after us. And \nthat is the debate we owe those who have worked so hard over the last \n200 years to make America the place it is today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after the Senate's unfortunate debate about \nthe tragic case of the late Terri Schiavo, I thought the Senate was \nunlikely to debate this matter any time soon. Unfortunately, it seems \nthere may be another discussion of this matter. In spite of the fact \nthat the American people made it very clear that the Government ought \nto stay out of these tragic end-of-life matters, new legislation, S. \n3788, has been introduced which would, in effect, throw Oregon's Death \nwith Dignity Act into the trash can.\n  As a result of the introduction of this legislation and my concern \nthat the last thing we need is more Government stepping into these very \ndifficult end-of-life decisions, I am announcing this afternoon that I \nam placing a hold on S. 3788 which would overturn Oregon's unique Death \nwith Dignity Act and would, in my view, do great damage to the cause of \npain management all across our country.\n  In the past, the Senate has looked at this only in the context of \nwhat some describe as assisted suicide. Obviously, there are \ndifferences of opinion on this issue. The people in my State have been \ndebating this for well over a decade and twice have made it clear that \nthey believe these decisions ought to be left to the individual and to \nfamilies trying to cope with these difficult circumstances. They have \nsent a strong message that death is an intensely personal and private \nmatter and that the Government ought to leave our citizens alone. The \nGovernment ought not attempt to override or preempt the individual and \nfamily values, religious beliefs, and wishes.\n  What has been debated in Oregon is not all that different from what \nwas faced in the Senate when there was a discussion about the case of \nthe late Terri Schiavo. I objected on the floor at that time to \nconsideration of the original Schiavo legislation, which was an \nextraordinary overreach of Federal power, and today I put a hold on S. \n3788 which would overturn my State's law.\n  These are very difficult issues, and many of us are torn with respect \nto how to handle them. I, for example, opposed physician aid in dying \nboth as an Oregon voter and as a Senator. When my State originally \nconsidered the Death with Dignity Act, I worried a great deal about the \nadequacy of the ballot measure safeguards to protect particularly the \npoor and the vulnerable. Now we have 8 years of experience with this \nlegislation and, thankfully, my fears with respect to how the \nvulnerable would fare under this legislation have not been realized, \nand the realities are that the safeguards in the law have worked quite \nwell in preventing potential abuses.\n  Had Oregon acted hastily or without thorough examination and debate, \nI might not be in a position to defend my State's law. But no one can \naccuse my State of acting precipitously in approving this matter. We \nhave endured several ballot initiatives, court challenges, and, most \nrecently, a challenge that was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. Each \ntime, the will of a majority of Oregonians prevailed. It is that will \nof my State's voters which S. 3788 would overturn.\n  During the 8 years the law has been in effect in my home State of \nOregon, the opponents of the law have combed through the statute \nlooking for potential pitfalls. The law still stands because the notion \nof opponents that there would be abuses and a stampede to Oregon have \nnot been borne out. In fact, and this obviously could not ever be \nproved, my sense is that there are probably fewer assisted suicides in \nmy home State, the only State with a statute, than there are in other \nparts of the country. That is because the real effect of Oregon's Death \nwith Dignity Act has been to generate a significant increase in the use \nof hospice and to generate a significant increase in the number of \npeople who spend their last days at home with family dealing with these \nissues on their own. So we have not seen this tidal wave of assisted \nsuicides in my home State, but what we have seen as a result of all of \nthe focus on end-of-life care is a significant increase in folks \nspending their last days through the compassionate services of hospice \nprograms and help with their families at home.\n  The reality is there is no constitutional issue at stake in this \ndiscussion with respect to State rights. Historically, defining medical \npractice has been a matter left to the States. What is so ironic is \nthat some who come to the floor of the Senate to talk about State \nrights are essentially saying they only believe in State rights if they \nthink the State is right.\n  This is a matter which Oregonians have decided for themselves. It has \nhistorically been an issue which has been left to the States.\n  In my home State, there was a vigorous discussion around dinner \ntables and at the ballot box, and our State has spoken clearly with \nrespect to where we stand on this difficult issue. I do not believe \nthat a Senator from another State should seek to overturn another \nState's law based on his personal beliefs.\n  We are just a couple of months from Election Day in which local, \nState, and Federal elections will be held. Many States will have \nnumerous ballot measures covering every issue imaginable. Voters need \nto know they can debate even the most emotionally wrenching issues \nthrough the ballot process and have their election results respected. \nThe proposed legislation I have put a hold on, S. 3788, sends voters \nthe message that if Congress doesn't like the conclusion your State \ncomes to through a ballot measure, your vote really doesn't matter. I \nintend to make sure that the votes of the people of my State, on a \nmatter that has historically been left to them, will count.\n  You can be opposed to physician aid in dying and be opposed to this \nlegislation as well. The reason I conclude that, is because I believe \nthis proposal will be a huge setback to the cause of pain management in \nevery corner of the country, not just in my home State. Like efforts \nbefore it, S. 3788 seeks to undermine my State's law by amending the \nControlled Substances Act in order to say that drugs which fall under \nthe Controlled Substances Act cannot be used in physician aid in dying. \nThe Controlled Substances Act, of course, is legislation Congress \npassed to go after drug kingpins and to make sure that those with \naccess to drugs, including doctors and pharmacists and others, do not \ndistribute them illegally. The penalties in the Controlled Substances \nAct are substantial. However, the bottom line is the Controlled \nSubstances Act was not meant to throw the will of the people of my \nState or any other in the trash can with respect to a medical practice \ninvolving end-of-life care.\n  Like past efforts, the legislation I have put a hold on purports to \ncreate a safe harbor to protect physicians and others. Sadly, such a \nsafe harbor is meaningless because of the realities patients, families, \ndoctors, pharmacies, and others face when they are trying \ncompassionately to assist a dying patient in that patient's last days. \nMedicine and the use of controlled substances, particularly in the case \nof the dying, is an art, not an exact science. It is not as if you can \nprove scientifically and medically that a dose of a drug in so many \nmilligrams can always relieve pain and half a milligram more is going \nto result in death. People are different. Each of these medical \ntragedies is different. The dying often can\n\n[[Page S8921]]\n\nwithstand doses of controlled substances that would kill a healthy \nperson.\n  There are many examples that make it clear that interpretations after \nthe fact by law enforcement give physicians great concern with respect \nto how these drugs are used. Second-guessing will deter physicians, \neven physicians who are opposed to assisted suicide, from moving into \ntreating pain aggressively.\n  During the previous congressional effort to throw out my State's law, \nthe New England Journal of Medicine editorialized against that attempt \nout of the very same concern I have reflected today about the impact on \npain management. The New England Journal of Medicine said:\n\n       Many doctors are concerned about the scrutiny they invite \n     when they prescribe or administer controlled substances and \n     they are hypersensitive to drug-seeking behavior in patients. \n     Patients as well as doctors often have exaggerated fears of \n     addiction and the side effects of narcotics. Congress would \n     make this bad situation worse.\n\n  That is what independent medical authorities said the last time there \nwas an effort to pass legislation like the new bill, S. 3788, and it \nholds true as well today.\n  I have appreciated Senator Smith's leadership, my colleague from \nOregon on the other side of the aisle, who joins me with respect to the \nconcern about pain management. He and I have introduced the Conquering \nPain Act to help provide families, patients, and health professionals \nwith assistance so that no patient would be left in excruciating pain \nwaiting for a doctor's office to open up.\n  The reality is, as we saw during the debate involving the late Terri \nSchiavo, Americans have dramatically differing views on this issue, and \nthose views are passionately held. But there can be efforts, successful \nefforts, to bring both sides together on this issue. I mentioned the \nConquering Pain Act Senator Smith and I have sponsored. I also believe \nthere should be changes in the Medicare hospice benefit to extend \nopportunities for end-of-life care there. Right now, the Medicare law \nalmost forces someone to give up hope for the prospect of recovery in \norder to get the hospice benefit, and I believe that is unfortunate.\n  I am almost finished with my remarks. I see my good friend from the \nState of Kentucky here. I would ask unanimous consent at this time--and \nsee what is convenient for my colleague from Kentucky--for 5 additional \nminutes to wrap up my remarks, and if that is convenient with the \nSenator from Kentucky, I would make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, again, just to complete that thought, there \nare ways that both sides in this end-of-life care debate can be brought \ntogether. I have mentioned several. What I think is clear, after the \nTerri Schiavo discussion, is that the American people don't want the \nFederal Government butting in, interfering, and preempting the ability \nof families and those in their last days to make these judgments. For \nthe citizens of my State, the Death With Dignity Act has brought about \nimprovement in many areas and encouraged conversations about a wide \nvariety of end-of-life options. Those conversations probably wouldn't \nhave even taken place if the people of my State hadn't voted for this \ntwice. In my State, the end-of-life process has been decriminalized. \nRecognizing the deeply personal nature of this, the Federal Government \nshould not decide again, as has been considered before, that this \nshould be the province of the Federal Government and not left to \nindividuals and families.\n  My State has chosen a unique path. Rather than the bitter and \ndivisive debate over physician aid in dying--which this country would \nhave, once again, if S. 3788 moved forward--I would offer that instead \nthe Senate work together on a bipartisan basis to make the end of life \na better period for all Americans.\n  So consistent with the policy I have held of publishing in the \nCongressional Record a statement whenever I put a hold on a piece of \nlegislation, I am announcing today my intent to object to any unanimous \nconsent agreement concerning S. 3788. The Senate should have learned \nduring the debate over the tragic case of Terri Schiavo that the \nAmerican people don't want the Government interfering during these very \ndifficult days. S. 3788 would allow just this kind of interference, and \nthat is why I will do everything I can to defend Oregon's law against \nthis congressional overreaching and respect the message the American \npeople sent during the Terri Schiavo debate that there ought to be a \nright to be left alone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8921-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8921-S8922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE CRASH OF COMAIR FLIGHT 5191\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL: Mr. President, it is difficult to put into words what \nthe citizens of Kentucky are feeling. Nine days ago, tragedy struck the \nheart of our Commonwealth when Comair Flight 5191 crashed shortly after \ntakeoff at Blue Grass Airport, in Lexington, KY. Forty-nine people \nperished.\n  This single, devastating event is of course not one story but many. \nThis crash has brought grief into scores of families and countless \nlives, all over Kentucky and beyond. Holes that cannot be filled have \nbeen created in places like Lexington, Georgetown, Somerset, London, \nHarrodsburg, and Richmond.\n  Funeral services have been conducted across Kentucky over recent \ndays, and I know I am joined by all Kentuckians in extending heartfelt \nsympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims.\n  After a catastrophe as great as the crash of Comair Flight 5191, \nsorrow can be overwhelming. Many people in my state are feeling that \nway now. And the entire state is struggling for answers in the face of \nsuch an unexpected tragedy that is so unbearable.\n  Since the crash I have been learning, as many Kentuckians have, about \nthe lives of the victims, who they were and where they were going that \nday.\n  Four Kentuckians on the plane worked for Galls, a Lexington-based \ncompany that makes public safety equipment and apparel. Three of them \nwere flying to New Orleans to help deliver new uniforms to New Orleans \npolice officers after Hurricane Katrina.\n  Jonathan Hooker, 27, and Scarlett Parsley Hooker, 24, spent only \nhours together as husband and wife before they both boarded Flight 5191 \nto fly to California for their honeymoon. The Reverend Terry Gabbard \nmarried them the night before the flight in a beautiful evening \nceremony in Lexington. One week later, he would speak at their funeral.\n  The deaths of these two newlyweds so soon after starting their lives \ntogether devastated many in their hometown of London, Kentucky. Jon had \na lot of friends after attending London's North Laurel High School, \nwhere he was a star athlete.\n  He went on to pitch for the University of Kentucky baseball team from \n1997 to 2001, and then to work as a professional minor-league baseball \nplayer. In the last few months of his life, he helped others as a \nsubstance-abuse counselor. He liked to play golf, and worked with a \nyouth baseball league in London.\n  Scarlett, his wife, was a 2004 graduate of Centre College, in \nDanville, Kentucky, and was attending the University of Kentucky to \npursue a master's degree in communication disorders. An avid swimmer, \namong the many friends she leaves behind are the members of a local \nLondon swim team she helped found: the Barracudas.\n  My friend Lee Todd, the president of the University of Kentucky, put \nit well when he said that this young couple ``held all the promise that \nyouth and love carry.'' Because of the tragedy of Flight 5191, we will \nnever get to see that promise fulfilled.\n  A promise was also snuffed out in Lexington at the same time--the \npromise of a father to a young son to watch him grow up. Clarence Wayne \nFortney II, called C.W. by his friends and 34 years old, died in Flight \n5191, leaving behind his wife Sarah and their 16-month-old son Calvin \nJames.\n  C.W. was flying to Atlanta to report for work as a pilot for AirTran \nAirlines.\n  C.W. grew up in Stanton, Kentucky, and always wanted to be a pilot. \nBoth his father and his grandfather were private pilots. When he was 5, \nhis mother\n\n[[Page S8922]]\n\npaid $35 for his first ride in a prop jet plane. C.W. realized his \ndream after graduating from Eastern Kentucky University with an \naviation degree.\n  A kind man, during his and Sarah's courtship, C.W. helped care for \nher father with terminal cancer. As a pilot, he received commendations \nfrom Federal Aviation Administration officials who flew on his plane. A \nfew days before the crash, he and Sarah celebrated their 8-year wedding \nanniversary.\n  This past Sunday, at C.W.'s funeral, 300 mourners pinned on pairs of \npilot's wings. Mourners also got to see Mr. Lamb, a tiny stuffed lamb \nthat C.W. bought for his wife on a whim about 3-years ago at an airport \ngift shop. Now, their toddler son Calvin James takes Mr. Lamb \neverywhere.\n  Sarah has said that as she raises Calvin James, she will be sure to \nteach him the words his father took as his motto: ``In dreams and in \nlove, there are no impossibilities.'' We hope it is not impossible that \none day, Calvin James will soar as high as his father did.\n  Last week's crash also robbed the world of Patrick Smith, 58, of \nLexington. Pat's ultimate destination that morning was Gulfport, MS. \nThat was only a short distance for him. Because of his volunteer work \nwith Habitat for Humanity, Pat had traveled to Ghana, Sri Lanka, \nNorthern Ireland, South Africa, Mexico, and India to build houses for \nthose less fortunate than he.\n  Pat was a member of Habitat for Humanity International's Board of \nDirectors, as well as the board of his local Lexington chapter, and had \nserved with the organization for more than 15 years. He excelled at \norganizing fellow volunteers from Kentucky and leading them in their \nhumanitarian efforts.\n  Under his direction, 80 Kentucky volunteers constructed 26 houses in \nsmall fishing villages in southern India for people who had lost \neverything in the tsunami of 2004.\n  He also helped those closer to home. Pat's final trip to Gulfport was \nto follow up on the work he had already done in 7 trips to Mississippi \nbefore, for a project to build 13 houses on South Carolina Avenue to \nreplace the ones that were washed away by Hurricane Katrina.\n  Pat's wife Jean often accompanied him on his projects, although last \nSunday on Flight 5191 Pat traveled alone. Pat had done so much good \nwork for the organization that he was named Habitat's volunteer of the \nyear in 2003.\n  Several of Pat's volunteer projects were sponsored by his church, \nCathedral of Christ the King. He worked as a partner at a Lexington \nindustrial automation company, Versa Tech Automation.\n  Pat once stated very simply the reason he had dedicated so much of \nhis time and efforts to volunteer work: ``We have an obligation to \nhelp.'' Now his wife, Jean, and their children and grandchildren will \nrely on the help of others as grief sets in.\n  I am glad that newspapers all across Kentucky have printed details \nlike these about the victims of the terrible crash of Comair Flight \n5191. This way we can know not just how these people died, but also how \nthey lived.\n  I am also grateful that even in such dark times, the generosity and \nkindness of Kentucky continues to shine through. Local volunteers have \nbeen invaluable to the relief and recovery effort, and to the families \nthat have been left behind to grieve.\n  Volunteers from local chapters of the Salvation Army served as \nchaplains and grief counselors. They also served more than 1,000 meals \nand over 6,000 snacks and drinks to relief workers at the crash site.\n  The Bluegrass Chapter of the American Red Cross fielded dozens of \nvolunteers, who helped arrange memorial services for the victims' \nfamilies. They also worked as grief counselors and provided meals.

What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Defense appropriations bill is pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I ask what the Senator from Virginia intended to do?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I wanted to call up amendment No. 4883. I \nwas waiting for our chairman to be here, and ask I be recognized to \noffer this amendment. It will take approximately 5 or 6 minutes to \noffer the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I might say to my friend from Virginia, when we left \nthis bill, the understanding was Senator Kennedy's amendment would come \nfirst. We will be happy to have the Senator offer his amendment with \nthe understanding it will come up after the amendment of Senator \nKennedy, if that will be agreeable to Senator Kennedy?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is Senator Kennedy's amendment the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment pending.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have it ready to send to the desk.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor to have the Senator propose his \namendment and then Senator Allen propose his amendment and we will come \nback to his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4885\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and our Democratic leader, Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself \n     and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 4885.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To include information on civil war in Iraq in the quarterly \n  reports on progress toward military and political stability in Iraq)\n\n       On page 235, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (E) A determination by the Secretary of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State, as to whether there \n     is a civil war in Iraq.\n       (F) A description of the criteria underlying the \n     determination in subparagraph (E) of the Secretary of \n     Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, as to \n     whether there is a civil war in Iraq, including--\n       (i) an assessment of levels of sectarian violence and an \n     estimate of civilian casualties as a result of sectarian \n     violence;\n       (ii) the numbers of civilians displaced;\n       (iii) the degree to which government security forces \n     (including the army, police, and special forces) exercise \n     effective control over major urban areas;\n       (iv) the extent to which militias are providing security;\n       (v) the extent to which militias have organized or \n     conducted hostile actions against the United States Armed \n     Forces and Iraqi security forces;\n       (vi) the extent to which the Government of Iraq has \n     developed and is implementing a credible plan to disarm, \n     demobilize, and reintegrate militias into government security \n     forces; and\n       (vii) the extent to which the Government of Iraq has \n     obtained a credible commitment from the political parties to \n     disarm and disband the militias.\n       (G) If the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, determines pursuant to subparagraph (E) \n     that there is not a civil war in Iraq, the following \n     information (in unclassified format):\n       (i) A description of the efforts by the United States \n     Government to help avoid civil war in Iraq.\n       (ii) The strategy of the United States Government to \n     protect the United States Armed Forces in the event of civil \n     war in Iraq.\n       (iii) The strategy of the United States Government to \n     ensure that the United States Armed Forces will not take \n     sides in the event of civil war in Iraq.\n       (iv) The progress being made by the Government of Iraq in \n     disarming or demobilizing militias or reintegrating militias \n     into government security forces.\n       (H) If the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, determines pursuant to subparagraph (E) \n     that there is a civil war in Iraq, the following information \n     (in unclassified format):\n       (i) A statement of the mission and duration of United \n     States Armed Forces in Iraq.\n       (ii) The strategy of the United States Government to \n     protect the United States Armed Forces while they remain in \n     Iraq.\n       (iii) The strategy of the United States Government to \n     ensure that the United States Armed Forces will not take \n     sides in the civil war.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as suggested by the Senator from Alaska, \nI am glad to yield without losing my rights. I yield to the Senator \nfrom Virginia so he may offer his amendment. As I understand it, there \nis an agreement to dispose of it.\n  Is it the understanding of the Senator from Virginia that they are \ngoing to accept the amendment of the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, I hope that \nSenator Stevens and the committee will accept my amendment. I would not \nwant to speak for them. But I surely so urge them. I think our body \nwould support it. It is a very good amendment to help out in the \nfunding for our soldiers, the men and women who come back with head \ninjuries.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have no objection, obviously, to--\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield without losing his right to \nthe floor?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is our intention to suggest to the Senator from \nHawaii, when he arrives, that we accept this amendment of the Senator \nfrom Virginia, but we don't accept amendments without bipartisan \napproval so I would appreciate it if the Senator will discuss his \namendment after Senator Kennedy has discussed his and we will await an \nopportunity to discuss it with the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have not had a chance to see the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia that deals with head injuries. \nThere is also an amendment, I believe, from the Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin, on this subject as well. It is a matter of enormous \nimportance and consequence. Hopefully, our committees will take action \nto deal with it at an appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, next week marks the fifth anniversary of the vicious \nattack on America by al-Qaida terrorists.\n  Despite the passage of time, Americans still vividly recall with \nenormous pain and sorrow that dark and somber day. We recall the nearly \n3,000 Americans who were killed by al-Qaida terrorists. We recall the \nbrave firefighters and first responders who sacrificed their lives so \nthat others could live. We recall the twin towers crumbling before our \neyes, and the Pentagon ablaze beneath a plume of smoke. And we recall \nthe pledge by the administration and all Americans that this type of \nattack will never, ever occur again.\n  As we approach this anniversary, there is little doubt that the \nPresident will, once again, resort to the politics of fear in an effort \nto convince the American people that the Iraq war is central to the \nGlobal War on Terror.\n  Nothing is further from the truth. Scare tactics may have worked in \nthe elections of 2002 and 2004, but this time, the American people know \nbetter.\n  The American people know that the war in Iraq was a distraction from \nthe real Global War on Terror and that Iraq had nothing to do with al-\nQaida.\n  The American people know that America should have kept its eye on the \nball and captured Osama bin Laden--rather than rushing headlong into a \nwar that we did not need to fight.\n  The American people know that the administration should have \nimplemented fully the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission to protect \nour ports and support our first responders--rather than spending more \nthan $200 million each day on a failed policy in Iraq.\n  The American people know that the war in Iraq has made Americans more \nhated in the world, created more terrorists, and made it harder to win \nthe real Global War on Terror.\n  The American people know that while we have been bogged down in Iraq, \nNorth Korea's nuclear stockpile has quadrupled and Iran has continued \nits pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  The American people know that we never should have gone to war in \nIraq when we did, and for the false reasons we were given.\n  Most importantly, the American people know that the President's \nstubborn insistence that we ``stay the course'' does not make victory \nany more likely and that we need to change our policy in Iraq.\n  At almost every stage of the Bush administration's conduct of the war \nin Iraq, we have seen major miscalculations and serious mistakes that \nplace our troops at greater risk and jeopardize America's standing in \nthe world.\n  Military leaders and retired generals know it. Middle East experts \nknow it. Our allies know it. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress \nknow it. And most important, the American people know it.\n  They saw it when the Bush team disbanded the Iraqi Army after the \nfall of Saddam but allowed thousands to walk away with their weapons.\n  They saw it when the Bush administration waited a full year to begin \ntraining the new Iraqi security forces.\n  They saw it when the White House failed to see the insurgency \nspreading like a cancer through Iraq.\n  They saw it when the Bush team failed to see the danger of roadside \nbombs and improvised explosive devices yet sent our troops on patrol \nday after day, month after month, year after year.\n  They saw it when the White House failed to provide proper armor for \nour troops, until Congress finally demanded it.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's repeated failure to see each new \nthreat in Iraq has put our troops and our security in greater peril.\n  Today, once again, the administration refuses to recognize another \nseismic shift in Iraq--the dangerous prospect that we are drawn into a \ndeadly and divisive civil war.\n  While the President and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld are on the \ncampaign trail claiming progress in Iraq, military leaders and experts \nare urging the White House to heed the disturbing warning signs in \nIraq.\n\n[[Page S8924]]\n\n  The President and his cabinet may not believe the fears of civil war \nare justified, but some of our military leaders do. General Rick \nSanchez, former commander of the multi-national forces in Iraq, said as \nlong ago as January 7, ``The country's on the verge of a civil war.'' \nGeneral Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on \nMarch 13 that, ``Everything is in place if they want to have a civil \nwar.''\n  Our Ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, is concerned about the \nthreat as well. On March 7, he said, ``The potential is there'' for \nsectarian violence to become civil war. ``We have opened the Pandora's \nbox and the question is, what is the way forward?''\n  General Abizaid acknowledged the clear danger when he told the Senate \nArmed Services Committee on August 3, ``I believe that the sectarian \nviolence is probably as bad as I've seen it, in Baghdad in particular, \nand that if not stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move towards \ncivil war.''\n  General Pace, at the same hearing, agreed about the threat of civil \nwar. He said, ``I believe that we do have the possibility of devolving \nto a civil war, but that does not have to be a fact.''\n  Others think that a civil war may have already begun. Former Iraqi \nPrime Minister Allawi said in March that Iraq is probably in ``an early \nstage of civil war.''\n  The British Ambassador to Iraq wrote in August, ``The prospect of a \nlow intensity civil war and a de facto division of Iraq is probably \nmore likely at this stage than a successful and substantial transition \nto a stable democracy.\n  Our colleague from Nebraska, Senator Chuck Hagel, concurred, saying, \nin August that ``We, in fact, are in probably a low grade, maybe a very \ndefined, civil war.''\n  General William Nash, who commanded our troops in Bosnia after that \ncountry's civil war ended, stated on March 5, ``We're in a civil war \nnow; it's just that not everybody's joined in.'' He said, ``The failure \nto understand that the civil war is already taking place, just not \nnecessarily at the maximum level, means that our counter measures are \ninadequate and therefore dangerous to our long-term interest.''\n  These leaders see what's really happening in Iraq--not just the White \nHouse spin.\n  They know that the polarization of communities along sectarian lines \nis increasing. In fact, 80 percent of the Iraqi people voted along \nsectarian lines in the recent elections.\n  Civilian casualties as a result of sectarian violence have \nskyrocketed. According to the United Nations, 5,800 civilians were \nkilled during May and June of this year and another 5,800 were wounded. \nAn estimated 100 people a day were killed in Baghdad in July. Militia \nattacks continue unabated. The Shiite militia forces are growing in \nstrength. The widespread infiltration of government security forces by \nthose whose principal loyalty is to their sectarian militias, not the \ngovernment, is well documented. Interior ministry detention centers \nhave been used to torture inmates just because they are Sunnis. Too \noften we hear that men wearing Interior ministry uniforms have abducted \nSunni men and boys, who later turn up dead.\n  The numbers of civilians displaced or fleeing the violence is \nincreasing as Shiites are forced from Sunni areas and Sunnis from \nShiite areas. According to the United Nations, approximately 150,000 \nIraqis had been displaced as of June.\n  Despite these trends and the warnings of the experts, President Bush \nstubbornly continues to deny that civil war is even a real possibility \nin Iraq.\n  Last December, he said, ``I know some fear the possibility that Iraq \ncould break apart and fall into a civil war. I don't believe these \nfears are justified.''\n  The President reiterated the same view on February 28 when he said, \n``I don't buy your premise that there's going to be a civil war.''\n  Again in March, President Bush dismissed the notion, saying, ``They \nknow that they lack the military strength to challenge Iraqi and \ncoalition forces directly--so their only hope is to try and provoke a \ncivil war . . . By their response over the past two weeks, Iraqis have \nshown the world they want a future of freedom and peace--and they will \noppose a violent minority that seeks to take that future away from them \nby tearing their country apart.''\n  In August, President Bush still denied that there was a civil war. He \nsaid, ``You know, I hear people say, well, civil war this, civil war \nthat The Iraqi people decided against civil war when they went to the \nballot box.'' Again, on August 21, he said, ``You know, I hear a lot of \ntalk about civil war. I'm concerned about that, of course. And I've \ntalked to a lot of people about it. And what I've found from my talks \nare that the Iraqis want a unified country and that the Iraqi \nleadership is determined to thwart the efforts of the extremists and \nthe radicals and al Qaida and that the security forces remain united \nbehind the government.''\n  For a third time, on August 31, the President denied the possibility \nof civil war. He said, ``This cruelty and carnage has led some to \nquestion whether Iraq has descended into civil war. Our commanders and \nour diplomats on the ground in Iraq believe that's not the case. They \nreport that only a small number of Iraqis are engaged in sectarian \nviolence, while the overwhelming majority want peace and a normal life \nin a unified country.''\n  I just wish the President would take a little time to read this \nreport that was put out by the Department of Defense, on Stability and \nSecurity in Iraq.\n  I come back to that in a few moments.\n  Vice President Cheney, too, has long denied the possibility of civil \nwar. On March 19, he stated, ``What we've seen is a serious effort by \nthem to foment civil war, but I don't think they've been successful.''\n  Secretary Rumsfeld dismisses it as well. In March he said, ``I do not \nbelieve they are in a civil war.''\n  That same month, Secretary Rumsfeld said, ``The terrorists are \ndetermined to stoke sectarian tension and are attempting to spark a \ncivil war. But despite the many acts of violence and provocation, the \nvast majority of Iraqis have shown that they want their country to \nremain whole and free of ethnic conflict.''\n  In April, he said, ``I don't think a full-fledged civil war will take \nhold of the country.''\n  In May, in an eerie echo of the past, when asked what political and \nmilitary contingences would be in place if a civil war occurred, \nSecretary Rumsfeld responded, ``I don't think the scenario that you \nhave described is going to happen, but life's filled with things you \ndon't think are going to happen.''\n  That's vintage Rumsfeld. ``Stuff happens,'' he said, in response to \nthe chaos that erupted in Baghdad after the first days of the invasion, \nas though no one could have anticipated such a possibility and it made \nno sense to waste time planning for such possibilities. That attitude \nhas plagued our forces and our country throughout this misguided war, \nand it must stop.\n  This, July, as the situation took another turn for the worse, he \nsaid, ``There certainly has been an upsurge in sectarian violence; \nthere's no question but that they're trying to incite a civil war. And \nthey have been for a long time, and they have failed so far.''\n  Secretary Rice also refuses to see the possibility of civil war in \nIraq. In February, she said, ``I don't think there is a brewing civil \nwar in Iraq.'' Despite the escalating casualties and increasing \nsectarian violence, on August 4 she said, ``I don't think Iraq is going \nto slide into civil war.'' Two days later she repeated the claim and \nsaid, ``But the important point here is that Iraqis haven't made a \nchoice for civil war. Iraqis have made a choice for a unified \ngovernment that can deliver for all Iraqis. And when I say Iraqis, I \nmean not just their leadership, which clearly has not made a choice for \ncivil war, but their population.''\n  On the same day she again denied the possibility of civil war, \nstating, ``It would be really erroneous to say that the Iraqis are \nsomehow making a choice for civil war, or I think even sliding into \ncivil war.''\n  That's what the Bush team is claiming. They are so focused on the \nspin war on the campaign trail that they fail to see the real war in \nIraq. They are so focused on using the war to win elections here at \nhome that they fail to see the real needs of our troops in Iraq.\n  But this time, the American people aren't buying it. They've heard it \nall\n\n[[Page S8925]]\n\nbefore and are demanding honest assessments and realistic strategies. \nThey know that the President and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld can \nsay it's not a civil war, but that doesn't make it so. They know that \nour brave men and women in uniform are doing everything they can to \nbring peace and stability in Iraq. They continue to fight insurgents \nand terrorists, but are at grave risk of being trapped in the middle of \nan unwinnable civil war.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment today with the Democratic \nleader. It requires the administration through the Secretary of Defense \nand the Secretary of State to provide an honest and candid assessment \nof the extent to which Iraq is now in a state of civil war. And even \nmore important, the amendment requires them to say what we are going to \ndo about it. How are we going to advance America's interests in Iraq in \na time of civil war? How are we going to protect our troops from \ngetting drawn ever deeper into an endless sectarian conflict?\n  An article in Newsweek magazine on August 14 indicates that although \nthe Bush administration insists that Iraq is a long way from civil war, \nsome inside the White House and the Pentagon have begun some \ncontingency planning.\n  The administration should level with the American people about the \nreal conditions and their planning.\n  And that's the purpose of our amendment today.\n  The amendment requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of State, to determine every 3 months whether a civil war \nis taking place and to inform Congress of the plan for our troops in \nthe event of such a war.\n  For each determination, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of \nState will provide their assessment of the levels of sectarian violence \nsuch as the level of polarization of communities along sectarian lines \nand an estimate of civilian casualties as a result of the violence; the \nnumber of civilians displaced by the violence; the degree to which \nIraqi government forces exercise effective control over major urban \nareas; the extent to which militias have been mobilized, are providing \nsecurity, and attacking other Iraqis; and the extent to which the \nGovernment of Iraq has obtained a credible commitment from the \npolitical parties to disarm and disband the militias and are \nimplementing a credible plan to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate \nmilitias into government security forces.\n  If the administration determines that Iraq is not in a civil war, the \namendment requires a description of the efforts by our government to \navoid civil war in Iraq, a plan to protect our troops in the event of a \ncivil war, and a strategy to ensure that our troops don't take sides.\n  If the determination is that Iraq is in a civil war, the amendment \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to explain the mission of our troops \nand its duration, his plan to protect our troops, and a strategy to \nensure that they don't take sides in a civil war.\n  The amendment is needed to ensure proper planning in the event of \ncivil war.\n  The trends in Iraq are discouraging and certainly point toward civil \nwar.\n  Indeed, the September 1 report prepared by the Department of Defense \non Stability and Security in Iraq reaffirms what the American people \nalready understand: the conditions of civil war exist, violence in Iraq \nis spiraling out of control and staying the course is not a viable \noption.\n  The Department of Defense report says that concern about civil war \nwithin the Iraqi civilian population and among some defense analysts \nhas increased in recent months. Conditions that could lead to civil war \nexist in Iraq;\n  Rising sectarian strife defines the emerging nature of violence in \nmid-2006;\n  Sustained ethnic and sectarian violence is the greatest threat to \nsecurity and stability in Iraq;\n  Sectarian tensions increased over the last three months, demonstrated \nby the increasing number of executions, kidnappings, attacks on \ncivilians, and internally displaced persons;\n  Civilian casualties increased by approximately 1000 per month since \nthe previous quarter. Assassinations in particular reached new highs in \nthe month of July. The Baghdad Coroner's Office reported 1600 bodies \narrived in June and more than 1800 bodies in July, 90 percent of which \nwere assessed to be the result of executions;\n  Sectarian violence is gradually spreading north into Diyala Province \nand Kirkuk as Sunni, Shiite, and Kurdish groups compete for provincial \ninfluencey;\n  Both Shia and Sunni death squads are active in Iraq, and are \nresponsible for the most significant increases in sectarian violence;\n  Militias and small, illegally armed groups operate openly and often \nwith popular support. The threat posed by Shiite illegal armed groups, \nfilling perceived and actual security vacuums, is growing;\n  The security situation is currently at its most complex state since \nthe initiation of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Overall attack levels are \nhigher than the last three months. The average number of weekly attacks \nincreased 15 percent and Iraqi casualties increased by 51 percent \ncompared.\n  These facts are at odds with the administration's statements about \ncivil war. Sectarian divisions are increasing. Mlilitia violence and \ndeath squad activity are increasing. The number of Iraqis fleeing the \nviolence is increasing. Yet, the President continues to deny the \npossibility of civil war. The Vice President, Secretary of Defense and \nSecretary of State continue to deny it. As long as the administration \ncontinues to deny the plain truth, America will be behind the curve and \nunable to adjust to the current realities on the ground and protect our \ntroops.\n  Instead of attacking those who want to change our course, President \nBush ought to deal with the hard cold facts. This Defense Department \nreport underscores the fundamental truth that our brave troops are \nbeing let down by an administration more interested in political spin \nthan in finding a way to succeed.\n  The administration needs to look at all the facts and honestly \naddress the question of civil war for the sake of our military and the \nAmerican people.\n  This legislation creates a continuing obligation to ensure that \nanalysis on civil war is done regularly. Unfortunately, this is \nnecessary, because the Congress has forced the administration to step \nup to the plate on Iraq time and again.\n  The facts in the report say one thing about civil war, but the \nconclusion about civil war says another. We need an honest assessment \nfrom the Secretaries of Defense and State about the conditions on the \nground, and that is what the Kennedy-Reid amendment would require. We \nalso need some hard thinking within the administration and a clear plan \nto protect our troops in a civil war.\n  At every step of the way, this administration has missed the threat \nto our troops, and Democrats in Congress have had to force the issue.\n  The Democrats in Congress have had to force the issue:\n  We had to require accounting of progress being made to train Iraqi \ntroops so our soldiers can begin to come home.\n  We provided over $1 billion in additional funding for vehicle armor \nto upgrade the armor on Humvees.\n  We are demanding an updated National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq \nbecause the administration has failed to provide one in more than 2 \nyears.\n  We provided more than $175 million for democracy programs in Iraq \nwhen the Bush administration's budget did not provide it.\n  We need an honest accounting of the situation so we can adjust \naccordingly and protect our troops. And we need a plan to protect our \ntroops. The President's stubborn insistence on staying the course \nimpedes success.\n  Our soldiers and the American people deserve more from the \nadministration. Together, the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of \nState need to set the White House's political agenda aside and directly \nand thoughtfully address this ominous threat.\n  The administration acts as if the mere discussion of civil war is \ndefeatist. They have it exactly backwards. This amendment is an effort \nto make sure that the administration confronts and deals with the facts \non the ground in Iraq and recognizes the emerging threat before it \nconsumes our troops.\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\nThis is the only way to achieve any measure of success. For too long, \nthe Bush administration has pursued policies that have failed utterly \nto carry the day in Iraq and have made America less safe.\n  Unfortunately, this administration has decided that domestic politics \nrequire that it stay this failed course through November, and so they \nhave refused to confront the facts in Iraq. Instead, they have chosen \npolitical spin, false claims of progress, and baseless attacks on those \nwho focus on the reality of the situation.\n  We must do better. This administration owes it to the American \npeople. Even more importantly, dealing with reality is essential and \nnecessary to protect the lives of our brave soldiers.\n  Iraq's future and the lives of our troops are close to the precipice \nof a new disaster. The time bomb of civil war is ticking, and our most \nurgent priority is to defuse it.\n  Our Government should work to reverse the downward spiral. And Iraqi \nleaders must make essential compromises to strengthen their government, \nprevent civil war, undermine the insurgency, and deal with the \nfestering problem of militias.\n  For the sake of our men and women in uniform and the stability of \nIraq, all Americans are anxious for success, but we need to be \nrealistic enough and smart enough and humble enough to understand that \neven our best efforts may not prevent a civil war from overtaking \nevents in Iraq.\n  We need to begin planning now for this possibility. That's what this \namendment requires.\n  Such planning is not an admission of defeat. It is essential and \nnecessary for protecting the lives of our service men and women in \nIraq, who are performing so admirably today under such enormously \ndifficult circumstances.\n  Mr. President, I will not include this whole report in the Record--it \nis 63 pages--but I will reference it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I made arrangements to put a copy of the report on every \nSenator's desk by tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that. During the course of the week, \nindividuals may quote from it, as I did earlier today and may again. I \nwill not ask that it be printed in the Record, but it should be \navailable for anyone concerned about the debate on Iraq. It is an \nenormously important document and is a ``must read'' for every Member \nof Congress--certainly for the American people--to have a real \nunderstanding of what we are facing in that country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia will offer his \namendment, so I will not take much time now. I will respond to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  I have just returned from being present when the President of the \nUnited States made a tremendous statement about the situation in Iraq \nand the world in terms of the war on terror. My view of the situation \nis much different from the Senator from Massachusetts. I read this \nreport that is before the Senate now as being an up-to-date analysis of \nthe situation that exists now.\n  I sometimes wonder what would have happened in Korea if, after some \nof the major losses in Korea, the Senate had decided we ought to ask \nthe Truman administration to make more reports, produce more reports, \nrequire analysis of what was going on, and have hearings.\n  We are about in the same situation. This report does conclude--that \nis why I think everyone should read it--the concerns over civil war \nthat are expressed. It says that notwithstanding this concern, there is \ngenerally no agreed-upon definition of civil war among academics or \ndefense analysts. Moreover, the conflict in Iraq does not meet the \nstringent international legal standards for civil war.\n  That is a situation of the statement that exists now. To require \nanother set of reports when we get these every quarter is unwarranted. \nThis was released September 1. We will get another one the first of \nJanuary. We do not have to have an amendment to do this.\n  However, as we discussed, it may be possible to take this amendment \nto conference and work it out so we get some ideas. If they want \nadditional information in the next report, we can arrange that; \nhowever, it does not have to be a conflict. It does not have to have as \nmuch political rhetoric, I say to my friend from Massachusetts. I am a \nlittle bit tired of political rhetoric concerning this conflict, which \nis a global conflict against terror. It is more than the war against \nIraq, against Saddam Hussein. There is no question about that. I urge \nthe Senator to read the President's speech today, the quotes he has \ngiven to us from the President of Iran, from the people involved with \nHezbollah, from the people involved in the various dissident factions \nthroughout the world that are demanding we surrender to them, that we \nkneel down before them and accept defeat. This Senator is not ready for \nthat kind of rhetoric to come to this Senate. I hope it does not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to do that, yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In my remarks, I said we ought to have kept our eye on \nthe ball, which was al-Qaida and the terrorists, and not gone into \nIraq.\n  As the President of the United States knows, there were no weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq. As the 9/11 Commission reported, there was no \nconnection between Iraq and al-Qaida's attack on this country.\n  So we have a rush to war. Instead of focusing on the problems of al-\nQaida, North Korea and Iran, we are now mired in a war in Iraq.\n  The Senator is making my point. We should have focused on the dangers \nof Iraq. That is a completely different situation than in Korea when \nthe Chinese Communists crossed the river. There was a real issue in \nterms of our national security. The case has was not made that Iraq \nposed a threat to our national interest or security. That case was not \nmade in the Senate. And the arguments that were made were inaccurate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I still have the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All right.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be glad to debate the Senator any time.\n  Again, I urge the Senator to read the President's statement before he \ncriticizes it. The President has made a very significant statement \ntoday of where we are. He will make another statement tomorrow.\n  I have looked at the report. Every Senator should look at it. We \nshould decide whether there is a deficiency. If there is, we will be \nglad to take the amendment to conference and try to work out some \nlanguage that will not be political rhetoric. I sense it is political \nrhetoric, I say to my friend from Massachusetts. I hope it does not get \nthat far. It is still a war against terror.\n  Our job ought to be to get this bill passed so we can get the money \nto these people for sure by October 1. The longer this bill is delayed, \nthe more trouble our people in uniform are going to have. I have been \narguing that now for a month. There is no question this bill has to be \nsigned by September 30.\n  I am not going to prolong this by debating politics in the Senate. I \nwill say we will do our best to take as many amendments as we can to \nconference and try to work out something that will meet with the \nagreement of the Congress as a whole so we can get this bill signed.\n  I yield the floor. We have an agreement that the Senator will be able \nto propose his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4883, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment, No. 4883, and I \nsend a modification to the desk and I ask the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4883, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To make available from Defense Health Program up to \n     $12,000,000 for the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. ___. Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title VI under the heading ``Defense Health \n     Program'', $19,000,000 shall be available for the Defense and \n     Veterans Brain Injury Center.\n\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am proposing an amendment to provide an \nadditional $12 million that shall be available to the Defense and \nVeterans Brain Injury Center and centers all across our country.\n  We are in the midst of a war against terrorist organizations. They \nare vile. They are hate filled. They are al-Qaida, they are Hezbollah, \nIslamic Jihad, Hamas, and a variety of different organizations. The \nbattlefronts are all over the world. We have troops deployed in Iraq. \nWe have troops in Afghanistan. Our friends and allies are having to \nfight Hezbollah, a puppet surrogate of Iran. These terrorists have hit \nall over the world. They have hit, obviously, in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThey have hit in Israel. They have hit in Jordan. They have hit in \nIndia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Spain, and London. They are still \ntrying to hit us. Fortunately, the British intercepted airplanes that \nwould be used in another terrorist attack.\n  They use a lot of different devices in this war. They use bombs and a \nvariety of IEDs. They use rocket-propelled grenades. They use land \nmines. I was talking to a woman from Afghanistan a couple weeks ago. I \nasked for her perspective of Afghanistan. She said that things are \nbetter, but the terrorists are hitting schools.\n  I asked: Why are they hitting schools?\n  And she said: Because we are educating women in Afghanistan, and from \nthe al-Qaida/Taliban point of view, women are not to be educated.\n  Our service men and women are serving very courageously in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and other places in the world. They deserve to have the \nbest possibile equipment when they go into battle or into dangerous \ncombat zones. We need to make sure our troops are outfitted with the \nbest body armor, the most technologically advanced armaments, weapons, \nand communication devices that are possible so that they are safe and \nthat we can defeat these terrorist enemies.\n  The same principles apply when our brave men and women return home \nfrom the theaters of war. We need to make sure our servicemembers \nreceive the best possible medical care for any injuries that may have \narisen while they were in these combat zones. We need to make sure our \nsoldiers receive the proper mental health treatment to deal with any \nissues of post-traumatic stress disorder or appropriate counseling to \nhelp adjust back into civilian life.\n  For those soldiers returning home with an injury, we need to make \nsure our medical treatment facilities have sufficient funding and also \nthe professional services and the most up-to-date technology so our \nservicemembers receive the quality care they deserve.\n  One of the more prevalent injuries in Iraq right now for our soldiers \nis traumatic brain injuries. According to the National Institute of \nNeurological Disorders and Stroke, a traumatic brain injury occurs when \na sudden trauma causes damage to the brain. Traumatic brain injury can \nresult when the head suddenly and violently hits an object or when an \nobject pierces the skull and enters brain tissue.\n  According to the Office of the Surgeon General of the Army, 64 \npercent of soldiers recently wounded in Operation Iraqi Freedom \nsustained blast injuries, which are the leading cause of traumatic \nbrain injuries for Active-Duty military personnel in war zones. These \nblast injuries are the result, as I said earlier, of RPGs, rocket-\npropelled grenades, or IEDs, otherwise known as or short for improvised \nexplosive devices, and also landmines.\n  Soldiers, I say to the Presiding Officer and my colleagues, suffering \ninjuries from these devices require specialized care from providers \nwith experience in treating traumatic brain injuries. One of the key \ncomponents of this care is the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury \nCenter, which is located at Walter Reed Army Medical Center--the site \nthat receives more casualties from theaters of operations than any \nother military treatment facility.\n  The Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center provides state-of-the-\nart medical care, innovative clinical research initiatives, and \neducational programs on traumatic brain injury to assist Active-Duty \nservicemembers and veterans. The Brain Injury Center is actually a \nmultisite medical care facility with operations in California, Texas, \nFlorida, Minnesota, North Carolina, and in my home Commonwealth of \nVirginia. In Virginia, the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center \nserves as a national referral center for traumatic brain injury cases \nand other diseases. They partner with Virginia Commonwealth University \nin Richmond to provide the best quality service for treatment and \nrecovery, as well as research. And I suspect the facilities in other \nStates, probably provide similar services. I just know very much about \nthe McGuire facility in Richmond and also the Walter Reed site and have \nseen the expert staff as they review the daily incoming casualty \nreports and identify the patients who have sustained injuries caused by \nblasts or falls or other incidents. They have evaluated and treated \nhundreds of patients.\n  These centers really do provide outstanding specialized care, such as \nrehabilitation--for speech and physical rehabilitation--and education. \nThese patients need to be helped to return to the highest possible \nlevel of function.\n  These centers are performing a very admirable job and doing the best \nthey can; however, we need to make sure, whether it is McGuire in \nRichmond, whether it is Walter Reed, or one of these facilities in \nMinnesota or Florida or Texas or California or North Carolina--this \nwork I have seen at these centers, at least at McGuire in Richmond and \nWalter Reed, are providing great services. I can tell you firsthand, by \nthe way, how the soldiers are reacting to it and also the response from \nfamily members who are seeing slow but steady progress for many of \ntheir loved ones. They greatly appreciate it.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment, to make available from the \nDefense Health Programs an additional $12 million, which would increase \nit from $7 million to $19 million--an additional $12 million in funding \nthat shall be available to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury \nCenters for this work, including blast mitigation.\n  It is my view this is the least we should do. This is exactly what we \nshould be trying to do to help our men and women who are bravely \nsacrificing so much to protect our freedom at home while trying to \nadvance freedom for other people around the world.\n  George Washington cautioned that ``the willingness of future \ngenerations to fight for their country, no matter how just the cause, \nwill be proportional to how they perceive previous veterans are \ntreated.'' This amendment is a long step forward--a long step forward--\nin that direction, and I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport my amendment, as modified.\n  I understand other colleagues apparently share my concerns about the \nadequacy of such needed funding for brain injury services. I hope the \nSenator from Illinois, who I know shares my views on this issue, and \nother Senators on both sides of the aisle--that we could work together \nin a bipartisan manner to get this job done, to make sure we effectuate \nthis bipartisan solution for this very pressing need to make sure those \nwho have brain injuries--head trauma and injuries from blasts--whether \nin Afghanistan, whether in Iraq, or anywhere else in combat zones--to \nmake sure they have the right treatment.\n  We have the professionals in this country, but we need to make sure \nthey have adequate funding for this clear and present need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator to allow me to \nbecome a cosponsor. I hope the Senator from Illinois will, also. We had \na little disagreement before about funding in this area, but I have no \ndisagreement with the necessity for funds, particularly after a report \nwe received just this August on the nature and extent of these matters. \nI think this money is needed. So I would be willing--and I think the \nSenator from Hawaii will have no objection to this--I would be pleased \nto----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Will the Senator from Virginia just yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have the floor, for just a second, if I \nmay. I\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\nwould urge Senator Durbin, if he will, to join us. Again, it is a \nmatter of expediting our bill. I know he has an amendment, too. But I \nbelieve the numbers are the same and the intent is the same, and we \nshould all cosponsor it, as far as I am concerned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was just asking the Senator how this is different from \nthe Durbin amendment. I note the Senator was in the Chamber earlier. \nHow is this amendment different? I was a cosponsor of his amendment.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would have to look at the details. That is why I \nmentioned the Senator from Illinois, and I and others, I think, share \nthe same concern. The main point, the main concern--which is making \nsure the professional services were there, the adequacy of the devices, \nthe adequacy of the health care professionals--I think was actually \nfairly identical. I have not looked at the measure of the Senator from \nIllinois. It appears that we are going down the same stream, in the \nsame direction.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe the main difference was the amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia said ``may'' and the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Illinois said ``shall'' in terms of the $19 million. And you have \nused the word ``shall'' from the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois, have you not?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Yes, as modified. Thank you. However, the point is it is \n$19 million, and it shall be appropriated for this function.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So you have accepted what was in the Durbin amendment; \nthat is, that shall be spent?\n  Mr. ALLEN. The point is, my amendment was going to be $19 million \nregardless. And my view was, we needed added funding, and this will \nmake it absolutely clear.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator because I was a cosponsor. I did not \npay close attention to the presentation, but I was a cosponsor of \nSenator Durbin's amendment, as I understand, as printed. And listening \nto the Senator from Virginia, it appears it is virtually identical to \nwhat the Senator from Illinois had proposed. I am glad we will have an \nopportunity to take action on it.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would say, Mr. President, to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, this is an opportunity for all of us to come together in \na bipartisan fashion. I know one of the occasions when I was at Walter \nReed Hospital the Senator from Massachusetts was there at the same \ntime. And we see the outstanding work the professionals provide for \nthose men and women who have been injured.\n  This is one issue where I believe all Americans, regardless of party, \nregardless of region, need to come together to make sure funding is \nthere.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, was my request to be added as a cosponsor \nto the amendment granted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Senator Allen filed an amendment numbered \n4883, which was on the same subject matter as my amendment numbered \n4884 that was filed. I have been told by staff that he has modified his \namendment so it is now identical to mine; is that correct?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I believe so. Mr. President, my amendment was filed before \nthe Senator's and his was filed after. I have not read the Senator's \namendment, but as modified, the best I have heard from talking to \nSenator Stevens and listening to the Senator from Massachusetts, they \nseem to be very close, if not identical.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the changes in language the Senator made to his \namendment have made them virtually identical, so it appears we are \nsetting out to do the same thing.\n  So that there is clarity in the record, I want to make sure I \nunderstand this. My amendment said $19 million will be available to \nthis program for defense and a veterans brain injuries center. Is that \nthe Senator's modified amendment?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Rather than ``will,'' it would be ``shall'' in my \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. So they are identical at this point.\n  Mr. ALLEN. The Senator wasn't here. I mentioned that I would love for \nus to work together on a bipartisan basis to effectuate our shared \ngoal.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly what we should do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the cosponsors of my amendment--and \nthere are some eight cosponsors and myself. Let us do this as a \nbipartisan amendment since we are doing exactly the same thing. Is that \nacceptable to the Senator?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Agreed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a statement in \nsupport of the amendment at this point. I think we all understand that \nthe war we are fighting in Iraq has resulted in injuries that are much \ndifferent than in previous wars. Many times our soldiers would go to \nwar and face other soldiers and enemies with rifles aimed at them \ntrying to kill them. Now most of our soldiers and marines are coming \nhome with injuries related to trauma from these homemade bombs, these \nIEDs which are being exploded. As a consequence, the signature wound of \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for American soldiers has become \ntraumatic brain injury.\n  Many of my colleagues who have visited injured servicemen at military \nVeterans Administration facilities across the Nation understand this is \na new challenge for us. We say to the men and women in uniform: If you \nwill risk your life and stand up for America, we will stand by you. If \nyou are injured, we will make sure we do everything humanly possible to \nget you back on your feet and back at home and into your normal life.\n  So now we know that traumatic brain injury is a new challenge for us, \nin greater numbers than we have ever seen in previous conflicts. The \nleading organization within the DOD to deal with this is the Defense \nand Veterans Brain Injury Center. They started it in 1992, and the \nclinical treatment and research conducted by that center has really \ntried to define optimal care for survivors of traumatic brain injury.\n  This center is located at Walter Reed, one of our greatest hospitals \nin America. It has other sites in Texas, California, Virginia, Florida, \nNorth Carolina, and Minnesota. The center's current budget is $14 \nmillion. That fiscal year ends in just a few weeks. The leaders at the \ncenter requested $19 million for the coming year. They say there are \nmore patients. That is obvious from the soldiers coming home. They say \nthe cost of long-term care has gone up. The current staffing \nrequirements and need for research to improve treatment and prevention \nall require more funds, so that $14 million this year would not be \nenough for next year. The appropriations bill we seek to amend, \nunfortunately, cut the funds for the center. In fact, it cut them in \nhalf to $7 million. That is totally inadequate, even for this year, and \nwould not meet the need for next year.\n  The center estimates that 1 out of every 10 servicemembers in Iraq \nand 2 in 10 troops in the front lines return from combat tours with \nconcussions. It is the nature of combat in Iraq, where insurgents use \nroadside bombs instead of bullets. That produces more brain injuries. \nAs of today, more than 1,700 wounded servicemen have come back from \nIraq with brain injuries. Half of them are severe enough to permanently \nimpair thinking, memory, mood, behavior, and their ability to work. In \nVietnam and previous 20th century wars, brain injuries were just 12 \npercent of injuries. In Iraq and Afghanistan, it is almost double--22 \npercent.\n  According to a recent study by researchers at Harvard and Columbia, \nit is estimated that the cost of medical treatment for these \nindividuals with brain injuries from the Iraq war will be at least $14 \nbillion over the next 20 years. So when we speak of the real cost of \nwar at this point, we are talking about not only the current injuries\n\n[[Page S8929]]\n\nthat are being treated as the soldiers return home but their long-term \ncare and rehabilitation, which is part of our responsibility as well.\n  This brain injury center is completely different from other brain \ninjury programs and initiatives. It focuses on the well-being of those \nwho put themselves in harm's way for our country. It is not just \nresearch, it is treatment based. It links injured soldiers to clinical \nstudies where cutting-edge treatments are explored. It does this with \nall members of the military, Active-Duty personnel and reservists as \nwell. No other brain center combines treatment and clinical studies for \nthe immediate benefit of our servicemembers.\n  This brain center also focuses on the unique needs of the military \nand veteran beneficiaries, including return-to-duty considerations, \ncontinuation of care with military and veterans hospitals, and TRICARE.\n  I offered amendment No. 4884 along with Senators Menendez, Mikulski, \nKennedy, Bingaman, Kerry, Lautenberg, and Obama. They have all joined \nme in offering this amendment. I sent out a ``dear colleague'' last \nweek, and I am happy to have their support. Now we are going to combine \nour amendment with Senator Allen's efforts so that it is a bipartisan \neffort to pass this amendment.\n  This amendment will allow the brain center to meet its current \nadministrative and staffing requirements and maintain talented \nprofessionals who are essential for the soldiers to get back on their \nfeet. My colleagues can clearly see that the brain injury center is \ndirectly related to the needs of our warfighters and will go a long way \ntoward treating the signature wound of our conflicts in Afghanistan and \nIraq. It is not just another research program.\n  Before the August recess, there was a lengthy debate about my \nattempts to put more money into research for traumatic brain injury, \nwhich was voted down on the floor. This is treatment as well as \nresearch and therapy. It is time for us to take decisive action.\n  I am proud that the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American \nVeterans, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the National \nMilitary Families Association, the American Legion, and the Blinded \nVeterans Association all support my amendment for more funding for the \nbrain injury center. I hope my colleagues will also support our injured \ntroops fighting this war by supporting this amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent, but I \nwill make it clear that if there is any modification at a later point \nthat Senator Allen suggests, I will be glad to work with him. I believe \nthis is our understanding based on the colloquy we had.\n  I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 4883, Senator Allen's \namendment, be shown as the Allen-Durbin amendment and that my \ncosponsors be added as cosponsors to this amendment. My amendment No. \n4884 and Senator Allen's are identical.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If Senator Allen wants to change that in any way, I will \nbe happy to do it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me? I wish to \nmake an inquiry of the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the order? Is the order that we \ngo to the judge nomination at 4:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator--I don't know how long \nshe intends to speak; I don't even need to ask--when she is finished, \nwill she put in a quorum call if it is before 4:30, please?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to do so.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today, as we debate the Defense \nAppropriations bill, to talk about the leadership of the Secretary of \nDefense and to relay to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle what I \nheard, as I was out and about in California, about his comments and the \nneed, in my opinion, to change direction at the Department of Defense.\n  During this break, I was home in California working. There is a lot \nof anxiety in the land. Today, a new poll came out and showed a huge \npercentage of the American people--a huge percentage--angry, actually \nangry about what is happening in this country today. If you probe and \nfind out, there are many issues. They are angry about the economy, \nwhich they are part of, where they see corporate profits way up but \nwages stagnant or falling--wages that cannot even keep up with \ninflation. They are angry at deficits. They are angry at debt. They are \nangry at good jobs going overseas. They are angry at the oil companies. \nThey are angry at this Congress for doing nothing about that, not even \nsupporting antigouging legislation. But the one thing they are angry \nand upset about more than any other is the war in Iraq.\n  So I think it is time that the Senate go on record and state very \nclearly that we are not satisfied with the way things are going. We are \nangry as well. We are upset as well. So over the recess, when Secretary \nRumsfeld made his latest speech, which turned into an attack on the \nAmerican people who oppose this war--61 percent of the people; he \ncalled them appeasers--I just said enough is enough, and I announced \nthat I was preparing a resolution asking the President for new \nleadership at the Pentagon.\n  I know today Secretary Rumsfeld is having elective surgery on his \nshoulder. I want him to know this is not about his personality, it is \nabout his policies. I wish him well today. But I do think it is time \nfor new leadership at the Department of Defense.\n  Last week, Secretary Rumsfeld compared critics of the Bush \nadministration's failed policies in Iraq to those who wanted to appease \nfascism and Nazism in the run up to World War II. On this rampage, he \nsaid that those people who oppose this administration's war in Iraq \nfailed to learn the lessons of history.\n  I have served in the Congress since 1983. I was sworn into the House \nthat year, and in 1992 was sworn into the Senate. So it has been a long \ntime. I have served with four Presidents, Republicans and Democrats. I \nhave yet to see a situation where a President of the United States, in \nthe middle of a horrific situation where we are losing our beautiful \nyoung men and women every day, where they are coming home with post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, with severe brain injuries--and I am very \npleased that Senators Durbin and Allen have gotten together so we have \na bipartisan amendment to help our soldiers as they come home dealing \nwith these brain injuries--but I have never seen a President of any \nparty offer no hope, no exit, no way out.\n  The best this President can say is: As long as I am President, we are \ngoing to be in Iraq. Is that a policy? Is that a plan? Is that a \nstrategy? Is that hope? It isn't.\n  We hear the Secretary of Defense essentially give no hope either. His \nanswer is to lash out at those of us who want to give some hope, who \nwant to find a way out of this. But he went too far. He went too far \nbecause he attacked the American people. That is what he did. I believe \nthat Secretary Rumsfeld, who thinks that those of us who believe this \nwar is not going well and that we need an exit strategy are wrong, is \nfailing to learn the lessons of history as he melds together the war on \nterror and the war in Iraq.\n  He says we don't understand history. I say to him: I voted to go to \nwar against the terrorists. Every single Senator, Democrat and \nRepublican,\n\n[[Page S8930]]\n\nvoted to go after the people who attacked us, voted to go after the \nterrorists.\n  Let me remind the Secretary that according to a publication of this \nadministration's own Department of State, there was not at that time \none al-Qaida cell in Iraq, when there were many here in America. So \ndon't blend this. It isn't going to work anymore. The people are too \nsmart for this. It was al-Qaida who struck the United States on \nSeptember 11, 2001--not Iraq--a country that didn't have a single al-\nQaida cell. It had a brutal dictator worthy of the worst possible fate \nbut not one al-Qaida cell, by this administration's own reports that I \nhave made public time and time again. The American people get it. \nToday, 61 percent of the American people, nearly two-thirds of all \nAmericans, oppose the war in Iraq. The American people are right. They \nunderstand the difference. They understand that the President and the \nSecretary of Defense, saying over and over: Iraq, war on terror, same \nthing, doesn't make it true.\n\n  When President Bush was asked directly a few weeks ago on August 21, \nhe said: Iraq had nothing to do with the terrorist attack of September \n11, 2001. But then I am assuming everyone gets together and says: Well, \nthe only way we can try to win over the American people and get them on \nthe side of this war is to tell them over and over again that the Iraq \nwar is about getting the terrorists. While Osama bin Laden is on the \nloose, while the Taliban are gaining strength in Afghanistan, while we \ntook our eye off that prize, while we lost the support of the world, we \nwent into Iraq. Secretary Rumsfeld is wrong when he says we don't \nunderstand this.\n  Osama bin Laden remains at large. America is bogged down in a war \nthat becomes increasingly costly in dollars. My last memory is that it \nis costing $8 billion a month. Eight billion dollars a month, while we \ncan't get $1 billion to take care of 1 million kids who have no place \nto go after school. That is just one comparison. While we are told we \ncan't afford interoperable communications for our police, $8 billion a \nmonth is being spent in Iraq. And the treasure of our young people, \neach and every day--today I heard right now, another four--today, \nanother four.\n  Now, here is the situation: We have to hold people accountable. When \nI face the electorate, I am held accountable. Everything I ever did \nthat people didn't like, believe me, I hear about it. There are 30-\nsecond commercials about it and people get to look at it and they hold \nme accountable. Secretary Rumsfeld should be held accountable. Time and \ntime again he has been wrong about Iraq, and time and time again he has \nresponded to his own mistakes by playing politics and attacking the \nAmerican people and their patriotism if they oppose his ill-advised \ndecisions and now calling them appeasers. Appeasers, the new ``word du \njour.''\n  It was Secretary Rumsfeld who failed to heed the warnings of military \nplanners and experts that the overthrow of the Iraqi regime would be a \nprolonged and costly undertaking. In fact, he failed to heed even his \nown advice. I would like to share Secretary Rumsfeld's own words with \nyou to illustrate this point. This is what Secretary Rumsfeld said his \nguidelines would be:\n\n       U.S. leadership must be brutally honest with itself, the \n     Congress, the public, and coalition partners. We must not \n     make the effort sound even marginally easier or less costly \n     than it could become. Preserving U.S. credibility requires \n     that we promise less, or no more, than we are sure we can \n     deliver. It is a great deal easier to get into something than \n     it is to get out of it.\n\n  Now, this is the text of a memorandum: ``Guidelines to be considered \nwhen committing forces,'' written by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld \nin March 2001. So this is 2 years before Iraq. ``It is a great deal \neasier,'' he said, ``to get into something than it is to get out of \nit.''\n  But he didn't follow his own guidelines. He never even had a plan to \nget out of it.\n  So I remember very clearly his other quote. He said:\n\n       This war could last six days, six weeks. I doubt six \n     months.\n\n  That was February of 2003.\n  And then he said in February of 2003:\n\n       There is no question but that American forces would be \n     welcomed by the majority of the civilian population of Iraq.\n\n  Now, if he said this and no more--I would say you have to hold \nsomeone responsible who has done all of this: set out guidelines and \nthen turns around and doesn't pay attention to his own guidelines; \npredicts the war would, at tops, last 6 months, he doubted it; and that \nwe would be welcomed by the majority of the civilian population of \nIraq. He ought to tell that to a mother I just met with whose military \nson was training the Iraqi military when one of the Iraqi military \nkilled him in cold blood. Tell that--tell that to the military moms \nthat I meet with.\n  It was Secretary Rumsfeld who said on March 30, 2003:\n\n       We know where they are, the weapons of mass destruction. \n     They are in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, \n     west, south and north somewhat.\n\n  I remember sitting across from him, just a few feet, looking right \ninto his eyes after we had started looking for the weapons of mass \ndestruction, and he still held to all that: Oh, I know. You turn left \nat the fountain. It was that kind of a response. We know exactly where \nthey are. Well, they had relied on people who were phonies. Their \nintelligence was wrong. But his judgment was to listen to those folks \nwho were known to be exaggerators.\n  It was Secretary Rumsfeld who said on April 11, 2003, in the wake of \nwidespread looting after the fall of Saddam Hussein when they were \nlooting the museums, there was no law, there was no order. We had no \nplan. Our military did everything that was asked of them and they did \nit perfectly. There was no plan. And this is what he said in light of \nthis widespread looting:\n\n       Stuff happens, and it's untidy and freedom's untidy, and \n     free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and \n     do bad things.\n  What a message. We now know--and we knew then as we watched it--that \nthis looting set the stage for the climate of fear and lawlessness that \npersists to this day in Iraq. No plan. Oh, we were going to be there 6 \nmonths tops. Our troops were going to be loved. Oh, yeah, and if they \njust did a little looting, this is nothing.\n  It was Secretary Rumsfeld who sent brave young American men and women \ninto combat without sufficient body armor, telling the young soldier \nwho had the guts to ask him a question about this, he said:\n\n       As you know, you go to war with the Army you have, not the \n     Army you might want or wish to have at a later time.\n\n  What kind of comment is that? Why would he not say:\n\n       Young man, you had the guts to ask that question, and I am \n     going to make sure that we do everything we have to do to \n     make you as safe as you can be.\n\n  He needs to go.\n  It was Secretary Rumsfeld who sat back, without doing anything, in \nthe face of widespread violence, the rise of sectarian militias, and \nthe rapid growth of the insurgency. We went and asked questions of him \ntime and time again. It was the same thing, always: Everything is going \ngreat. There are a couple of bad apples, a couple of bad apples.\n  It was Secretary Rumsfeld who presided over the Pentagon during the \nAbu Ghraib Prison abuse scandal which diminished U.S. standing in the \nworld and caused irreparable harm to the image of the U.S. military. I \nremember looking at a document that the Secretary had approved of, \nwhere he said, these are the things that he thinks we should be able to \ndo to the prisoners, and it was pretty shocking. But what has happened \nto this country is we have never been held in lower esteem, ever, than \nwe are today.\n  This face, Secretary Rumsfeld's face, and this history, Secretary \nRumsfeld's history, is dogging this country. I hope the President would \nsee this, and we know he is extremely loyal, but it is time to be loyal \nto the troops now. It is time to be loyal to the families now. It is \ntime to be loyal to the American people now who are very angry about \nwhat they see. It is time for him to go and get a fresh face in there. \nThere are a number of people--and I wouldn't even consider putting any \nnames out because it is not appropriate for me to do that. But there \nare many men and women in this country who could take on this task and \nbring a freshness to the job, a new perspective, someone who isn't tied \ndown to past misstatements, past mistakes, and now this attack that he \nunleashed, this tirade on the American people.\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\n  It is time for new leadership, new direction, and new vision. We can \ndo better. We have to do better. And I have to say in this conversation \nthat there have been many on the other side of the aisle, both sitting \nin the Senate and also running for the Senate, who have also shared a \ncritique of this particular Secretary of Defense. There is one in \nparticular on the other side of the aisle who expressed no confidence \nin Secretary Rumsfeld. A number of retired generals who served our \ncountry with honor and distinction have called for Secretary Rumsfeld's \nresignation over his mishandling of the Iraq war, including GEN Anthony \nZinni, GEN Wesley Clark, LTG Gregory Newbold, who actually was part of \nthe team that laid out the invasion plan for Iraq and who appeared \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee and clearly offered a better way \na year, a year-and-a-half ago, a better way out of this war. MG John \nBatiste, MG Charles Swannack, Jr., MG John Riggs, and MG Paul Eaton. We \nremember what happened. As soon as these generals had the courage to go \nout and say something, they were slapped down hard by this \nadministration, essentially saying they had no right to express \nthemselves. Well, quite the contrary. Quite the contrary.\n  I heard my leader, Harry Reid, say something very interesting one \nday. He quoted Teddy Roosevelt, the Republican President, who said \nsomething like this. I am paraphrasing, but I am using very similar \nwords. He said: In a time of war, if you don't agree with the commander \nin chief and you say nothing, you are guilty of treason. That is a \nRepublican President. How much have they changed? Now if you try to say \nanything, they slap you down. These generals deserve our thanks for \nhaving the courage to come forward, having the courage to say we need \nnew leadership at the Pentagon.\n  MG Paul Eaton, who was responsible for training Iraqi security forces \nfrom 2003 to 2004--and, by the way, that is a hard job. I saw it being \ndone when I was in Iraq last. MG Paul Eaton wrote in the New York Times \non March 19, 2006, that Secretary Rumsfeld, ``has shown himself \nincompetent strategically, operationally, and tactically, and is far \nmore than anyone else responsible for what has happened to our \nimportant mission in Iraq. Mr. Rumsfeld must step down.''\n  This is not easy for former generals, to say these things. What is \nimportant is that we hear them. Not that we say you have no right to \nspeak. This is America. They have the obligation to speak, and each of \nus has the obligation to speak. No one in this country should be afraid \nof saying what is on his or her mind. If we get to that point, we are \nin deep trouble.\n  Talk about the lessons of history--we have our men and women in \nuniform fighting to give the Iraqis a chance at freedom. They are doing \nevery single thing they can do. They have accomplished every single \nmission. We can go back to the missions they have completed. Those \nmissions changed constantly.\n  First it was find the weapons of mass instruction. Well, they found \nthey were not there. Then we said get rid of Saddam Hussein, and they \ncaptured him and he will meet his fate. Then they said there is some \ntrouble here, let's show we are tough, so they killed his sons, and \nthen the administration chose to put those pictures on television, \nthinking that would send a message: Don't mess with us.\n  Then they said we have to have an election. Our troops were \nmagnificent. They set the stage for the election. Then they said we \nhave to train their troops, and they trained their troops. Then they \nsaid they need another election, and they did it again. They did an \nextraordinary job.\n  But they cannot want freedom and democracy more than the Iraqis want \nit. Name one country that could be a country but has to rely on a \nforeign power to run the country and to provide the security. You can't \nfind a country that is surviving in that situation. You cannot.\n  We just saw, in Lebanon, Hezbollah, a terrorist group, acting like a \nstate within a state. That is unacceptable. The world is coming to \nLebanon's rescue. Hopefully it will work and they will stop attacking \nIsraeli soldiers and sending their rockets into Israel and they will \nleave the Lebanese alone and the Lebanese will protect their security. \nWe cannot do the job of security for the people of Iraq if they are not \ninterested in doing it.\n  Let me say, when I was over there, there is an attitude there that we \nwill just stay forever, that they never have to do this. There is an \nattitude over there like that. I don't mind being Uncle Sam, but I sure \ndon't want to be Uncle Sucker. This isn't right. This isn't fair. This \nisn't just, to send our people back and back and back, to second tours \nof duty, third tours of duty, to do a job the Iraqis must do for \nthemselves.\n  This sectarian violence is the problem. The Bush administration \nitself, while they try to make this a war on terror, says and teaches \nus that it is a small percent of the violence that is coming from the \nterrorists. The vast majority is sectarian violence. That is why the \nAmerican people are seeing through this. What they are learning is that \nin fact this operation in Iraq is shorting the war on terror.\n  I spoke before about Afghanistan. We went in there with the vote of \nevery single Senator, to get the terrorists. We had the world in our \nhands. Then we made a detour, turned around, and now Afghanistan is \nhaving trouble. That should have been the model we used. That would \nhave sent the message. We would have gotten bin Laden. We would have \nended the Taliban. Now they are all creeping back in, as is the drug \ntrading. This adventure in Iraq has weakened the war on terror. When \nSecretary Rumsfeld refuses to see that clearly and tells us it is all \none, he is confusing the public purposely because he sees, politically, \nthe people are catching on.\n  How many more troops do we have to lose? Madam President, 2,652 \ntroops have lost their lives in Iraq and nearly 20,000 have been \nwounded. The cost of this war will soon reach $318.5 billion. We don't \nhave enough money to insure our children for health care. We don't have \nenough money to protect our ports. We don't have enough money for \ninteroperable communications. We don't have enough money to protect our \nnuclear powerplants and our railroads. And while we are taking away lip \ngel from women on planes, they are still not checking the cargo that \ngoes inside the planes. We can't afford it--oh, no. But we can afford \nthis and tax cuts to millionaires--again and again and again.\n  I guess we can afford these deficits and we can afford the debt that \nis reaching such a major proportion that it is not only our children \nbut our grandchildren, and maybe theirs, who will have to pay off this \ndebt. And we were on our way to a debt-free America when this \nadministration took over.\n  We have shortchanged the war in Afghanistan, which is the central \nfront of the war on terror. According to the New York Times, suicide \nbombings have doubled. The roadside bombs attacks, modeled after those \ncarried out in Iraq, are up 30 percent. The United Nations announced \nSaturday that this year's opium crop in Afghanistan has reached the \nhighest levels ever recorded, yielding extraordinary profits that we \nknow fall back into the hands of the very people we are trying to \ndefeat.\n  Tragically, attacks against schools are on the rise, and attacks \nagainst women. In January, armed men in the Zabul province of \nAfghanistan beheaded a high school headmaster in front of his children. \nBy March, half of the schools in the province had closed and attacks \nreached an average of one a day.\n  We are losing ground. Iraq, Iraq, Iraq--24/7--Iraq, Iraq, Iraq. There \nare no time lines, no deadlines, no hope, no vision, no plan. The \nonly thing we know from this President is, as long as I am in power, he \nsays, we will be in Iraq.\n\n  We are weaker in Afghanistan because of Iraq. We are weaker on \nhomeland security. I call this administration soft on homeland defense \nbecause they will not do what needs to be done. There are things we \ncould do right now, today, that absolutely make eminent sense. They are \nnot politics. They are not politics. The 9/11 Commission came out with \na number of recommendations, dozens of them. We know they said that it \nis important that we either screen the cargo for explosives--the cargo \nthat goes on passenger planes--or we have blast-resistant cargo \ncontainers installed so if\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\nthere is a blast, it will remain inside the container and not bring the \nairplane down.\n  Do you think this administration will do this? Let me tell you no, \nand let me tell you how I know--because I sit on the Commerce \nCommittee. We have jurisdiction over the FAA. Years ago, I had an \namendment pass the committee that said: Let's test these blast-\nresistant containers. Usually they would be made out of Kevlar. If you \nhave ever seen Kevlar, had an experience with Kevlar, you know this is \na fantastic product we can use. Oh, no, they are still studying it. And \nthey are still not inspecting cargo.\n  So when we are told the alerts are up, of course we have every reason \nto be worried because we are not doing what we should be doing because \nwe are spending $8 billion a month on Iraq, we are spending $318 \nbillion, we are stretching our military thin, we are soft on homeland \ndefense, and we have neglected Afghanistan.\n  The face of this policy, in addition to the President, is Secretary \nRumsfeld. Now as he looks around the world, he has to see it. Everybody \ndoes see it. You can dream about a better world, but all you have to do \nis open any newspaper--I don't care whether it is a liberal or \nconservative one or independent or moderate--and you know what is \nhappening on the ground all over the world. You see it. From Darfur to \nAfghanistan to Iraq to Iran to North Korea to London--where, thank God \nthey foiled the plot of the terrorists there.\n  Instead of saying maybe it is time we just look at our priorities and \ndo a little bit more--we all know in America that the war on terror is \ngoing to be with us. We all know we have to be prepared. We all know \nthey do not give up. We all know they will try again. We all know al-\nQaida is still out there, with bin Laden--but even if it didn't have \nbin Laden, it would still be out there. Yet what does Secretary \nRumsfeld do? He starts a fight by calling the American people, who do \nnot agree with him--the majority, vast majority--appeasers when they \nunderstand very clearly that the war in Iraq is a diversion from the \nwar on terrorism and that we are failing on the war on terrorism \nbecause we have not invested in it and haven't focused on it. The \nAmerican people want us to do that. It is time for a new direction.\n  I brought to the attention of the Senate the threat from shoulder-\nfired missiles. Two dozen terrorist organizations have them. They sit \non the shoulder, they weigh 35 pounds, and they can catch an airplane. \nOh, they are slow-walking that. They just don't have the money. They \ntested it, but they are slow-walking it.\n  It is time for accountability. I do not think staying the course with \na failing policy in Iraq has anything to do with appeasing the Nazis \nbefore World War II. Get with the current moment, Mr. Secretary and Mr. \nPresident. Let's get a fresh face over at the Department of Defense. \nLet's move forward with hope. Let's move forward with a plan. Let's win \nback the confidence of the American people together, all of us. And \nlet's win back the confidence of the world.\n  I believe it starts with accountability. That is why I plan to \nsupport an amendment that will be offered to this bill calling for new \nleadership at the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, before the time arrives for \nconsideration of the judicial nominee, I ask unanimous consent to \nproceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8932-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8932-S8933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SUDAN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to forcefully \nexpress themselves, to urge and perhaps even compel the Government of \nthe Sudan to proceed to accept a United Nations peacekeeping force of \nsome 20,000 to bring stability to that area. We have seen a drastic \nsituation evolve where some 3 million people have been displaced--\nperhaps a few more, perhaps a few less--and some 300,000 have been \nkilled. The fighting goes on between the Government of Sudan and the \nrebels.\n  And the prospects are for additional bloodshed and significant \ndisplacement of refugees are great unless there is some forceful action \ntaken by the United Nations.\n  The proposal has been made to have 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers deploy to \nDarfur to try to stabilize the situation. Regrettably, this has been \nrejected by the Government of Sudan.\n  Just today, the New York Times reports that the Government of Sudan \nhas given the African Union an ultimatum--either proceed under the \nterms of the Government of Sudan, which is characterized by the news \nreport as ``blackmail,'' or for the African force of some 7,000 \nproposed peacekeepers--they really are ineffectual in the job--to \nvacate the country by September 30.\n  I participated last Thursday, August 31, in a forum in the Trinity \nCathedral in downtown Pittsburgh where concerned citizens gathered to \ndecry the situation, to urge United Nations' action. The following day, \nI wrote to the President requesting that a Special Envoy to Sudan be \nappointed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to President Bush, dated \nSeptember 1, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The President, the White House,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I write to express my support for your \n     efforts to bring an end to the ongoing crisis in the Darfur \n     region of Sudan and to urge the immediate appointment of a \n     Special Envoy to Sudan.\n       I commend the hard work of your Administration to achieve \n     the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), which was signed by the \n     government of Sudan and the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) \n     faction led by Minni Arku Minnawi on May 5, 2006. I also \n     applaud your efforts to mobilize international support for \n     the deployment of a United Nations (U.N.) peacekeeping force \n     to replace the African Union (A.U.) force currently in the \n     region. I believe the DPA and deployment of a U.N. force are \n     important steps towards ending the crisis in Darfur, which to \n     date has led to over 200,000 deaths and 2 million people \n     displaced from their homes and dependent on international aid \n     agencies for survival.\n       Unfortunately, the refusal of many rebel groups to sign the \n     DPA, the limited capabilities of the A.U. peacekeepers, and \n     rejection by the government of Sudan of the deployment of a \n     U.N. force, has led to continued violence and further \n     deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Darfur. In \n     July, the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) reported that more \n     than 470,000 of 2.8 million planned beneficiaries did not \n     receive food assistance due to the deteriorating security \n     conditions. To make matters worse, reports indicate that the \n     government of Sudan is preparing a renewed assault against \n     rebel groups that remain outside the DPA. Aid officials, \n     cited in a August 31, 2006 article in The New York Times, \n     stated that a military offensive in Darfur could lead to the \n     ``complete evacuation of humanitarian workers in Northern \n     Darfur, which would leave millions without a lifeline'' and \n     that the resulting loss of life ``could dwarf the killings in \n     2003 and 2004''.\n       The DPA was signed in great measure due to the work of \n     then-Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick. However, in \n     light of his resignation and the fragility of the prospects \n     for a sustainable peace in Darfur, I urge that you \n     immediately appoint a Special Envoy to Sudan. With so many \n     lives hanging in the balance, it is vital that the U.S. \n     demonstrate its commitment at the highest level to the \n     success of the Darfur peace process. I believe the \n     appointment of a Special Envoy, charged to proactively work \n     with all parties to fully implement the DPA and secure the \n     deployment of a U.N. force represents the best prospect for \n     avoiding further catastrophe in Darfur.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a report \nof USA Today, dated August 31, be printed in the Record. The headline \nis ``U.S. Reporter's Arrest Shows Sudan Has Something To Hide.'' The \nreporter was arrested because he reported the truth which the \nGovernment of Sudan is trying to conceal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Aug. 31, 2006]\n\n        U.S. Reporter's Arrest Shows Sudan Has Something To Hide\n\n       The great journalists, writer Pete Hamill has said, are \n     ``men and women who take a torch to the back of a cave and \n     report what they see to the rest of the tribe.''\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\n       One of the darkest places on earth today is the war-torn \n     Darfur region of Sudan, where at least 200,000 people have \n     been killed and 3 million rendered homeless since 2003.\n       Award-winning U.S. reporter Paul Salopek was simply trying \n     to illuminate the situation there when he was detained \n     earlier this month, jailed and accused of espionage and \n     writing ``false news.''\n       Looking for the truth in places such as Darfur, where truth \n     is in short supply and needed so much, is a dangerous \n     business. From 2001 through '05, 202 journalists were killed \n     on duty, up from 136 in the prior five years, according to \n     the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n       If it weren't for reporters like Salopek, the world would \n     know little more than the twisted stories put out by the \n     Sudanese government about the genocide in Darfur. His arrest \n     is just one more of Sudan's increasingly shameless efforts to \n     keep outsiders from reporting on--or doing something to end--\n     the killings and mass rapes. Those government efforts range \n     from shutting down many aid operations to refusing to accept \n     a force of United Nations peacekeepers.\n       Similar attempts to bottle up truth or use journalists as \n     pawns are common:\n       In China, Zhao Yan, a Chinese researcher for The New York \n     Times, was jailed in 2004 on charges of leaking state \n     secrets. He was acquitted of those charges last week but \n     sentenced to three years in prison on an unrelated charge. \n     Times executive editor Bill Keller said the only thing Zhao \n     ``committed is journalism.''\n       In the Middle East, U.S. journalists have become targets. \n     Two Fox News journalists were snatched by militants in Gaza \n     and held for two harrowing weeks before their release Sunday. \n     Their concern? That the incident would deter others: ``I hope \n     that this never scares a single journalist away from coming \n     to Gaza to cover the story,'' said reporter Steve Centanni \n     after his release.\n       Given the risks, even the severest press critic would \n     concede that reporters' willingness to venture into the \n     deepest caves is a courageous public service.\n       That's all that Salopek was doing. A Chicago Tribune \n     reporter on a freelance assignment for National Geographic, \n     he sneaked across the Sudanese border from Chad without a \n     visa. For reporters, that's about the only way to get in. \n     Usually when they are caught, they are deported.\n       This time, Sudan apparently chose to make a point. It did--\n     that its claims about Darfur are not credible. The State \n     Department and others are pressing Sudan to set Salopek free.\n       Salopek is anything but a spy. He is a veteran reporter who \n     has won journalism's highest honor twice. And, unfortunately, \n     he is the latest victim of those who seek to keep the public \n     in the dark.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my \nprepared written remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Senator Arlen Specter\n\n\n                     the situation in darfur, sudan\n\n        Mr. President, I seek recognition today to call attention \n     to the continuing crisis in Darfur, Sudan. Tensions are not \n     new to this drought plagued region where Arabic nomads and \n     African farmers have long competed for land and resources. \n     However, the current crisis began in February 2003 when two \n     non-Arab Darfur rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Army and \n     the Justice and Equality Movement, rose up against Sudan's \n     Arab dominated government, demanding the same resource and \n     power-sharing concessions being offered to rebels in southern \n     Sudan who were then engaged in peace talks to end a separate \n     conflict with the Government in Khartoum.\n       The response from the Government of Sudan was swift and \n     brutal. An estimated 200,000 Sudanese refugees fled to \n     neighboring Chad telling of a scorched earth campaign being \n     carried out by armed militias, known as the Janjaweed, \n     supported by the Government of Sudan. While the Government \n     bombarded villages from the air, militias followed on the \n     ground murdering men and children, raping and branding women, \n     and pillaging and burning homes.\n       The House and Senate declared the atrocities in Darfur \n     ``genocide'' in July 2004. Former Secretary of State Colin \n     Powell, in remarks before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee on September 9, 2004, stated that, ``genocide has \n     been committed in Darfur and the Government of Sudan and the \n     Janjaweed bear responsibility.'' Further, the International \n     Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, in its January 25, 2005 \n     report to Secretary General Kofi Annan, found that, ``the \n     Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed are responsible for \n     serious violations of international human rights and \n     humanitarian law amounting to crimes under international \n     law.''\n       Today, the situation in Sudan represents the worst \n     humanitarian crisis facing the world. Since the start of the \n     conflict, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n     estimates that 350,000 people have died in the region as a \n     result of violence, disease or starvation. In addition, \n     according to the United States Agency for International \n     Development, the crisis has resulted in 1.8 million people \n     displaced from their homes and dependent on aid agencies for \n     survival.\n       Due to continued pressure by the U.S. Government, in \n     particular the efforts of former Deputy Secretary of State \n     Robert Zoellick, the government of Sudan and the strongest \n     faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army signed the Darfur \n     Peace Agreement on May 4, 2006. Under the terms of the Darfur \n     Peace Agreement, the Janjaweed militias are to be disarmed, \n     rebel fighters are to be integrated into Sudan's national \n     forces or provided with the support necessary to assist their \n     return to civilian life, measures are to be implemented to \n     increase security for displaced persons and refugees, power \n     and wealth sharing mechanisms are to be established at the \n     national and local levels, and the Sudanese government is to \n     provide Darfur with robust reconstruction assistance \n     amounting to $700 million.\n       Unfortunately, the Justice and Equality Movement and a \n     smaller rebel group formerly part of the Sudan Liberation \n     Army did not sign the agreement, the Janjaweed has not been \n     disarmed and violence persists resulting in the continued \n     deterioration of the humanitarian and security situation.\n       I believe the Darfur Peace Agreement and deployment of a \n     United Nations force are important steps towards ending the \n     crisis in Darfur. I applaud U.S. efforts to mobilize \n     international support for the deployment of a U.N. \n     peacekeeping force to replace the African Union force \n     currently in the region. The African Union has a 7,500 \n     peacekeeping force deployed in Darfur. However, The African \n     Union force is slow, poorly equipped and too small. Moreover, \n     this force is quickly running out of funding and has a \n     limited mandate that allows it to monitor but not enforce the \n     cease-fire agreement.\n       On September 1, 2006 the U.N. Security Council approved a \n     resolution authorizing the deployment of a U.N. military \n     force of up to 17,300 members and a civilian police force of \n     3,300 with a Chapter VII mandate authorizing the use of force \n     to protect civilians, relief workers and U.N. workers. \n     Regrettably, the Government of Sudan has refused to accept a \n     U.N. deployment. In a statement reported by the New York \n     Times on August 22, 2006, Sudan's President, Omar Hassan al-\n     Bashir, seemed to suggest he would resist such a deployment \n     with force when he stated Sudan would ``defeat any forces \n     entering the country just as Hezbollah has defeated the \n     Israeli forces.''\n       On August 31, 2006, I attended a rally at the Trinity \n     Cathedral in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania sponsored by the \n     Pittsburgh Darfur Emergency Coalition to call attention to \n     the crisis in Darfur. The following day, I wrote to President \n     Bush urging he appoint a Special Envoy to Sudan. With so many \n     lives hanging in the balance, it is vital that the U.S. \n     demonstrate its commitment at the highest level to resolving \n     the Darfur crisis. I believe the appointment of a Special \n     Envoy, charged to proactively work with all parties to fully \n     implement the Darfur Peace Agreement and secure the \n     deployment of a U.N. force represents the best prospect for \n     avoiding further catastrophe in Darfur.\n       The crisis in Darfur can not be ignored. The international \n     community must be allowed to take action before the situation \n     deteriorates further. I urge the Administration to appoint a \n     Special Envoy to Sudan to work with all parties to bring an \n     end to the crisis, and urge the Government of Sudan to allow \n     the deployment of a U.N. force.\n       I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, before proceeding to the nomination of \nKimberly Ann Moore to be U.S. circuit judge for the Federal Circuit, I \nask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 10 minutes as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8933-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8933-S8944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REPORT ON FOREIGN TRAVEL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, at the conclusion of these brief \nremarks, I ask unanimous consent that a full text of my report on \nforeign travel be printed in the record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit I.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, as is my custom, when I return from \nforeign travel, I file a report with the Senate.\n  From August 5 to August 24, I traveled abroad. I started with a \ndelegation led by Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Dan Inouye to China \nwhere eight U.S. Senators participated in a forum with Parliamentarians \nfrom China. We discussed a broad range of issues, with the Chinese \ndelegation being very forceful on their concern about the one-nation \npolicy, that Taiwan not be\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\nregarded as an independent nation. We had extensive discussions about \nthe economic imbalance which exists in trade, on the manipulation by \nthe Government of China of its currency, and on the issue of human \nrights.\n  I raised with the Chinese officials the issue of human rights \nstarting with the incident in 1999 where the Dickinson law librarian in \nPennsylvania was kept in custody for some 7 months without being able \nto see a lawyer, and without being able to see his wife.\n  Following that, an appropriation was made for approximately $2 \nmillion in each of the past several years for Temple University to \nestablish in Beijing a law school to teach human rights, with a focus \non Chinese judges, Chinese professors, and Chinese lawyers.\n  During the trip to Beijing, I met with almost 50 of the students at \nthe school--some judges, some lawyers, and some academics--where there \nwas a concern to understand due process of law. I was pleased to hear \nsome reports that there has been an improvement in some situations on \nfiling charges, on the access of counsel. I believe the school of law \nestablished by Temple University in Beijing is very useful. But I \nthink, realistically, they have a very long way to go.\n  From China, I then set out to Nepal, visited Katmandu, and spoke to \nthe Prime Minister, who has had a very difficult time. There was a \ngreat deal of unrest in the country following the King's taking power \nfrom the elected government. Following strong public resistance and \nmarches, the King stepped down. Seven political parties are trying to \ngo through the formation of a new government.\n  They are being challenged by malice, with an overriding concern about \nthe possibility of violence there.\n  I discussed a major situation where there are more than 100,000 \nrefugees in Nepal originating from neighboring Bhutan. I traveled next \nto Bhutan, which is a remarkable country situated between Nepal and \nTibet. James Hilton's famous book, ``Lost Horizon,'' locates the \nidyllic spot, Shangri-La, with fantasy, in Bhutan or in Tibet.\n  Bhutan is a country of about 700,000 people. It was totally isolated \nuntil 1950 when the King invited in foreigners. It was said that up \nuntil that time they lived in a medieval state. Now there is a King, \n51--very progressive, who has not waited for popular unrest to oust \nhim. But they are moving ahead with the formation of a constitution--\nand a very unique constitution where they are concerned about the gross \nnational happiness product as opposed to the gross domestic product.\n  I had a lengthy discussion with the King about setting up a \nconstitution where the monarch must step aside at the age of 68. Bhutan \nis being modernized.\n  The road from the airport city to the main city, Thimpu, is 60 \nkilometers of treacherous highway road. But it is a remarkable country.\n  There I talked to the Chief Justice of Bhutan. I talked to him about \nthe formation of their constitution as I had done in Nepal. The issue \nof a constitution is one which is spreading around the world, with \nconsiderable modeling after the Constitution of the United States which \nwas, as we know, the first complete written constitution.\n  From Bhutan, I then traveled to Kuwait. I met with the Emir of Kuwait \nand with the Prime Minister and had extensive discussions about the \nconcerns of the nuclear activities in neighboring Iran. We spent just \nan overnight there and then on to Israel. Regrettably, we had to make a \nstop in Cyprus. The rules are, if you come from an Arab country you \ncan't fly directly to Israel, just as we cannot fly directly from \nIsrael to Libya. But we had to make a stop in Cyprus, and coming from \nKuwait, we had to make a stop in Amman, Jordan, before going on to \nIsrael.\n  In Israel, we met with Prime Minister Olmert and with Defense \nMinister Perez. We reviewed the situation and our findings there are \nset out more extensively in the written report.\n  From Israel, we traveled on to Libya and saw a remarkable \ntransformation of Libya and Libya's leader, Colonel Qadhafi. I think \nthere has been a historic rehabilitation of the nation of Libya and the \nleader, Colonel Qadhafi, where they have moved from being the world's \nleading terrorist state in very heavy competition, at least at the time \nthey blew up Pan Am flight 103 back in 1988 and blew up the German \ndiscotheque killing U.S. soldiers and wounding many more.\n  We had an opportunity to meet Colonel Qadhafi. We took a plane flight \nfrom Tripoli for a couple of hours, moved on to the middle of the \ndesert, met with him in his tent, and had a discussion with him looking \nfor some guidance as to how a major world terrorist could rehabilitate, \npay compensation, as to whether there could be any insight as to what \nwe might do with North Korea and Iran today.\n  Regrettably, those problems are beyond anyone's solution, but the \nrehabilitation of Libya and Qadhafi showed that there is some hope to \nturn major terrorists into a rehabilitated situation.\n  We then flew overnight to China and returned to the United States. As \nI said, the details are set forth in the extensive written report which \nfollows the conclusion of these extemporaneous comments.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       Statement of Arlen Specter\n\n\n                        REPORT ON FOREIGN TRAVEL\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to report on \n     foreign travel, as is my custom, from August 5 to August 24, \n     2006. On August 5, I joined a delegation led by Senator Ted \n     Stevens which departed from Andrews Air Force Base at 11:00 \n     a.m. en route to Guilin, China, via Beijing to participate in \n     the Untied States-China interparliamentary conference. \n     Senator Stevens is the Chairman of that conference and \n     Senator Daniel Inouye is the co-chairman. Senator Patty \n     Murray and Senator Norm Coleman serve as vice-chairmen. In \n     addition, the delegation consisted of Senator Thad Cochran, \n     Senator Mark Dayton, Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator \n     Richard Burr.\n       Our first stop was Anchorage, Alaska where we landed at \n     Elmendorf Air Force Base after a flight of 7 hours. After \n     dinner and overnighting at the Captain Cook Hotel, we \n     departed for Beijing the next morning, August 6, at 9:00 a.m. \n     We passed the international date line and arrived in Beijing \n     at about 9:00 a.m. Beijing time on Tuesday, August 7. We then \n     flew an additional 3 hours to Guilin where the conference was \n     held. Most of us decided to stay up for the balance of the \n     day although we had already been up some 24 hours to try to \n     get on our regular body clock schedule. Joan and I took a \n     long walk, visited the town, had an early dinner, and \n     retired. It is always difficult to get much sleep on the \n     first night, but we awoke somewhat refreshed.\n       On the morning of Tuesday, August 8, we took a trip on the \n     Li River hosted by the interparliamentary group's Chairman, \n     Sheng Hauren. It was a magnificent boat trip. The area is \n     heralded as one of the China's most extraordinary scenic \n     spots. With lunch being served onboard, it provided an \n     opportunity for extensive informal discussion with our \n     Chinese hosts.\n       Chairman Sheng Hauren was a charming host in his mid-60s \n     with a full head of gray hair, portly, with a perpetual smile \n     and an easygoing disposition. I told him of my special \n     interest in human rights in China arising out of an incident \n     where a librarian from Dickinson College, Mr. Yongyi Song, \n     was detained by Chinese officials in 1999. Mr. Song was born \n     in China and immigrated to the United States where he was \n     about to fulfill his requirements for citizenship when he \n     returned to China for research. He was arrested, held for 7 \n     months without an opportunity to see counsel or even his \n     wife. No charges were brought against him and no hearing had \n     been set when it was called to my attention.\n       I filed a Senate resolution reciting the facts, condemning \n     the process which lacked even the fundamentals of due process \n     of law and urged his release. Shortly after filing the \n     petition, I was summoned by the Chinese Ambassador to the \n     United States to meet with him. It was a testy meeting with \n     the Ambassador beginning by challenging me for meddling in \n     internal Chinese affairs. I responded politely but forcefully \n     that it was hardly meddling in Chinese internal affairs when \n     they detained a Pennsylvanian under the circumstances noted \n     without any basic rights. I emphasized that I had great \n     respect for China, a powerful country of 1 billion, 250 \n     million people at which point I was interrupted by the \n     Ambassador who said: ``please Senator, 1 billion, 300 million \n     people.'' From the time I had last checked the Chinese \n     statistics they had gained about 50 million people, about the \n     population of France. We continued to discuss the matter when \n     the Ambassador notified me that Mr. Song was about to be \n     released and would be arriving by air in Philadelphia in a \n     few days.\n       I told Chairman Sheng Hauren about this incident as a \n     primer to discussing with him the action taken as a result of \n     the detention of Mr. Song. I introduced legislation to \n     appropriate approximately 2 million dollars to establish a \n     branch of the Temple Law School in Beijing to teach judges, \n     prosecutors, academics and students the fundamentals of due \n     process of law. Chairman Sheng Hauren listened politely and \n     said, of course, that he knew nothing about the specifics of \n     the case I cited. He said that with the developing\n\n[[Page S8935]]\n\n     country in China and the need for civil order there were \n     occasions where arrests were made which might seem extreme to \n     foreigners. I did not press the matter further, but I already \n     made my point about being concerned about human rights and \n     the rights of detainees in China.\n       I asked Chairman Sheng Huaren about the relative authority \n     of the Chinese courts compared to the Executive Branch or the \n     National People's Congress. Chairman Sheng Huaren replied \n     that after the Supreme Court of China had ruled, their \n     decisions could be overturned by National People's Congress. \n     I replied that it was exactly the opposite in the United \n     States where the Supreme Court had the final word in deciding \n     the constitutionality of congressional enactments and the \n     Supreme Court had the authority to overrule the President's \n     exercise of executive power as the court has recently done in \n     the celebrated case of Hamdan v Rumsfeld when the Supreme \n     Court ruled the President did not have the authority to set \n     the rules of the trials of war criminals.\n       I asked Chairman Sheng Huaren why there had been so much \n     more economic development in China contrasted with India \n     which had a population almost as large, one billion compared \n     to 1.3 billion, and the government of India had the benefit \n     of democratic institutions which would have been expected to \n     produce more individual initiatives. Chairman Sheng Huaren \n     replied that China had enjoyed greater success because of \n     China's planning and the diversification of ownership. He \n     pointed out that early on in China, employees had an interest \n     in ownership. He noted that there had been planning between \n     urban and rural areas with special attention being devoted to \n     agriculture as the primary industry with secondary attention \n     to manufacturing and beyond that the service industry. The \n     Chairman emphasized that there had been a special effort made \n     in China to achieve a harmonious social society which \n     promoted productivity and economic advancement.\n       The boat ride ended mid-afternoon and we docked at a nearby \n     town where shopping was available and then drove back to \n     Guilin. The Chairman hosted a dinner that evening in a \n     magnificent dinning hall which was part of the large \n     conference center. The full delegation and spouses and staff \n     were present with almost 100 people in attendance for the \n     customary Chinese eight course dinner.\n       The next morning, the delegates arrived for the traditional \n     photo session with the two hour morning program beginning at \n     9:30 AM. The topics which had been agreed upon were bilateral \n     relations and trade and investment. After a break for lunch, \n     again sumptuous, the afternoon session began at 2:00 PM and \n     ran until approximately 4:00 PM with international security \n     and energy as the topics.\n       The tone of the meeting was very cordial. Senator Inouye \n     drew a laugh when he said it was better to talk than to \n     shoot. Chairman Sheng Huaren got down to business promptly \n     raising the issue of Taiwan which is very much on the minds \n     of the Chinese. Chairman Sheng Huaren stated that he \n     appreciated the reiteration of our one China policy and China \n     was totally opposed to unilateral action meaning any effort \n     by Taiwan to break away from China.\n       At one point in the conference, Senator Stevens reiterated \n     that the United States stood behind the one China policy and \n     added, prefacing his remarks that it was intended to be in \n     the friendly constructive spirit, that the Chinese were \n     preoccupied with the one China issue. Senator Stevens noted \n     China was soon to play host to the 2008 Olympics which has \n     the promise to be the greatest Olympics ever and that event \n     should not be marred or spoiled by any military action \n     between China and Taiwan. The Chinese delegation appeared to \n     take the comments in good spirit and gave no specific reply.\n       Senator Stevens said that the 21st century should be the \n     century of the Pacific and noted that the United States was \n     proposing an interparliamentary meeting with Japan and that \n     if that took root as the U.S.-Chinese group had, that they \n     might look forward to having the three major powers, the \n     U.S., China and Japan, join together to discuss the issues of \n     the Pacific. Senator Stevens pointed to the damage to plant \n     life and the threat to extinguishing species of fishes and \n     the air control over the pacific and the problems generally \n     with the water supply. The Chinese delegates emphasized the \n     enormous need for economic development in China with its \n     expanding population and the need to create millions of jobs \n     each year.\n       On the morning of August 11th, I broke from the delegation \n     to speak to a group of students, lawyers and judges at \n     Tsinghua University outside Beijing. The Yongyi Song case in \n     1999 illustrated the lack of a transparent and fair legal \n     system in China. Since 2000, I worked to advance the rule of \n     law in China through Temple University's Rule of Law program \n     at Tsinghua Law School and approximately $2 million has been \n     secured annually for the program. During a prior visit to \n     China in 2001, I suggested to Premier Zhu Rong-ji that the \n     Chinese government work with Temple's program to develop an \n     agreement with the U.S. dealing with due process rights for \n     detained American citizens. That is still a work in progress.\n       Upon arrival at Tsinghua, I was met by Temple professor \n     John Snagoola who provided an update on the program. Temple \n     has educated 612 legal professionals of whom 494 were from \n     the public sector including 184 judges, 107 prosecutors, 59 \n     government officials, 97 law professors and 47 NGO legal \n     staff.\n       I was received in the law school's lecture hall by 48 \n     students and a panel of eight professors. I spoke to the \n     students about a wide variety of judicial and constitutional \n     issues being debated in the United States including the \n     detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and the NSA wiretapping \n     program. I explained to the students the importance of the \n     rule of law in American society and that no man is above the \n     law. I highlighted the benefits of a system where the accused \n     have the right to counsel, to a trial and to know why they \n     are being detained.\n       I elaborated on the role of the courts as the final arbiter \n     and that neither the Congress nor the President could \n     overrule the courts. In contrast, the National People's \n     Congress of China supersedes any decision made by the courts. \n     The hour-long session provided ample time for dialogue with \n     the students. They asked a variety of questions with \n     special attention to civil liberties, national security, \n     medical care for women, same sex marriage and the war in \n     Iraq.\n       I ask unanimous consent that the Special Report on Temple \n     Students compiled by the Beasley School of Law and letters \n     supporting the program be included in the record.\n       I rejoined the delegation later that afternoon for a \n     meeting with Wu Banggou, Chairman of the National People's \n     Congress, at the Great Hall of the People. Our conversations \n     included a wide range of issues including national security, \n     weapons proliferation and trade. Following the meeting, \n     Chairman Wu hosted a banquet for all members of the \n     delegation at the Great Hall of the People.\n       On August 12th, the delegation returned to the Great Hall \n     of the People for a meeting with President Hu Jintao. Many of \n     the issues raised during the visit were discussed during the \n     meeting. I specifically pressed President Hu about arms \n     transfers to Iran and China's efforts to ensure they are not \n     being transferred to third parties. I did not receive a \n     sufficient response.\n       While my colleagues returned to the United States on August \n     12th, I traveled on to Kathmandu, Nepal. Prior to departing \n     from Beijing, I was joined by my aide Christopher Bradish, \n     Lieutenant Colonel Donald Walker, United States Army, and Dr. \n     Ron Smith, United States Navy.\n\n\n                                 NEPAL\n\n       From Beijing, I traveled to Kathmandu, Nepal where I was \n     met by Ambassador Bill Moriarty who provided me with insight \n     into Nepal's political situation and its struggle for \n     democracy. In June 2001 ten members of the royal family, \n     including King Birendra, were killed in an assassination-\n     suicide, reportedly carried out by Crown Prince Dipendra. The \n     murdered king's younger brother, Gyanendra, now occupies the \n     throne. Nepal's recent history has been characterized by a \n     power struggle between the monarchy, political parties, and a \n     Maoist insurgency.\n       In 1990, following a democratization movement, Nepal became \n     a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch. In \n     a reversal of the longer-term trend towards a democratic \n     constitutional monarchy, on February 1, 2005, King Gyanendra \n     declared a state of emergency, assumed full powers, suspended \n     civil liberties, and placed opposition leaders under arrest. \n     The King explained his move as necessary, because of the \n     elected government's inability to put down the Maoist \n     insurgency. However, most analysts saw the move as an attempt \n     to also assert control over the country's democratic \n     elements.\n       In response to the King's actions, Nepal's seven main \n     political parties announced they would work together to \n     reform the constitution, reinstate parliament, and limit the \n     powers of the king. Mutual rejection of the King's power grab \n     also led the parties to seek rapprochement with the Maoist \n     insurgents. In April 2006, popular anger at the King's abuse \n     of power resulted in three weeks of massive demonstrations \n     across the country and broad public support for a nationwide \n     general strike called by the coalition of political parties, \n     and backed by the Maoists.\n       After unsuccessfully attempting to forcefully suppress the \n     demonstrations, the King announced the reinstatement of \n     Parliament on April 26, 2006. The Parliament has since taken \n     action to strip the King of his political and military \n     powers, reciprocated a Maoist cease-fire, and released \n     hundreds of guerrillas, including some of their top leaders, \n     from jail. In talks with the Maoists, the Parliament has also \n     agreed to the writing of an interim constitution, to the \n     formation of an interim government, and to hold new \n     elections.\n       In February 1996, the leaders of the underground Communist \n     Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the United People's Front (UPF) \n     launched a ``People's War'' in the Midwestern region of \n     Nepal, with the aim of replacing the constitutional monarchy \n     with a one-party Communist regime. The insurgency has claimed \n     the lives of approximately 13,000 people. With an estimated \n     5,000-10,000 armed fighters utilizing guerrilla warfare \n     tactics including murder, torture, arson, sabotage, \n     extortion, child conscription, kidnapping, bombings, and \n     assassinations, the Maoists were able to establish a parallel \n     government to rule over substantial proportions of Nepal. A \n     string of bank robberies, combined with ``revolutionary tax'' \n     revenues, made the Nepalese Maoists among the wealthiest \n     rebel groups in Asia.\n\n[[Page S8936]]\n\n       Following the King's 2005 seizure of power, the Maoists \n     joined with Nepal's seven major political parties in \n     resisting the King's control of government. After the \n     restoration of Parliament, the Maoists offered the government \n     a cease fire and entered talks to join the government. In \n     June, the Maoists leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as \n     ``Prachanda,'' agreed to dismantle the parallel government, \n     but refused to disarm until after elections are held for \n     constituent assembly to draft a new constitution. The Maoists \n     have offered to sequester their arms and men under \n     international supervision, provided the Nepalese military \n     does the same.\n       The Maoists' message has included bellicose and anti-\n     American rhetoric. In 2002, the Maoists claimed \n     responsibility for killing two off-duty Nepalese security \n     guards at the American Embassy in Kathmandu. On October 22, \n     2003, the Maoists stated that American-backed organizations \n     would be targeted for attack. The State Department does not \n     list the Maoists/UPF as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. \n     However, the Department's 2005 Country Reports on Terrorism \n     does list the groups amongst its list of ``Other Groups of \n     Concern.''\n       In a statement before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee's Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian \n     Affairs on May 18, 2006, Assistant Secretary of State for \n     South and Central Asian Affairs Richard Boucher highlighted \n     that the Maoists have not renounced violence, nor agreed to \n     disarm. He further noted that the Maoists originally took up \n     arms in 1996 against an elected government and that Maoists \n     human rights abuses continue to be reported. He stated that \n     until the group renounces violence and shows respect for \n     human rights, the Administration ``will not be convinced that \n     they have abandoned their stated goal of establishing a one-\n     party, authoritarian state.''\n       Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. Up to \n     90 percent of its inhabitants earn a living through \n     agriculture. Continued reliance on subsistence farming could \n     keep Nepal poor for many years to come. Government efforts to \n     increase foreign trade and investment have been impeded by \n     political instability, the small size of the economy, its \n     remoteness, a lack of infrastructure and technological \n     development, and frequent natural disasters. Future economic \n     prospects will likely be influenced by the outcome of the \n     negotiations underway between the Parliament and Maoists.\n       On August 13th, I met with Prime Minister Koriala for 45 \n     minutes. Prime Minister Koriala expressed his gratitude for \n     U.S. financial assistance and that it aided in stabilizing \n     the government. He stressed his strong support for democracy \n     and emphasized that unless the Maoists give up their weapons \n     they could not joint the government. Koriala hoped that the \n     United Nations would be brought in to resolve Nepal's \n     internal conflict.\n       Prime Minister Koriala had been jailed on several occasions \n     throughout his life for his political activities. These \n     sentences accounted for fourteen years of his life. Koriala \n     informed me that his life's goal was to bring all non-\n     democratic elements, including the Maoists, into a \n     constitutional democracy, stating that he would never \n     surrender a democratic government to anyone. Koriala informed \n     me that he would succeed in order for terrorists all over the \n     world to learn from Nepal's example that dialogue was the \n     best way to solve disputes.\n       Prime Minster Koriala said he favors a ceremonial monarchy \n     because it had been a unifying factor in Nepal since 1769. He \n     noted that, unless the Maoists gave up their weapons, the \n     interim constitutional drafting committee could not consider \n     the Maoist's suggestions, adding that their proposals for a \n     republic based on ethnic regions could fragment and \n     destabilize Nepal.\n       PM Koriala expressed his concern about the Maoist's \n     intentions, especially as they have not given up their \n     weapons. Koriala informed me that they are still extorting \n     and collecting taxes from citizens despite their signing of \n     the 25-point code of conduct in which they agreed to stop \n     these activities. Many representatives I met with expressed \n     skepticism about the Maoists ability to implement what they \n     agree to do.\n       Following my meeting with the Prime Minister, I met with \n     Subash Nemwang, Speaker of the House. The Speaker reiterated \n     the position of the Prime Minister that Maoists will not be \n     permitted to enter into any form of interim government until \n     they are disarmed. Speaker Nemwang expressed his desire to \n     see the Maoists repudiate violence and join the democratic \n     political process.\n       I then met with the Home Minister Krishna Prasad Situala \n     who is also the point person on the Government of Nepal's \n     peace talks. The Home Minister expressed hope that the \n     Maoists could be brought peacefully into the political \n     mainstream, but warned that the Maoists had not lived up to \n     the pledges made in negotiations. He stressed the importance \n     between Nepal moving towards a successful democracy and the \n     need to have the Maoists disarmed. He believes that the \n     United Nations could playa positive role in facilitating the \n     transition to democracy. I urged the Home Minister, in his \n     role as chief negotiator, to be firm and tough with the \n     Maoists, whose actions are similar to those of thugs.\n       Nepal has formed a Peace Secretariat, a think tank of \n     sorts, to advise the government on how to transition to \n     democracy. I met with the head of that agency, Vidyadhar \n     Malik, who also expressed an interest in having the UN \n     involved in Nepal. The Peace Secretariat believes the UN \n     could be able to provide some best practices options for \n     Nepal on how to ensure arms are not part of the political \n     equation.\n       Armed groups or political parties cannot be permitted to \n     participate in government unless they disarm. Hezbollah and \n     Hamas, both terrorist organizations, were permitted to \n     participate in government much to the detriment of citizens \n     in the region. During my conversation with Mallik and other \n     leaders, it became clear that were the Maoists to come to \n     power, Nepal would be more unstable and ruled through \n     intimidation and fear.\n       I was invited to the Ambassador's residence for a \n     roundtable discussion and lunch with the leaders of the \n     various Nepalese political parties. Attendees included: Sher \n     Bahadur Dueba, former Prime Minister and President of the \n     Nepali Congress, Madhav Kumar Nepal, General Secretary of the \n     Communist party, Ram Chandra Poudel, General Secretary of the \n     Nepali Congress party, Narayan Man Bijukche, President of the \n     Nepal Workers and Peasants party, Prakash Man Singh, Vice \n     President of the Nepali Congress, Chandra Prakash Mainali, \n     General Secretary of the Socialist party, Jhalanath Khanal, \n     Central Committee Member of the Communist party, Arjun \n     Narsingh, Central Committee Member of the Nepali Congress \n     party and Lilamani Pokhrel, Vice President of the People's \n     Front. We had a candid discussion about the parties efforts \n     to work together to confront the Maoists and the prospects \n     for a democratic Nepal.\n       Later that day, the Ambassador invited me to a dinner \n     reception at his residence where there were roughly seventy \n     political party leaders, civil society representatives, human \n     rights and women's rights activists. I had the opportunity to \n     engage in dialogue with many of those in attendance about the \n     status of Nepal and the prospects for stability. Many of the \n     leaders expressed their appreciation to me for coming to \n     Nepal and the support the U.S. has provided the country.\n\n\n                                 BHUTAN\n\n       On Monday, August 14th, we departed Kathmandu en route \n     Thimphu, Bhutan. Due to the mountainous terrain of Bhutan, we \n     had to take the Royal Druk Airline whose pilots are the only \n     ones permitted to fly into Bhutan. From the Paro airport we \n     took the windy ninety minute drive to the capital, Thimphu.\n       Bhutan is the world's last Buddhist kingdom. Although the \n     government places a heavy influence on the preservation of \n     its Tibetan Buddhist culture, Bhutan is slowly emerging from \n     self imposed international isolation and is in the process of \n     evolving into a constitutional monarchy with a \n     representative government.\n       The U.S. and Bhutan have not established formal diplomatic \n     relations; however, relations between the two governments are \n     cordial. The Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy in \n     New Delhi administers the International Visitor (IV) and \n     Fulbright Exchange Programs for Bhutan. There are currently \n     sixty-seven Bhutanese alumni of the IV program including \n     Bhutan's Chief Justice, three Ministers, and six District \n     Governors. Thirty-three Bhutanese nationals have received \n     undergraduate degrees in engineering and the sciences through \n     the Fulbright Exchange Program. Most alumni now head \n     technical corporations working on infrastructure development \n     at Bhutan's regional level.\n       The following morning, I met with Prime Minister Sangay \n     Ngedup. The Prime Minister began by expressing his \n     appreciation for the United States as a great democracy and \n     global leader. He also informed me that Bhutan is going \n     through a lot of changes. Most notably, the King announced \n     that Bhutan will be voting on its first constitution in 2008 \n     and instituting a parliamentary democracy.\n       The Prime Minister told me that this move is inspired in no \n     small part by the U.S. Constitution. Prime Minister Ngedup \n     said the country's leadership is working to ensure the \n     country will have good governance and good leaders for its \n     future. He believes Bhutan can serve as a model democracy for \n     the region. The Prime Minister expressed the view held in \n     Bhutan that happiness is the cornerstone of the society. In \n     fact, the country has developed a Gross National Happiness \n     indicator.\n       When King Wangchuk came to power in 1972, he announced that \n     government policies would be based on the pursuit of high \n     ``Gross National Happiness'' rather than the conventional \n     Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The concept of GNH is based on \n     the premise that true development of human society takes \n     place when material and spiritual development occur side by \n     side to complement and reinforce each other. Since the King's \n     1972 announcement, the government has focused on what it \n     calls the ``four pillars'' of GNH (socio-economic growth, \n     cultural values, environmental conservation and good \n     governance) to guide the country's development plans. For \n     example, the government mandates that a minimum of 60 percent \n     of its land be covered in forest and has instituted policies \n     meant to encourage only high-scale environmentally \n     conscientious tourists to visit. The 2005 national census \n     found that 45.2 percent of Bhutanese are ``very happy,'' 51.6 \n     percent are ``happy,'' and only 3.3 percent are ``not very \n     happy.''\n       The Prime Minister reminded me of the provision penned by \n     Thomas Jefferson regarding the pursuit of happiness. In \n     Bhutan,\n\n[[Page S8937]]\n\n     they measure achieved happiness. The idea of a Gross National \n     Happiness is certainly unusual. I did commend my hosts \n     because it is wonderful that a government wants its people to \n     be happy and makes government work toward that end.\n       The Prime Minister wears two hats in that he also serves as \n     the government's point person for agricultural issues. His \n     role in ensuring a high level of Gross National Happiness is \n     to provide an adequate supply of food, shelter, clothing, \n     clean air and water. He told me about his work to increase \n     food production, raise rural income and improve the \n     livelihood of the nation's large rural population while \n     preserving the pristine natural environment and conserving \n     the rich natural resources.\n       We then met with Khandu Wangchuk, the Minister of Foreign \n     Affairs. Minister Wangchuk attended graduate school at Tufts \n     University. I pressed the Prime Minister on the issue of the \n     105,000 refugees living in UN-funded camps in Nepal. The \n     immigration of ethnic Nepalese to Bhutan has taken place \n     since the 17th century and ethnic Nepalese and ruling Drukpas \n     have shared cordial relations throughout the years. However, \n     in the late 1980s, concern over the increase 13 in the \n     population of and political agitation among ethnic Nepalese \n     prompted aggressive government efforts by Bhutan to assert a \n     national culture, to tighten control over the southern \n     regions, to control illegal immigration and to expel ethnic \n     Nepalese.\n       Beginning in 1988, Bhutan's government expelled large \n     numbers of ethnic Nepalese through enforcement of new \n     citizenship laws. In response to this perceived repression, \n     ethnic Nepalese protested, sometimes violently, leading to a \n     government crackdown and the closure of local Nepalese \n     schools, clinics, and development programs. In 1991, ethnic \n     Nepalese began to leave southern areas of the country in \n     large numbers and to take refuge in Nepal. Today, over \n     100,000 ethnic Nepalese who were expelled from Bhutan are \n     encamped in seven United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees (UNHCR) camps in southeastern Nepal.\n       In October 2004, then-Assistant Secretary of State for \n     Population, Refugees and Migration Gene Dewey visited Bhutan \n     and discussed the refugee issue with the King. During this \n     visit, the King agreed to immediately repatriate certain \n     categories of refugees. However, to date, no refugees have \n     returned, because of procedural disagreements between Bhutan \n     and Nepal. In recent months, the international community, \n     through a Core Group on Bhutanese Refugees (consisting of the \n     US, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, and \n     New Zealand), has begun discussing a comprehensive solution \n     to the refugee problem that would likely include resettlement \n     of a large number of refugees to third countries. Ambassador \n     Moriarty noted that the U.S. could possibly accept upwards of \n     75,000 refugees spread out over many years.\n       The Foreign Minister, well-versed in this issue, explained \n     that this refugee issue is unique and complicated. He \n     informed me that Bhutan, a country of 700,000 does not have \n     the capability to absorb large numbers of people in its \n     society and large-scale immigration would be difficult to \n     accommodate and perhaps pose a threat to stability due to the \n     scramble over resources and infrastructure.\n       The major problem facing the bilateral relationship between \n     Bhutan and Nepal is the instability in Nepal. The constant \n     changes in Nepal's government have made it difficult for \n     Bhutan to negotiate.\n       The Foreign Minister requested that my committee and \n     colleagues consider allowing Bhutanese students, studying in \n     the United States, the ability to have multiple entry visas \n     to allow them to return for holidays and to visit family. \n     Additionally, he requested I inquire about funds belonging to \n     Druk Air, the national airline, which were frozen by the \n     United States as a result of the sanctions placed on Burma.\n       While in Nepal, many leaders expressed concern that if \n     those in UN camps were allowed to go to a third-party \n     country, such as the United States, Bhutan would expel \n     additional ethnic Nepalese. The Foreign Minister assured me \n     that the government would do no such thing.\n       Following our meeting with the Foreign Minister, we had an \n     audience with King Jigme Singye Wangchuk who ascended to the \n     throne in 1972 at the age of 17. As head of state, the King \n     is responsible for all matters relating to the country's \n     domestic policies, security, and sovereignty. However, in \n     1998, King Wangchuk voluntarily transferred his executive \n     powers to the ten member- Council of Ministers. Ministers are \n     nominated by the King and approved by the 150 member National \n     Assembly, 106 of whom are elected by the people. The \n     remaining Assembly members are selected by the King, Buddhist \n     clergy, and the Council of Ministers.\n       In March 2005, King Wangchuk unveiled a draft constitution, \n     which envisions a constitutional monarchy with a Parliament \n     consisting of an upper and lower house. The proposed draft \n     Constitution legalizes political parties and guarantees \n     fundamental human rights such as the right to life, liberty \n     and security of person, the right of association, freedom of \n     speech and press, freedom from torture or inhuman punishment, \n     and freedom from discrimination based on race, sex, language, \n     religion, or politics. The draft also mandates the abdication \n     of the monarch on his 65th birthday and would allow the \n     National Assembly to force a royal abdication if the motion \n     was backed by three-quarters of its members. The draft has \n     reportedly been sent to every household in the country for \n     review. The King has said the Constitution will be ratified \n     through a public referendum, although a date has not yet been \n     set.\n       In December 2005, King Wangchuk announced that when the \n     nation holds elections for its first elected government in \n     2008, he will abdicate to his son, Crown Prince Dasho Jigme \n     Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck. I asked the King why he chose to \n     reduce the power of the monarchy. The King responded that he \n     ``became King due to birth, not merit... which is a flaw of \n     monarchies'' and that ``national interests come first.'' I \n     found this action rare and refreshing in contrast to a world \n     where more and more people are trying to gain more and more \n     power. We spoke at great length about a wide variety of \n     issues including terrorism, the Middle East, radical Islam, \n     Iraq and Afghanistan. We had an informative dialogue and I \n     was impressed with the King's knowledge of world events \n     during the course of our hour-long meeting.\n       Following the meeting with the King, I had the opportunity \n     to meet with the Chief Justice of the Royal Court, Sonam \n     Tobgye. The Bhutanese legal system is primarily based on \n     Buddhist natural law. The court has three levels, the High \n     Court, established in 1968, over which the Chief Justice \n     presides, the Dzongkhag Court, established in 1960, and the \n     Dungkhad Court, established in 1978. The High Court consists \n     of seven to nine Judges. A Dzongkhag court comprises of a \n     minimum of single judge and a maximum of three judges. A \n     Dungkhag court is comprised of one judge.\n       The drafting committee for Bhutan's constitution is headed \n     by the Chief Justice and consists of 39 members of elected \n     representatives. The current system of government provides \n     for a unicameral assembly. The new government will be a \n     bicameral system with an assembly, or lower house, and an \n     upper house. I asked the Chief Justice why the King supports \n     a move towards this form of governance. He responded by \n     saying that the King told him, ``it is better to trust the \n     people than to hope for the best in one person.''\n       From Bhutan we flew back to Kathmandu, passing Mount \n     Everest, to change planes before heading to Kuwait.\n\n\n                                 KUWAIT\n\n       On Friday, August 18th, we landed in 118 degree weather at \n     Ali al Salem Air Base located 45 minutes outside Kuwait City \n     and forty miles from the border with Iraq. We were met by \n     First Secretary and Chief of the Political section from the \n     U.S. embassy, Natalie Brown.\n       Ali Al Salem Air Base is located just 39 miles from the \n     border with Iraq and the bomb damage from Iraq's occupation \n     of Kuwait is still visible. Kuwait can host as many as 90,000 \n     U.S. military personnel at any one time, most of whom are \n     rotating in or out of Iraq. Following the U.S.-led effort to \n     liberate Kuwait from Iraq in 1991, Kuwait signed a ten year \n     defense pact with the U.S. In September 2001, the pact was \n     renewed for another ten years. On April 1, 2004, the Bush \n     Administration designed Kuwait as a Major Non-NATO Ally \n     (MNNA), a designation held by only one other Gulf state \n     (Bahrain).\n       Kuwait privately supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003, \n     even though it publicly opposed the U.S. action. In the run \n     up to the invasion, Kuwait closed off 60% of its territory in \n     order to secure the U.S.-led invasion force of about 250,000 \n     personnel and several thousand pieces of armor; allowed U.S. \n     forces to use two air bases, as well as its international \n     airport and sea ports, and provided $266 million in burden \n     sharing to support combat operations. Kuwait has contributed \n     $213 million in burden sharing support to OIF in FY2005, and \n     is expected to contribute $210 million in both FY2006 and \n     FY2007. Kuwait has also built a water line into Iraq, assists \n     the Polish-led security sector in Hilla, Iraq, and runs a \n     humanitarian operation center (HOC) that has funneled over \n     $500 million in assistance to Iraqis since the fall of \n     Saddam.\n       Prior to the toppling of Saddam Hussein, Kuwait hosted \n     about 1,000 U.S. Air Force personnel enforcing the ``no fly \n     zone'' over southern Iraq. Kuwait also hosted about 5,000 \n     U.S. forces during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in \n     Afghanistan that ousted the Taliban.\n       On Saturday, August 19th, I met with U.S. Ambassador \n     Richard LeBaron who updated me on the recent developments in \n     the region. Ambassador LeBaron informed me that Kuwait plays \n     host to the largest military base outside Iraq in the Middle \n     East. Kuwait also gives more aid and support than any other \n     country to support U.S. efforts in Iraq.\n       According to the Ambassador, Kuwait is very concerned about \n     Iraq and what they describe as the ``emergence of a failed \n     state.'' LeBaron requested I pursue the issue of Iraq with \n     Kuwaiti leaders and seek their views on the future of its \n     northern neighbor. LeBaron further asked me to seek the views \n     of Kuwait on the problem of Iran. While the US. is primarily \n     concerned about Iran's capability to attain nuclear weapons, \n     Kuwait is concerned about the environmental hazards \n     associated with nuclear energy. More specifically, Iran's \n     Bushehr nuclear facility is located closer to Kuwait city \n     than Tehran. Any accident or leak at the facility could have \n     a profound impact on Kuwait's water supply and air quality.\n       The State Department's 2005 Country Reports on Terrorism \n     credits Kuwait for bolstering measures to protect U.S. forces \n     in\n\n[[Page S8938]]\n\n     Kuwait from terrorist attacks but notes that Kuwait has been \n     ``reluctant to confront extremist elements within the local \n     population.'' In May 2006, Kuwaiti judges dismissed charges \n     against five Kuwaitis who were repatriated from the U.S. \n     facility at Guantanamo Bay. In December 2005, Kuwait \n     convicted six men of belonging to a terrorist group (``Lions \n     of the Peninsula'') allegedly planning attacks on U.S. troops \n     in Kuwait. Since January 2005, Kuwaiti security forces have \n     engaged terrorists in at least five confrontations in Kuwait \n     City. Shortly after the September 11, 2001, attacks, Kuwait \n     moved to block the accounts of suspected Al Qaeda activists \n     in Kuwait, and the State Department reports that Kuwait has \n     established an office at the Ministry of Social Affairs and \n     Labor to monitor Islamic charities.\n       On the social and political fronts, Ambassador LeBaron \n     reported that Kuwait has taken steady steps towards \n     liberalization. Women received the right to vote in 2005 and \n     ran in elections in 2006. However, no women were elected. The \n     U.S. has been providing technical assistance to Kuwait \n     through organizations like the International Republican \n     Institute and the National Democratic Institute. Kuwait has \n     had a functioning legislature for forty years which the \n     Ambassador portrayed as a ``serious body'' that is not a \n     rubber stamp and is often critical of Kuwait's leadership.\n       The royal family is widely respected by the people of \n     Kuwait. The Ambassador pointed out that they do not \n     monopolize wealth and are part of the system. Kuwait's \n     substantial oil wealth, which accounts for ten percent of the \n     world market and three percent of U.S. imports, is not owned \n     by the ruling family but rather the Kuwaiti people. \n     Currently, there is much debate about over how much oil the \n     country has, but the Ambassador said Kuwait has plenty and is \n     still finding more.\n       For some time, I have questioned the validity of claims \n     that the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, told Saddam \n     Hussein that the U.S. would not stand in the way should he \n     wish to take Kuwait. Unfortunately, this answer still eludes \n     me as Ambassador LeBaron did not have an answer.\n       As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have been heavily \n     involved in examining the issues surrounding the detainees at \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The U.S. released six Kuwaitis who were \n     later tried and released in Kuwait. However, five Kuwaitis \n     remain at Guantanamo.\n       Our discussion expanded to many issues confronting the \n     region, namely the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Ambassador \n     informed me that many in the Arab world would like to see the \n     peace process rejuvenated. Even if progress is slow, Arabs \n     want to see the United States and others engaged in a process \n     and working towards a solution.\n       The Ambassador and I then headed to Seif Palace to meet \n     with the Amir of Kuwait, Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-\n     Sabah, the fifteenth Amir of Kuwait. During the hour-long \n     session, I asked the Amir what needs to be done to get Iran \n     to stop aiding Hezbollah and the insurgents in Iraq. The Amir \n     responded by saying that Iraq will not be stable in the next \n     few years and that Iran has been emboldened and strengthened \n     by the chaos in Iraq and the situation in Lebanon. He advised \n     me that the U.S. should speed up the training of the Iraqi \n     army and that U.S. forces should not enter town and cities \n     unless invited.\n       I asked Amir Sabah if it is realistic to think that a \n     United Nations peacekeeping force of 15,000 in Lebanon can \n     stabilize the situation between Israel and Hezbollah. The \n     Amir felt the force will only be effective if they are given \n     a good mandate and the necessary authority to control the \n     region.\n       When I asked about Kuwait's bilateral relationship with \n     Iran, the Amir told me Kuwait had good relations but that \n     they are concerned about the impact a nuclear accident in \n     Iran would have on Kuwait and their fear that Iran will \n     transfer peaceful nuclear technology to a military \n     capability. Given his concern about Iran becoming a nuclear \n     state, I asked if Kuwait had pressed Iran to stop their \n     pursuit of weapons. The Amir responded in the negative with \n     the rationale that if the U.S. and Europeans could not \n     convince Iran to give up their pursuit, a small country like \n     Kuwait would not be able to make any progress. However, the \n     Amir did say he would support sanctions.\n       I asked the Amir about his views on the Arab-Israeli \n     conflict. Former National Security Advisor, Brent Scowcroft, \n     wrote an article suggesting relations between the two could \n     improve if Israel retreated to its 1967 borders. Saudi Arabia \n     reportedly said it would enter into a peace agreement with \n     Israel if it agreed to this proposal. The Amir also said \n     Kuwait would support such a proposal and pointed out that the \n     Arab League declared its support for such a proposal at the \n     2002 Arab summit. However, we both expressed doubt that \n     Israel would agree to such a proposal.\n       I asked the Amir what should be done about Hamas and their \n     view that Israel should be destroyed. The Amir doubted Hamas \n     had the capability to destroy Israel and that Hamas attacks \n     Israel with ``fireworks.'' I informed the Amir that \n     ``fireworks do not kill people.''\n       The Amir asked me to review the case of five Kuwaitis being \n     held in U.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and work to \n     secure their release to his government. The Amir assured me \n     that they would be tried for any crimes and punished \n     accordingly if found guilty. Six Kuwaitis were released to \n     Kuwait from Guantanamo, tried and found not guilty.\n       Following my audience with the Amir, I met with Prime \n     Minister Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah. The Prime \n     Minister served as Ambassador to Iran for ten years and \n     shared with me his views on that country. He pointed out that \n     President Ahmadinejad came to power via democratic means and \n     therefore he must be recognized and dealt with. The Prime \n     Minister suggested that the U.S. should directly engage Iran \n     in a frank and direct manner because, as is the case with all \n     conflicts, dialogue and discussions should be exhausted \n     before any other action is pursued. I agreed with the Prime \n     Minister's assessment with the caveat that Iran's support for \n     terrorism and its desire to possess nuclear weapons poses a \n     threat to the region and the world. When Nasser suggested \n     that the U.S. meet with Iran in Vienna to discuss the issues \n     confronting our bilateral relationship, I informed him of my \n     prior meetings with Iranian officials in New York and my \n     desire to have a parliamentary dialogue.\n       On the issue of peacekeeping efforts in Lebanon, the Prime \n     Minister hoped the U.N. efforts would be fruitful but that \n     the key to success will be having a coalition of nations \n     respected by both sides. On the issue of Hamas, the Prime \n     Minister said that Hamas was democratically elected and that \n     they must be recognized. However, he noted that Kuwait has \n     counseled Hamas that they are now policymakers inside the \n     government and must act accordingly. Following my meetings at \n     Seif Palace, we left the Gulf for Israel.\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n       On Saturday, August 19th, we landed at Ben Gurion in Tel \n     Aviv after a technical stop in Amman, Jordan. The following \n     morning I met with Israel's Defense Minister, Amir Peretz in \n     Jerusalem. Joining the meeting were Major General Etian \n     Dangott, military aide to Minister Peretz, Eyal Sela from the \n     Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amos Gilad, Political Director \n     of the Ministry of Defense and Commander Tom Williams, United \n     States Navy.\n       Peretz expressed his view that the International Community \n     must examine the rules of war for the U.N. mission in \n     southern Lebanon as Hezbollah is not a conventional force. If \n     Hezbollah is not disarmed, the U.N. must know that Israel \n     maintains the right to defend itself. Peretz was disappointed \n     that the U.N. has not been quick to provide the necessary \n     forces to implement the Security Council resolution and asked \n     the U.S. to pressure nations who have committed troops, such \n     as France, to make good on their word. I concurred and \n     believed that if there is not a sufficient force on the \n     ground in short order, Hezbollah will have the opportunity to \n     re-arm and we will find ourselves in the same situation in \n     the future. Israel agreed to the cease-fire based on the \n     U.N.'s commitment to provide 15,000 troops, of which France \n     was to provide 3,500. As of the time of our meeting, France \n     had only provided 200.\n       After sharing with me information that Iran has provided \n     training and equipment via Syria to Hezbollah, I asked him if \n     Israel considered retaliating against Iran and/or Syria for \n     their open support of Hezbollah. He said that Israel did not \n     want to open another front on the war and in particular, \n     Israel felt fighting Syria would move them closer to Iran and \n     result in Syria moving back into Lebanon. Peretz told me that \n     there is much debate over whether to fight Syria or try to \n     have a dialogue with them in an attempt to move them out of \n     Iran's sphere of influence.\n       I asked the Defense Minister to update me on the status of \n     the Israel Defense Force soldiers taken by Hamas and \n     Hezbollah and the likelihood that they will be returned to \n     Israel. Peretz expressed optimism that through negotiations \n     with Abu Mazen and Egypt that the soldier taken by Hamas \n     could be returned to Israel. However, he declared that Israel \n     will not negotiate with Hezbollah as they do not want to \n     strengthen the hand of Hassan Nasrallah who has not only \n     requested the release of Lebanese prisoners from Israel, but \n     also Palestinians.\n       I asked the Minister whether there was any possibility \n     Israel would return to its pre-1967 borders. He expressed \n     concern that without the disarmament of Hamas and Hezbollah, \n     the proposal would only permit them to hit targets further \n     inside Israel. He felt it was a complicated proposal because \n     the question of Jerusalem remained unanswered and that Syria \n     would have to be brought in as well.\n       Following my meeting with the Defense Minister, I went to \n     Israel's Supreme Court to meet with the Chief Justice, Aharon \n     Barak. Barak has served on the court for 28 years, of which \n     he was Chief Justice for the last eleven. Barak will be \n     retiring in September 2006 due to an Israeli limitation that \n     judges must retire at 70. We discussed many issues \n     including the interrogation of detainees, the use of \n     torture, the power of the executive, rule of law and \n     abortion.\n       Barak has had a long and distinguished career having served \n     as dean of the law school, being appointed as Attorney \n     General by Yitzhak Rabin in 1975 and serving through the \n     Menachem Begin administration prior to his appointment to the \n     court. Barak expressed his view that democracies cannot \n     conduct or condone torture and that those taken into custody \n     must be interrogated properly and given a prompt trial. Aside \n     from our legal discussions, I asked him his\n\n[[Page S8939]]\n\n     views on the Arab-Israeli dilemma. The Chief Justice felt \n     constrained from speaking candidly on this question as the \n     Chief Justice, but said that ``there is light at the end of \n     the tunnel but the problem is that the tunnel keeps getting \n     longer.''\n       After lunch, I traveled to the Knesset to meet with Prime \n     Minister Ehud Olmert. The Prime Minister began the meeting by \n     expressing his realization that he knew his job would be \n     difficult but that he did not expect to be in the middle of a \n     war a few months into the job. He described in some detail \n     the assistance Iran and Syria were giving to Hezbollah and \n     the great threat that poses to Israeli security. He gave me \n     many examples supporting his conclusion and pointed out that \n     Hezbollah guards were trained in Iran and Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guards are in Lebanon. He further explained how \n     Iran has provided top class weapons to Hezbollah.\n       The Prime Minister said the Israeli forces were extremely \n     effective in eliminating most of the long range and medium \n     range missiles through its sophisticated systems and that no \n     launcher fired a rocket twice. He declared that Israel won \n     every confrontation with Hezbollah, but that fighting against \n     well-equipped guerrillas is difficult. Despite these \n     victories, he expressed concern about the growing influence \n     being projected by Iran.\n       I asked the Olmert if he was frustrated that Israel could \n     not retaliate against Iran. The Prime Minister explained that \n     Israel should not have to deal with Iran alone and that the \n     international community must realize the threat Iran poses \n     and act to confront it accordingly. Olmert reminded me that \n     it was only 65 years ago when a dictator declared his desire \n     to eliminate Jews and now there was another leader who has \n     stated a similar desire and who is seeking nuclear weapons--a \n     convincing argument as to why the world should be moving \n     aggressively to eliminate the threat posed by Iran.\n       I asked the Prime Minister if the ceasefire will hold. \n     Olmert informed me that he had received criticism from \n     Israelis for agreeing to the ceasefire and that he agreed to \n     the proposal after assurances that a robust international \n     force would be provided to bring calm to the region. He \n     further explained that Security Resolution 1701 has to be \n     implemented or Israel will be left with no choice but to \n     continue to defend itself. He mentioned that this proposal \n     was not of Israeli origin but rather from the French and the \n     United States.\n       On the question of Hamas, the Prime Minister expressed hope \n     that Abu Mazen will exert his authority and garner more \n     control over the territories. He doubted there could be any \n     progress with Hamas and he refuses to negotiate with them. He \n     did believe that there could be progress in getting back \n     soldiers taken by Hezbollah, possibly in exchange for those \n     taken by Israel during the conflict.\n       I asked Prime Minister Olmert his views on the idea that if \n     Israel returned to the 1967 borders, peace would come between \n     the Arabs and Israelis. He responded by saying it was an \n     outdated proposal and Hamas still wants to destroy Israel. \n     Olmert expressed his belief that the next few years will be \n     critical for Israel's survival as they combat Hezbollah, \n     Hamas, Syria and most importantly Iran--who is seeking the \n     capability to wipe Israel off the map.\n\n\n                                 LIBYA\n\n       On the morning of August 21, 2006, we departed Tel Aviv en \n     route Tripoli, Libya with a brief technical stop in Cyprus. \n     We were greeted at Mitiga International Airport by Dr. \n     Suleiman al-Shahumi, the General People's Congress Secretary \n     of Foreign Affairs and by Charge Greg Berry and Political and \n     Economic Officer, Elizabeth Fritschle.\n       After a brief rest at the hotel, we traveled to the U.S. \n     embassy annex in Tripoli for a country team briefing. The \n     U.S. Embassy is temporarily located in the hotel we were \n     staying at, but is insufficient to serve as a place for the \n     U.S. Government to do its business. Charge Berry requested my \n     assistance in speaking with Libyan leadership in hopes of \n     security land for a permanent facility to build a mission. \n     Additionally, he informed me that airline companies in Libya \n     were in the process of deciding between Boeing and Airbus to \n     supply them with a new fleet. President Chirac, Prime \n     Minister Blair and Chancellor Merkel have all visited Libya \n     and offered their support for Airbus. Charge Berry requested \n     my assistance in sharing the benefits of the Boeing product.\n       In October 2005, Boeing received an order for two 737-800s \n     from Buraq Air, a privately held airline, valued at $250 \n     million and the planes are scheduled to be delivered by \n     November 2006. However, Boeing is competing against Airbus to \n     sell up to fourteen 737s and twelve 787s to Libyan Airways, \n     the flag carrier. This deal is estimated to be worth $2.9 \n     billion. Boeing has a significant footprint in Pennsylvania \n     employing 4,681 workers and 915 venders and suppliers. Boeing \n     spent $264,279,109 in Pennsylvania in 2005. In each of my \n     meetings with Libyan officials, I described the benefits of \n     the Boeing aircraft and highlighted the fact that it \n     incorporates the latest technologies and offers significant \n     fuel efficiencies.\n       Following the brief, we met with Dr. Suleiman al-Shahumi \n     for about an hour. Dr. Shahumi expressed his government's \n     desire to continue the improvements in our bilateral \n     relationship. He briefed me on Libya's efforts to combat \n     terrorism and their desire to have peace in Africa and the \n     Middle East. Dr. Shahumi and I discussed our country's \n     efforts to combat terrorism and our views on the issue of \n     Iran. We both agreed that we are entering a new phase in \n     U.S.-Libyan relations but that three decades of no \n     communication will take some time to overcome.\n       Dr. Shahumi shared with me Libya's problems with illegal \n     immigration. I told him about the ongoing immigration debate \n     in the United States and the eleven million illegal \n     immigrants residing in the country. Dr. Shahumi informed me \n     that an estimated 50,000 illegal immigrants pass through \n     Libya every month in an attempt to leave the continent for \n     Europe.\n       I told Dr. Shahumi that it was important that the U.S. be \n     permitted to establish an embassy quickly and he concurred. \n     The people to people exchanges are very valuable in \n     establishing sound relations between our countries. It was \n     brought to my attention that the note taker from the Libyan \n     government studied at Penn State University in 1980 and that \n     her son was born in State College, PA.\n       I asked Dr. Shahumi to work with the United States to \n     permit Dr. Donald White, an archaeology professor at the \n     University of Pennsylvania, to continue to have access to \n     various sites in Libya. Dr. White had previously had \n     difficulty securing the appropriate documents needed to enter \n     Libya. I also raised this issue with other members of the \n     Libyan leadership during my stay. Following our meeting, Dr. \n     Suleiman al-Shahumi hosted us for dinner at a beautiful \n     downtown Tripoli restaurant located adjacent to an arch \n     constructed in honor of Marcus Aurelius.\n       The following morning we departed for the Ministry of \n     Justice to meet with Ali Umar al-Hasnawi, Secretary of the \n     General People's Committee for Justice. As was customary \n     during all of my meetings with Libyan officials, the meetings \n     always began with a brief dialogue about the problems between \n     the U.S. and Libya in the past and both nations' desire for \n     better relations in the future.\n       I pressed Mr. Hasnawi about resolving the outstanding \n     issues surrounding the cases involving the bombings of Pan Am \n     Flight 103 and the La Belle Disco. On December 21, 1988, a \n     bomb exploded on Pan Am flight 103, over Lockerbie, Scotland \n     killing 270 people, including 189 Americans. The U.N. \n     Security Council passed three resolutions that placed \n     sanctions on Libya until its government surrendered for trial \n     men suspected of the Pan Am flight and the bombing of French \n     flight UTA 772 in 1989. Libya surrendered the two men on \n     April 5, 1999, and the U.N. suspended sanctions the same day. \n     In August 2003, Libya accepted responsibility for the Pan Am \n     bombing and agreed to pay the families of each American \n     victim $10 million in compensation. To date, the victims' \n     families had been paid $8 million each over two payments with \n     the remaining $2 million to be paid when the U.S. removed \n     Libya from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Libya has \n     been removed but the final payment has not been made.\n       On November 13, 2001, a German court found four \n     individuals, including a former employee of the Libyan \n     embassy, guilty in connection with the 1986 La Belle disco \n     bombing. Two U.S. servicemen were killed and eighty other \n     servicemen and women were injured in the bombing. In August \n     2004, a compensation deal for non-U.S. victims was agreed to; \n     however U.S. victims continue to pursue their claims in \n     federal court. While the U.S. Government was not party to \n     either of these suits, I stressed the importance of having \n     these outstanding issues resolved and the benefit it will \n     have in aiding Libya reemerge into the international \n     community. Mr. Hasnawi informed me that both sides are \n     working to bring the issue to a conclusion by the end of 2006 \n     and should the cases go to court, he pledged that Libya would \n     accept the ruling.\n       Charge Berry raised the issue of the five Bulgarian female \n     nurses and one Palestinian male doctor who were arrested in \n     1999 on charges that they infected 426 Libyan children with \n     HIV. They were found guilty on May 6, 2004, and sentenced to \n     death by firing squad. However, a French doctor testified at \n     the trial that the children had been infected in 1997, one \n     year before the Bulgarians and the Palestinian arrived in \n     Libya. On December 25, 2006, Libya's Supreme Court overturned \n     the convictions and death sentences, and ordered a retrial \n     which began in May 2006. Mr. Hasnawi responded that he \n     anticipates a ruling in the case by no later than November \n     2006.\n       I then traveled to the Foreign Ministry to meet with Abdul \n     Rahman Shalgam, Deputy Secretary of the General People's \n     Committee for Foreign Relations. I asked Mr. Shalgam what can \n     be done to address the tragic situation in Sudan. He informed \n     me of Libya's involvement over the last three years to bring \n     all sides in the conflict to Tripoli to participate in a \n     dialogue. The key to peace and stability in Sudan, according \n     to Shalgam, is to fulfill three requests made by all parties \n     involved. Each of whom want to participate in power, benefit \n     from the country's wealth and participate in a federal form \n     of government to allow for local administration of the \n     various regions. I requested that his government apply \n     pressure on the government in Khartoum to permit the United \n     Nations to enter the country.\n       I found the about-face in our bilateral relationship unique \n     in modern history and asked Mr. Shalgam what were the factors \n     that convinced Libya to reengage the United States and could \n     it be used as a template to improve relations between the \n     U.S. and Iran.\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\n     He informed me that it was in the best interest of Libya to \n     have good relations, commerce and trade with the United \n     States and that living under sanctions was detrimental to the \n     economy and the Libyan people. He further stated that Libya \n     wants recognition for their actions to eliminate weapons of \n     mass destruction and their cooperation on counterterrorism \n     efforts. It is this recognition, and a seat at the \n     international table, that Iran seeks, according to Shalgam. \n     He believes the U.S. should directly enter into dialogue \n     with Iran--a response shared by most officials I met with \n     during my trip.\n       After lunch, I departed for a meeting with Ali Baghdadi al \n     Mahmudi, Secretary of General People's Congress. Mr. Mahmudi, \n     whose position is not unlike that of a Prime Minister, was \n     running a cabinet meeting which was running overtime. This \n     delay provided me an opportunity to speak with Mohammad \n     Siala, Secretary of International Cooperation, about the \n     steps Libya has taken to restore its economy. Prior to \n     serving in his current capacity, Mr. Siala led Libya's \n     tourism bureau. Mr. Siala, echoing the statements of Mr. \n     Shalgam, stressed the importance of U.S. markets, in \n     particular, the U.S. financial and banking system, to the \n     growth of the Libyan economy. He expressed his interest in \n     having a delegation from the U.S. Export Import Bank come to \n     Libya in the near future to discuss proposals to aid Libya's \n     infrastructure and commerce.\n       When the cabinet meeting broke, I met with Mr. Mahmudi who \n     shared his view that the U.S.-Libyan relationship was on a \n     positive track. He expressed his desire for enhanced trade \n     and tourism with the U.S. and greater cooperation on issues \n     of mutual concern such as radical Islam. Mahmudi views \n     delegations from the U.S. as invaluable in enhancing our \n     understanding of one another and hoped that more would come \n     in the future.\n       During our discussion on Iran, Mr. Mahmudi believes the \n     U.S. should not impose preconditions for talking to Tehran. \n     On the issue of Libya serving as a framework in which the \n     U.S. and Iran could foster better relations, he warned that \n     the U.S. has not done enough to show the advantages of \n     ditching weapons of mass destruction. Many Libyans question \n     the move to surrender the weapons as they have not seen \n     anything in return for their actions, such as technology and \n     knowledge transfers. He believes that should the U.S. want to \n     convince Iran to forego nuclear weapons, it should set an \n     example by aiding Libya and showing the benefits that can be \n     brought to those who chose that path. He mentioned that Libya \n     has good relations with Iran and North Korea and that Libya \n     may be able to play a role in future negotiations.\n       Following my meeting with Mahmudi, I was whisked to Mitiga \n     International Airport as I was to meet Colonel Muammar \n     Qadhafi in Surt, located about a one hour flight from \n     Tripoli. Upon arrival at a vacant airport, I was led in a \n     motorcade into the desert. The drive revealed the desolate \n     landscape which was dotted with a few tents and camels. I \n     arrived at Qadhafi's location to find a man-made pond, \n     paddleboat, a few tents and a recreational vehicle. Perhaps \n     the strangest fixture at this location was Congressman Tom \n     Lantos, who was also meeting with Qadhafi. He commented how \n     difficult it was to see each other in Washington, D.C. and \n     how odd it was to be chatting in Libya.\n       As the sun was setting, we were summoned to enter Qadhafi's \n     tent. We exchanged pleasantries and our desires for enhanced \n     relations between our countries. I pressed Qadhafi to move \n     expeditiously towards settling the outstanding disputes \n     involving the bombings of Pan Am 103 and the La Belle disco.\n       I also requested he work expeditiously to grant the U.S. \n     the necessary land to build an embassy. Qadhafi said that the \n     U.S. would be given land, but that it would not be a typical \n     embassy. He elaborated that the mission in Tripoli would not \n     serve as an ``outpost for democracy and opposition'' and that \n     the U.S. Ambassador should not interfere with local affairs. \n     Charge Berry responded by reassuring Qadhafi that ``the U.S. \n     will be good guests.'' Qadhafi declared that he did not want \n     the U.S. mission involved in Libyan politics and did not want \n     U.S. funds being distributed to political parties and \n     democracy efforts. Charge Berry quipped that he did not have \n     any money to spend.\n       I asked Qadhafi if democracy was in Libya's future. He \n     responded by saying democracy was derived from an Arabic term \n     and that he hoped the United States would follow Libya's form \n     of government declaring it was the most pure form of \n     democracy in history. He believed that direct representation \n     does not serve the people of the United States and that \n     Libyans do not use proxies to make decisions on their behalf. \n     Qadhafi believes that peace will happen only when all the \n     people are in power and can decide the course of their \n     government. He further declared his desire to end the \n     existence of armies, classes, parliaments and to place wealth \n     back into the hand of the people.\n       Qadhafi informed me that there was no animosity held by the \n     Libyan people for Americans but that leaders of countries are \n     typically responsible for actions that create animosity \n     between peoples. For an example, he recanted his \n     confrontation with President Ronald Reagan and the action \n     taken by the United States which resulted in the killing of \n     his daughter. He asked the question, ``was that a decision of \n     the American people?''\n       I discussed the problems the United States is having with \n     Iran and their support for terrorism in the region, their \n     desire to attain nuclear weapons and their statements seeking \n     to wipe Israel off the map. I asked Qadhafi if there were any \n     lessons to be learned from the experience between the U.S. \n     and Libya and if it would be applicable to dealing with Iran. \n     Qadhafi informed me that Libya urged North Korea and Iran to \n     turn over their weapons and halt nuclear programs. However, \n     Qadhafi believes that unless the U.S. shows the benefits of \n     the actions taken by Libya to give up its weapons of mass \n     destruction, the U.S. will not be able to approach either \n     North Korea or Iran with any such proposals.\n       I asked Qadhafi what he wanted from the U.S. He replied by \n     saying President Bush promised he would help with technology \n     transfers and knowledge transfers but that nothing has \n     happened since the agreement was reached in 2004. He also \n     suggested that the United States provide free power \n     facilities for Libya. While I could not promise they would be \n     free, I concurred that the U.S. should aid Libya with their \n     infrastructure.\n       Qadhafi declared it would be counterproductive for us to \n     look towards the past and expressed his desire for the U.S. \n     and Libya to confront international terrorism, disease, \n     climate change and Middle East peace. I asked Qadhafi how we \n     should combat the issue of fundamentalism and terrorism. He \n     responded by saying that the U.S. is supporting it by \n     supporting Saudi Arabia. I told him we did not do so \n     intentionally and that some U.S. leaders, myself included, \n     have long been concerned about our relationship with Saudi \n     Arabia. I highlighted my frustration with the Saudi \n     government which began with their lack of cooperation \n     following the Khobar Towers bombing in 1996 to their support \n     for textbooks which incite hatred. I told him about \n     legislation I have authored, the Saudi Arabia Accountability \n     Act, and my desire for a closer examination of our \n     relationship with Riyadh.\n       He further stated that Wahabbism, which emanates from Saudi \n     Arabia, is spreading across the region and is taking root in \n     the Horn of Africa and is a threat to the entire Muslim \n     world. Qadhafi went on to say that Saudi Arabia was \n     responsible for the Bali bombings and behind the escape of \n     seven individuals from Yemen responsible for the attack on \n     the U.S.S. Cole. I asked Qadhafi to provide evidence to \n     support these claims and did so at a subsequent meeting but \n     was not provided anything to back up these charges.\n       Our meeting lasted about 45 minutes after which I was \n     escorted through the desert back to the air base and back to \n     Tripoli where we arrived at approximately 10:00 p.m.\n       On August 23rd, we departed Tripoli for Shannon, Ireland to \n     rest and refuel prior to returning to Philadelphia on August \n     24, 2006.\n       I yield the floor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Temple University, Beasley School of Law, Rule of Law Projects in \n                China--Special Report on Temple Students\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       Temple's initiatives in the People's Republic of China are \n     grounded on the common theme of developing carefully-selected \n     Chinese legal professionals who are poised to make \n     significant contributions to the rule of law in China. Temple \n     accomplishes this goal through three main categories of \n     programs: the Temple Beijing LL.M degree program, non-degree \n     education programs for judges and prosecutors, and law \n     development and reform initiatives. Each of these programs is \n     operated in cooperation with influential and high-level \n     Chinese partners.\n       Education is long-term investment in the legal \n     infrastructure of a society. However, Temple's programs have \n     the benefit of also having an immediate impact. We are \n     educating judges and prosecutors who are in the courtroom \n     interpreting China's laws and applying them to real cases \n     every day. Temple educates National People's Congress \n     Legislative Affairs Committee members who are using their \n     legal education to draft China's legislation. We instruct law \n     professors who incorporate program content and critical \n     teaching methods into their own classes, thus shaping more \n     future judges, prosecutors, and lawyers. Temple graduates are \n     developing the rule of law from within the system. As these \n     leaders advance in their careers, the opportunities to use \n     their Temple legal education will only gather momentum to \n     bring about even more truly effective law reform.\n       The Temple-educated legal community has the potential to be \n     enormously useful to the U.S. Government as it supports the \n     rule of law in China. Temple graduates and current \n     participants represent a reflective, highly-placed community \n     of judges, prosecutors, state officials, professors, and \n     legal advocates who have a special understanding of the \n     principles of the U.S. legal system.\n       A total of 554 legal professionals have participated or are \n     participating in at least one of Temple's China educational \n     programs since 1997. Of these, 81 percent are from the public \n     sector. We maintain contact with all graduates through the \n     newly formed Temple Law Alumni Association of China (TLAAC), \n     publishing directories, maintaining a website, and hosting \n     national reunions at least once a year.\n     The Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree program\n       The Temple Beijing LL.M. degree program, operated \n     cooperatively with Tsinghua University, is the most \n     comprehensive educational program Temple--or any other \n     foreign legal educational institution--offers in China. The \n     educational experience is designed for Chinese legal \n     professionals and\n\n[[Page S8941]]\n\n     aims to have a profound impact on these key legal change \n     agents.\n       A total of 293 Chinese legal professionals, including \n     judges, National People's Congress and State Council \n     legislative officers, prosecutors, government officials, and \n     law professors have graduated from or are currently enrolled \n     in Temple's Beijing and Philadelphia LL.M. programs. Of \n     these, 64% are from the public sector. Moreover, 12.7% are \n     ethnic minority lawyers, many from traditionally \n     disadvantaged regions within China.\n       The number of Temple-educated Chinese lawyers is impressive \n     and important. Temple has educated a substantial core \n     community of influential Chinese lawyers who have a deep \n     understanding of the fundamental principles of the rule of \n     law such as transparency, due process, accountability, and \n     high ethical standards. They will carry these ideas with them \n     as their careers mature.\n       Temple is constantly seeking out lawyers who work in NGOs \n     and public interest work to admit to the LL.M program. Among \n     our current students: Tu Lijuan is an experienced human \n     rights advocate, having worked for the Domestic Violence \n     Network; Shui Miao is a drafter with the Legislative Affairs \n     Office of the National People's Congress; and Xue-Dan Is the \n     Director of Training for the State Intellectual Property \n     Organization. Jiefeng Lu, a protege of the famous anti-\n     discrimination lawyer, Professor Zhou Wei, worked on cutting-\n     edge employment discrimination cases in China, plans to \n     become an activist-scholar in discrimination law.\n       Four LL.M. students from the public sector, including two \n     law professors, one official with the Legislative Affairs \n     Office of the State Council, and one official with the \n     Ministry of Justice (All China Lawyers Association), \n     participated in a one month internship at Reed Smith. Their \n     experience culminated in mock trial before Senior Circuit \n     Judge Edward Becker of the U.S. Third Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. The fact pattern simulated that of Kelo vs. New \n     London, the controversial property rights case involving the \n     government taking of private property for private economic \n     development. The students will take this knowledge on the \n     U.S. law of condemnation back to China, where the similar \n     issue of confiscation of private property is a sensitive \n     issue that requires public participation and commentary.\n       Each year Temple makes efforts to locate law professors to \n     attend the LL.M. program. To date, we have educated 19 law \n     professors, including seven during the term of this grant. We \n     know that these professors are incorporating what they have \n     learned into their courses in Chinese law schools, thereby \n     having a direct impact on what is being taught and, perhaps \n     more importantly, how it is being taught. As a result, a new \n     generation of Chinese lawyers will be able to critically \n     examine Chinese law and be exposed to principles of U.S law.\n       Class of 2006 Beijing LL.M. student and Professor Meng \n     Yanbei teaches antitrust at Renmin University. She reports \n     that her Temple education directly influences her teaching \n     and scholarship--and how she assesses her students. Meng took \n     antitrust with Professor Burton Caine in the fall of 2005 and \n     learned how to analyze cases from different angles and \n     appreciate how judges with different opinions set forth their \n     legal reasoning, and synthesize the law. The class \n     discussions often focused on how cases differ and overlap, \n     creating a living body of law, thus providing Meng with \n     greater insight into the law and how it should be taught. \n     Prior to her Temple education, she read antitrust and \n     anticompetitive law materials through translation into \n     Chinese, but now she reads the original source materials in \n     English. She said that many translated materials are \n     imprecise or misleading, and her improved English abilities \n     allow her to teach more competently about U.S. sources of \n     law. She also provides English case materials to her \n     students, explaining to them that it is better to work hard \n     at reading the original cases rather than fall back on \n     translations.\n       On March 7, 2006, we observed Meng's fourth-year \n     undergraduate law school anti-competition law class at Renmin \n     University. She arranges in advance for students to discuss \n     various topics and have them lead discussions using Power \n     Point. In the class we observed, the student made a series of \n     creative arguments in an effort to categorize the various \n     forms of anticompetitive behavior, and Meng made comments to \n     supplement the student points while also stimulating class \n     discussion to help the presenter clarify her ideas. She also \n     encouraged the students to think creatively about the law, \n     how a court may consider public policy in making decisions, \n     and to take a more active. role in their learning.\n       The impact of any program its demonstrated by its graduates \n     and what they do with their education. Our alumni report that \n     they are profoundly affected by their education. The \n     following anecdotal stories--from a judge who published a \n     book on how to cite legal authority and rationales in \n     judicial opinions; a prosecutor who writes the standards for \n     the Beijing People's Procuratorate stressing prosecutorial \n     restraint; and a teacher who uses advocacy techniques in the \n     courtroom and classroom--all illustrate the varied ways \n     Temple graduates are using their education to promote the \n     rule of law in China.\n       Mr. Feng Wensheng is the deputy director of the research \n     and policy division of the Supreme People's Court of Hebei \n     Province. Judge Feng graduated from the Temple Beijing LLM \n     program in 2003 and is now responsible for drafting internal \n     court procedures for all courts in the province--with \n     emphasis on judicial conduct. He continually focuses on \n     matters regarding judicial neutrality and the role of the \n     judge to seek truth from the facts before making any legal \n     determinations. His Temple experience also enabled him to \n     publish ``Reasoning and Annotations'' (Law Press: 2005), in \n     which Judge Feng draws on principles of U.S. and \n     international law to create a model for Chinese judicial \n     rationale drafting.\n       Mr. Chang Guofeng is the Director of the Discipline and \n     Guidance division of the Beijing People's Procuratorate. Mr. \n     Chang graduated from the Temple Beijing LL.M. program in 2004 \n     and is responsible for writing policy directives that are \n     distributed to the entire Beijing procuratorial system. He \n     reports that his Temple education gave him a stronger view of \n     prosecutorial restraint, and his directives reflect the \n     spirit that the role of prosecutors is to vigorously \n     represent the interests of the state without trampling the \n     rights of the defendant. His directives include strategies \n     and suggestions for prosecutors to take a middle course when \n     carrying out investigations and prosecutions, as the larger \n     interest of the state is not just to convict the guilty but \n     to ensure a fair trial and accurate result for all \n     participants.\n       Ms. Shen Jia is a professor of law at Beijing City \n     University and 2005 graduate of the Beijing LL.M. program. \n     Professor Shen reports in a recent e-mail:\n       ``To be frank, I am proud of what I have learned from \n     Beijing LLM program . . . Just think, two years ago, I knew \n     nothing about common law system, not to mention trial \n     advocacy. But now I can stand in front of a judge trying to \n     persuade the court what I've got to say. I know what the \n     judge wants from me by asking those questions, so I can turn \n     them into advocating for our side. It's because of the help \n     from all Temple professors . . . that made all these things \n     possible.''\n       Professor Shen teaches a U.S. common law course at Beijing \n     City University. She now provides a fresh and updated \n     teaching presentation to her students using strategies \n     similar to those employed in her Temple trial advocacy class. \n     Her teaching will inspire students to take a greater interest \n     in the importance of transparent laws and effective advocacy \n     trial practice.\n     Non-degree judicial education program\n       Temple has had a partnership with the National Judicial \n     Training College of the Supreme People's Court to operate a \n     non-degree judicial education program since 2002. Associate \n     Chief Justice Cao Jianmin personally oversees the program and \n     meets with Dean Robert Reinstein each year to discuss \n     progress and future collaboration.\n       The program consists of a three-month Introduction to the \n     U.S. Legal System course at the National Judicial College of \n     the Supreme People's Court, followed by a concentrated four-\n     week program in the United States. As part of the U.S. \n     module, participants attend a three-week session on the role \n     of the judiciary in a rule-of-law based legal system at New \n     York University School of Law's Institute for Judicial \n     Training. The judges also visit the Temple main campus in \n     Philadelphia for a discussion on judicial review hosted by \n     Dean Reinstein. Moreover, they visit Washington, D.C., \n     meeting with their American judicial colleagues, the \n     Department of Justice, and other legal institutions.\n       The Judicial Education Program was created primarily to \n     educate those judges who could benefit from some exposure to \n     U.S. and international law, but could not enter the LL.M. \n     program due to work commitments. To date, 138 judges have \n     completed or are participating in the program.\n       Participants are from geographically diverse parts of \n     China, including many judges from lesser-developed Western \n     regions. Temple maintains records on program participants and \n     has integrated the judges into the Temple Alumni Association \n     of China.\n       Judge Li Xinfang of the No.1 Civil Chamber of the Zhanjiang \n     Intermediate Court, Guangdong Province, reports that the \n     Introduction to U.S. Legal System course and one-month \n     session in the United States in 2005 has greatly expanded the \n     scope of resources she now uses to decide cases. In \n     particular, her visits to courts and interaction with \n     colleagues in the United States provided her a fresh \n     perspective on dispute resolution while underscoring the use \n     of due process and transparent norms as the guiding principle \n     for all judicial action.\n       Previous program participants report that their Temple \n     education allows them to exercise greater influence in their \n     home courts. The judges emphasize that they are often asked \n     to share information from their Temple training with their \n     colleagues at staff meetings and through written reports. \n     Their Temple experience also allows them to answer individual \n     questions for colleagues who must resolve an issue currently \n     unsettled under Chinese law but that may have common practice \n     in the United States. Judges state that this multiplier \n     effect allows their Temple education to carry tremendous \n     weight and influence in courts well beyond the training of \n     one individual judge.\n       Past Judicial Education Program participants also emphasize \n     the long-term value of the program.\n       Mr. Bai Zongzhao is a judge on the Supreme People's Court \n     of Sichuan Province. He participated in the 2003 Judicial \n     Education Program and then graduated from the\n\n[[Page S8942]]\n\n     Temple Beijing LLM program in 2004. He is now the deputy \n     director of the high court's criminal division. Judge Bai has \n     indicated, in a 2005 interview, that his Temple education \n     provided him with a profound sense of substantive knowledge \n     and court procedure. When he is the presiding judge in a \n     case, he now holds a pre-trial hearing and instructs the \n     prosecutors and defense attorneys on more efficient court \n     practice-skills Judge Bai says he learned in his Temple trial \n     advocacy class. He informs counsel that the purpose of the \n     hearing is to resolve questions the judges have about the \n     weak points of the cases, and not simply to recite the \n     written pleadings. Judge Bai insists that creating a more \n     adversarial-style hearing allows him to ask more detailed \n     questions and arrive at a more legally accurate conclusion. \n     Overall, he concludes that the Temple program positively \n     affects graduates' way of thinking about law, with greater \n     adherence to law and procedure, and will pay long-term \n     dividends in China's legal culture.\n       Temple and the National Judicial College remain very \n     satisfied with the educational experience and the progress of \n     our graduates. This year we have added an additional course \n     in Civil Procedure to the Beijing portion of the program.\n       The National Judicial College has recently agreed to \n     conduct a joint survey with Temple of all judges who have \n     attended the program with the specific goal determining what \n     has been most useful to our participants. We will likely use \n     our findings as a basis to refine the curriculum.\n     Non-degree prosecutorial education program\n       In 2002 the Supreme People's Procuratorate invited Temple \n     to create a non-degree prosecutor education program modeled \n     on our successful partnership with the Supreme People's \n     Court. In December 2005, the second prosecutorial education \n     program was held in Beijing, Philadelphia and Washington, \n     D.C.\n       Seasoned and well-reputed Temple faculty delivered sessions \n     on search and seizure protections, pre-arrest warnings, jury \n     trial procedures, and proper police practices in collecting \n     evidence. To supplement the faculty discussions, Temple was \n     fortunate to procure the enthusiastic participation of the \n     U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia as well as the \n     Department of Justice in Washington DC. Investigators from \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigations in both cities also took \n     part. Experienced U.S. prosecutors and FBI agents delivered \n     sessions on motion practice, importance of defense lawyers, \n     and strategies for combating official corruption.\n       An underlying strategy of the Temple program was to \n     underscore the importance of due process and transparent \n     norms at all stages of criminal investigation and \n     prosecution. Mr. Xu Yanping, Vice President of the Shanghai \n     Pudong District Procuratorate, served as group leader and \n     provided continual feedback to the program directors. He \n     continually remarked how the program impressed upon the \n     participants the depth and scope of U.S.-style protections, \n     the tremendous knowledge of the faculty and practitioners, \n     and the importance of an open and transparent system. This \n     combination of factors will influence the prosecutors to \n     carry out their own laws with fairness as well as to \n     continually bring themselves to higher levels of professional \n     excellence.\n       In a follow-up interview with Mr. Xu in Shanghai in \n     February 2006, he underscored the value to him of his \n     participation in the program, particularly how the material \n     now provides him a new frame of reference in making decisions \n     in his current job.\n       Similarly, Bian Fei, a participant in the 2003 program, \n     reported that his superiors asked him to do a presentation on \n     the information he acquired from the program to 100 of his \n     peers upon his return. Some of the ideas were subsequently \n     used in an office reorganization plan.\n       Participants reported that the training program was well-\n     run and extremely beneficial to their professional \n     development. They underscored that many areas of their \n     prosecutorial practice, particularly criminal procedure, are \n     still being developed in China--and that understanding of US. \n     practice helps to fill certain gaps. Some participants were \n     trial prosecutors, others were administrators and \n     prosecutorial researchers, so the multiplier effect of \n     training one person will also carry weight in various levels \n     of the Chinese prosecutorial system.\n       As part of Temple's overall plan to create a community of \n     U.S.-educated legal professionals, participants have been \n     fully integrated into the Temple Law Alumni Association of \n     China.\n       By all accounts, this program is effective and highly \n     valued by the Supreme People's Procuratorate. Unfortunately, \n     this program's funding was cut from the current year's grant.\n     Outreach to ethnic minorities in China\n       Temple is committed to identifying and supporting minority \n     students in our programs, and we aggressively recruit \n     qualified minority students, particularly from the Western \n     regions of China. Our partner organizations in China have \n     indicated that further development of the Western regions of \n     China is critical to the overall stability of China's legal \n     system, and so Temple has created a minority outreach program \n     to educate students who have the social commitment to return \n     to their home regions and carry out rule-of-law reforms in \n     less-developed areas.\n       Temple has an extraordinary record of success in educating \n     qualified minorities with a law degree--a rare commodity. \n     Temple's reputation is so well-known that minority students \n     are beginning to refer their friends to the program.\n       To date, 29 ethnic minorities have either graduated from or \n     are currently attending our LL.M. program. Thirteen minority \n     graduates now work in the public sector: four are judges, \n     three are prosecutors, and one works at the State Council. \n     Four graduates are law professors, currently teaching at the \n     laws schools of Central University for Nationalities, \n     Zhengzhou University, and Sichuan University. The LL.M. \n     program has educated nine Tibetans, eight Huis, three \n     Manchurians, two Mongolians, and one each Kazak, Li, Miao, \n     Tijia, Uigyur, Yi, and Zhuang.\n       As part of our partnership with the Central University for \n     Nationalities, Temple has supported Mr. Kalsang Tsering. Mr. \n     Tsering is an ethnic Tibetan who studied English in Temple's \n     Intensive English Language Program for two years. Upon his \n     graduation from Temple in May 2006, returned to Tibet to work \n     with the Tibet Hengfeng Law Firm to provide legal services to \n     the Tibetan community. Mr. Tsering states that his Temple \n     education will help him to provide access to justice for more \n     Tibetans while also assisting in facilitating foreign \n     investment in Tibet. He also feels a social obligation to \n     serve his community, and he ultimately hopes to work both as \n     a lawyer and law lecturer at newly-created law department at \n     Tibet University.\n       Kalsang studied international human rights course and wrote \n     a scholarly paper on how the Chinese government can take \n     additional action to protect Tibetan language rights and \n     establish a bilingual system in Tibetan regions.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       We are gratified by the accomplishments of Temple's rule of \n     law projects in China. Temple's programs are making tangible \n     contributions to China in its ongoing process of developing a \n     credible legal system. It is an honor and a privilege to be \n     entrusted with such an important job by the Department of \n     State.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               My View of the Temple/Tsinghoa LLM Program\n\n       Senator Specter: I am greatly honored for this opportunity \n     to express my view of the Temple/Tsinghua Program by writing \n     a letter to you.\n       First of all, heartiest thanks to you for your brief and \n     instructive speech to us students of the program during your \n     visit to China. Among the students, I was the luckiest person \n     to have had the chance to answer your inquiry about the \n     protection of the rights related to the accused persons in \n     China. In my opinion, there are many differences between \n     America and China on this issue, and the reasons are quite \n     complicated.\n       Politically speaking, China has a more than 2000 years \n     history of feuda1ism which is charateristic of autocracy, \n     that is to say, we have a strong tradition to give more than \n     enough belief and reliance to the government to decide \n     whether a person is guilty or not. Even though we are trying \n     to apply modern criminal procedure strictly to protect the \n     legal rights of accused persons, the phenomenon of \n     disregarding the suspects' legal rights still exists. More \n     time is needed to change, and I hope the sooner the better.\n       Judicially speaking, we have used the standard of the \n     presumption of guilt for many years, as it was hard to \n     believe that a person could be innocent when he/she was \n     accused of a crime in the past. From 1997, we began to apply \n     a new standard of the presumption of innocence, however, in \n     reality, we could not completely remove the influence of the \n     old notion. I am sure things will change with the development \n     of law in China.\n       Economically speaking, we have been focusing more on \n     economic development than on social justice. Sometimes we do \n     not have time to pay attention to the legal rights of accused \n     persons. But now we have put forward the social object of \n     justice, which no legal right can be ignored, nor can be the \n     accused persons' legal rights.\n       As far as I know, the difference about the protection of \n     the rights of the accused persons between America and China \n     is so large that it is usually difficult for us to understand \n     and agree with each other. Personally speaking, I think that \n     America may give too much protection to the accused person, \n     which is not very often good for the control of crime, and \n     that China may pay too much attention to social stability and \n     economic development, which sometimes sacrifices the accused \n     persons' legal rights. Therefore, the two countries can make \n     efforts to find common ground through communication. This \n     program will surely enhance the mutual understanding of each \n     other's legal systems.\n       I also know that it is your instrumental role in promoting \n     this program that makes the judicial communication between \n     America and China so specific and effective. All the students \n     of the program have benefitted a lot from the program, and we \n     will play a fundamental role in the legal communication \n     between America and China.\n       Once again thanks for your continued attention to the \n     program and to us students. We will try our best to study in \n     the program. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on \n     this matter.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                              Feng Zhaojiu/Thomas,\n                               Student of LL.M of Temple/Tsinghua.\n\n[[Page S8943]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n              My Impression of the Temple/Tsinghua Program\n\n       Senator Specter: First of all thanks for your supports to \n     the program and meeting with us!\n       The exchange and cooperation between Temple University and \n     Tsinghua University law school is very valuable. It provides \n     a good platform for Chinese judges, prosecutors, attorneys, \n     and government officials to understand the legal system of \n     the United States. The Master of Laws Program of Temple/\n     Tsinghua University provides legal education that causes \n     fruitful development in China. It opens a window for us to \n     use the advanced legal system of the United States for \n     references.\n       I come from the Dongying Intermediate Court of Shandong \n     Province. I have been working as a criminal judge for six \n     years, hearing more than 150 cases. I chose to attend this \n     program with the encouragement of my American teachers when I \n     studied in National Judicial College this year. What \n     impressed me most is their patience and responsibility!\n       As to this program, I wish that it could contain more \n     hands-on practical training, so that it could be even more \n     efficient and valuable to us. In addition, I wish we can be \n     given more lectures by American judges, prosecutors, and \n     government officials; this will provide us additional \n     information to help us carry out our jobs as judges in China.\n       Finally, this program is a big challenge to me because \n     English is not my native language, and America's legal \n     culture is very different from China's legal culture. I will \n     do my best to achieve my goal in the program, meanwhile I \n     wish I can obtain more help. I know it is only beginning, \n     even if I can survive the LLM program! My dream is to become \n     an excellent judge. In the future, I wish I can do some \n     beneficial work for judicial exchange and cooperation between \n     China and the United States.\n\n                                                  Chen Litian,\n\n     Graduate of the LLM of Temple/Tsinghua University.\n                                  ____\n\n       August 24, 2006.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am very pleased to write this \n     letter to you. I truly admire you for your abundant \n     experience and your contribution to the judicial relationship \n     between the United States and China. Your excellent and \n     useful lecture impressed me deeply.\n       I am a young female Chinese judge of Bayannaor Intermediate \n     Court in Inner Mongolia. I was appointed to the judiciary in \n     March 1997.\n       I am very lucky to have this good opportunity to take part \n     in Temple/Tsinghua LLM program. First of all, it is very \n     convenient for Chinese law practitioners to learn the legal \n     system of the United States at Tsinghua, which is a famous \n     university in China, and then spend two months at Temple \n     University in Philadelphia. We really appreciate the \n     financial aid supplied by the American government. Secondly, \n     the program has opened a broad vision for us to master the \n     American legal system in such a short time with the help of \n     American law professors. Thirdly, the ``checks and balances'' \n     principle of the American legal system causes us to \n     reconsider our own legal system, as it is also very helpful \n     as a model for Chinese judicial reform.\n       As a judge, I have handled over 200 cases including both \n     civil cases and criminal cases. In dealing with cases, I have \n     found many problems which need to be solved in the Chinese \n     legal system, although there has been progress: such as when \n     police officers question suspects in the investigation \n     process, and when lawyers or records are needed. We have \n     absorbed American due process theory and set up a similar \n     system. However, other problems need to be solved. For \n     instance, there is only one Civil Code and one Civil \n     Procedure Law in China. All judges apply the same law, but \n     different judges make different decisions on similar factual \n     matters. The parties cannot understand the results. I was \n     taught some the fundamentals of U.S. law and the legal system \n     by professors of Temple University. I found the interaction \n     very useful to help me solve legal problems in my own \n     practice. The Supreme People's Court of China should set up \n     some cases system to instruct judges in applying new laws and \n     principles.\n       I believe this study experience in Temple University will \n     bring me great success in my future career.\n           Sincerely.\n     Wei Xiaoxia.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Tsinghua University Beijing.\n\n                                                   August 20, 2006\n       Hon. Senator Specter: I do appreciate your visit! Thank you \n     very much for your care and support for our program!\n       I have been engaged in civil case trials for 15 years in \n     the Fujian Province High People's Court. I first worked in \n     the civil division for 11 years, and now work in supervision \n     division. It is my honor to enter the LLM of Temple \n     University at Tsinghua University.\n       The function of the judge in the civil law and common law \n     systems is different. However, the role of Chinese judges is \n     undergoing change with the development of China. Judges no \n     longer apply law mechanically. We are realizing the \n     transformation of adapting the letter of the law to social \n     reality and demands. No judge acquires the wisdom to apply \n     laws without long-term study and practice. The judicial \n     system based on case law is the essential element of American \n     law. This is just what we should learn and refer to. So never \n     can we learn the extensive and profound American law without \n     the knowledge of a specific case and its process. So we need \n     this opportunity to learn.\n       Although I have rich work experience and profound basis of \n     legal theory, I wish to enlarge my scope of knowledge, to \n     acquire more knowledge of the U.S. legal system, by taking \n     advantage of this opportunity. I also want to improve my \n     knowledge base in order to excel in my duties as a judge in \n     the future.\n       Thank you again!\n           Yours faithfully,\n     Zhao, Yumei.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am glad to have attended the \n     meeting in which I met with you in Beijing on July 11th. It \n     is a great honor for me to further discuss with you the topic \n     of the Temple Program's value to strengthen the cooperation \n     and communication between the Sino-US legal systems.\n       I am the deputy presiding judge of the No. 1 Civil Tribunal \n     (trial of civil cases, mainly including real estate, tort, \n     contract, and domestic relations) of the Intermediate \n     People's Court of Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. I began my \n     judicial career in the court since I graduated from China \n     University of Political Science & Law in Beijing in 1994. \n     During that same year, I passed the National Lawyer's \n     Qualification Exam. I have worked as a clerk, an assistant \n     judge, and a judge in the same court for more than 12 years. \n     In 2004, I passed the entrance exam of Juris Master Degree in \n     Pudan University (located in Shanghai. 126 kilometres away \n     from Wuxi City) with the third highest score and am pursuing \n     that degree part time.\n       Since 1999, I have been engaged in the trial of tort, \n     contract, intellectual property, bankruptcy, and commercial \n     matters involving foreign aspects as a judge in my court. In \n     2004. I become a presiding judge through tough competition. \n     At present, all the cases which I was the main judge and \n     wrote judicial opinions for have exceeded 370, not including \n     those which I took part in as a member of the panel or a \n     presiding judge.\n       Through my resume, you can imagine how challenging and \n     exciting the job is. I am strongly interested in the \n     practical trial of cases while I deeply know the importance \n     of legal research beside the overload of the job. 1 like to \n     read valuable treatises and communicate with other \n     outstanding judges and some scholars to broaden my eyesight.\n       On Feb. 2006, I was selected to attend the program of \n     training judges co-sponsored by the P.R. China Judicial \n     College and Temple University. It is a good opportunity to \n     obtain an international view over the Chinese legal system \n     and jump out from the busy daily work to think about what I \n     can do to improve it.\n       This three-month training course is very impressive. As one \n     of the monitors of the training course, I fully noticed that \n     all the professors in the group treated the job seriously and \n     devoted their extra efforts to adapt to our critical judges. \n     For example, Professor Melindah Bush, the group leader, was \n     so popular that she approved our request for her to give more \n     lectures every weekend and kept doing it from the first \n     beginning till the last end. She also invited some \n     experienced and smart personal friends to give us extra and \n     helpful lectures, all at which exceeded the duty she must do \n     and showed the program's friendliness and flexibility to \n     adapt to our needs. Another example is Professor Peter \n     Castagnaro, an expert in linguistics, who tried to convince \n     us, mostly in our thirties or forties, to commence a \n     scientific new style to learn English as a foreign language, \n     which proved to be very effective. He even brought A4 paper \n     for us to do homework when he heard we talked about the \n     inconvenience to buy it. Surely the result of the training \n     course manifested that their works brought us so many new \n     ideas and was so successful that all the judges requested the \n     program to be extended as long as possible until most of them \n     must go to New York for the next stage training course. We \n     were very grateful to see the request had been met again.\n       For my individual point of view, I acquired a general idea \n     of American legal system from the judges training program. \n     Different with an American attorney's emphasis on the \n     distinction between Sino-US legal systems, whose lecture \n     pointed out more than 10 differences, I found more important \n     the common points between the two legal systems and arrived \n     at a conclusion that doing further research about US legal \n     system will be very helpful to improve our own legal system. \n     As a judge, I prefer to avoid to arrive at any hasty \n     decisions. But the extremely effective training program is a \n     powerful supporting evidence to encourage me to apply for \n     attending the Temple-Tsinghua LLM Program. I believe the \n     precious opportunity will be beneficial to enhance my \n     judicial ability and enable me to share new knowledge with \n     other Chinese judges. I hope I can make full use of the time \n     in the LLM program, learn new and practical ideas as much as \n     possible to improve my court's judicial reform, and become \n     familiar with the American culture and promote the \n     communication and understanding between the people.\n       Finally, I shall express my deepest thanks to your kind \n     support and serious concern with the program which provides \n     such an effective way for me to learn something valuable to \n     improve our judicial work and\n\n[[Page S8944]]\n\n     strengthen the understanding of US legal system.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                     Shen Dongemi,\n           Judge of the Intermediate People's Court of Wuxi City, \n     Jiangsu Province, P.R.

I spent August in Vermont, a \nmatter of no great sacrifice I must say, but nevertheless a very busy \nmonth.\n  That made me think, Madam President, when we returned today from \nrecess, we have less than 4 weeks remaining in this legislative \nsession. With so little time remaining, I hope we can join to make real \nprogress on the issues that have languished unresolved, the real issues \nthat matter most to the American people. We spend a lot of time talking \nabout issues that really do not matter to the American people and \nignoring those issues that do.\n  I urge the administration and the Republican leadership of the House \nand Senate to recognize the failures that have set us back as a nation. \nWe are ready to work together to rectify those failures.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney struck the absolute \nwrong note when they recently labeled as ``appeasers'' the majority of \nAmericans who recognize the disastrous war in Iraq as distracting them \nfrom winning the war on terror. Basically, they are saying anyone who \nquestions their mistakes or points out their mistakes is nearly \ntreasonous. My God, we have not heard talk like that since the days of \nKing George. And that led to the revolution that made us a country.\n  Again, this week, the Democratic leadership reached out to the \nPresident on this important issue. Rather than name-calling and seeking \nto divide Americans, rather than fostering fear and seeking to scare \nAmericans into staying the disastrous course on which the Government \nremains headed, I urge Republican leaders to join to fight a smarter \nwar on terror so we can make America safer.\n  The cronyism, the incompetence that brought us the devastating \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina cannot continue to define Government \naction. With more Americans in poverty, and extreme poverty, with more \nchildren without health care, we must do better. America can do better.\n  With rising interest rates, rising mortgage rates, rising health care \ncosts, rising insurance costs, we must do better for America's working \nfamilies. America can do better.\n  While corporate profits have taken a greater and greater share of our \ngross national product, wages are stagnant. Those in charge refuse to \nallow a long overdue raise to the minimum wage. We have just come \nthrough a summer of record-high gas prices. For many families, the \nthreat of record-high home heating prices this winter is around the \ncorner. Yet this will be another year in which this administration will \nnot raise the minimum wage.\n  As we approach the fifth anniversary of the attacks of September 11, \n2001, we are more aware of the painful failure of the Federal \nGovernment in neglecting to protect the Nation from those attacks. \nSeptember 11 could have been avoided. Our Government dropped the ball. \nWe did not protect the Nation. In these last 5 years, the \nadministration's decision to send hundreds of thousands of Americans \ninto Iraq, diverting attention and resources from the hunt for Osama \nbin Laden and the fight against al-Qaida--those loom largest among the \nmany mistakes they have made which have created a more dangerous and \nthreatening world.\n  How sad, how discouraging, how needless, and how ominous it has been \nthe past 5 years to see the national and international unity we had \nafter those horrific attacks squandered by this administration's crass \npolitics, their arrogant unilateralism, their misguided policies.\n  It was around the time of the second anniversary of September 11 that \nDefense Secretary Rumsfeld put his finger\n\n[[Page S8945]]\n\non a key question in the fight against terrorism, when he asked whether \nwe were creating or eliminating more terrorists through our actions. \nThere can now be little doubt about the honest answer to the question \nabout the actions taken by this administration over the last 5 years. \nDoes anyone doubt the impact of the occupation of Iraq, the images from \nAbu Ghraib, the international scandal at Guantanamo, and the war \nprofiteering by huge defense contractors?\n  Our own State Department, the Bush State Department, had to revise \nits reports on international terrorism in order to reflect a more \nhonest assessment of the growing incidence of terrorism violence.\n  Hamas and Hezbollah are winning elections, as are hardliners in Iran \nand elsewhere throughout the Middle East. We see American soldiers, \nbrave American soldiers, trapped in the sectarian violence in Iraq. We \nsee the situation every day in Afghanistan deteriorating.\n  Meanwhile, we have lost precious time to confront growing threats \nfrom Iran and North Korea and the Middle East. They are more \nthreatening than any time in recent memory.\n  The administration resisted recent efforts to examine what led to the \ntragic events of September 11. The administration does not want the \nrubberstamp Congress to ask them what they did, why they allowed \nSeptember 11 to happen in the first place.\n  They resisted the creation of a Department of Homeland Security. They \nresisted the formation of the 9/11 Commission because they knew it \nwould ask the question: Why did September 11 happen during the Bush \nadministration? And they failed to implement many of the Commission's \nmost important recommendations.\n  Recently, President Bush held a press conference. He conceded what we \nall know: Iraq had ``nothing'' to do with the attack on the World Trade \nCenter. Then he skipped quickly over the main reason we went into Iraq; \nnamely, his erroneous contention that Iraq had weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  A growing roster of conservative Republicans, from William Buckley \non, is now acknowledging the failure of this administration's strategy \nin Iraq.\n  Even as sectarian violence has continued to grow among Iraqis, as the \nlosses it causes to America continue to mount, the administration \ntolerates no criticism or, worse yet, listens to no new perspectives on \na deteriorating situation. They stubbornly insist: Stay on this \nuncorrected course for another 2\\1/2\\ years--this from a President who, \nwhen he first ran for office, told our country he was against nation \nbuilding and against foreign military antagonists.\n  It is difficult to come together and to move forward when the \nadministration will not acknowledge that its historic miscalculations \nthat led to the current situation. When they are not ignoring the past, \nthey simply excuse it. The excuses for their failures are mockingly the \nsame.\n  In May 2002, the then-National Security Adviser, now Secretary of \nState, said:\n\n       I don't think anybody could have predicted that these \n     people would take an airplane and slam it into the World \n     Trade Center . . . that they would try to use an airplane as \n     a missile.\n\n  Of course, that was not true. The 9/11 Commission showed how the Bush \nadministration had received many of the September 11 warnings that that \nwas exactly what they were going to do.\n  In September 2005, President Bush responded to the destruction of New \nOrleans by saying:\n\n       I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.\n\n  Of course, that was wrong. Of course, local papers and others had \ndiscussed this hurricane disaster scenario and others for years. It was \npredicted.\n  And earlier this summer, Vice President Cheney said about Iraq:\n\n       I don't think anybody anticipated the level of violence \n     that we've encountered.\n\n  And a military spokesman said:\n\n       I don't think anyone could have anticipated the sectarian \n     violence.\n\n  Of course, neither of these statements was accurate since sectarian \nviolence was a known risk. It was even a predicted risk from the \noutset. It is one of the reasons so many opposed going there in the \nfirst place.\n  Just as this administration's justification for U.S. involvement in \nIraq continued to shift from one to the next, its excuses ring hollow \nwhen they refuse to acknowledge their errors and instead claim \ninfallibility. ``Just trust us'' long ago proved its failure as a Bush \nadministration policy.\n  Ours is the strongest military in the world, but there are limits to \nmilitary power. That military power and resources must never be \nsquandered. Many people who have actively served in the military knew \nthat. The President's father knew that. General Powell knew that. \nPresident Eisenhower, the military hero of World War II, a Republican \nPresident, knew that.\n  Unfortunately, this administration, thousands of lives later, \nhundreds of billions of dollars later, is just beginning to learn it in \nwhat has proven to be a disaster of historic proportions.\n  Imagine how different our situation would be today if we had not \nshifted our lead forces from Afghanistan to Iraq at the critical moment \nwhen we had Osama bin Laden cornered, when we were about to find him. \nWhat if the President had done what we unanimously asked him to do, go \nget Osama bin Laden, the man who engineered September 11. We had him on \nthe run. We let him go, and we went into a futile war in Iraq.\n  In the years since then, the Iraq war has stretched our military to \nthe breaking point. It has sapped hundreds of millions of dollars and \npreoccupied our attention. The White House has even disbanded the \nintelligence unit that for a year was dedicated to tracking down Osama \nbin Laden. All those nations that were on our side after September 11, \n2001, now do not support us.\n  What have we done? A diversion to Iraq has only succeeded in creating \na new breeding ground for terrorists and in emboldening the rogue \nstates to harbor and supply them. Starting this unnecessary war in Iraq \ndid not make us more secure, it has made us less secure. And worse yet, \nthe Bush administration allowed Osama bin Laden to escape.\n\n  We need to adjust our course in order to effectively confront the \nthreat of terrorism. We do not need excuses and name calling. We need \nhonesty and determination. We need not just conventional military might \nbut better intelligence, stronger alliances, repaired alliances, and \nbetter information sharing. We need to use our resources for homeland \nsecurity, to protect our ports, our planes, our industrial plants, and \nour vital resources.\n  Let us function as a constitutional democracy and act within a moral \nframework and legitimate legal rules. Let us be that democratic model \nto the world that America often has been and should be today. Let us \nshow the strength and resolve of a free people, not a fearful people. \nLet us set a new direction to counterterrorism on our own terms, with \nAmerican skill and with American values.\n  This summer we expressed our gratitude to British authorities for \ndisrupting a plot that reportedly endangered the citizens of both our \ncountries. That episode and the fifth anniversary, next week, of the \nattacks of \n9/11 are reminders there is little margin for error in countering \nterrorism.\n  We need to refocus our attention and resources from the divisions \nthat plague Iraq to eliminating the misdirection and mismanagement that \nstill diverts us from an effective international strategy to protect \nthe American people from terrorism. We need to be smarter and stronger \nto make America safer. We can do better. America can do better.\n  For almost 5 years since the Government failed to protect us from 9/\n11, Bush administration officials in charge of security have been \nsaying it is not a question of whether al-Qaida will attack us again \nbut when. We need to do better. We need to do better. We should look at \nthe mistakes that allowed 9/11 to happen. We should look at the \ncolossal mistake that allowed Osama bin Laden to escape. We as America \nneed to do better.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not see others on the floor seeking \nrecognition, so let me continue.\n  The full agenda before us, as we enter the final weeks of this \nlegislative session, reflects how little this Republican\n\n[[Page S8946]]\n\nleadership has accomplished, even when it has control of the White \nHouse, a Republican President, rubberstamp Republican leadership in \nboth the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n  We have had a steady course of misguided priorities, including \nweeks--weeks--spent on constitutional amendments designed to restrict \nAmericans' rights and the misuse of Congress's time and authority to \ninterfere in court battles over the medical treatment of Terri Schiavo. \nThese distractions have done nothing to help our country but instead \ncost Americans progress on real issues that matter most.\n  These failures to focus on our real priorities have left America less \nsecure. I look forward to a representative Congress that focuses on the \nNation's real priorities. For example, the Republican-controlled \nCongress has yet to enact a Federal budget; this notwithstanding that \nthe law required them to do it by April 15 of this year. The Republican \nleadership of the House and Senate decided to ignore the law and not \npass one.\n  We have passed but one appropriations bill, and we are required by \nlaw to pass 13. We have yet to reconcile and enact lobbying reform and \nethics legislation. We have yet to deal with the skyrocketing cost of \ngasoline and health care. We have yet to reconcile and enact a \nbipartisan and comprehensive immigration reform bill. And the press \nreports today that the Republican leadership has decided they will not \ndo that. And for the second year in a row, the Republican-led Senate \nwill not even take up the annual intelligence authorization bill so we \ncould vote up or down, even though they have a majority in their own \nparty here.\n  As we commemorated the 1-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina last \nweek, we were reminded that the situation in the gulf coast remains a \ntragedy with serious human consequences. We need to commit ourselves \nand our resources to helping our fellow citizens who are still in need \nafter the appalling lack of responsiveness by this administration. We \nneed to provide the assistance to that region of our country where \nrubble remains a fixture of the landscape 1 year later. We are spending \ntens of millions--hundreds of millions--storing trailers that will \nnever be used. Some contractors have made billions, but people remain \nhomeless. This is our Department of Homeland Security that is supposed \nto be able to react at a moment's notice if we have a danger. Here, \neven though they were given days of warning, they did not react. And \nwhen they did, it was one fumble after another, while the \nadministration gave statements saying: Everything is under control. It \nreminds me of the President standing on the aircraft carrier saying: \nMission accomplished.\n  But not just the residents of the Gulf Coast who cannot return to \nhomes or return to jobs, all Americans have to prepare for the threat \nof an avian flu pandemic so we do not see the repeat of last winter, \nwhen the Government was unprepared for a typical winter flu season. Mr. \nPresident, throughout your lifetime and my lifetime, every single \nyear--every single year--we have had a flu season. And last year the \nadministration acted surprised that we had a flu season. We should take \naction to preserve and improve rather than pollute the environment. \nProtecting our environment has become a pressing issue that has public \nsafety and serious health consequences for all Americans, today and \ntomorrow. That demands immediate attention.\n  We cannot ignore the destruction already wrought by the \nadministration's ill-advised, head-in-the-sand policies. We have to \nprovide resources that our returning veterans need at home. We spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars for health care facilities in Iraq that \nwill never be used. Yet we are cutting back on health care facilities \nin America that our veterans need. America can do better. We spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars, ostensibly, to build schools in Iraq \nthat will never be used, and our schools in America are falling apart \nwithout money for them. We can spend hundreds of millions of dollars \nfor law enforcement in Iraq, law enforcement that has proven \nparticularly ineffective, and, at the same time, we are cutting \nmillions of dollars for law enforcement in America, while our crime \nrates skyrocket. America can do better.\n\n  The Senate can make progress, but it has to work together. Today, we \nconsider the nomination of Kimberly Ann Moore for a lifetime \nappointment to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In the \nweeks before the recess, we confirmed several nominees to the Nation's \nimportant circuit courts.\n  Working together, the Senate confirmed two circuit nominees and two \nFederal trial court nominees in a matter of minutes in one afternoon. \nThat, I might point out, is the kind of progress we can make when the \nPresident nominates qualified, consensus nominees.\n  When she is confirmed, Ms. Moore will be the 7th circuit court \nnominee and the 30th judge overall confirmed this year. Compare this \nwith those left unconfirmed in the 1996 congressional session, when \nRepublicans controlled the Senate and they stalled the nominations of \nPresident Clinton. And in that year, Republicans would not confirm a \nsingle appellate court judge--not one. Here, today, we will have our \nseventh appellate court judge. I think of the 61--61--judges of \nPresident Clinton who were pocket filibustered by a Republican-\ncontrolled Senate.\n  I think of the irony that in the 17 months of President Bush's term \nin office when the Democrats controlled the Senate, we actually \nconfirmed President Bush's judges faster than has been done under a \nRepublican-controlled Senate. You would not know that from the speeches \nthat are made.\n  But today is a day to congratulate Ms. Moore on her confirmation. I \nhope she will be the kind of judge who will apply the law fairly and \nprotect the rights of all litigants appearing in her courtroom. There \nare some superb people on that court. I think of such people as Judge \nRichard Linn. He should be a model for her as to the kind of judge this \nNation deserves. He is one of the more senior members of that court. \nThat is the kind of person I hope she will emulate.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, of course, again, I will yield the floor if \nsomebody else seeks time.\n  I do not mean this in an unfair way because the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, of course, is not allowed to speak. I commend him. \nHe comes from a wonderful State. It has been my privilege to visit \nthere. I suspect it is a lot like Vermont. You have a chance to go into \nthese small towns and cities, to go to county fairs and meet people. I \nhave known the Presiding Officer to be a very accessible person when he \nwas a Governor, when he was a member of the Cabinet, and now as a \nSenator. I try to do the same thing in my own State.\n  During this past month, I have gone all over the State of Vermont. I \nhave talked to people. I have attended funerals of brave soldiers \nkilled in Iraq from Vermont. Vermont has lost more soldiers per capita \nthan any other State in the country. And it is interesting, in a small \nState such as ours, as to the people you see at these funerals, \neverybody knows everybody else. I walk out and I see people whom I went \nto grade school with or people who knew my parents or I knew them or \ntheir families. We are there, and the other Members of the \ncongressional delegation, the Governor, and nobody goes by a title. Our \nadjutant general is usually referred to as Mike. I am called Pat. There \nis Jim and Bernie and so on.\n  We're a very proud State. We're a very patriotic State. We're a very \nhonest State. We're the 14th State in the Nation, and we have answered \nthe call. People wonder if maybe the call has been distorted this time. \nThey wonder what this war does for our security. As I said earlier, I \nbelieve it has made us less secure as a nation, not more secure. They \nwonder where the failures were in Government that allowed 9/11 to \nhappen in the first place. And, of course, as more information has come \nout, it could have been avoided, should have been avoided, should have \nbeen avoided. And they wonder if the lessons have been learned about \nthat.\n  They see Homeland Security that should be able to respond to any \nemergency, even that on a second's notice, and yet they see that it \nfailed to respond to Katrina there was all kinds of\n\n[[Page S8947]]\n\nnotice. They see Republicans and Democrats joined together saying: Go \nget Osama bin Laden. And the administration does not get Osama bin \nLaden. Instead, they divert those forces to go into Iraq in a war we \ndid not need and one that has made us less secure. They even disbanded \nthe special intelligence unit that has been tracking Osama bin Laden.\n  But worse yet--and I heard this from Republicans and Democrats alike \nin my State--when the Secretary of Defense and others in the \nadministration say if you raise questions, if you point out their \nmistakes, somehow you are aiding the enemy, however defined, that you \nare not being patriotic. I am reminded to paraphrase Mark Twain. He \nsaid: Love your country. Question your Government.\n  A lot of people in my State--Republicans and Democrats--say there is \na great deal to question today.\n  I hope they will continue to do so. I hope they will never fail to do \nso. I hope that those people who have the audacity in America--the \nfreest democracy on Earth--that those leaders in our Government who \nhave the audacity to question the patriotism of Americans who question \ntheir mistakes will themselves be quiet and leave--leave the stage.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I support the President's nomination of \nKimberly Ann Moore of Falls Church, VA, to be a U.S. Circuit Court \nJudge for the Federal Circuit. I was pleased, along with Senator Allen, \nto introduce Ms. Moore to the Judiciary Committee on June 28, 2006, and \nit is my privilege to speak again on her behalf.\n  All of us recognize the importance of the position to which President \nBush has nominated Ms. Moore. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal \nCircuit stands as one of the 13 Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals that \noperate just under the U.S. Supreme Court. The Federal Circuit, which \nconsists of 12 judges, is a unique court in that it has nationwide \njurisdiction in a variety of subject areas, including international \ntrade, government contracts, patents, trademarks, certain money claims \nagainst the U.S. Government, and veterans' benefits cases.\n  Given the court's highly technical jurisdiction, there is no doubt \nthat serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is a \nchallenging task. In my view, based on Ms. Moore's educational \nbackground and her legal and technical expertise, she is clearly up to \nthe task.\n  Ms. Moore received her undergraduate degree in 1990 in electrical \nengineering from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \nA year later, she earned her masters of science and earned an \nimpressive grade point average of 4.8 out of a 5-point scale. The \nnominee then went on to graduate cum laude from Georgetown University \nLaw Center in 1994.\n  Subsequent to graduation, Ms. Moore entered private practice where \nshe worked as an associate at the well- respected law firm of Kirkland \n& Ellis. While at the firm, Ms. Moore specialized in intellectual \nproperty litigation.\n  In 1995, the nominee left private practice to serve as a law clerk \nfor the Honorable Glenn L. Archer, Jr., then-chief judge of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Ms. Moore served a 2-year \nclerkship on the court.\n  After her clerkship, the nominee joined the faculty at the Chicago-\nKent College of Law and, later the University of Maryland School of \nLaw. At both law schools, Ms. Moore taught patent and trademark law. \nBeginning in 2000, Ms. Moore spent 3 years as an intellectual property \nlitigation counsel at the firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in Washington \nDC. At the same time, however, she still managed to work in academia, \nteaching law as an associate professor at the George Mason University \nSchool of Law. In 2004, Ms. Moore became a full professor of law at \nGeorge Mason University where she teaches intellectual property law.\n  It is impressive to note that throughout her legal career the nominee \nhas written and delivered over 60 published articles, books, and \nspeeches, mostly in the realm of intellectual property law. Moreover, \nMs. Moore has earned accolades from the National Law Journal, which \nrecently selected her as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in \nAmerica.\n  In my view, Ms. Moore is obviously very well qualified to serve as a \njudge on this prestigious court. I look forward to the Senate \nconfirming this fine nominee overwhelmingly.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the confirmation of Kimberly Moore to be a circuit judge on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n  Kimberly Moore is a Falls Church, VA resident and a full tenured law \nprofessor at George Mason University.\n  Among other cases, the Federal Circuit hears all patent appeals from \nthe district courts and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Kimberly \nMoore is uniquely qualified to serve on this distinguished court.\n  First, Ms. Moore has a strong technical background with two degrees \nfrom the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a bachelor of science \nin electrical engineering, and a master of science and work experience \nas an engineer with the Naval Surface Warfare Center.\n  Also, Ms. Moore has a great deal of experience with the Federal \nCircuit itself. She is on the board of governors of the Federal Circuit \nBar Association, has been editor-in-chief of the Federal Circuit Bar \nJournal for 8 years, and has been selected as a mediator in the Federal \nCircuit's Pilot Appellate Mediation Program.\n  As a professor, Kimberly Moore has taught courses in patent law, \npatent litigation, trademark law, and Federal circuit practice. In \nfact, she coauthored the casebook ``Patent Litigation & Strategy,'' \nwith the current chief judge of the Federal Circuit, Paul Michel, and a \nprominent practitioner, Raphael Lupo. Kimberly Moore has written more \nthan a dozen law review articles on patent law and litigation and \nspoken at more than 40 conferences on patent topics.\n  As a lawyer, Kimberly Moore has consulted with firms on patent cases \nand appeals to the Federal Circuit. She has also served as an expert \nwitness in dozens of patent cases. In fact, just this month, Kimberly \nMoore was named one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America by \nthe National Law Journal.\n  I am pleased that President Bush has chosen to nominate someone with \nsuch a strong background in patent law to the Federal Circuit. Kimberly \nMoore will be an excellent addition to the court.\n  I strongly support the confirmation of Ms. Kimberly Moore to be \ncircuit judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and \nurge my colleagues to support this confirmation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am happy to see that we are scheduled \nto confirm today the nomination of Kimberly Ann Moore, of Virginia, to \nbe U.S. Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit. It is about time that we \nget back to confirming judges, and I am glad to see that our leader is \nputting this issue back on the Senate's agenda.\n  It is of utmost importance that the Senate continue to confirm \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. Just last month, we saw what can \nhappen when an ideologically driven activist judge attempts to create \nnational security policy. Judge Anna Diggs Taylor, a Federal district \njudge in Michigan appointed by President Carter in 1979, ruled that the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program was unconstitutional. This program, \nadministered by the National Security Agency, has been a critical \ncomponent in ensuring the safety of millions of Americans. Despite \nthat, Judge Diggs Taylor ruled that the program, which the Government \nonly uses to intercept international telephone and internet \ncommunications, violates the first and fourth amendments to the \nConstitution, the Administrative Procedures Act, and the Separation of \nPowers doctrine, in other words the veritable legal kitchen sink.\n  While some on the other side of the aisle have rejoiced in this \ndecision, this opinion has been attacked from both ends of the \npolitical spectrum. The Washington Post, in an editorial on August 18, \nnoted that the decision is neither careful nor scholarly, and it is\n\n[[Page S8948]]\n\nhard-hitting only in the sense that a bludgeon is hard-hitting. The \nangry rhetoric of U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor will no doubt \ngrab headlines. But as a piece of judicial work--that is, as a guide to \nwhat the law requires and how it either restrains or permits the NSA's \nprogram--her opinion will not be helpful.\n  Legal scholars have also criticized Judge Diggs Taylor's opinion. Let \nme give you just a few of these criticisms. David B. Rivkin, a former \nJustice Department official in Reagan's and George H.W. Bush's \nadministrations, noted in a New York Times op-ed on August 18 that \n``[i]t is an appallingly bad opinion, both from a philosophical and \ntechnical perspective, manifesting strong bias.''\n  Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe has written ``[i]t's altogether \ntoo easy to make disparaging remarks about the quality of the Taylor \nopinion, which seems almost to have been written more to poke a finger \nin the President's eye than to please the legal commentariat or even, \nalas, to impress an appellate panel . . . .''\n  Howard Bashman, an appellate attorney and editor of the How Appealing \nlegal blog, wrote in the New York Times on August 19 that ``[i]t does \nappear that folks on all sides of the spectrum, both those who support \nit and those who oppose it, say the decision is not strongly grounded \nin legal authority.''\n  UCLA Law Professor Eugene Volokh wrote on his widely read blog: ``the \njudge's opinion . . . seems not just ill-reasoned, but rhetorically \nill-conceived. . . . [B]y writing an opinion that was too much feeling \nand too little careful argument, the judge in this case made it less \nlikely that the legal approach she feels so strongly about will \nultimately become law.''\n  In contrast to Judge Anna Diggs Taylor, both of President Bush's \nnominees to the Supreme Court, Justices Roberts and Alito, understand \nthat it is not the role of the judicial branch to make policy. During \nhis confirmation hearings last year, Supreme Court Chief Justice John \nRoberts said, ``I don't think you want judges who will decide cases \nbefore them under the law on what they think is good, simply good \npolicy for America.'' He also noted, ``[T]he Court has to appreciate \nthat the reason they have that authority is because they're \ninterpreting the law, they're not making policy, and to the extent they \ngo beyond their confined limits and make policy or execute the law, \nthey lose their legitimacy, and I think that calls into question the \nauthority they will need when it's necessary to act in the face of \nunconstitutional action.''\n  Similarly, Justice Samuel Alito remarked during his confirmation \nhearing that ``results-oriented jurisprudence is never justified \nbecause it is not our job to try to produce particular results. We are \nnot policy makers and we shouldn't be implementing any sort of policy \nagenda or policy preferences that we have.''\n  Yes, Justices Roberts and Alito have it right. It is not the role of \na judge to seek to replace the legislature, or the President, State \nlegislatures, and the Governors, township supervisors, county councils \nwith his or her own views. It is the role of a judge to apply the law \nand to do justice based on the facts in solving the dispute that has \nbeen presented.\n  A court is not a place for zealous advocates to impose their will \nupon the American public. It is not a place for people who believe \ntheir views as judges are superior to the views of the democratically \nelected officials in this country--better put, that their views are \nbetter than the people's views because we are, in fact, accountable to \nthe people we represent. It is and should continue to be a place for \nthose public servants who seek to do justice under the law and facts of \neach case and a place to interpret the law, rather than make law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4882\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4882.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 4882.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To protect civilian lives from unexploded cluster munitions)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8109. No funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be obligated or expended to \n     acquire, utilize, sell, or transfer any cluster munition \n     unless the rules of engagement applicable to the cluster \n     munition ensure that the cluster munition will not be used in \n     or near any concentrated population of civilians, whether \n     permanent or temporary, including inhabited parts of cities \n     or villages, camps or columns of refugees or evacuees, or \n     camps or groups of nomads.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Vermont \nand myself, I offer an amendment to the Defense appropriations bill to \naddress a humanitarian issue that I have actually thought a great deal \nabout over a long period of time; that is, the use of the cluster bomb. \nThe human death toll and injury from these weapons is felt every day, \ngoing back decades. Innocent children think they are picking up a play \ntoy in the field and suddenly their arm is blown off.\n  I believe we need to take a look at our policies and adjust them. \nSpecifically, our amendment would prevent any funds from being spent to \npurchase, use, or transfer cluster munitions until the rules of \nengagement have been adopted by the Department of Defense to ensure \nthat such munitions will not be used in or near any concentration of \ncivilians, be it permanent or temporary, such as inhabited\n\n[[Page S8949]]\n\nparts of cities or villages or in camps or columns of refugees or \nevacuees.\n  Every year, hundreds of civilians are killed and many more are \ninjured due to unexploded cluster bombs. From the fields of Vietnam, \nLaos, and Cambodia, through the streets of Kosovo and Iraq, to the arid \nhills of Afghanistan and the playgrounds of Lebanon, these lethal \nrelics of war continue to cripple life, hope, and peace.\n  Cluster munitions are large bombs, rockets, or artillery shells that \ncontain up to hundreds of small submunitions or individual bomblets. \nThey are intended for attacking enemy troop formations and armor, \ncovering approximately a .6-mile radius. In other words, their swath is \nover one-half mile. Yet in practice they pose a real threat to the \nsafety of civilians when used in populated areas because they leave \nhundreds of unexploded bombs over a very large area and they are often \ninaccurate. They end up in streets and cities where men and women go to \nwork and do their shopping. They end up in groves of trees and fields \nwhere children play. They end up in homes where families live. And in \nsome cases, up to 40 percent of cluster bombs fail to explode, posing a \nparticular danger to civilians long after the conflict has ended.\n  This is particularly and sadly true of children because bomblets are \nno bigger than a D battery and in some cases resemble a tennis ball. \nChildren outside with their friends and relatives come across these \ncluster bombs. They pick them up out of curiosity because they look \nlike balls and they start playing with them and a terrible result \nfollows.\n  On March 25, 2003, Abdallah Yaqoob, whose picture is behind me, was \nsleeping on his bed in his family's home in Basra, Iraq, when he was \nhit with shrapnel from a cluster munitions strike in his neighborhood. \nHe lost his arm, and his abdomen was severely injured. Abdallah was hit \nby a British L20A1/M85 munition.\n  Falah Hassan, 13, was injured by an unexploded ground-launched \nsubmunition in Iraq on March 26, 2003. The explosion severed his right \nhand and spread shrapnel through his body. He lost his left index \nfinger and soft tissue in his lower limbs.\n  This is a photo of an unexploded M42 cluster submunition found on a \nbarbed-wire fence in southern Lebanon in August 2006. You can see the \nsize of the bomblet. Right next to it is a small pinecone. So this is a \nsmall munition hanging on a piece of barbed wire.\n  These unexploded cluster bombs become, in essence, landmines. Instead \nof targeting troop formations and enemy armor, unexploded bomblets \ntarget innocent civilians, seriously maiming or killing their victims. \nThis runs counter to our values, and I believe it also runs counter to \nthe laws of war.\n  Make no mistake, the impact of unexploded cluster bombs on civilian \npopulations has been devastating. This first came to my attention in \nLaos, many years ago. In Laos today, there are between 9 and 27 million \nunexploded cluster bombs, leftovers from our bombing campaigns in the \n1960s and 1970s. Approximately 11,000 people, 30 percent of them \nchildren, have been killed or injured since the war ended.\n  In the first gulf war, 61,000 cluster bombs were used, containing 20 \nmillion bomblets. Since 1991, unexploded bomblets have killed 1,600 \ninnocent men, women, and children and injured more than 2,500.\n  In Afghanistan in 2001, over 1,228 cluster bombs with almost a \nquarter of a million bomblets were used. Between October 2001 and \nNovember 2002, that year, 127 civilians were killed, 70 percent of them \nunder the age of 18.\n  In Iraq in 2003, 13,000 cluster bombs with 2 million bomblets were \nused. Combining the first and second gulf war, the total number of \nunexploded bomblets in the region today is 1.2 million. How many people \nwill die? Already, an estimated 1,220 Kuwaitis and 400 Iraqi civilians \nhave been killed since 1991 because they innocently picked up one of \nthese bomblets.\n  What gives rise in part to my amendment are recent developments in \nLebanon over alleged use of cluster bombs. Throughout southern Lebanon, \nmore than 405 cluster bomb sites containing approximately 100,000 \nunexploded bomblets have been discovered. Each site covers a radius of \n220 yards. As Lebanese children and families return to their homes and \nbegin to rebuild, they will be exposed to the danger of these \nunexploded bomblets lying in the rubble. Thirteen people, including \nthree young children, have been killed so far, and 48 injured. One \nUnited Nations official estimates that the rate of unexploded bomblets \nis 40 percent. So far, more than 2,000 unexploded bomblets have been \ndestroyed, but it will take 12 to 15 months to complete the effort.\n  Let me say that I join the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator \nfor Lebanon, David Shearer, in calling on Israel to provide information \non where the cluster bombs were used. Such information is vital to \nspeed up the cleanup process and save lives.\n  We have called the State Department. We have asked for information \nabout the conditions for the sale of cluster munitions to Israel, and \nwe have not been able to get that information. It seems to me that \ninformation should be readily available and transparent, particularly \nto the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  The State Department is currently looking into charges that the \ncluster bombs found in south Lebanon were American made--I do not know \nthat they were--and that they were used in violation of agreements \nbetween the United States and Israel. I do not know that they were, but \nI think we should know, and I think we should not cloak ourselves with \nignorance. I am hopeful that this inquiry will be completed as soon as \npossible and the findings reported to the Congress. If there are \nviolations, there should be consequences.\n  Looking at these figures, it is clear that several countries are \nawash with unexploded bomblets--Laos, 7 to 27 million; Iraq, 1.2 \nmillion; and then Lebanon, 100,000.\n  Some say: Why should we be doing this? I have always believed that \nthis country stands for justice, it stands for right, and it has a \nmoral compass. I believe the use of these weapons in civilian areas \nshould be stopped.\n  I also know that there is a dud rate--in other words, a rate at which \npoint these bomblets do not explode. I ask this question: How are we \nsupposed to win the hearts and minds of civilians in those countries \nwhere we leave behind such deadly weapons that indiscriminately kill \nyoung children? How are we supposed to speed up reconstruction \nefforts--building homes, schools, hospitals, clinics, ensuring \nelectricity and water supplies--when populated areas are littered with \nthese bombs? They remind innocent civilians that it was America that \nlaunched these weapons in populated areas; that it was America that \nfailed to take the necessary steps to protect them from unexploded \nbombs by demanding a low failure rate; and it was America that failed \nto remove, expeditiously, unexploded bombs.\n\n  Simply put, unexploded cluster bombs fuel anger and resentment and \nmake security stabilization and reconstruction efforts that much \nharder.\n  It is not just a humanitarian problem, it is also a military problem.\n  By showering targets with cluster bombs, we ensure that our own \npersonnel will face thousands of unexploded bombs as they move forward. \nThis forces them to change course. It slows the mission.\n  During the Iraq war, U.S. troops fired 6 rockets containing 4,000 \nbomblets to eliminate 1 artillery piece in a civilian neighborhood. \nWith a 16-percent failure rate, approximately 640 unexploded bomblets \nwere left behind. That is 1 artillery piece--6 rockets, 4,000 bomblets, \nand today 640 unexploded bomblets on the streets.\n  As an August 2003 Wall Street Journal article noted, ``Unexploded \nbomblets render significant swaths of battlefield off-limits to \nadvancing U.S. troops.''\n  In fact, during the first gulf war, unexploded cluster munitions \nkilled 22 of our own military. That was 6 percent of the total U.S. \nfatalities, and it injured 58. Former Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen \nrecognized the threat cluster bombs pose to civilians as well as our \ntroops. He issued a memorandum which became known as the Cohen policy.\n  It stated that beginning in fiscal year 2005, all new cluster \nbomblets would have a failure rate of less than 1 percent.\n  This was an important step forward, but we must remember that we \nstill\n\n[[Page S8950]]\n\nhave 5.5 million cluster bombs containing 728.5 million bomblets. That \nmeans we are still prepared to use an enormous number of cluster bombs \nthat have significant failure rates--some estimate as high as 40 \npercent.\n  Out of the 728.5 million cluster submunitions, only 30,900 have self-\ndestruct devices that would ensure a less than 1 percent so-called dud \nor unexploded failure rate. Those submunitions account for only 0.00004 \npercent of the U.S. total.\n  The Pentagon has stated that cluster bomblets with failure rates of \nmore than 1 percent ``will remain in the Department's inventory until \nused or until they have reached their extended life and are \ndemilitarized.''\n  That is pretty clear information that we are going to continue to use \nthem. I think that is wrong.\n  In fact, by fiscal year 2011, the United States will still possess \n480 million old cluster munitions with significant failure rates.\n  The latest Pentagon study on cluster bombs cite failure rates of 2 to \n6 percent for the entire U.S. arsenal. Other studies, however, \nincluding one by the GAO, found failure rates as high as 16 percent. \nU.S. marines in Karbala, Iraq, in 2003 believe the failure rate in some \nplaces was as high as 40 percent.\n  But even if you accept the conservative estimate of the Pentagon \nreport, if the United States used its entire arsenal of cluster bombs, \nwe would leave 27 million unexploded bomblets somewhere in the world. \nAnd a 16-percent failure rate would equal 117 million unexploded \nbomblets, and a 40-percent failure rate would equal 300 million \nunexploded bomblets.\n  Where am I going with all this? Think about it. Three hundred million \nunexploded bomblets spread from Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Afghanistan, \nIraq, southern Lebanon, wherever it may be, and those bomblets remain \nthere decade after decade until somebody picks them up. And then that \nsomebody is either killed or maimed for life.\n  I ask you: Is this the legacy we want to leave behind in Iraq and \nAfghanistan? Is this the legacy Israel wants to leave behind in \nLebanon? Or is this the legacy anyone that manufactures and sells these \nmunitions want to leave behind?\n  There are steps we can take to ensure a failure rate of less than 1 \npercent. And the Pentagon isn't going to do it. But at a cost of \nbetween $8 and $15, a self-destruct device can be added to cluster \nsubmunitions that destroy these munitions if, in fact, they survive \nintact.\n  The Pentagon has argued that adding this device is cost prohibitive. \nAnd it may well be.\n  The amendment of Senator Leahy and myself does not address this \nissue.\n  I would like simply to end by reading the amendment.\n\n       No funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     Act may be obligated or expended to acquire, utilize, sell, \n     or transfer any cluster munition unless the rules of \n     engagement applicable to the cluster munition ensure that the \n     cluster munition will not be used in or near any concentrated \n     population of civilians.\n\n  Is that too much to ask? That if you are going to use a cluster \nmunition which spews bomblets for a half mile that you be certain these \nare not going to be used in a civilian area? I think the answer is \nclearly is no.\n  I hope the Senate will see fit to agree to this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8950-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8950-S8951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHICAGO TRIBUNE REPORTER PAUL SALOPEK\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during the August break, I took some time \noff with my wife. As we were traveling, we were contacted by Jim \nO'Shea, who works with the Chicago Tribune, in the city of Chicago, \nwhich I represent.\n  He told me about a terrible situation. A writer for the Chicago \nTribune, Paul Salopek, who was on assignment for National Geographic in \nAfrica, was arrested and detained in the Sudan.\n  For 9 days, our embassy was not notified. When they learned of this \nand found him, he was in a confinement or jail cell in El Fasher in \nSudan. He is being charged with visa and other violations for crossing \nover into Sudan and most notably he is being charged with the crime of \nespionage.\n  I come to the Senate today to let the American people know about his \nplight but also to speak to the Sudanese Government and their embassy \nin Washington. Many times when we come to the Senate to speak about \nforeign policy issues, we discuss the fate of hundreds of thousands, \nsometimes even millions of people. This relates to the fate of one man. \nPaul Salopek is not just another journalist, not just another \ncorrespondent. He is a Pulitzer Prize winner.\n  I first started reading his work in the Chicago Tribune. As soon as I \nwould finish a piece he had written, I would rush to the byline to see \nwho wrote this. He is truly a gifted writer. He has written some things \nwhich I have saved and clipped out, that I hang onto. They are dog-\neared and yellowed from age, he is just that good.\n  When I went to the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this \nlast December with Senator Brownback, we were touring an area where, \nsadly, 5,000 people a day die in this region of Africa. Very few people \nin the West are aware of it. In preparation for that journey, we looked \nat the National Geographic special on Africa and particularly the \nsection on the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was, once again, \none of those pieces of writing that stops you cold. And you think: I \nwish I had the gift to come up with the words of this writer. The \nwriter, once again, was Paul Salopek.\n  On August 6, Paul Salopek was arrested in the Sudan while on \nfreelance assignment for the National Geographic, along with his driver \nand interpreter. He has been charged, as I said, with espionage and \nwith writing ``false news,'' along with an immigration violation.\n  When you look at his assignment, it was not even close to being \npolitically sensitive. National Geographic had sent him to this region \nto write about the history and culture of the Sahel region of Africa. I \nknow that he undertook this assignment with the same commitment and \npassion as he has in all of his work.\n  When we visited the Congo, one of the women there, who had worked \nwith Paul while he was in that region, said she could not remember \nanother writer who became so immersed in his work, spending the entire \nday with the Pygmy people of the Congo, and then at night he would be \noff to his tent and, by just a dim light, working on his computer \nwriting all night to bring together all of his thoughts.\n  His subject, in this case for the National Geographic, has been the \ngeography, history, culture, environment, wildlife, natural resources, \nreligion, landscape, and populace of the Sahel, a wide swath of land \nrunning from the Atlantic Ocean to the Horn of Africa. I know when the \npiece is finally written it will be well worth reading.\n  The name ``Sahel'' comes from the Arabic word for ``border'' or \n``margin.'' And for many Americans, the Sahel is undoubtedly on the \nmargins of their awareness. Paul Salopek's article would have helped \nchange that. Now he awaits trial in El Fasher, in the North Darfur \nregion of Sudan.\n  I have been in close contact with the U.S. Embassy in Sudan and \nunderstand he is being treated well while he awaits trial. Mr. Bishop, \nwho works for our embassy in Khartoum, has been in frequent contact, \nvisiting him almost on a daily basis, providing him with water and food \nand the basics of life and making certain he is being taken care of. \nAnd I am glad to report that is happening. I appreciate that fact and \nall the efforts the State Department and others have undertaken on his \nbehalf.\n  Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer urged Sudanese President \nal-Bashir to release him. And many of us in Congress have been working \nto try to help effect his release.\n  Let me make it clear: Those of us who know of the work of Paul \nSalopek know one thing for certain, Paul\n\n[[Page S8951]]\n\nSalopek is a journalist. He is not a spy. He has written on everything \nfrom the human genome diversity project, for which he won his first \nPulitzer Prize, to the civil war in the Congo, for which he won his \nsecond.\n  He has been a student of cultural geography, which informs his \ncurrent project on the Sahel, once traveling hundreds of miles by mule \nthrough the remote Sierra Madre region in Mexico.\n  In another brilliant story, Paul traced the route of a barrel of oil, \ntracking shipments of crude oil from across the globe, until they \nreached South Elgin in my home State of Illinois, and filled the gas \ntanks of the cars in my home State.\n  He has written a touching article about 7-year-old brides in Ethiopia \nand a 13-year-old school girl in Angola who was tortured after she was \naccused of witchcraft.\n  His writing captures the reader from the opening sentence, \nilluminating and educating along the way. As Adlai Stevenson once said: \nHe can make the words march on the page.\n  One of his former colleagues, now with the Seattle Times, wrote this \nweek:\n\n       If we don't care about Paul, we don't care about the \n     stories he writes. We don't care about the world and the \n     people in its farthest reaches and most desperate \n     circumstances. His work serves us all, to help us understand \n     and feel.\n\n  I would like to associate myself with that quotation.\n  Paul Salopek is a journalist, a reporter, and most fundamentally he \nis a writer. He crossed a border without the correct paperwork, but he \nhas spent his writing career breaking down borders that divide us in \nthis world.\n  I am hopeful the Government of Sudan will recognize the fact that \nalthough Paul did enter the country without a visa, which is a civil \nviolation, he did so as a writer, writing for the National Geographic \nmagazine. He is not a spy. He did not come to this region of the world \nwith any political agenda.\n  I am heartened by the news that the Khartoum Government has issued a \npardon to a Slovenian writer and envoy who had been convicted of \nsimilar charges.\n  I hope that Mr. Salopek can be released even more quickly.\n  The American Society of Newspaper Editors, Reporters without Borders, \nthe Overseas Press Club, and the Committee to Protect Journalists have \nall issued statements urging the release of Paul Salopek and his driver \nand translator who were detained with them.\n  I want to repeat those calls on the floor of the Senate.\n  This is an opportunity for the Sudanese Government to make one small \nstep in the right direction, toward recognizing basic freedoms.\n  I want to thank all those who tried to help; my colleague, Senator \nObama, traveling in Africa, who has tried to do his part to help Paul \nSalopek. I also want to acknowledge the work that has been done by \nformer Congressman, former Ambassador, former Secretary, now Governor \nBill Richardson of New Mexico, who is also trying to help in every way \nhe can.\n  This is an opportunity for the Sudanese Government to make the right \nstep in the right direction, toward recognizing basic freedoms, toward \ndemonstrating the kind of humanitarianism which will leave, I think, \nthe Sudanese Government in good stead with many countries around the \nworld.\n  It is my deepest hope that Paul Salopek will soon be reunited with \nhis family and soon be released from this prison. It is a matter of the \nfreedom of the press but, as I said, also the freedom of one fine man.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for 25 years the Chevrolet Corvette, \nknown as America's sports car, has been exclusively manufactured in the \nGeneral Motors Bowling Green Assembly Plant in Bowling Green, KY. I \nrise today to celebrate Bowling Green as the ``Home of the Corvette.'' \nWe are very proud that it is in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  The Corvette looms large as one of America's most admired sports \ncars. Introduced in 1953, it was originally produced elsewhere, but in \n1981, General Motors recognized Kentucky as the growing, business-\nfriendly environment it has become and decided Bowling Green and the \nCorvette made a good match. The first Kentucky-built Corvette rolled \noff the assembly line on June 1, 1981.\n  The Bowling Green Assembly Plant also produces the Cadillac XLR and \nXLR-V in addition to three models of the Corvette. Over 39,000 GM cars \nare manufactured in Kentucky each year and delivered to driving \nenthusiasts all over the world. Over the 2\\1/2\\ decades, the Bowling \nGreen Assembly Plant has undergone redesign and updating to incorporate \nthe latest technology. Recently, the newest model, the Corvette Z06, \nwas launched and continues the success of the made-in-Kentucky Corvette \nbrand.\n  The over 1,200 Kentuckians who work at the Bowling Green Assembly \nPlant maintain a high standard of quality while also serving as vital \ncontributors to their communities. Plant employees have generously \ndonated their efforts and resources to noble causes such as the United \nWay, Junior Achievement, the American Red Cross, D.A.R.E.--Drug Abuse \nResistance Education--the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and various local \ncharities.\n  The plant and its workers also work closely with Western Kentucky \nUniversity to sponsor grants and events. They also offer 30 internships \nto WKU students each year, giving young men and women an invaluable \nopportunity to learn about the business world from inside one of \nAmerica's biggest companies. Several interns have gone on to earn \npermanent jobs with GM after graduation.\n  The Bowling Green Assembly Plant's contribution to the local economy \ncannot be understated, either. Not only does the plant provide jobs to \nKentuckians and keep directing money into the local economy, the plant \nalso offers public tours, attracting over 50,000 tourists to the area \nevery year.\n  Every Corvette built in Kentucky is custom-built for an individual \ncustomer; the cars are not mass produced. The employees of the Bowling \nGreen Assembly Plant are very proud of their commitment to precision \nand high quality. They have won more than 70 automotive industry awards \nsince 1997.\n  The Bowling Green Assembly Plant will celebrate its 25 years in \nKentucky this September. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me \nin congratulating the Kentuckians who make America's sports car for \ntheir dedication to achievement and success, both on the job and in \ntheir communities. Kentucky is still reaping the rewards\n\n[[Page S8952]]\n\nof its 25-year partnership with GM, and we hope to continue to do so \nfor years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8952-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n              Private First Class William Edgerton Thorne\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to PFC \nWilliam Edgerton Thorn who died honorably Thursday, August 24 at 8 a.m. \nin Baghdad at the age of 26. He was killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom \nafter an improvised explosive devise detonated near his vehicle.\n  Given the opportunity to protect the people he loved and his strong \nbelief in the cause, Willy, as he was known among family and friends, \nfought proudly. Similarly, Corey, his wife, is serving her country in \nIraq. The couple was married on November 10, 2001 and enlisted in the \nArmy in May of 2005. While they realized the dangers and hardships, \nthey were willing to risk their lives for the freedom of others. My \nthoughts and prayers are with Corey Thorne at this difficult time, and \nI thank her for her service and tremendous sacrifice.\n  Willy loved making children laugh, and he and his wife hoped to save \nenough money to adopt a baby. His death is deeply mourned by his \nhometown, Rock Valley, and throughout the nation. Thus there is great \ntruth in what Willy's mother-in-law, Deb Jasper, said ``A fallen \nsoldier hits everyone because they have fallen for each and every one \nof us. What a sacrifice. What an honor.'' We, the American people, are \nforever indebted to Willy for his great strength and heroic sacrifice.\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Jeffrey J. Hansen\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Nebraska Army National Guard SSG Jeffrey J. Hansen of Cairo, NE \nStaff Sergeant Hansen died of injuries sustained in a vehicle accident \nnear Balad, Iraq on Sunday, August 27. He was 31 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant Hansen was a 1993 graduate of Bertrand Community High \nSchool and graduated from the University of Nebraska at Kearney in \n1997. Staff Sergeant Hansen lived in Cairo, NE, with his wife, \nJennifer, and worked as a police officer at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs' medical facility in Grand Island, NE.\n  In January 2000, Staff Sergeant Hansen enlisted with the Nebraska \nArmy National Guard. He mobilized for a tour of duty in Iraq on October \n11, 2005 with the 1st Squadron, 167th Cavalry Regiment. Staff Sergeant \nHansen served in a unit comprised of approximately 360 Nebraska Guard \nsoldiers that were providing security for Camp Anaconda near Balad, \nIraq. Staff Sergeant Hansen will be remembered as a loyal soldier who \nhad a strong sense of duty, honor and love of country. Thousands of \nbrave Americans like Staff Sergeant Hansen are currently serving in \nIraq.\n  In addition to his wife, Staff Sergeant Hansen is survived by his \nfather, Robert, of Bertrand, Nebraska. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith them at this difficult time. America is proud of Staff Sergeant \nHansen's heroic service and mourns his loss.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Staff \nSergeant Jeffrey J. Hansen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8952-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8952-S8953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent \nResolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2006 \nbudget through August 4, 2006. The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2006 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, H. Con. \nRes. 95. Pursuant to section 402 of that resolution, provisions \ndesignated as emergency requirements are exempt from enforcement of the \nbudget resolution. As a result, the attached report excludes these \namounts.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is under the budget \nresolution by $11.869 billion in budget authority and by $4.030 billion \nin outlays in 2006. Current level for revenues is $6.590 billion above \nthe budget resolution in 2006.\n  Since my last report dated July 11, 2006, Congress has cleared and \nthe President has signed the following acts which have changed budget \nauthority, outlays, or revenues for 2006: the Returned Americans \nProtection Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-250) and an act to provide funding to \nfacilitate the evacuation of persons from Lebanon (P.L. 109-268).

As a result, the \n     enclosed current level report excludes these amounts (see \n     footnote 2 on Table 2).\n       Since my last letter dated July 10, 2006, the Congress has \n     cleared and the President has signed the following acts which \n     have changed budget authority, outlays, or revenues: the \n     Returned Americans Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-\n     250); and an act to provide funding to facilitate the \n     evacuation of persons from Lebanon (Public Law 109-268).\n       In addition, the scoring for the Broadcast Decency \n     Enforcement Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-235) was added to the \n     enclosed report.

Mr. President, as the international community deploys \nan international peacekeeping force to southern Lebanon and as Lebanon \nand Israel begin rebuilding after the recent conflict, it has become \nclear that a long-term solution to this conflict will not come about \nunless the Lebanese Government is strengthened and has the ability and \nthe will to improve the daily lives of its citizens--thereby \neliminating the conditions that have allowed Hezbollah to exploit and \nexpand its influence throughout the country. Israel's security depends \non it, and a lasting peace throughout the region won't occur without \nit.\n  While it is still fragile, the cessation of hostilities presents an \nopportunity for the Lebanese people, with support from the \ninternational community, to eliminate terrorism and to cast off the \ndetrimental influence that Iran and Syria have had throughout their \ncountry for years. It is also an opportunity to address the significant \nthreats that have plagued Israel for decades.\n  Still, my optimism is guarded. Unless the deployment of a U.N. force \nto patrol southern Lebanon is part of a broader international effort to \nroot out Hezbollah and address the underlying causes of the conflict, \nwe cannot expect Israel to feel more secure than it did prior to \nHezbollah's recent aggressions, nor can we expect that any broader, \nlong-term peace process will be pursued. Israel has every right to \nremain wary of the current international effort unless its security \nconcerns are addressed and Lebanon can become a permanent--and \ncapable--partner in establishing long-term peace in the region.\n  One of the most important elements of establishing peace is \ninitiating reconstruction efforts throughout southern Lebanon \nimmediately. Unfortunately, the Lebanese Government--and thus the \ninternational community--is already losing to Hezbollah in the race to \nshow legitimacy and strength. It is an ominous sign that Hezbollah is \nahead of Lebanese and internationally led reconstruction efforts and \nhas been responsive to local needs. This is in contrast to an \ninternational donor community that has yet to establish the mechanisms \nand partnerships on the ground to get reconstruction efforts moving. In \naddition, the Lebanese Government is looking weak and out of touch, \nstruggling to develop coordinated strategies for reconstruction and \nsecurity. If this continues, it will have very real security \nimplications for Israel, Lebanon, and the region, and will make the \nwork of the U.N. force relatively useless. This is not in the interest \nof Israel, Lebanon, or the international community.\n  Mr. President, as troop-contributing nations begin their deployments \nto support the U.N. force, an equal amount of attention needs to be \npaid to longer term efforts to bolster the Lebanese Government's \ncapacity to deliver services and to kick-start the Lebanese economy. As \nI mentioned, coordinated--and rapid--reconstruction efforts will help. \nBut so, too, will support for the Government, its institutions, and its \nrole in Lebanese society. In addition, and as experts have suggested in \nrecent weeks, sufficient--and significant--attention needs to be given \nto enhancing the ability of the Lebanese military and police forces to \ndo their jobs. The military and police forces need outside help. They \nneed training, equipment, and supplies if they are going to be able to \nproject the authority of the central Government in a professional way. \nLebanon's democratic institutions need help; so, too, do civil society \ngroups and private enterprises that can provide services to the \nLebanese people quickly and that can increase demand for functioning, \nresponsive, and transparent democratic institutions. Without this \nsupport for the army and police, stability will be elusive, and Israel \nwill have every right to remain nervous about the role that Hezbollah \nwill play in southern Lebanon and about the influence that Iran and \nSyria will have throughout the country.\n  Finally, the U.S. Government must devote greater attention and \nresources to this issue. We have already seen the results of this \nadministration's passive approach: hesitant international partners, \nlagging reconstruction efforts, and a shaky framework for ensuring that \nIsrael's security concerns are addressed. If we are to contribute \npositively to a sustainable ceasefire and to setting the conditions \nwithin which Israel and Lebanon can become secure, a senior U.S. envoy \nmust be deployed to help manage the implementation of U.N. Resolution \n1701, assist with donor reconstruction efforts, build support for the \nLebanese Government, influence important regional actors, and begin \nsetting the conditions for a transition to a broader peace process \nthroughout the region that will bring an end to this violence and \ninstability.\n  One of the most pressing and important tasks for a U.S. envoy will be \nworking with the international community to end the pernicious \ninfluence that Iran and Syria continue to exert over Lebanon. Until \nthat influence is ended and the Lebanese people are allowed to assert \ntheir own sovereignty, the prospects for a long-term peace will be \nshaky at best.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity to eliminate a terrorist \norganization that has terrorized Israel for too\n\n[[Page S8954]]\n\nlong. It has exploited a weak Lebanese Government and has used the \nfacade of public service and charity work to buy favor amongst the \npeople of southern Lebanon. Efforts now must be focused on helping to \ncreate the conditions within which the Lebanese Government can build \nthe legitimacy and capacity it will need to establish peace within its \nborders. This will make Israel safer and will contribute to longer term \npeace efforts throughout the region. That won't happen unless the \ninternational community, led by the United States, helps create the \nconditions within which the Lebanese Government can do its job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8954-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AFRICAN UNION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the African Union is essential to the \npolitical and economic development of Africa's diverse community of \nStates. It has become clear that the AU represents a real commitment by \nits members to establishing a forum for political dialogue and to \naddress the challenges and seize opportunities that are arising \nthroughout the continent.\n  The AU plays three very specific roles that I will highlight as we \nconsider the nomination of the United States' first ambassador and as \nwe renew our efforts to strengthen our relationship with the AU.\n  The AU is primed to serve as the primary forum for establishing peace \nand preventing conflict throughout the continent. I applaud the efforts \nof the leaders of the AU to establish a true capacity to prevent and \nend conflict that has devastated many parts of the continent for too \nlong. The creation of the Peace and Security Council, PSC, within the \nAU is particularly valuable, and I hope this organ within the AU \ndevelops sufficient capacity to deal with the full range of conflict \nthroughout the continent. It is essential that the PSC complete its \nwork in developing a series of early warning systems and indicators so \nthat it can be effective in preventing conflict. It also must develop a \nreal capacity to respond to conflict should one occur. The Panel of the \nWise, too, is an important source of moral authority and opportunity \nfor prominent African leaders to engage in country-specific conflicts \nwithout sacrificing neutrality or threatening the sovereignty of a \nnation.\n  As we have learned from recent years in places such as Sudan and \nSomalia, it is critical that there be a way to identify, understand, \nand respond to the conditions that breed instability. The United States \nshould support this conflict prevention and resolution capacity and \nwork closely with the AU to identify weaknesses or shortfalls that \nexist in maximizing the AU's ability to fulfill these important \nfunctions.\n  The United States must also support the AU's efforts to establish an \nAfrican Standby Force that can participate in peace operations, \nintervention, and conflict monitoring. The AU and its members have \nproven a willingness and commitment to contributing military forces to \nAU-flagged missions throughout the continent. AU forces are operational \nin Darfur and in Burundi and have proven that they are willing to take \non challenging assignments in nonpermissive environments. \nUnfortunately, the AU still does not have the capacity to fully \nimplement the vision for the African Standby Force, nor to effectively \ncomplete its mission in Darfur. The United States should assist the AU \nin developing a professional, deployment-ready standby force that can \nrespond to conflict and that can participate in interventions to \nestablish peace in areas already facing conflict. We must continue our \nefforts to help African militaries develop their capacity, while also \nurging the importance of the respect for human rights, civilian \nleadership, and fighting corruption.\n  Finally, the AU is playing an increasingly important role in \ndefeating terrorist networks throughout the African continent. As \nterrorist networks exploit undergoverned or unstable areas throughout \nAfrica, the AU can play an important role in helping member States \ndevelop internal capacity to defeat the conditions that allow \nterrorists to take root. The AU also can strengthen member-State \nnetworks to share information, best practices, and even capacity as it \nrelates to understanding, and ultimately defeating, terrorist networks. \nThe African Center for the Study and Research on Terrorism, ACSRT, a \njoint AU Commission/PSC structure, was launched in 2004 but lacks \nsufficient capacity to carry out its broad mission. It is a good first \nstep, but it will need assistance from the United States, the European \nUnion, and other members of the international community. Establishing \nthis capacity must also be a priority for the AU's member states.\n  There are a range of other challenges facing the AU, and there is no \ndoubt a long list of priorities to be addressed. And while the United \nStates has and will continue to support a range of AU efforts, it is \nessential that the U.S. Government structure its assistance to the AU \nto help empower it as an organization, support its priorities, and help \nto develop an internal capacity to plan for its growth and role in the \ncoming years. I hope that the fact that we are sending our first \nambassador to the AU will represent a heightened level of engagement \nwith the AU and a renewed commitment to helping the AU, its member \nstates, and the people of the African continent address the challenges \nof the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8954-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FOREIGN SERVICE FAMILY LOSSES\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Monday, August 7, was the eighth \nanniversary of the bombings of our Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es \nSalaam of August 7, 1998. On that dreadful day, the lives of 12 \nAmericans, 11 Tanzanians, and 212 Kenyans were tragically taken; more \nthan 4,000 injured. The names of 56 killed U.S. Government employees--\nAmericans, Kenyans, and Tanzanians--are memorialized on a plaque on a \nwall in the State Department. I want to take this opportunity to extend \nmy deepest sympathies and condolences to the families and friends of \nthose who died and to those who were injured. We continue to mourn \ntheir loss. Their memories will remain eternal. And we pray for \nstrength for those who are still suffering.\n  At this time, I also want to express my heartfelt sympathy for \nanother great loss in the Foreign Service family, the matriarch of \nAmerica's diplomats, Ambassador Mary Ryan. I, as well as all those who \nknew her, was deeply saddened to hear of Mary's passing on April 25.\n  During my days with the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mary and I \nworked closely together in response to the 1993 World Trade Center \nbombings by aggressively introducing technology data systems, such as \nthe TIPOFF lookout system, and strengthening interagency information \nsharing to identify potential terrorists as they applied for visas to \nour great Nation. In the aftermath of the August 7 bombings in Kenya \nand Tanzania, and then after 9/11, our paths crossed again, as we, \ntogether, tackled the visa and border security challenges of our day. \nMary's dedication to and love for her nation was always very evident \nduring these trying times.\n  As the longest-serving diplomat at the time of her departure from the \nState Department, Mary served 36 years in her distinguished public \nservice career. Mary entered the Foreign Service in 1966 serving in \nNaples, Tegucigalpa, Monterrey, Washington, Abidjan, and Khartoum \nbefore being appointed ambassador to Swaziland in 1988. In 1993, she \nbecame the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs and in \n1999 she was named career ambassador, only the second woman to hold the \nrank in the history of the State Department.\n  A mentor to generations in the Foreign Service, particularly women, \nMary Ryan was truly an outstanding American diplomat and public \nservant. Mary donated much of her time to those in need, extending a \nuniquely kind, generous and warm spirit that will be missed by all.\n  The Nation owes a deep debt of gratitude to these fine men and women \nwho serve our Nation's interests overseas and their families. And I \nwant to thank them for their public service and dedication to our fine \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8954-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8954-S8955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to begin by commending \nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Enzi, \nSenate HELP Committee Ranking Member Kennedy, and the rest of my\n\n[[Page S8955]]\n\ncolleagues on the HELP Committee and the Senate Finance Committee for \ntheir commitment to working on a bipartisan basis toward the shared \ngoal of comprehensive pension reform. This legislation is the product \nof their tireless work on behalf of our Nation's workers and retirees.\n  In particular, I would like to express my appreciation to the \nconferees in the Senate and the House for undertaking the difficult \nwork of negotiating a compromise between the two Chambers' bills. It is \na challenge to reconcile legislation on such a complex set of reforms, \nand it is an enormous credit to the hard work of the conferees--and \ntheir staffs--that we were in a position to act on this important piece \nof legislation.\n  The protection of the retirement security of workers and their \nfamilies is one of my highest priorities as a Senator. The promise of a \npension is one of the central tenets of the compact between an employer \nand an employee and one of the essential components of the American \ndream. It is incumbent on our businesses and on our Nation to make good \non that promise. So many of my constituents in New York, like millions \nof other Americans throughout the Nation, work their entire lives to \nsecure the right to pension benefits when they retire, and they come to \ndepend on those benefits to provide financial security for them and \ntheir loved ones through retirement.\n  Unfortunately, the private pension system in America is badly in need \nof repair. More and more companies are terminating the defined benefit \nplans that serve as a dependable source of retirement income for tens \nof millions of workers throughout the country. Workers in terminated \nplans often find their pension benefits slashed, and the consequences \nfor these workers are all too real, including postponed retirement, \nadditional jobs, and tighter budgets.\n  Liability for these pension plans is shifted to the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation, which insures defined benefit plans but is now \n$22 billion in debt and itself could require a taxpayer bailout if more \ncompanies abandon their plans. And in fact, many more companies' \ndefined benefit plans are on the brink of insolvency--defined benefit \nplans insured by the PBGC are underfunded by roughly $450 billion, \nincluding almost $100 billion for defaults it calls reasonably \npossible. I meet often with New Yorkers who are deeply anxious that \nthey will never see the pension benefits they worked so hard to earn.\n  The Pension Protection Act makes great strides toward restoring the \ngreat promise of the private pension system for workers in New York and \nthroughout the Nation. Among the important reforms in this bill are \nprovisions that: require companies to fully fund their single-employer \ndefined benefit plans; provide incentives for companies to contribute \nmore money to their pension plans during good years; strengthen the \nmultiemployer pension system; improve the pensions of public safety \nofficers; allow Reserve and National Guard members to draw on their \nretirement savings without penalty when they serve our country in \nactive duty; and take important steps toward restoring the solvency of \nthe PBGC.\n  The Pension Protection Act also contains provisions that aim to \nprotect the retirement security of workers as more employers transition \nfrom defined benefit pensions to 401(k)s and new hybrid plans. The \nlegislation will clarify the legality of these hybrid plans on a \nprospective basis, and prohibit the ``wear-away'' of the benefits of \nolder employees under these plans. The legislation will encourage the \nuse of automatic enrollment for 401(k)s and other defined contribution \nplans. And the legislation will prohibit employers from requiring \nemployees to keep their retirement savings in company stock, a practice \nthat magnified the harmful impact of the Enron and other corporate \nscandals on employees.\n  Finally, in light of the low personal savings rate in this country, \nit was vitally important that the bill included tax incentives for \nsavings. I am particularly happy that the bill makes permanent the \nSaver's Credit, which helps middle- and low-income families save for \ntheir retirement. Making the credit permanent was one of the reforms \nthat I and some of my colleagues call for in the American Dream \nInitiative. These are smart and commonsense reforms that will offer \nclarity and certainty in the retirement planning of the millions of New \nYorkers and the 65 million Americans estimated to participate in 401(k) \nand defined contribution plans.\n  I also commend the conference on making a number of improvements to \nthe Senate bill that was passed last year. For one, the new bill is \nwise to drop a provision that would have looked to the credit rating of \na company to determine whether it is at risk for plan default and \ntherefore must make accelerated contributions into its plan. That \napproach would have made it far more difficult for a company to \npreserve a plan during a period of financial distress, a result that is \nundesirable for the company, its employees, and the American taxpayer. \nLikewise, the legislation increases the ``smoothing'' period for the \ncalculation of assets and liabilities from what was in the Senate bill, \na change that will improve the predictability of pension payments and \nmake it easier for employers to keep their pension promises.\n  The legislation is not without its flaws. The legislation walks back \nseveral of the provisions in various areas of the Senate bill that \nprovided important protections for workers. My strong preference was to \nsee the costs in the legislation offset. Also, while funding provisions \nin the bill required a certain measure of compromise on the part of all \nof the stakeholders, I am concerned that these provisions could exact \nan unintentional and unnecessarily harsh toll on employees in certain \nindustries. I will be monitoring the impact of the bill closely, and I \nwill work with my colleagues to correct the situation should this \noccur. Finally, while the bill protects the pensions of many of the \nthousands of airline employees who live and work in New York, we must \ncontinue to find ways to assist other distressed companies in taking \nthe steps necessary to preserve the pension plans of their employees.\n  And indeed, we should not regard this bill as an excuse to rest on \nour laurels. Our work on behalf of workers and their families is only \nbeginning. We need even more Congressional action to pursue public and \nprivate ways of addressing the retirement security of workers in New \nYork and throughout America: portable retirement accounts for workers \nwith even stronger incentives to save, offering real health care \noptions to retirees and workers; and protecting Social Security for our \nseniors.\n  Workers and their families are counting on their employers to keep \ntheir pension promises. The Pension Protection Act will help employers \nto do so, while strengthening the defined benefit system, protecting \nthe PBGC, and encouraging private savings. This bill is an important \nstep toward the goal of restoring retirement security for working men \nand women. For these reasons, I applaud the Senate for passing this \nimportant piece of legislation, and I call on the President to sign it \npromptly. I look forward to working my colleagues on further measures \nto enhance the defined benefit system and increase retirement savings \nfor workers in New York and throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8955-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8955-S8956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LIFTING OF HOLDS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in August, I announced my intention to \nobject to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the \nnominations of John Ray Correll to be Director of the Office of Surface \nMining, Interior Department, and Mark Myers to be Director of the U.S. \nGeological Services, Interior Department. Previously, in May, I also \nplaced a hold on David Bernhardt, the administration's nominee to be \nInterior Solicitor. I also objected to any unanimous consent to keep \nthese nominees on the calendar during the August recess. Instead, I \nasked that these nominations be returned to the White House. I did so \nbecause, despite several requests, I had received no assurance from the \nadministration that the needs of people in more than 700 rural counties \nin over 40 States would be adequately addressed by fully funded county \npayments. The county payments law, which provides a stable revenue \nsource for education, roads, and other county services in rural areas, \nis due to expire at the end\n\n[[Page S8956]]\n\nof this year. In early 2005, I cosponsored a bipartisan bill, S. 267, \nto reauthorize county payments for another 7 years. In February, the \nadministration proposed reauthorizing the law for only 5 years, while \ncutting funding by 60 percent, and funding that reduced portion with a \ncontroversial Federal land sale scheme.\n  During the August recess, the administration agreed to work with us \nto find a mutually acceptable solution to fully fund county payments \nfor another year. On August 7, 2006, I received a letter from Mr. Mark \nRey, Under Secretary for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in which \nthe administration committed to work with me, and my colleagues Senator \nSmith and Senator Craig, to reauthorize the program for the coming \nyear, through a mutually acceptable funding source. This is not a long-\nterm solution, but it will address the needs of hundreds of communities \nfor the short term. Because of the commitment of the administration to \nwork with me, and my colleagues Senator Smith and Senator Craig, to \nreach a solution, I will no longer object to any unanimous consent \nrequest for the Senate to take up the nominations of John Ray Correll, \nMark Myers, and David Bernhardt. I will, however, continue to look for \nthe agreed upon funding solution to be proposed from the \nadministration, while looking toward a future long-term solution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this statement along with Mr. \nRey's letter be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 7, 2006.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a former \ncolleague and dear friend, Robert Giaimo, who passed away on May 24 of \nthis year. He served the people of Connecticut and the United States as \na Member of the House of Representatives for more than 20 years, and I \nwant to speak to my colleagues today about the life and legacy of this \ndedicated public servant.\n  Bob Giaimo was born in North Haven, CT on October 19, 1919, son of \nthe late Rose and Rosario Giaimo. He attended North Haven public \nschools, and graduated from Fordham University before receiving his law \ndegree from the University of Connecticut in 1943. During World War II, \nBob served as a commissioned officer in the United States Army. When he \nreturned, he served as the chairman of the State of Connecticut \nPersonnel Appeals Board, as a member of the North Haven Board of \nEducation, North Haven Board of Finance, and as third selectman of the \ntown of North Haven.\n  Bob Giaimo's public service culminated with his tenure in the House \nof Representatives. Elected in 1958, Congressman Giaimo represented \nConnecticut's third congressional district until his retirement in \n1980. During his eleven terms in office, Representative Giaimo served \nas a member of the House Education and Labor Committee between 1959 and \n1963, and went on to serve on the House Appropriations Committee. When \nthe House Committee on the Budget was established in 1974, \nRepresentative Giaimo was elected to serve as a member, and was elected \nchairman of that committee in 1979. He was the first Connecticut \nDemocrat and the first Connecticut Member of Congress since 1931 to \nchair a congressional committee.\n  One of Congressman Giaimo's greatest legislative achievements was \nundoubtedly his 1965 sponsorship of the bill that created the National \nEndowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, \nseparate grant-making agencies that support our nation's painters, \nsculptors, writers, poets, and historians, among others. His dedication \nto this legislation has made an enormous contribution to America's \ncultural heritage.\n  When I was elected to Congress in 1975, Bob was already a senior \nmember of the House. But he very graciously took an interest in showing \nthis newcomer the ways of that institution. With me, as with all who \nknew him, Bob was a public figure who led by example. Never one to seek \nthe spotlight, Bob remained dedicated to the working families, the \npoor, the elderly, and others who cannot afford to buy a voice in \nWashington and who instead rely on their elected officials to look out \nfor them in the corridors of power. The quality and caliber of this \nleadership will be missed and continues to inspire those of us who knew \nhim and who serve in public life.\n  My wife Jackie and I offer our deepest condolences to his wife \nMarion, his daughter Barbara, and his granddaughter Tracey. They have \nlost a beloved member of their family. And the people of Connecticut \nand our Nation have lost a dedicated public servant and an exceptional \nman.\n  I was honored to attend Representative Giaimo's memorial service on \nJune 1, and found the eulogy, delivered by Reverend Hugh MacDonald, to \nbe particularly moving. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \neulogy be printed in the Record.\n\n                         Eulogy: Robert Giaimo\n\n                (Reverend Hugh MacDonald, June 1, 2006)\n\n       The great cathedrals of Europe are a glorious part of our \n     Christian heritage--towering testimonials to an Age of Faith. \n     But anyone who now visits these sublime buildings soon \n     realizes that they also have a history as cemeteries for the \n     celebrated.\n       Whether interred in the basement crypts or encased in \n     magnificent tombs scattered around the sanctuary and aisles, \n     the famous dead almost vie for attention with our living \n     worship.\n       My personal favorite among cathedral tombs is in the \n     Cathedral of Saint Richard in the city of Chichester on the \n     southern coast of England. In the north aisle of that elegant \n     church is a massive stone sepulcher containing the remains of \n     the fourteenth-century Earl of Arundel and his countess. Side \n     by side, atop the monument, lie their carved stone \n     likenesses.\n       A famous warrior, he is clad in medieval armor, and his \n     feet rest up on a lion--the symbol of bravery. On his right, \n     his wife is shown in nun-like robes, her feet resting on a \n     small dog--symbol of fidelity.\n       Purely as sculpture, the Arundel tomb is not all that \n     impressive, and six centuries have blurred the once precise \n     details of the carved faces. But what finally rivets your \n     attention is their hands! The universal custom in pious \n     monument-sculpture is for the hands to be stiffly folded on \n     the chest, pointing heavenward in a gesture of everlasting \n     prayer.\n       Not so with the Arundels! His left arm lies at his side, \n     and in that left hand he holds the empty glove (or gauntlet) \n     for his right hand. So, immediately your eyes seek out that \n     right hand. His right arm is also relaxed at his side, and \n     the hand is thus concealed by the overlapping folds of the \n     countess's robe as she lies beside him. But if you go to the \n     foot of the monument and stoop down a bit, you can discover \n     their touching secret. Under the carved armor and the pleated \n     dress, their hands are clasped in tender love!\n       I find that detail enormously moving. We know almost \n     nothing now about the once famous exploits of this heroic \n     earl and nothing whatsoever about his wife. And in the \n     cathedral that houses their bones, the centuries have \n     witnessed violent religious wars and the cruel ravages of \n     time. But through it all and despite it all, those clasped \n     hands are a reminder of what is noblest in our lives and in \n     our legacy. The poet Philip Larkin put it beautifully in the \n     final line of his meditation on the Arundel tomb when he \n     wrote: ``What will survive of us is love.''\n       Those words sprang to my mind on Monday after I had talked \n     on the phone with Barbara about the shining love her parents \n     shared. Robert and Marion were married here at Saint Barnabas \n     sixty-one years ago. Sadly, poor health prevents Marion from \n     being here with us this morning for this Mass of Christian \n     Burial.\n       But in fact every celebration of the Eucharist reminds us \n     that nothing can truly separate us from our love of the Lord \n     or our love\n\n[[Page S8957]]\n\n     of each other. Not miles or years or even death! Love is \n     always present tense, and love never comes to an end!!\n       Clearly, what God asks of us is not just theoretical love, \n     love-in-the-abstract. Not at all! God challenges you and me \n     to flesh out our love in acts of living prayer and lives of \n     authentic service. Unless our hands are clasped in love, \n     nothing else really matters.\n       Robert Giaimo understood that challenge, and he lived that \n     faith with sincerity and simple conviction. Harry Truman (God \n     bless him!) once said that the politicians of his era used to \n     pour God over everything--like ketchup! (By the way, I don't \n     know what President Truman would have to say about the \n     current level of religiosity in our political discourse, but \n     I for one would dearly love to hear it!!!)\n       But Bob Giaimo's faith was never showy or self-\n     congratulatory. He didn't preach sermons, he just served \n     people.\n       This was a man who regularly walked the corridors of power, \n     but never forgot his roots, his heritage, his humanity. His \n     towering stature made him an imposing presence, but his \n     genuine humility made him a caring person and a lasting \n     friend. And, of course, a deeply devoted husband, father, and \n     grandfather.\n       The pulpit is not a place to assess his political \n     achievements, but I can't resist a heartfelt ``Thank you!'' \n     to the man who was so influential in creating the National \n     Endowment for the Arts and Humanities. He firmly believed \n     that the arts not only enrich our lives but actually instruct \n     us how to live. (That's one of the reasons I began this \n     eulogy with that Arundel anecdote.)\n       Our brother has now passed beyond our sight but not at all \n     beyond our reach. He is quite literally only a prayer away. \n     And on each day of our continuing journey of faith, he will \n     continue through the power of his prayer to reach into our \n     lives: to touch us, to lead us, to help us. Because, for \n     Robert Giaimo it has always been quite personal!\n       And isn't that precisely the point Jesus is making in \n     today's gospel selection? Notice the Lord did not say to His \n     anxious Apostle: ``Thomas, I will show you the way, I will \n     teach you the truth, I will give you life.'' No: it's \n     absolutely personal. ``Thomas, I AM the Way and the Truth and \n     the Life.''\n       No one was ever saved by words or rituals, by laws or \n     creeds. We are saved by the powerful Person of the Lord, and \n     we show our acceptance of that great gift by cherishing all \n     the precious people who share our journey.\n       So, when all is said and done, Bob Giaimo's gift to us was \n     not a legacy of laws but of loving service. Power passes, and \n     fame is fleeting. ``What will survive of us is love.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8957-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        PAYNESVILLE AREA SCHOOL DISTRICT, PAYNESVILLE, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor the Paynesville Area \nSchool District, in Paynesville, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  The Paynesville Area School District is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. The district administrators, teachers, staff, and parents have \nremained focused on the District's mission: ``Success for Everyone \nThrough Quality Learning.''\n  The commitment of the entire community to the education of its \nchildren has earned the Paynesville Area School District's high school \na five-star rating in both math and reading, one of only seven percent \nof schools in the State that can make that claim. The elementary school \nalso earned a five-star rating in reading. Paynesville is very proud of \nthe fact that it is the only district in greater Minnesota that has \nfive stars in reading for both its elementary and high schools.\n  Paynesville, a rural community, continually seeks new ideas to remain \ncompetitive in a progressive society while cherishing local history and \ntradition. Along with the fundamentals of reading, writing, and \nmathematics, the district also emphasizes respect as a basic value.\n  The Paynesville Area School District offers a number of innovative \nprograms, including full-day kindergarten for everyone; children in \nkindergarten and first grade are grouped by ability; teachers in grades \n2 and 3 remain with the same teacher for 2 years in a row; parents can \nview children's grades through the district's Web site; and College in \nthe Classroom courses are available for fundamentals of college \nwriting, rhetoric, and introduction to literature, allowing students to \nearn college credit in these subjects.\n  The Paynesville Area School District also offers a wide variety of \ncocurricular activities, including: an award-winning Future Farmers of \nAmerica Program, a Future Leaders of America Program, and a Business \nProfessionals of America Program. The middle school band has been rated \n``Best Young Band,'' and the high school choir performed at candlelight \nprocessionals at Disney's Epcot Center in 2000 and 2004.\n  Much of the credit for the Paynesville Area Public School's success \nbelongs to its superintendent, Mr. Todd Burlingame, and the district's \ndedicated principals, teachers, and staff. The students and staff at \nthe Paynesville Area School District understand that, in order to be \nsuccessful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it must \nalso provide a nurturing environment where students can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All of \nthe faculty, staff, and students at the Paynesville Area School \nDistrict should be very proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate the Paynesville Area School District in Paynesville \nfor winning the Award for Excellence in Education and for its \nexceptional contributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8957-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8957-S8958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     LITTLE FALLS COMMUNITY MIDDLE SCHOOL, LITTLE FALLS, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor Little Falls \nCommunity Middle School, in Little Falls, MN, which recently earned an \nAward for Excellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative \nachievements in educating children.\n  Little Falls Community Middle School is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. Every year since 1997, its Language Arts Department has \ninvited well-known authors to work with the students to help develop \ntheir writing skills. Students are assigned beforehand to read one or \nmore of each author's books. This approach to teaching both an \nappreciation of reading and improved writing skills works very well in \na middle school setting.\n  This year, Will Weaver was invited to work with the students. Some \nother authors who have participated are Will Durbin, Patricia Calvert, \nand Earl Fleck. The author spends 2 days teaching techniques for \nwriting stories that allow the reader to ``feel'' what is happening. \nThe authors discuss their favorite books, how they came up with the \nideas for their books, how long it takes to write a chapter, and how \nthey were able to get their first books published. Students come away \nfrom the experience believing that they, too, can become good writers.\n  Another program unique to the school is its annual Water Festival, \nwhich allows sixth-graders to travel each year to nearby Camp Ripley \nfor hands-on experience learning about the significance of water in our \nenvironment. The festival offers children an opportunity to discover \nhow important water is in their lives and how we ourselves affect \nwater, positively or negatively. They learn about water purification \ntechniques, invertebrates that live in the water, wetland habitat, the \nhistory of the Mississippi River, and the characteristics of a \nwatershed. The school makes use of National Guard staff, Department of \nNatural Resources Specialists, and representatives from the Science \nMuseum of Minnesota.\n  This year, Little Falls Community Middle School suffered a tremendous \nloss when one of its teachers, Mr. Lee Hochsprung, died suddenly. He \nhad enjoyed spending time with his family, teaching at the middle \nschool for 31 years in language arts, EBD, and social studies, hunting, \nfishing, camping, cooking, watching his children play sports, \nannouncing wrestling matches, listening to all kinds of music, and \nreading history. He was a compassionate person, a motivator, and a \nloving husband, father, and loyal friend. The Little Falls community \nwill remember Lee for his stories, jokes, great teaching skills, \nfabulous coaching ability, gift for connecting with students and \nparents, capacity for fun, and love for all children, especially for \nhis own children, Laura, Paul, Phil, and Katie, and his wife Julie.\n  Much of the credit for Little Falls Community Middle School's success \nbelongs to its principal, Dr. Maxine Strege, and the dedicated \nteachers. The students and staff at Little Falls Community Middle \nSchool understand that in order to be successful, a school must\n\n[[Page S8958]]\n\ngo beyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a nurturing \nenvironment where students can develop the knowledge, skills, and \nattitudes for success throughout life.

Mr. President, today I honor Johnsville Elementary \nSchool, in Blaine, MN, which recently earned an Award for Excellence in \nEducation for its exceptional and innovative achievements in educating \nchildren.\n  Johnsville Elementary School is truly a model of educational success. \nThe school has developed a wide variety of programs to meet the \nlearning needs of all children. Unlike many elementary schools, which \noffer only three or four break-out curricula, Johnsville has built art, \nmusic, library, technology, and physical education into the school-day \ncurriculum. A talent development program provides enrichment reading, \nmath, creative writing, and science for the more advanced learners. A \ntargeted services program offers extended-day instruction in reading \nand math for pupils who are struggling.\n  At Johnsville, those kindergarten children who have already begun to \nread and write can participate in an advanced reader program. In \naddition, for 2 consecutive years, a Johnsville kindergartner has won \nthe Anoka Hennepin District's Anti-Bullying Kindergarten Poster \nContest. This year's winner was Jake Taylor.\n  The school is also very proud of its choir programs, including an \nhonors choir program, and its Fine Arts Festival, where everyone \ndisplays at least one project.\n  The Anoka-Hennepin School District has also established a teacher \nwith outstanding performance, TOP, recognition program so that parents \ncan nominate deserving teachers. Seven of Johnsville's teachers have \nreceived the award.\n  Parents' support for the school is reflected in the 98 percent parent \nparticipation rate in parent-teacher conferences. Johnsville also \nprovides opportunities to involve parents in all aspects of the school \nday.\n  In the spirit of community service, this year Johnsville participated \nin a special fund-raiser for people affected by Hurricane Katrina, \nraising $2,700 for St. John's School in Louisiana.\n  Johnsville's principal, Mr. Patrick Murray, was recently recognized \nwith a division leadership award from the Minnesota Elementary School \nPrincipals' Association.\n  In 2005, the school received a three-star rating in math and a four-\nstar rating in reading. This is an improvement over the two-star rating \nin reading the school received in 2004.\n  Much of the credit for Johnsville Elementary School's success belongs \nto its principal, Mr. Patrick Murray, and the dedicated teachers and \nstaff. The pupils and staff at Johnsville Elementary School understand \nthat, in order to be successful, a school must go beyond achieving \nacademic success; it must also provide a nurturing environment where \nchildren can develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success \nthroughout life.

Mr. President, today I honor Saint Anthony Middle \nSchool, in Saint Anthony Village, MN, which recently earned an Award \nfor Excellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative \nachievements in educating children.\n  Saint Anthony Middle School is truly a model of educational success. \nThe Saint Anthony and New Brighton communities, which are served by the \nmiddle school, place a high value on quality education for every \nstudent. The teachers and students have taken the initiative to \nestablish an academic enrichment program, matching students and \nteachers with similar interests to participate in enrichment learning \nactivities.\n  Saint Anthony Middle School has also developed curricula and teaching \ntechniques to meet the needs of struggling learners as well as advanced \nstudents. Children who need greater support are given additional study \ntime and assistance from paraprofessionals and high school tutors. \nAdvanced students participate in special courses designed to move at a \nfaster pace. The Connections Course, developed by the social studies \nteachers and language arts teachers, offers an advanced-level course \nintegrating both subjects.\n  Recognizing that positive connections with middle school students are \nessential, teachers and staff work constantly to improve the \neducational experience. Teachers, who often go to great lengths to be \nsure that all students are connecting with the curriculum, helped the \neighth-graders create a Colonial Day, on which community members \nfacilitate workshops to help students to understand firsthand what it \nwas like to live during colonial times. Among other things, students \ncreated cornhusk dolls, wove baskets, dressed in colonial attire, and \nignited a fire using stones. The school is also exploring the \npossibility of adding an International Baccalaureate Program to the \ncurriculum.\n  The success of Saint Anthony Middle School is reflected in student \nenrollment numbers: 42 percent of the students come to the school, \nthrough open enrollment, from neighboring districts.\n  In 2005, St. Anthony Middle School received a three-star rating in \nmath and a four-star rating in reading from the Minnesota Department of \nEducation.\n  Much of the credit for Saint Anthony Middle School's success belongs \nto its principal, Shirley Gregoire, and the dedicated teachers and \nstaff.

The high school aims to establish a ``preferred, small, caring \neducational community creatively meeting individual learners' needs.''\n  The Saint Anthony Village High School's success can be attributed to \nthe relatively small number of students enrolled, the dedicated \nteachers and staff, and the strong community support. The high school \nand middle school share the same building, hence the innovative Tutors \nR Us Program has allowed high-achieving older students to help tutor \nmiddle school students who need more individualized attention.\n  Teachers at Saint Anthony Village High School genuinely care for \ntheir students and hold them accountable for high academic standards. \nWhen Maggie Horan, a recent graduate, and senior Dede Sirleaf were \nasked about their teachers, they responded by citing their experience \nwith Mr. Olszanski, their math teacher:\n\n       He takes the time to explain things. If you don't get it, \n     he will explain it two or three times to make sure you get \n     it--he really cares about you. He wants everyone to learn and \n     be on the same page. He will even take time to stay after \n     school with you if you don't get it.\n\n\n[[Page S8959]]\n\n\n  The community has demonstrated its strong support for the schools by \napproving several referendums and supporting numerous fundraising \nactivities. Community members are always represented at school \nfunctions, act as mentors for students, serve as hosts for student \nvolunteer opportunities, and frequently offer afterschool employment \nfor Saint Anthony students.\n  The results are very impressive. The number of Advanced Placement \ntests taken by students at Saint Anthony has grown from 5 in 1994 to \n240 in 2006. Over 20 percent of juniors and seniors belong to the \nNational Honor Society.\n  In both 2004 and 2005, the school received five-star ratings in both \nmath and reading from the Minnesota Department of Education.\n  Much of the credit for Saint Anthony Village High School's success \nbelongs to its principal, Mr. Tom Keith, and the dedicated teachers and \nstaff.

The children form an aerospace commission designed to study space \nflight, aerodynamics, weather, physics, and optics. As they accomplish \neach intelligence-gathering mission, they earn valuable ``cash'' for \ntheir company. They then use the knowledge they have acquired to build \nand launch model air-powered rockets. The children then make design \nmodifications to their rockets, based on actual flight performance. To \nearn the privilege of launching their rockets, pupils must pass a tough \nphysics test which covers concepts in energy, mass, light, sound, the \nearth's tilt, and Newton's laws of motion.\n  Fifth-graders also participate in an experiment growing chicks, which \nincludes gauging the effects of diet on growing chickens. The children \nwrite the experimental protocol, analyze weight gain, feed intake, and \nfeed/gain conversion. They use math skills to compile data and perform \nmeasurements. The children meet with research scientists from the \nUniversity of Minnesota's College of Agricultural, Food, and \nEnvironmental Sciences at the West Central Research and Outreach \nCenter. The scientists talk with the children about research, how to \nwrite a scientific hypothesis, and how to conduct a research project \nthat will either prove or disprove the hypothesis.\n  Fifth-graders also conduct a plant-growing experiment, in partnership \nwith the USDA Soils Lab, located in Morris. The children study how \ncertain variables affect germination, growth, and reproduction in \ntomato plants. The children are required to take measurements, \nconstruct data tables, and present findings at the annual Tomato Fest. \nOne-third of the seeds were flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis in \n1997; another third were sealed in a dry container and kept underwater \nat the Scott Carpenter Space Analog Station in Key Largo, FL; and the \nrest were kept as a control group at Park Seed Company.\n  During the fifth-graders' annual science fair, research scientists \nfrom the University join area high school students who excel in \nscience. The scientists and high school students visit the fifth- grade \nclassrooms for a ``meet the expert day,'' when they review the science \nprojects, answer questions, and give feedback about the fifth-graders' \nprojects.\n  While the Award for Excellence in Education recognizes the Morris \nElementary fifth-grade science curriculum, the school has also done \nvery well in reading and math, receiving four stars in reading and five \nstars in math from the Minnesota Department of Education in 2005.\n  Much of the credit for Morris Elementary School's success belongs to \nits principal, Brad Korn, and the dedicated teachers and staff. The \npupils and staff at Morris Elementary School understand that, in order \nto be successful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; \nit must also provide a nurturing environment where pupils can develop \nthe knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All \nof the faculty, staff, and pupils at Morris Elementary School should be \nvery proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Morris Elementary School in Morris for winning the \nAward for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional contributions \nto education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8959-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8959-S8960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MARSHALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS, MARSHALL, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor the Marshall Public \nSchool District, in Marshall, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  The Marshall Public School District is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. Marshall Mayor Bob Byrnes nominated the local school district \nfor an Award for Excellence, based largely upon the many programs \noffered through a collaboration of the school district, the city, and \nlocal businesses.\n  The programs include the Marshall Public School District's Mentor \nConnection Program, which gives students an opportunity to shadow \nMarshall business, nonprofit, and government leaders; the Talents \nAcademy, which pairs the brightest instructors with gifted students at \na very early age; and the Marshall East Campus Learning Alternative, \nMECLA, Program, the district's alternative education program for \nstudents at risk of dropping out of high school. All of these reflect \nthe belief of the Marshall community that ``all children are important \nresources.''\n  The growth and achievement shown by Marshall's students have supplied \nbenchmarks for other Minnesota school districts. Students achieved 90 \npercent reading proficiency and 80 percent math proficiency on the \nMinnesota Comprehensive Assessment tests. Over 50 percent of Marshall's \nteachers have at least a master's degree.\n  The Emerging Leadership Investment Program for Marshall's minority \nresidents demonstrates the effectiveness of collaboration on the local \nlevel. The partnership between the city, its schools, and its \nbusinesses has also produced an extremely successful intramural sports \nprogram at Marshall High School, which allows a cross section of \nstudents to interact socially in a structured, recreational setting, \nwhile benefiting from physical activity. The program will be expanded \nthis fall to deliver the same opportunities to middle school children. \nIn addition, foreign languages, creative writing, and science clubs \nwill be added to afterschool activities.\n  Mayor Byrnes said, ``Our community is fortunate to understand the \ncommon goal of educating our youth and developing communities that \ndemonstrate their interest in our youth. Communities that value youth, \nin the end, will retain youth for its sustainable future.''\n  In 2005, the Marshall High School received a three-star rating in \nmath and a five-star rating in reading from the Minnesota Department of \nEducation; the junior high school received a four-star rating in math \nand a three-star rating in reading; and the elementary schools received \nthree-star ratings in both math and reading.\n  Much of the credit for the Marshall Public School District's success \nbelongs to its superintendent, Mr. Klint\n\n[[Page S8960]]\n\nWillert, and the dedicated principals, teachers, and staff. The \nstudents and staff at Marshall Public Schools understand that, in order \nto be successful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; \nit must also provide a nurturing environment where students can develop \nthe knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life.

Mr. President, today I honor Walker-Hackensack-\nAkeley School District's speech team, in Walker, MN, which recently \nearned an Award for Excellence in Education for its exceptional and \ninnovative achievements in educating children.\n  The Walker-Hackensack-Akeley speech team is truly a model of \neducational success. The team has demonstrated that when a school \nestablishes a reputation in a specific area, this promotes high \nexpectations, community involvement and support, and an atmosphere \nencouraging further success. The competitive speech program at Walker-\nHackensack-Akeley High School truly sets this school apart from most \nothers in the State. The program is primarily for senior high school, \nbut exceptionally gifted seventh- and eighth-graders can also \nparticipate.\n  The speech program focuses on the Minnesota State High School Speech \nCompetition and the National Forensic League. Both areas of \nconcentration have brought numerous awards and recognition to Walker-\nHackensack-Akeley communities. More important, the program has helped \ndevelop students' skills and led them, in some cases, to world-class \nopportunities.\n  Walker-Hackensack-Akeley's speech program has produced more State \nchampions and medal winners at State-level competition than any school \nits size, and the high school consistently ranks among the top schools \nthroughout Minnesota. Many students have gone on to compete in the \nprestigious National Forensic League, and 10 former students have \nachieved National Forensic League Academic All-American status. Many \nhave also pursued distinguished careers in law, medicine, and business.\n  The Walker-Hackensack-Akeley speech program has a 40-year record of \nsuccess, during which participants earned 163 State speech medals, \nincluding 31 individual State championships. Participants of the \nprogram have competed 21 times at the national level and have won \ndozens of invitational, subsection, and sectional titles.\n  Last year, the high school's graduating class of 61 students received \nin excess of $650,000 in merit-based scholarships from universities and \ncolleges across the country.\n  Much of the credit for the Walker-Hackensack-Akeley's speech team's \nsuccess belongs to its coach, Chuck Cravens. The students and staff at \nWalker-Hackensack-Akeley Schools understand that in order to be \nsuccessful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it must \nalso provide a nurturing environment where students can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life.

Mr. President, today I honor the Wabasso Public \nSchools, in Wabasso, MN, which recently earned an Award for Excellence \nin Education for exceptional and innovative achievements in educating \nchildren.\n  The Wabasso Public Schools are truly a model of educational success. \nThe district is a small, rural district that has a single building for \nits entire program, prekindergarten through grade 12. Superintendent \nTed Suss describes the District as the ``center of local activity, the \nmost important institution within its community, and the emblem of \ncommunity pride.'' Wabasso Public Schools have demonstrated that \nquality education can be provided in a small, rural school district. \nThe district prides itself for its success in academics, athletics, and \nthe arts.\n  Wabasso Public Schools' amenities include a comprehensive early \nchildhood education program, a formal prekindergarten for 4-year-olds \nand an all-day kindergarten. In the high school, Wabasso offers a full-\nyear physics class and a full-year calculus class. The vocational \nagriculture department offers additional opportunities for students to \nearn science credits, including hands-on learning in floriculture, \nagriculture, crop science, and animal science. The district will begin \noffering advanced placement classes next year, which very few rural \ndistricts are able to do.\n  The Wabasso community is proudest of a Future Farmers of America \nChapter in which 25 percent of all students in grades 9 through 12 won \nthe opportunity to compete at the FAA State Convention; the Wabasso \nHigh School choir, which won three ``superior'' ratings, the maximum \npossible under Minnesota State High School League rules; the Wabasso \nHigh School Rabbits, which have an extraordinary record of success, \nincluding State championships in girls' fast-pitch softball and \nbasketball; the boys' wrestling team has qualified for the State \ntournament in 2 of the past 3 years, winning second place in 2001 and \nreaching the semifinals in 2003; and the football team has also \nadvanced to the State tournament in 2 of the past 3 years. The success \nof the football team is even more impressive, given that the school has \nopted to play in the more competitive 11-man league even though the \nsmall enrollment would have allowed them to compete in the 9-man \nleague.\n  To control costs, the Wabasso School District has hired a single dean \nof students to serve as the principal for the elementary school, middle \nschool, and high school. A site council makes many of the decisions \ntraditionally made by a school principal.\n  The Wabasso Elementary School received a four-star rating in math and \na five-star rating in reading from the department of education, while \nthe high school received three-star ratings in both math and reading. \nLast year, every 10th-grade student passed the state MCA writing test \non the first attempt. Well over 90 percent of the class of 2005 \ncontinued on to a postsecondary education program or entered the \nmilitary.\n  Much of the credit for Wabasso Public School's success belongs to its \nsuperintendent, Ted Suss, its dean of students, Amy Iverson, and the \ndedicated teachers and staff. The students and staff at Wabasso Public \nSchools understand that, in order to be successful, a school must go \nbeyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a nurturing \nenvironment where students can develop the knowledge, skills, and \nattitudes for success throughout life. All of the faculty, staff, and \nstudents at Wabasso Public Schools should be very proud of their \naccomplishments.\n  I congratulate Wabasso Public Schools in Wabasso for winning the \nAward for Excellence in Education and for exceptional contributions to \neducation in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8960-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8960-S8961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THOMAS JEFFERSON HIGH SCHOOL, BLOOMINGTON, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor Thomas Jefferson High \nSchool, in Bloomington, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Thomas Jefferson High School is truly a model of educational success. \nThe school is to be commended for its overall commitment to quality \neducation, including its curriculum and scheduling, staffing, materials \nand equipment, and facilities. The quality of Jefferson's programs in \nthe sciences, mathematics, language arts, health,\n\n[[Page S8961]]\n\nmusic, languages, special education, technology, media, and the arts \nhas set the standard for secondary education in Minnesota. In 2004 and \n2005, the school ranked as one of the top six schools in the State on \nthe Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments reading and math scores.\n  Thomas Jefferson High School, which opened in 1970, has 1,748 \nstudents and prides itself for its academic rigor. During the past 3 \nyears, 30 students have earned distinction as National Merit Scholar \nSemifinalists and Commended Scholars. Each year, over 150 students earn \ncollege credits at Jefferson by scoring three points or higher on \nadvanced placement tests. After graduation, more than 80 percent of \nJefferson students go on to postsecondary educational opportunities.\n  Academics alone, however, do not present the whole picture. According \nto the Thomas Jefferson High School mission statement: ``The Jefferson \nHigh School Community will develop and nurture responsible leaders and \nenlightened citizens who challenge themselves to create the present and \nenrich the future.'' The teachers and administrators at Jefferson High \nare proud of their students' academic, athletic, and artistic \naccomplishments, especially when achieved in the spirit of the Thomas \nJefferson core ethical values of respect, responsibility, integrity, \ncitizenship, and honesty.\n  For example, in keeping with Jefferson's broad mission statement, \nstudents demonstrated their personal integrity and desire to serve \nothers by working to raise over $12,000 for hurricane relief and \n$10,000 for the Red Cross relief efforts.\n  In addition, the Jefferson Marching Band, which is fondly known as \nthe Pride of Minnesota, is a source of special luster and has performed \nat the Cotton Bowl, Alamo Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, and Tournament of Roses \nParade. Students are also offered a choice of two orchestra programs.\n  The school does well in athletic competition. Over its 35-year \nhistory, Jefferson High School has won 51 State championships in \nhockey, soccer, football, baseball, and other men's and women's sports. \nRecent accomplishments of Jefferson sports teams include a 2004-2005 \nBoys State Soccer Championship, a 2004-2005 Boys' Hockey Lake \nConference and 6AA Championship Title, and a 2003-2004 Girls State \nAlpine Ski Academic Championship.\n  Much of the credit for Thomas Jefferson High School's success belongs \nto its principal, Steve Hill, and the dedicated teachers. The students \nand staff at Thomas Jefferson High School understand that, in order to \nbe successful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it \nmust also provide a nurturing environment where students can develop \nthe knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life.

Mr. President, today I honor Wilshire Park \nElementary School, in Saint Anthony Village, MN, which recently earned \nan Award for Excellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative \nachievements in educating children.\n  Wilshire Park Elementary School is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. Wilshire's motto is: ``Making Kids #1 for Over 40 Years.'' The \nschool's reputation is reflected in the fact that nearly half its \npupils enter through open enrollment, and there is a long waiting list \nfor acceptance. Families choose Wilshire because it is known for \nacademic excellence and for its safe, caring environment\n  Test scores at Wilshire Park Elementary School are well above the \nState average and continue to improve every year. Three years ago, \nWilshire received three stars in reading and math from the Minnesota \nDepartment of Education. Two years ago, the school received four stars \nin reading and three in math. Last year, Wilshire received four stars \nin reading and five stars in math.\n  However, test scores and ratings alone do not fully represent a \nschool's true success. The principal and teachers at Wilshire Park \nElementary believe many other factors influence children's ability to \nlearn, qualities often better revealed through personal stories \ndescribing an atmosphere of caring and nurturing.\n  The true sense of the Wilshire community is evident from the support \nthe entire school gives to children experiencing tragedies in their \nlives. One Wilshire student has been on kidney dialysis for several \nyears, waiting to receive a transplant. Last fall, the school held a \ndance to raise funds to help cover the family's medical expenses. Also, \nearlier this year, staff rallied to support a first-grader whose mother \ndied suddenly.\n  Wilshire was the first school in the five-State area to have a K-Kids \nClub, which is a Kiwanis Club for children to work on projects to \nbenefit the whole community.\n  Wilshire Park Elementary School is also proud of the tremendous \nvolunteer support it receives from the community. The school currently \nhas 252 active volunteers, of whom 70 to 80 work at the school at least \n1 to 2 days per week. These volunteers not only include parents of \nWilshire pupils; aunts, grandparents, and community members are also \nregulars in the volunteer room.\n  Much of the credit for Wilshire Park Elementary School's success \nbelongs to its recently retired principal, Dr. Bonnie Kirkpatrick, and \nthe dedicated teachers and staff. The pupils and staff at Wilshire Park \nElementary School understand that, in order to be successful, a school \nmust go beyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a \nnurturing environment where children can develop the knowledge, skills, \nand attitudes for success throughout life. All of the faculty, staff, \nand pupils at Wilshire Park Elementary School should be very proud of \ntheir accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Wilshire Park Elementary School in Saint Anthony \nVillage for winning the Award for Excellence in Education and for its \nexceptional contributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8961-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8961-S8962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RENVILLE COUNTY WEST SCHOOL DISTRICT, RENVILLE, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor Renville County West \nSchool District, in Renville, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Renville County West School District is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. The district has struggled financially for many years, \nprimarily as a result of declining enrollment. It has addressed its \nfinancial problems through multiple consolidations of many districts \ninto a single district, and last year, the closing of yet another \nschool building. These moves, while financially necessary, are \nextremely hard on the students, staff, and community.\n  While the district has been plagued by falling enrollment due to \npopulation trends, statutory operating debt, reductions in staff and \nprograms, and staff development funds that have been suspended, the \ndistrict maintains its commitment to quality education. Its schools \nhave consistently made yearly progress toward the goals of No Child \nLeft Behind.\n  Despite these challenges, test scores in Renville County West schools \nhave improved over the past few years. Last year, Renville County West \nElementary School earned four-star ratings in math and reading; and its \nhigh school earned a four-star rating in math. Renville County West's \ncontinued academic progress has also overcome changes created by \ngreater numbers of special education, low-income, and minority \nstudents.\n  The statements of teachers and students offer yet another reflection \nof the success of the district. Social sciences teacher Daniel Rohman \nwrites: ``I have developed a senior economics class that gives kids a \nspringboard into life. In this class, I teach the concepts of micro and \nmacro but try to put it into real life examples that the kids have to \nwork at. In this class I teach investments. We do mock\n\n[[Page S8962]]\n\nportfolios; we track stocks; we do government securities, 403s and \n401s, IRAs, mutual funds, insurance plans, money market accounts, and \non and on.\n  ``I have had kids so interested in this class that they have gone \ninto the securities profession as investment brokers, insurance sales, \nworking for firms such as State Farm and Piper Jaffrey. Do you think \nthat makes me proud? You bet it does. That is what teaching is all \nabout. Seeing a kid make three times what I make and feeling good about \nit when they come back to share their success story with you and \nsaying, `Thank you, you made a difference in my life.' ''\n  Molly Forkrud, a 2006 graduate of Renville, describes her academic \ncareer, writing: ``I can honestly say in all four campuses, I have \nreceived a wonderful education. This education did not come from the \nwalls, halls, or classrooms of certain buildings, but rather the \nconsistent ambition of the teachers and staff who instructed me. The \nbuildings themselves have had nothing to do with my education, but it's \nthe people inside who have impacted my life as a student.''\n  Although the district has struggled financially, it has made the \nfinancial commitment to fund an all-day kindergarten for all children, \nsomething the State of Minnesota has refused to provide.\n  Much of the credit for the Renville County West School District's \nsuccess belongs to its Superintendent, Mr. Doug Conboy, and the \ndedicated principals, teachers, and staff. The students and staff at \nthe Renville County West School District understand that in order to be \nsuccessful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success. It must \nalso provide a nurturing environment where students can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All of \nthe faculty, staff, and students at the Renville County West School \nDistrict should be very proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate the Renville County West School District in Renville \nfor winning the Award for Excellence in Education and for its \nexceptional contributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8962-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SAINT MICHAEL-ALBERTVILLE HIGH SCHOOL, ALBERTVILLE, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor Saint Michael-\nAlbertville High School, in Albertville, MN, which recently earned an \nAward for Excellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative \nachievements in educating children.\n  Saint Michael-Albertville High School is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. Its students and staff recently completed a collaborative \neffort uniting the environmental sciences classes, studio art classes, \nand members of the community to create a mural, now displayed in the \nschool's courtyard. The students also designed a flower garden to \nbeautify the building's landscaping. Each of the mural's components \ndepicts one of the four seasons in Minnesota.\n  The mural, which was completed last November, was funded through a \ngrant from the Minnesota Arts Board. Over 180 high school students \ncontributed, under the direction of Mr. Danny Saathoff, an artist in \nresidence. Students from the environmental sciences department helped \ndevelop the ideas for each component of the mural. Then studio art \nstudents transformed those ideas into a proposed design. A local \nbusiness, Timberland Clothing Store, also helped install the finished \nmural in the courtyard.\n  Although the Award for Excellence is in recognition of the school's \ncreation of a mural, its academic performance over the past few years \nalso merits recognition. In 2005, the high school received five stars \nin reading and four stars in math from the Minnesota Department of \nEducation, which is a significant improvement over the three-star \nrating the district received in reading and math in 2004. The school \nalso offers a College in a Classroom Program, allowing high school \nstudents to take college-level courses and earn college credits through \na partnership with St. Cloud State University.\n  Much of the credit for the Saint Michael-Albertville High School's \nsuccess belongs to its Principal, Mark Minkler, and the dedicated \nteachers. The students and staff at Saint Michael-Albertville High \nSchool understand that, in order to be successful, a school must go \nbeyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a nurturing \nenvironment where students can develop the knowledge, skills, and \nattitudes for success throughout life.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a gifted \nmusician, successful entrepreneur, devoted wife and mother, \nconstituent, and friend, Helen Armstrong, who passed away on April 28 \nof this year. Helen was an international virtuoso violinist who \ndedicated her life to enriching the lives of others through music.\n  Helen Armstrong was born on March 16, 1943, in Rockford, IL. Her \ncareer as a violinist began at the age of 3. Before long, she was \nenrolled at the Juilliard School where she quickly caught the eye of \nrenowned instructors Ivan Galamian and Dorothy DeLay. She was among the \nselect few chosen to study under them in pursuit of a solo career. \nOther violinists in this group include Helen's childhood friend Yitzhak \nPerlman and Pinchas Zuckerman. In 1976 Helen made her Lincoln Center \ndebut and went on to perform with various orchestras including the \nBoston Pops, the Indianapolis Symphony, and the New Polish \nPhilharmonic. She has also toured North America, Europe, and Asia as a \nrecitalist.\n  But Helen Armstrong was not content to be a successful and highly \naccomplished musician. She was also an entrepreneur and philanthropist \nwho brought music into the lives of others through performance and \neducation.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a gifted \nmusician, successful entrepreneur, devoted wife and mother, \nconstituent, and friend, Helen Armstrong, who passed away on April 28 \nof this year. Helen was an international virtuoso violinist who \ndedicated her life to enriching the lives of others through music.\n  Helen Armstrong was born on March 16, 1943, in Rockford, IL. Her \ncareer as a violinist began at the age of 3. Before long, she was \nenrolled at the Juilliard School where she quickly caught the eye of \nrenowned instructors Ivan Galamian and Dorothy DeLay. She was among the \nselect few chosen to study under them in pursuit of a solo career. \nOther violinists in this group include Helen's childhood friend Yitzhak \nPerlman and Pinchas Zuckerman. In 1976 Helen made her Lincoln Center \ndebut and went on to perform with various orchestras including the \nBoston Pops, the Indianapolis Symphony, and the New Polish \nPhilharmonic. She has also toured North America, Europe, and Asia as a \nrecitalist.\n  But Helen Armstrong was not content to be a successful and highly \naccomplished musician. She was also an entrepreneur and philanthropist \nwho brought music into the lives of others through performance and \neducation. She founded Armstrong Chamber Concerts, Inc. and served as \nits artistic director for more than 22 years. What began one summer as \na way to lure musicians out of New York City to perform in Helen's home \nin Washington, CT became a thriving enterprise encompassing performance \nseries in Litchfield and Fairfield counties as well as Carnegie Hall \nrecitals, corporate events, and educational programs in schools in \nConnecticut and New York City.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment and wish best \nof luck to an accomplished, young and promising Mississippian who is \nleaving federal service to pursue private sector opportunities.\n  Nick Walters, originally of Wiggins, MS, was appointed as \nMississippi's USDA Rural Development Director by President George Bush \nin 2001. Since then, Nick has done a great job supporting Mississippi's \ncommunities, helping to secure resources needed for public facilities, \nutilities, and for economic development.\n  This is a key Federal position for my State. As Nick likes to say, \nthis is the ``nonfarm,'' or ``nonfood'' part of USDA. It is about new \nwater and waste water systems, so people can have clean, dependable \nrunning water. It is about new community centers, town halls, and even \nhigh-tech or educational assets like broadband service, telemedicine \nand long-distance learning.\n  Since taking office, Nick has presented scores of oversized checks, \nin countless, photos for local papers telling stories about a new water \ntower or a new police car or fire truck.\n  Some people might think these things are small, and they often are in \nterms of Federal dollars. But these modest services will reverberate \nfor years to come. As Nick says: USDA Rural Development is really about \neconomic development, helping to encourage and sustain job creation--\npaving the way for communities to grow.\n  Nick has helped administer more than $100 million to Mississippi's \ncities and towns through this agency.\n  He hasn't sat on his laurels waiting for mayors, supervisors, town \nalderman or CEOs to approach him. Nick has been proactive, innovative, \nand he has actively sought cases and ways to meet individual community \nneeds through USDA's various Rural Development Programs.\n  We've all heard the old saying: Don't tel1 me what you can't do, tell \nme what you can do. That has been Nick Walters' approach to public \nservice. His first inclination is to act.\n  That is something we Mississippians appreciate. After Hurricane \nKatrina, we saw many Federal bureaucrats in FEMA and elsewhere strapped \nby indecision, blinded by tunnel vision, stuck on what they could not \ndo, obsessed with the word ``no,'' when they should have been saying \n``yes.''\n  Nick isn't that type. He has provided a great example of what someone \nin this office can do using its authority to the utmost, and we are \nworking hard to find a successor who will continue this strong \nleadership.\n  Nick Walters will be missed, but my guess is that he will be back in \npublic service one day. In what capacity? I don't know. That's a \ndecision for him, his wife Lisa and his young children, Porter and John \nGarrett.\n  But now with this success behind him and given his previous \nexperience in the private sector, his work with former Mississippi \nGovernor Kirk Fordice, his stint as chief of staff for the Mississippi \nPublic Service Commission--Nick Walters will be successful in wherever \nhis endeavors may lead.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Nick Walters for his \nexemplary service to the Federal Government and, more importantly, to \nAmerica as Mississippi's USDA rural development director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8963-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BRAD EXTON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Brad Exton, \nan individual with a long and outstanding record as member of the U.S. \nForest Service. Over the course of his 29 years in the Forest Service, \nMr. Exton has held many demanding posts, including deputy forest \nsupervisor and acting forest supervisor of the Black Hills National \nForest, BHNF, in South Dakota. He has also been instrumental in helping \nthe Forest Service improve relations with Native American tribes, and \nhelped to create a closer relationship between the Forest Service, \nNational Park Service, and the State park system.\n  Before his tenure in South Dakota, Mr. Exton served in several States \nand numerous positions within the Forest Service. He was a graduate \nforester in Oregon; a river ranger in the Frank Church River of No \nReturn Wilderness in Idaho; a district ranger in Caribou-Targhee \nNational Forest, encompassing 3 million acres in Idaho, Montana, \nWyoming, and Utah; and a recreation staff officer in the Ashley \nNational Forest in Utah. He brought this wealth of experience with him \nto BHNF in April of 2003.\n  As deputy forest supervisor and acting forest supervisor at BHNF, Mr. \nExton took a leadership role in confronting some of the most difficult \nchallenges facing the organization. For example, Mr. Exton was a BHNF \nspokesman and negotiator on issues of concern to Indian tribes. The \nBlack Hills area is sacred land to 22 tribes, including the Lakota \npeople, and there has often been tension with the Forest Service over \nthe role of the tribes in land management and usage. Through meetings \nand the formation of an advisory group, Mr. Exton has partnered with \ntribal members to seek a more active role for the tribes in maintaining \nhealthy forests and creating an atmosphere of respect for indigenous \ncultures and knowledge. His commitment was reflected in 2005, when he \nwas awarded a Regional Forester Honor Award for his work with the \nRosebud Sioux Tribe in developing a program of fuel reduction.\n  While it is unfortunate for BHNF to lose a valuable public servant \nsuch as Mr. Exton, I am confident he will thrive in his new position as \nmanager of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. I \nwish to congratulate Mr. Exton on this exciting new opportunity, and \nwish him all the best. The cooperation and respect Mr. Exton has \nfostered in South Dakota will remain as a worthy legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8963-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING RUDY GARCIA\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to honor the memory of Rudolph ``Rudy'' Garcia, a \nquintessential entrepreneur and fixture in the St. Paul community, who \npassed away on August 27, 2006, at the age of 61. As Rudy's close \nfriends have noted: ``He truly personified the American Dream.'' Having \ngrown up in an orphanage without any formation education, Rudy decided \nat an early age to chase his dream of owning and operating his own \nrestaurant a dream that went hand in hand with his great love of \ncooking.\n  At the age of 21, he opened his first establishment, Garcia's Casita \non the West Side of the city, becoming St. Paul's first Latino \nbusinessowner. Through a combination of Rudy's personality and \ncommonsense business practices, he was able to grow Garcia's Casita \ninto a string of six different St. Paul eating establishments during \nthe 1990s. From steakhouses to nightclubs, Rudy's perseverance \ncontinually led him to success even in the face of several failures and \na St. Paul that was still on the edge of revitalization.\n  Rick Aguilar, a St. Paul businessman and longtime friend, described \nRudy as ``a man with a million ideas'' whose energy helped him roll \nwith the punches and make his dreams a reality. Rudy continued to stay \nthe course as both he and St. Paul grew alongside each other through \nthe years. In 1994, while serving as the mayor of St. Paul, I had the \ndistinct privilege of proclaiming a day in his honor. While the St. \nPaul community mourns Rudy's passing, we can't help but celebrate his \nlife that should serve as a model for not only Latinos, but all \nAmericans who are looking to make their dreams a reality.\n  The St. Paul area and I will sincerely miss Garcia's great commitment \nto our community. Whether it was his work in the restaurant business or \nhis participation in the early 1960s band the Jaymars a popular area \nband that played a mix of jazz, rock `n' roll and blues--Garcia's \nimpact on St. Paul is immeasurable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8963-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8963-S8964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LYN McCLELLAND\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Lyn \nMcClelland, a highly respected leader in the maritime community, who is \nretiring this month after 21 years of service as the Maritime \nAdministration's Seattle representative. Lyn has helped support the \nsuccess, safety, and security of the U.S. maritime community in the \nPacific Northwest.\n  Over the years, we have turned to Lyn time and again for her \nexpertise, her judgment, and her ability to come\n\n[[Page S8964]]\n\nup with practical solutions. If there is a challenge in the maritime \ncommunity, you can bet that Lyn's worked to solve it.\n  I am especially proud of Lyn's work on critical security programs, \nwhich as my colleagues know is an area of special interest for me. I \nwas so pleased that Lyn worked on Operation Safe Commerce, which I \nhelped create here in the Senate. She has worked on the STEP program \nSeattle/Tacoma/Everett Port Security Program, and the Washington State \nTransportation Research Center electronic seal test. She's been a key \nplayer on three Area Maritime Security Committees Alaska, Washington, \nand Oregon, and Lyn partnered with the Coast Guard on a number of \nmaritime security programs including reviewing applications for port \nsecurity grants. Lyn's work also helped ensure the development, \navailability and security of military out-load ports in support of our \nmen and women engaged in hostilities overseas.\n  Lyn's contributions were not limited to port security. She has also \nbeen a major supporter of the development of the Marine Transportation \nSystem, the U.S. Merchant Marine, and she has always been involved in \nencouraging young people to pursue careers in the maritime industry. \nHer support of the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Committee spurred the \nadoption of new safety measures for vessel and waterfront facility \noperation. Lyn's eager participation in a wide array of maritime events \nand celebrations helped make them successful.\n  Lyn has been a stalwart leader and mainstay of the Pacific Northwest \nmaritime industry, and she has strengthened the relationship between \nindustry and government. As other leaders came and went, we could \nalways rely on the energy, knowledge, dedication, and professionalism \nof Lyn McClelland for any challenge. I want to wish her ``fair winds \nand following seas'' in her well-deserved retirement. She will be \ngreatly missed. Lyn may be leaving her job, but she is leaving all of \nus with a tremendous legacy of service and success.

Convention Against Corruption]\n\n       Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein),\n       Section 1. Senate Advice and Consent subject to \n     reservations and declarations.\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     United Nations Convention Against Corruption (hereinafter in \n     this resolution referred to as the ``Convention''), adopted \n     by the United Nations General Assembly on October 31, 2003, \n     and signed by the United States on December 9, 2003, at \n     Merida, Mexico (T. Doc. 109096), subject to the reservations \n     in section 2 and the declarations in section 3.\n       Section 2. Reservations.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following reservations, which shall be \n     included in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The United States of America reserves the right to \n     assume obligations under the Convention in a manner \n     consistent with its fundamental principles of federalism, \n     pursuant to which both federal and state criminal laws must \n     be considered in relation to the conduct addressed in the \n     Convention. U.S. federal criminal law, which regulates \n     conduct based on its effect on interstate or foreign \n     commerce, or another federal interest, serves as an important \n     component of the legal regime within the United States for \n     combating corruption and is broadly effective for this \n     purpose. Federal criminal law does not apply where such \n     criminal conduct does not so involve interstate or foreign \n     commerce, or another federal interest. There are conceivable \n     situations involving offenses of a purely local character \n     where U.S. federal and state criminal law may not be entirely \n     adequate to satisfy an obligation under the Convention. \n     Similarly, in the U.S. system, the states are responsible for \n     preventive measures governing their own officials. While the \n     states generally regulate their own affairs in a manner \n     consistent with the obligations set forth in the chapter on \n     preventive measures in the Convention, in some cases they may \n     do so in a different manner. Accordingly, there may be \n     situations where state and federal law will not be entirely \n     adequate to satisfy an obligation in Chapters II and III of \n     the Convention. The United States of America therefore \n     reserves to the obligations set forth in the Convention to \n     the extent they (1) address conduct that would fall within \n     this narrow category of highly localized activity or (2) \n     involve preventive measures not covered by federal law \n     governing state and local officials. This reservation does \n     not affect in any respect the ability of the United States to \n     provide international cooperation to other States Parties in \n     accordance with the provisions of the Convention.\n       (2) The United States of America reserves the right not to \n     apply in part the obligation set forth in Article 42, \n     paragraph 1(b) with respect to the offenses established in \n     accordance with the Convention. The United States does not \n     provide for plenary jurisdiction over offenses that are \n     committed on board ships flying its flag or aircraft \n     registered under its laws. However, in many circumstances, \n     U.S. law provides for jurisdiction over such offenses \n     committed on board U.S.-flagged ships or aircraft registered \n     under U.S. law. Accordingly, the United States shall \n     implement paragraph 1(b) to the extent provided for under its \n     federal law.\n       Section 3. Declarations.\n       (a) The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\n     declaration: The United States of America declares that, in \n     view of its reservations, current United States law, \n     including the laws of the States of United States, fulfills \n     the obligations of the Convention for the United States. \n     Accordingly, the United States of America does not intend to \n     enact new legislation to fulfill its obligations under the \n     Convention.\n       (b) The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following declarations, which shall be \n     included in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       (1) In accordance with Article 66, paragraph 3, the United \n     States of America declares that it does not consider itself \n     bound by the obligation set forth in Article 66, paragraph 2.\n       (2) The United States declares that the provisions of the \n     Convention (with the exception of Articles 44 and 46) are \n     non-self-executing. None of the provisions of the Convention \n     creates a private right of action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8972-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. SCHUMER:\n       S. 3840.

A bill to permit individuals who are employees of a grantee \nthat is receiving funds under section 330 of the Public Health Service \nAct to enroll in health insurance coverage provided under the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original coauthor \nof the Community Health Center Employee Health Coverage Act of 2006 \nwith Senators Smith and Murkowski. I ask for unanimous consent that a \nfact sheet with respect to the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Fact Sheet\n\n       Problem: Like many small businesses, health centers have \n     seen their health insurance premiums sky-rocket. Although \n     they delivered comprehensive primary and preventive care to \n     more than 15 million people in 2004, more than 6 million of \n     whom had no health insurance coverage, these rising costs \n     will have detrimental impacts on health centers as they are \n     forced to channel federal grant dollars (which are intended \n     for the uninsured and underinsured) to pay for the increasing \n     insurance expenditures. If this continues, health centers may \n     eventually be forced to either reduce the coverage of their \n     own employees or reduce the availability of health care in \n     their already underserved communities.\n       Fortunately, employees of health centers are generally \n     healthy individuals and largely do not have chronic diseases \n     or high medical bills. The irony here is that at the same \n     time that health center employees are providing quality care \n     to the uninsured and very poor, they are often unable to \n     afford health insurance themselves. Furthermore, health \n     centers have cited affordable health care as a key concern in \n     recruiting and retaining quality employees and clinical \n     staff.\n       Solution: This bipartisan legislation, introduced by \n     Senators Smith, Bingaman, and Murkowski, would reduce health \n     centers' rising health insurance costs and also improve \n     coverage in many cases and therefore save taxpayer grant \n     money that would otherwise be used to pay health insurance \n     premiums. The bill would enable health centers to use scarce \n     funds to continue providing care in their communities. In \n     addition, extending coverage under FEHBP to health centers \n     would allow health centers to continue to offer health \n     insurance to their employees so they too don't join the ranks \n     of the uninsured.\n       This bill would not set a precedent. The law currently \n     provides for Federal Employees Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) \n     coverage for other individuals who are not federal employees \n     but do receive federal grant funds for their operations, such \n     as Gallaudet University or USDA grant recipients comprised of \n     local farmers. Currently FEHBP covers over nine million \n     federal employees, while Heath Centers employ nearly 100,000 \n     people across the country.\n       This would be a logical extension of the health centers' \n     Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) legislation, where health \n     center staffers are deemed as federal employees for medical \n     malpractice coverage purposes. This bill would extend the \n     same mechanism for health insurance purposes.\n       Benefit: This bill will aid in the continuation of \n     providing quality health care to those who need it most. It \n     would also provide relief to community health centers in the \n     form of lower premiums and better coverage for their \n     employees by deeming them as federal employees for purposes \n     of the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP). There \n     should be no federal cost for this bill as health centers \n     will pay the health care premiums for their employees but at \n     a less expensive cost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8974-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8974-S8975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Reid, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 3841. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Bureau of \nReclamation to carry out the Lower Colorado River Multi-Species \nConservation Program in the States of Arizona, California, and Nevada, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senators \nEnsign, Feinstein and Reid to introduce the Lower Colorado River Multi-\nSpecies Conservation Program Act. This bipartisan legislation is \ndesigned to protect and maintain wildlife habitat on the lower Colorado \nRiver and to provide assurances to the affected water and power \nagencies of Arizona, California, and Nevada that their river operations \nmay continue upon compliance with the underlying program.\n  The Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program, \notherwise known as the MSCP, is a comprehensive, cooperative effort \namong 50 Federal and non-Federal entities in Arizona, California, and \nNevada whose purposes are to: 1. protect the lower Colorado River \nenvironment while ensuring the certainty of existing river water and \npower operations; 2. protect threatened and endangered wildlife under \nthe Endangered Species Act; and 3. prevent the listing of additional \nspecies on the lower Colorado River.\n  To accomplish these goals, the MSCP will create more than 8,100 acres \nof riparian, marsh, and backwater habitat and implement additional \nmeasures to protect 26 endangered, threatened and sensitive species. \nThe program covers approximately 400 miles, including the full-pool \nelevations of Lake Mead to the United States-Mexico Southerly \nInternational Boundary.\n  The program costs will be spread over 50 years, and split 50/50 \nbetween the Federal Government and the non-\n\n[[Page S8975]]\n\nFederal entities covered by MSCP. Arizona and Nevada will each bear 25 \npercent of the non-Federal costs and California will bear 50 percent of \nthe non-Federal costs.\n  Although implementation of the program began in April 2005 under the \nU.S. Department of the Interior's existing authority, legislation is \nneeded to protect the substantial financial commitments that the non-\nFederal parties are making to species protection. To that end, the \nbill: 1. expressly authorizes appropriations to cover the Federal share \nof the program costs; 2. directs the Secretary of the Interior to \nmanage and implement the MSCP in accordance with the underlying program \ndocuments; and 3. provides a waiver of sovereign immunity to allow the \nnon-Federal parties to enforce, if necessary, the underlying program \ndocuments. The waiver, however, does not allow an action to be brought \nagainst the United States for money damages.\n  While some minor issues remain regarding the continuity of the \nprogram documents, we have every confidence that these issues will be \nresolved as the legislation progresses.\n  In summary, this bill will ensure the certainty of existing river \nwater and power operations while at the same time conserving and \nhelping the recovery of endangered species on the lower Colorado River. \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8975-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4882.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on September 5, 2006, by the President \nof the United States: Patent Law Treaty and Regulations Under Patent \nLaw Treaty, Treaty Document No. 109-12. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the treaty be considered as having been read the first time; that \nit be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's message \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The President's message is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, subject to the reservation outlined below, I transmit \nherewith the Patent Law Treaty and Regulations Under the Patent Law \nTreaty (the ``Treaty''), done at Geneva on June 1, 2000, between the \nGovernments of 53 countries including the United States of America. I \nalso transmit, for the information of the Senate, the Key Provisions of \nthe Patent Law Treaty report prepared by the Department of State.\n  Strong intellectual property protection is a cornerstone of free \ntrade and global market access. This Treaty promotes patent protection \nby codifying, harmonizing, and reducing the costs of taking the steps \nnecessary for obtaining and maintaining patents throughout the world. \nThe provisions set forth in the Treaty will safeguard U.S. commercial \ninterests by making it easier for U.S. patent applicants and owners to \nprotect their intellectual property worldwide.\n  The Treaty generally sets forth the maximum procedural requirements \nthat can be imposed on patent applicants, and in addition, provides \nstandardized requirements for obtaining a filing date from which no \nparty may deviate. Additionally, the Treaty provides that applicants \ncannot be required to hire representation for, among other things, the \npurpose of filing an application and that patents may not be revoked or \ninvalidated because of noncompliance with certain application \nrequirements, unless the noncompliance is a result of fraud. The Treaty \ndoes not limit the United States from providing patent requirements \nthat are more favorable to the patent applicant or patent owner than \nthose set forth in the Treaty or from prescribing requirements that are \nprovided for in our substantive law relating to patents. Additionally, \nthe Treaty is not intended to limit the United States from taking \nactions that it deems necessary for the preservation of its essential \nsecurity interests.\n  This Treaty is in harmony with current U.S. patent laws and \nregulations, with minor exceptions to be addressed in proposed \nlegislation. Because U.S. law does not require that each patent \napplication apply to only one invention or inventive concept, and \nbecause the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office assesses that implementing \na provision of the Treaty requiring ``unity of invention'' for all \nnational applications would require a substantive and impractical \nchange to our Patent Law, I recommend that the following reservation be \nincluded in the U.S. instrument of ratification, as allowed by the \nTreaty:\n\n       Pursuant to Article 23, the United States declares that \n     Article 6(1) shall not apply to any requirement relating to \n     unity of invention applicable under the Patent Cooperation \n     Treaty to an international application.\n\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Treaty and give its advice and consent to its ratification, \nsubject to the reservation described above.\n                                                      George W.

Res. 552\n\n       Whereas countless families in the United States have a \n     family member that suffers from prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 1 in 6 men in the United States is diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas throughout the past decade, prostate cancer has \n     been the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer other than \n     skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-\n     related deaths among men in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2006, more than 234,460 men in the United \n     States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 27,350 men \n     in the United States will die of prostate cancer according to \n     estimates from the American Cancer Society;\n       Whereas 30 percent of the new diagnoses of prostate cancer \n     occur in men under the age of 65;\n       Whereas a man in the United States turns 50 years old about \n     every 14 seconds, increasing his odds of being diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas African American males suffer from prostate cancer \n     at an incidence rate up to 65 percent higher than white males \n     and at a mortality rate double that of white males;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity \n     of prostate cancer and the chance that the disease will lead \n     to death;\n       Whereas if a man in the United States has 1 family member \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer, he has double the risk of \n     prostate cancer, if he has 2 family members with such \n     diagnosis, he has 5 times the risk, and if he has 3 family \n     members with such diagnosis, he has a 97 percent risk of \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas screening by both a digital rectal examination \n     (DRE) and a prostate specific antigen blood test (PSA) can \n     detect prostate cancer in earlier and more treatable stages \n     and reduce the rate of mortality due to the disease;\n       Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in \n     prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treatments; \n     and\n       Whereas educating people in the United States, including \n     health care providers, about prostate cancer and early \n     detection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of men \n     and preserving and protecting our families: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2006 as ``National Prostate Cancer \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) declares that it is critical--\n       (A) to raise awareness about the importance of screening \n     methods and the treatment of prostate cancer;\n       (B) to increase research funding to be proportionate with \n     the burden of prostate cancer so that the causes of the \n     disease, improved screening and treatments, and ultimately a \n     cure may be discovered; and\n       (C) to continue to consider methods to improve both access \n     to and the quality of health care services for detecting and \n     treating prostate cancer; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested \n     groups, and affected persons--\n       (A) to promote awareness of prostate cancer;\n       (B) to take an active role in the fight to end the \n     devastating effects of prostate cancer on individuals, their \n     families, and the economy; and\n       (C) to observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/05/senate-section/article/S8978-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8978-S8979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
