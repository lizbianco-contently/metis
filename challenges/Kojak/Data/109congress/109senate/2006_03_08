Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ncomment on the trip that President Bush recently made to my home State \nof Colorado. The President visited several sites that are involved with \nfurthering renewable energy. One of those sites included the National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL as it is often called, in Golden, \nCO. Due to previous commitments, I was unable to join the President \nduring his trip, but I want to thank him for visiting there, and thank \nhim for the commitments he has made to the lab and to renewable energy.\n  NREL is on the cutting edge in bringing renewable energy technologies \nout of the laboratory and into the mainstream of American business and \nsociety. Although America has rivals in many Asian and European nations \nin investing in the development of these technologies, NREL deserves \ncredit for many wonderful accomplishments.\n  In recognition of these accomplishments, I have, during my tenure in \nCongress, led a coalition to push for sufficient funding for both the \nDepartment of Energy's renewables budget and NREL. Earmarks have \ncreated problems for our national laboratories throughout the United \nStates. The President has addressed the problem, and I am working to \nprevent this in the future.\n  The environmental benefits of renewable energy are well noted and \nwidely praised. Not only are renewable sources of energy beneficial to \nour national security, but they reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \ndecrease demands for other energy resources.\n  Wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, photovoltaic and other renewable \nenergies have few if any harmful byproducts. It is simply good policy \nto do all we can to effectively harness and utilize the natural, clean, \nreusable sources of energy that are abundant all around us.\n  However we should also be looking at energy efficient technologies. \nThere is a saying that energy saved is like extra\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\nenergy made. I think it is important that we continue investing in \nresearch and development of renewable energy and energy efficient \ntechnologies. Further developing these technologies is a win-win \nsolution in every sense. Jobs are created, taxpayer money is saved, our \nnational security is enhanced, and the environment is protected.\n  For example, a hog farm near Lamar, CO, is seeing both economic and \nenvironmental benefits from converting to a renewable energy source \nthat they have in abundance. The farm was built with an anaerobic \ndigester, which is fueled by hog waste, and uses its methane as a fuel \nto supply power to the farm operations. An example of how increased \nefficiency saves money comes from Harmony Library in Fort Collins, CO. \nThe library is considered to be a showcase for state-of-the-art, \nenergy-efficient technologies and building design. They are projected \nto use about 40 percent less energy than a comparable new building in \nFort Collins. They estimate that this will save nearly $12,000 in \nannual operation costs. The library will be able to use these savings \nto increase stock and provide additional library services.\n  Renewable and efficient technologies are an important part of a \nbalanced domestic energy portfolio, and our energy future and national \nsecurity will be enriched by the technologies being developed and \nperfected today. We must maintain our commitment to funding the \nresearch and development that will bring those technologies to the \nmarket. The future of our security and prosperity depends on the \ncommitments we make today.\n  I would also like to remind my colleagues of the Renewable Energy and \nEnergy Efficiency Caucus within the Senate. The caucus works to keep \nMembers informed about issues important to the renewables and \nefficiency communities. We currently have 36 members, but we would like \nto have more.\n  I also want to thank the President again for his sincere interest in \nsolar and biofuels. The visit to NREL by President Bush and his staff \nis appreciated by those of us who have been advocating a role in our \nenergy policy for renewable energy. I will continue to work with the \nadministration and my colleagues on the issues facing renewable energy \nresources.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1860-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STRENGTH\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the strength of \nour economy.\n  This might seem like a news flash, but our economy is thriving.\n  You would not know it if you tuned in to a network newscast or read \nthe paper, but we have much to be excited about.\n  The U.S. economy is healthy, growing, and creating more opportunity \nevery single day.\n  The commonsense tax relief that we passed in the Senate and that the \nPresident signed into law have fueled our economy and driven it to new \nheights.\n  Fighting for this relief wasn't a gamble--we did it because it has a \nproven track record.\n  We know that lowering taxes creates more jobs, greater opportunity, \nand overall prosperity.\n  It has been proven in my home State of Nevada, and we have seen the \nresults in our Nation's economy over the last several years.\n  Since 2003, when the tax cut went into effect, there have been almost \n5 million new jobs created.\n  Economic growth in the United States has outpaced other major \nindustrialized countries.\n  We have had 33 straight months of growth in our manufacturing sector. \nAnd productivity has grown strongly over the last 5 years.\n  In January, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest monthly rate \nsince July 2001 and lower than the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and \n1990s.\n  In Nevada, the unemployment rate is at an all time low, 3.6 percent.\n  Tax relief is working.\n  All of this economic growth and job market expansion is a result of \nthe Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 that \njumpstarted our economy and fueled unprecedented growth.\n  Another example of how tax cuts boost the economy is the Invest in \nthe USA Act which I offered.\n  I introduced this legislation, which was included in the JOBS Act of \n2004. However, this was only a temporary, 1 year tax reduction.\n  When meeting with corporations in the Silicon Valley, I learned that \nU.S. corporations pay no U.S. tax on foreign earnings invested \noverseas, the same as their foreign competitors. But they pay taxes on \n100 percent of the foreign earnings that they want to reinvest in the \nUnited States.\n  Obviously, this deters many U.S. companies from reinvesting their \nforeign earnings in the United States. That comes at a great loss to \nour economy.\n  The Invest in the USA Act temporarily modified this inequity for 1 \nyear by taxing companies at 15 percent for foreign earnings reinvested \nin the United States.\n  By January 2006 when it expired, the law had encouraged companies to \nbring home and reinvest an additional $350 billion of foreign earnings \nin the United States. It raised revenues, lifted investment, and \ncreated thousands of jobs.\n  We should take the momentum of the tax relief measures we have \nprovided during the last several years and build on them.\n  Our economy is growing and that is great news, but as has always been \nthe case in the United States, we look to the future and work to make \nit even better.\n  Let's make tax relief permanent and reassure American families and \nbusinesses that today's remarkable economy is just the beginning.\n  Cutting taxes, empowering working families by letting them keep more \nof their income, encouraging small businesses to expand and create \njobs--that is how we continue to create opportunity and success in the \nUnited States.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1860-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1860-S1861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the economy, as has been noted, has been \nperforming extremely well of late with 10 consecutive quarters of \neconomic growth, with job creation at 4.5 million jobs created in the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ years. There are a lot of good things happening in our \neconomy. One of the dark clouds that hovers over our economy right now, \nhowever, is the cost of energy. For several years, going back to the \nvery first year of the Bush administration, there was an effort made by \nthe administration to move a comprehensive energy bill through \nCongress, get it passed and put into law, that lessens our dependence \nupon foreign sources of energy.\n  Regrettably, in the last Congress, that bill, after it had been \nnegotiated through the conference committee, was filibustered by the \nSenate Democrats and prevented from becoming law.\n  In this session of Congress, last July, the Senate and the House came \ntogether in a conference committee and reported out a conference \nreport, an energy bill that was signed into law by the President that \nwill make remarkable strides forward in doing what all agree is an \nimportant goal for this country, which is to reduce our dependence upon \nforeign sources of energy.\n  Statistics today show we are now 59 percent dependent upon imports \nfor our U.S. energy demand. That is expected to be 60 percent not too \nfar into the future. The Energy Information Agency says U.S. oil \nconsumption will grow from 20.7 million barrels a day in 2005 to 26.1 \nmillion barrels a day in 2025. We are using more energy. Worldwide \ndemand for energy is growing. Countries such as India and China are \ndemanding more and more energy. We rely on energy that exists outside \nthe United States in areas of the world that are unpredictable and \nunreliable and unstable.\n  We have a great solution. We have seen significant success in my \nState of South Dakota with renewable energy. The products we raise and \ngrow right here in the United States, in States\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\nsuch as South Dakota, corn and soybeans, can be converted into energy \nthat will lessen that dependence upon foreign sources of energy and, at \nthe same time, create jobs. We are creating enormous numbers of jobs \nacross this country, particularly in the Midwest.\n  New technologies will allow ethanol, cellulose ethanol, to be made \nfrom other products, from other feedstocks. This will be a trend that \nwill continue to create jobs all across this country.\n  The ethanol industry and the economic gains we have seen have \nbenefited our rural economy. Over the next year, ethanol will displace \n2 million barrels of imported oil, create 234,840 jobs and boost \nAmerican household incomes by $43 billion. Because of the ethanol \nrequirement in the Energy bill we passed last summer, 34 new ethanol \nplants are under construction, 8 existing plants will be expanded \ntoday, and more than 150 plants are in the works. Each plant employs \nbetween 40 and 50 people directly and creates hundreds of jobs \nthroughout the local economy. These new plants will add more than 2 \nbillion gallons of ethanol to the Nation's fuel supply by 2007, a 50-\npercent growth in ethanol production.\n\n  This is a good story for the American economy because the American \neconomy relies upon affordable energy. My State of South Dakota is a \ncase in point. We are an agriculture intense economy, energy intense \neconomy, and rely on tourism. We have long distances to cover. We need \naffordable energy to continue to grow the economy and create jobs in \nstates such as South Dakota.\n  The ethanol success story could not have happened had it not been for \nthe Republican leadership in the Senate and the House coming together \nlast summer on a bill that would put in place a renewable fuel standard \nthat guarantees a market for ethanol moving forward in the year 2012. \nAs a consequence, we are seeing remarkable improvements in the economy \nin places that had been struggling economic areas in this country, in \nrural areas of America that had been losing jobs and suffering from \noutmigration. It is a success story and one that could not have \nhappened had it not been for the leadership that moved forward with an \nenergy bill last year, that put in place the renewable fuel standard \nfor the first time as a matter of policy in this country.\n  There are lots of other areas in the Energy bill currently being \ndeveloped. If you look at wind energy, solar energy, nuclear energy, \nthe Energy bill passed last summer provides great strides forward as we \nstrive to achieve energy independence in this country and deal with \nwhat is a fundamental issue for our national security; that is, our \nenergy security.\n  I rise this morning to again take note of the fact that we are an \neconomy that is in some respects growing, seeing job expansion and a \nlot of good things happening in our economy, but also acknowledging \nthat unless we do something to decrease the amount, the 60 percent of \nthe energy that we get from outside the United States, we run the risk \nof dramatically undermining and harming the economic growth we have \nexperienced.\n  The energy policies we put in place last summer and some of the \nthings currently under consideration in the Senate as we move forward \nwill make great strides forward in helping America deal with what is an \neconomic security issue, what is a national security issue, and that is \nthe crisis of energy we see not only in the United States but across \nthe world as more and more countries have an energy demand and the \nconsumption continues to increase with a very limited supply.\n  We have a supply right in the Midwest. We grow corn each year, we \ngrow soybeans each year. Other areas produce products that, as \ntechnology continues to improve, will enable us to convert those \nproducts into usable energy for America's future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2349 which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2349) to provide greater transparency in the \n     legislative process.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 2932, to provide additional transparency \n     in the legislative process.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to spend a couple of minutes this \nmorning commenting on the provisions offered by the Democratic leader, \nSenator Reid of Nevada, which is a comprehensive amendment that covers \na lot of the waterfront related to the matter before us, and that is \ngreater transparency and accountability by Members of this institution \nas well as those who lobby us, who come to us and petition us as paid \nrepresentatives of various public, private, and nonprofit entities, so \nwe have a better opportunity to restore a lot of the confidence that \nhas been eroded in how this institution performs its public function.\n  My colleague from Nevada, the chairman of the Democratic team here, \nhas put together a very good proposal. It has been endorsed and \nsupported by over 40 of our colleagues as part of the larger Reid bill. \nIt is called the Honest Leadership Act. It covers a lot of ground. I \nwant to identify the provisions in this bill. I know my colleague from \nNevada has done that already, but it deserves repetition.\n  As someone who has now spent more than a quarter of a century in this \nbody, I have great respect for my colleagues and their integrity. We \nall know that laws are not only written for the majority who abide by \nthe law, but occasionally we write laws because there are those who \nstep outside the boundaries, particularly when it comes to public \nresponsibility and trust. I am not suggesting by this amendment, nor is \nthe Democratic leader, that my colleagues in any way, at least the \noverwhelming majority, are violating not only the law of the land but \neven ethics, a sense of responsibility, a sense of good conduct. But we \nhave learned painfully over the last number of months that there are \npeople, unfortunately, who serve in public life, who serve in this \ngreat Capitol building, who do take advantage of their position for \nprivate gain, who have abused that public trust and have caused this \ninstitution and its Members to suffer once again the derision of our \nconstituents, of people who are disappointed about how we conduct our \nbusiness. It is a painful thing to go through.\n  I have often said I would be willing to take the 99 Members I serve \nwith in this body and compare their ethics and morality to almost any \nother group of people, and I am sure they would stand up very well. But \nthe facts are that we have people who do abuse the process, and we need \nto be cognizant of that and respond to it. That is what Senator Lott \nand I are doing. That is what my colleagues, Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Collins, are doing with their proposal which is part of the \nunderlying bill.\n  Senator Reid, on behalf of more than 40 of our colleagues, has put \ntogether a\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\ncomprehensive proposal to try and deal with many of these issues. I am \nsure there are matters with which some Members may disagree, may want \nto fine-tune in some way, may not necessarily support every dotted \n``I'' and crossed ``T.'' But the overall direction of the provisions \nincluded in this proposal is one that should enjoy broad support. We \nhope when the vote occurs later this morning, we can have strong \nsupport for it.\n  Let me mention several things it does. One, it bans all gifts, \nincluding meals, from lobbyists, the assumption being that this is no \nlonger acceptable. There is no connection between the work of someone \npetitioning government on behalf of a client or an organization and \nsimultaneously offering some gift to the Member or to the staff of that \nMember as a way of ingratiating themselves on behalf of the cause they \nrepresent. It may be innocent enough. We may find it obnoxious, even, \nin some cases, considering some of the things that are called gifts. \nBut nonetheless, the perception--perception is reality in the business \nof public life--that Members of Congress or their staffs are receiving \nsome unrelated item or gift or service or activity as a result of the \nrelationship has come to be unacceptable to most of us here. And again, \nperceptions are such that we suffer as a result of that kind of \nconduct.\n  We also impose some additional restrictions of disclosure on the \nrevolving door issue, requirements under the bill's revolving door \nprovisions. This has to do with Members and senior staff who serve here \nand then leave and go into private life and become lobbyists and use \nthat relationship to come back and have an immediate, direct influence \non the legislative process as a result of those close, personal \nrelationships. The revolving door has tried to have additional \ndisclosure requirements and even extend to some degree the amount of \ntime before such a person could come back and lobby their Member or \nother Members of this body or their senior staff.\n  We also deal in the Reid proposal with congressional travel. It bans \nlobbyists or anybody affiliated with them from being involved in \ncongressional travel. Again, I say ``congressional travel.'' Travel can \nbe a very important element of service in the U.S. Congress. Members, \nfrom time to time, need to get out around the country and need to \nengage in foreign travel. We are not talking about that. We are not \ntalking about related travel in which Members should be engaged. We are \ntalking about those travel expenses that are unrelated.\n  The most egregious case recently is the matter involving Members of \nthe other body on a golfing excursion in Scotland. When people look at \nthat, they assume maybe all of us are doing those sorts of things. That \nis not the case, but that is the perception. We need to limit what we \ntalk about here in terms of the travel in which Members of Congress can \nengage. In my view, if you are traveling on behalf of your public \nresponsibilities as a Member of the Senate or a Member of the Congress, \nthen that is something we ought to allow. In fact, we ought to \nencourage it. If the travel is unrelated to that nexus of your public \nresponsibility, we ought to try to limit it, if not ban it altogether.\n  The Reid proposal does that. It allows only bona fide 501(c)(3) \norganizations to pay for congressional travel for factfinding, \neducational purposes. It retains the requirement for Ethics Committee \napproval for travel beforehand so that if Members think it may be \nquestionable, they can get a ruling ahead of time. It requires \ncertification that the trip is not planned, supported, or paid for by \nlobbyists. It imposes per diem rates on acceptable third-party-paid \ntravel and lodging.\n  I point out, Mr. President, it tightens the ban on the so-called K \nStreet project. This is controversial. My colleague from Mississippi \nwas patient in the Rules Committee in listening to the K Street project \nprovision that was offered by my friend from Illinois. It was pointed \nout in committee that there are already prohibitions in existing \ncriminal law for people who would suggest that there was going to be a \nprice that someone would pay if they hired or did not hire someone else \nbased on their political affiliation. We thought it was so important to \nestablish this principle in the rules of this body that we have \ncodified the prohibition against those who would pressure outside \nemployers to make a hiring decision based primarily on party \naffiliation. This is wrong, it is an abuse, and it ought to be stopped. \nThe Reid proposal does just that.\n  It is especially egregious where it is accompanied by a threat--\nimplicit or explicit--that a Member might take or withhold certain \nactions based on the hiring decision. We have learned that has \nhappened. It is unfortunate. The businesses that did that were unwise \nand shortsighted, but nonetheless it has occurred. This proposal \nincludes the ban on the so-called K Street-type projects.\n  There are new civil and criminal penalties to combat public \ncorruption. It would require new certifications by lobbyists on gifts \nand travel and by trip sponsors and increase penalties for knowing, \nwillful, and corrupt violations under the False Statements Act. It \nwould prohibit dead-of-night legislating, require a final vote on \nconference reports in a public meeting, which, again, I think is \ncritical here.\n  We know if you are getting this legislation out, getting it to be \npublic on the Internet so people have an opportunity to read, as well, \nwhat we are about to do, what actions we are about to take--I know this \nbecomes difficult under certain circumstances, particularly at the end \nof a session if you are dealing with continuing resolutions which can \nbe very large and so forth. It imposes burdens on this institution. But \nI think we bear a responsibility to make sure the public has a clear \nidea, or at least the opportunity for a clear idea, to understand what \nwe are about to do, what actions we are about to take, and how they \nwould affect them.\n  So I urge my colleagues, again, to support this kind of provision. \nNot all are people on this side or the other side of the aisle. So that \nis what is being proposed by Senator Reid of Nevada. I hope in looking \nat this, in conjunction with the underlying accomplishments--let me say \nonce again to my colleagues, I think the work of the Rules Committee \nwas a good effort, and we are proud of what we did. Again, this is a \ndynamic process that doesn't happen all at once. What is reform one day \nis not the next, and you go back and forth. I always loved this line, \nand you have to be careful.\n\n  There was a wonderful Republican Party chairman in New York who once \nsaid that the last refuge of the scoundrel was patriotism--until they \ninvented the word ``reform.'' People sometimes hide behind that \nlanguage as a way to achieve certain ends.\n  What we have done here with the underlying bill--and I think with the \nReid proposal--is strengthen this legislation. It is going to make us \nall better Members, help restore confidence in this institution and its \nindividual Members. I emphasize what I said at the outset. I have great \nconfidence in the ethical, moral behavior of my colleagues. People I \nhave total disagreements with on policy matters, I trust them as to how \nthey conduct themselves in these public arenas. But every profession \nlearns that the laws are not written for the majority who obey the law. \nLaws and codes of ethics are written for those in the minority who \nviolate that trust and confidence.\n  So we write these provisions and include these proposals in statutory \nlaw and in our code of conduct not because we believe every Member is \nsomehow on the brink or cusp of engaging in irresponsible behavior but \nbecause we recognize and understand that from time to time there will \nbe people who serve with us who will violate that public trust and \nconfidence. That is why we have these codes of conduct, why we have \nstatutory language that prohibits the behavior that we have outlined in \nthese proposals.\n  So I urge my colleagues, when the time comes in roughly an hour or \nso, to support the Reid proposal. It is offered on behalf of more than \n40 of us in this body. We think it is a sound proposal that would \nstrengthen an already good bill. I urge my colleagues to cast and \n``aye'' vote for the Reid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after conferring with our colleagues on this \nside of the aisle, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to \nthe Reid amendment No. 2932 occur at 11:30 a.m.,\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\nwith no second degrees in order prior to the vote, and that all time be \nequally divided until the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to come over to speak \nif they wish.\n  Mr. LOTT. Those who would like to be heard, we want to make sure they \ncan be heard. I would be glad to yield my own floor time so they can \ncomment. I do have some comments I would like to make, and I will ask \nunanimous consent--I will do it then--that we set aside the Reid \namendment so that we can have one offered by Senator Santorum, and we \ncan begin debate on that. The emphasis will be on the Reid amendment, \nif you want to check that and make sure you are OK with that. I see one \npotential speaker.\n  In order to try to keep things moving, we are going to try to get \nanother amendment offered, and we will alternate back and forth.\n  Mr. DODD. I have no objection at all to that proposal offered by my \nfriend from Mississippi. I urge Members on both sides of the aisle who \nhave amendments or ideas on the bill, let us know so we can move the \nprocess along, and let us know what your amendments are so we can begin \nto consider and discuss them even before they are offered as a way of \ntrying to expedite the process. The Senate wants to consider other \nmatters. This is very important, but I would like to move as rapidly as \nwe can on the consideration of these ideas and proposals.\n  I urge my colleagues who have amendments and want to be heard to let \nus know as soon as possible.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, full disclosure, too. We have other Senators \nwho would like to get into the mix, I say to Senator Dodd. Senator \nInhofe is here with some amendments, some of which we can probably get \nan agreement on, some of which will take more time. Also, Senator \nVitter, who is in the chair now, would like to get into the mix.\n  As we go back and forth, I thought we would go to Santorum, and then \nif you have a Senator--or maybe we can clear a couple of the Inhofe \namendments. That is what we would like to do.\n  Mr. President, I want to respond a little bit to the Reid proposal. I \nthink you have to give credit to Senator Reid and the Democrats for \ndeveloping some legislation for this body to consider. People may be \nshocked to hear me say that, thinking that is not the way we do things. \nThis is basically the Democratic leader's proposal. My attitude is, \nlook, good work was done on it. They have a package here. Some of it \nwas good enough that we pulled it out and put it right into the Rules \nCommittee bill. I want to give credit to the fact that they want to \nwork on this and have made some recommendations. In that vein, Senator \nSantorum, at the request of our leader, as chairman of our conference, \nwent to work and started developing a package of ideas, amendments, and \nconcerns and solutions, too.\n  So both parties were working on this. Yes, it was on separate tracks, \nbut as we went forward Senators began to realize that this is not \nreally partisan. It is even bigger than the institution. It is about us \nand the people we represent and their rights. We need to think this \nthrough because whatever we do, we are going to have to live with it, \nand the American people are going to have to live with it.\n  As time went forward, Senator Santorum was working with Senator \nMcCain and Senator Lieberman. I started working with Senator Dodd--we \ntalked--and Senator Feinstein, and then bipartisan meetings started to \nhappen. I tell you, I wish we could do more things here like this. We \ncame to a juncture and we reported out a bill from the Rules Committee \nthat was unanimously approved. The Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee reported out a bill that had only one dissenting \nvote. This is the way it ought to work.\n  I give credit to Senator Reid and the Democrats for getting involved \nand helping this process. But now we have to produce legislation. It is \nimportant that we hear each other out and that we have some debate and \nsome amendments and votes and get this job done.\n  Mr. President, the amendment presented by the Democratic leader is \nnot fundamentally different from any of the provisions of the bill \nreported by the Rules Committee and by the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. It has similar provisions to what was \nin the Santorum package. Our main differences are on issues such as how \nto treat gifts from lobbyists, and the Reid amendment bars all gifts \nfrom registered lobbyists. The Rules Committee bans gifts from \nregistered lobbyists, except for meals, which are not included in the \ndefinition of a gift. I will give you one example for why we are making \nthis exception. Our bill bars gifts from registered lobbyists and \nforeign agents. A very thoughtful Senator, chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Lugar, inquired: Wait a minute. How will \nthat work if I am invited as chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee to a dinner at an embassy of a foreign country that involves \nforeign agents? Will I be able to go? How will I deal with that?\n  That is the kind of thoughtful question we better think about because \nwe don't want to put ourselves into a position where we cannot do our \njobs.\n  Another example of where I am concerned is we have language in the \nHomeland Security bill that is going to restrict or require more \nreporting of grassroots lobbying activities. This will have a chilling \neffect on grassroots lobbying. Do we want to do that? What about the \nright of the people to petition their government for a redress of \ngrievances? Why are we letting on like there is something wrong with \npeople with a point of view who would get people involved and get our \nconstituents to contact us about an issue? We are big boys and girls.\n  We should be able to hear from our constituents, even if they are \ninspired by the Chamber of Commerce or the Sierra Club, or even if it \nis something such as the ports issue. I heard from a lot of my \nconstituents. We need to make sure we think through what we do here.\n  The Reid amendment claims to prohibit privately funded travel, yet, \nin fact, it does no such thing. It opens a loophole that would allow \n501(c)(3) organizations to finance congressional travel. The Rules \nCommittee requires far stricter preclearance of such trips.\n  My attitude is, instead of setting up a new process or new loophole, \nlet's have these trips reviewed mandatorily and approved or you can't \ndo it. Then you have to also divulge the itinerary and who is involved \nin these trips. I think that is a far better approach.\n  The Democratic alternative presented by Senator Reid bars lobbyists \nfrom participating in such trips whereas the Rules Committee measure \nrequires disclosure of lobbyist involvement.\n  The Reid amendment also prohibits a Member from negotiating for \nprospective private employment if a conflict of interest or the \nappearance of a conflict exists. We have that in our Rules Committee \nlanguage. We actually went a step further than that. The law prohibits \nthis already, but I also think that a rule in this area is fine.\n  The Reid amendment makes it a felony for a Member of Congress to seek \nto influence a private employment decision by threatening to take or \nwithhold an official act. Absolutely we should do that. I think the law \nalready does that. I honestly believe the bills reported by the Rules \nCommittee and Governmental Affairs Committee are superior to the Reid \namendment.\n  When I first looked at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nbill, I wasn't quite sure what it did. But as I read it more and more, \nit is very good in terms of reporting, disclosure, and transparency. It \nrequires more reporting with regard to lobbyists.\n  We better continue to ask ourselves about what we are doing here. For \ninstance, I am particularly troubled by the provisions that would only \nallow travel sponsored by 501(c)(3) organizations. Do my colleagues not \nrealize that 501(c)(3) organizations can be manipulated and used by \nlobbyists as fronts for their lobbying activities? In fact, that is \nexactly what Jack Abramoff did. He laundered money through a 501(c)(3) \nand used a tax-exempt entity to finance congressional travel.\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\n  This is one of my major concerns with the Reid proposal. I think it \nactually endorses a process that has been used to abuse the lobbying \nrules.\n  While the effort here is a good one by Senator Reid and in good \nfaith, we have a superior bill. Where Senator Reid had some good \nproposals, we put them into the Rules Committee bill. But there are \nmany provisions, a much more detailed package from the Rules Committee \nand Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  I hope when the time comes, this amendment will be rejected. We are \ntrying to make this a responsible bill--not inferring that the Reid \namendment is not responsible. We are also trying to make it bipartisan. \nSo I am concerned that we have come right out of the gate with a \npartisan package. I assume we are not going to have the Santorum \nalternative offered as a package. It has been melded into what we have.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the partisan package. Let's take the \ngood stuff out of it and make it a part of our final product.\n  Mr. President, I will be glad to yield the floor so a Senator may \nspeak on the Reid proposal. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if it is all right with Senator Dodd, I \nwish to be heard on the Reid amendment for not longer than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield whatever the time the Senator cares to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate has now taken \nup this important issue. I compliment Senators Lott and Dodd for \nworking together, as well as Senators Collins and Lieberman. We needed \nto have this debate. We need to have these changes.\n  Over the past several months, we have all heard the sorry tale of \nscandal and corruption and bribery involving Jack Abramoff, senior Bush \nadministration officials, and, sadly for us, Members of Congress. Those \ntales have unfolded here in Washington. It is clear that these scandals \nshow corruption has taken hold here and that we in Congress must act. \nThat is why I am so glad we have set aside time for this bill.\n  The measure on the floor today makes important strides in cleaning up \ncorruption, but, in my view, it doesn't go quite far enough. Under the \nleadership of Senator Harry Reid, Senate Democrats have advanced \nlegislation that goes even further, but it doesn't go so far as to make \nit unworkable or unreasonable.\n  We were and Senator Reid was the first to respond to the revelations \nof scandal and corruption in Washington. Nearly the entire Democratic \ncaucus united to create a package of reforms which we call the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act of 2006. It was the first idea that \nwe rolled out for the American people to see.\n  I believe the Reid bill helped set the tone for the bill we are \ndebating today. I do, again, Mr. President, thank Senator Lott for his \nleadership in the committee. I thank him for working so closely with \nSenator Dodd. And I say the same to all my colleagues involved in this \nissue because we know the partisanship here is deep and the Senators \nset it aside, and for that we are all grateful.\n\n  What we have before us is an excellent start. If we did that and \nnothing else, it is a start. But we have a chance now to do better. I \nthink the American people won't settle for just a good start; they want \nto see deep reform. They want the revolving door slowed so that they \ndon't see Members of Congress--Senators and House Members--staff \nmembers, and administration officials walking out the Capitol steps and \nwalking right into a lucrative job where they will have undue influence \nin terms of what goes on in the Congress.\n  The American people want to feel they still have a voice, even though \nthey don't have thousands or maybe millions of dollars to shell out on \nK Street where the lobbyists thrive. They want gifts banned. They don't \nwant to see a commission report on why the latest scandal happened; \nthey want measures in place that prevent scandals from taking place at \nall.\n  My colleagues and I on this side of the aisle are prepared to offer \namendments to strengthen this bill, and Senator Reid's package is the \nfirst such attempt. I believe it is important, again, to strengthen \nthis bill and raise it to a standard in which our constituents can take \ncomfort.\n  We truly need to go beyond what we have before us. We also need to go \nbeyond the Congress and follow the money, as sordid as it may be, and \nfollow the meetings, and follow the contacts between Mr. Abramoff and \nthe White House. So far, the White House is quick to admonish those \noutside the administration who engage in scandalous acts. Yet they have \nmaintained a policy of duck and cover and denying when allegations are \npointed in their direction.\n  I will have an amendment calling on the White House to cooperate, to \nturn over the information that we and the public deserve to have on how \nmany times Jack Abramoff was in the White House, or his associates, and \nwhat it is they wanted and what it is they got and what it is they \ngave. That amendment will be coming soon. It is very clear. I hope it \nwill be accepted. I know that my side of the aisle supports it.\n  My amendment simply says that the White House should fully disclose \nall of its dealings with Mr. Abramoff. We certainly should disclose our \ndealings, and as far as I know, every Member has gone back and looked \nto see if they received contributions from Mr. Abramoff, if they \nreceived contributions from anyone associated with him. Many of us have \nacted to either return those contributions or to explain why we would \nrather give them to charity. We have opened up our books. The White \nHouse has to open up its books as well.\n  Again, I am very pleased at the bipartisan effort that has taken \nplace to bring ethics reform to the floor today, and I urge all my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Nevada and continue this bipartisanship.\n  Anyone who knows Harry Reid knows he is a reasonable person who loves \nthis institution, who has given his life to public service, starting \nfrom the time he was a police officer. The Reid amendment serves only \nto strengthen the reforms we seek and that the American people demand. \nThis is what it does in part.\n  It closes the revolving door so that the outcome of legislation is \nnot tied to a Member's potential job prospects. It ends the K Street \nproject by shutting down the pay-to-play corruption scheme. K Street \noffices should be staffed by individuals who are the most qualified for \nthe job, not well-placed former congressional staffers who obtain their \njob through a back-room deal to stack the deck in any party's political \nfavor. And we know that calls come routinely to these offices saying: \nHire this staff or that staff, and the implication is you will be \ntreated better in legislation. It is a disgrace.\n  The Reid amendment increases penalties for violations of the rules \nunder the Lobbying Disclosure Act as a further deterrent for lobbyists \nto engage in unethical practices, and it prohibits dead-of-night \nlegislating to allow for an open meeting of the conferees with access \nby the public. The public is so shut out around here. Not only are \nDemocrats shut out of some conferences, but the public certainly knows \nnot what is going on. We want the light of day to shine. If you want to \nstop those bridges to nowhere and other projects that don't make any \nsense, open up the process to the light of day, and all of us--all of \nus--will be scrutinized.\n  I think we should impose tougher restrictions on congressional travel \nand gifts. We know there is a difference between traveling in an \nofficial congressional delegation and traveling because some company \nwants to do you a favor. We know what that is about. There is a \ndifference between a truly educational trip that is sponsored by a \nfoundation with no ties to special economic interests and a trip that \nis organized by some economic interests that want to treat you in a way \nthat will make you more open to what they want. There is a difference \nhere, and I think what the Reid amendment does is walk that line.\n  So with this bill, amended by the Reid amendment, the American public \nwill have reason to feel confident that laws are being written and \ndebated and voted on by Members who respect democracy and the wishes of \ntheir constituents and are not unduly influenced\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\nby forces that simply want it because it is good for their bottom line.\n  We must be open, we must be honest, and we must be ethical. I know \neach of us tries to do that, but the rules need to reflect the highest \ndenominator, not the middle, not the lowest. With this bill, we are at \nthe middle denominator. The Reid amendment and some other amendments \noffered by colleagues on both sides of the aisle can bring us up to \nthat highest level, and I hope we will start by voting ``aye'' on the \nReid amendment in a bipartisan way. It will set the tone of this \ndebate.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Dodd for yielding me this time. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to be recognized for the purpose of \nhaving a colloquy with the chairman and ranking minority member, \nSenator Lott and Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for that purpose.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee knows, Senator \nGrassley and I have worked for a decade to bring some openness and \naccountability to the Senate by requiring that when a Senator puts a \nhold on a major piece of legislation, they would have to disclose it \npublicly. Senator Grassley and I are ready to go with that bipartisan \namendment which we have worked on for a decade. I would simply ask the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee and the ranking minority member \nwhat the process is so that Senator Grassley and I can bring forward \nthis bipartisan amendment. I pose my question to the distinguished \nchairman of the committee.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in answer to the distinguished Senator from \nOregon, we have before us the Reid amendment which is in the nature of \na substitute.\n  I am advised it is not; it is a regular amendment. We are going to \nhave a vote on it at 11:30. We are open for debate on that amendment.\n  Then we are working out arrangements where we would come back to this \nside to Senator Santorum and Senator Dodd, who are going to offer the \nnext amendment jointly, sometime between now and 11:30, or immediately \nafter the vote on the Reid amendment. Then it would be back to the \nDemocratic side and going back and forth for the next amendment that \nmight be in order. We are encouraging Members to come to the floor and \noffer their amendments. We have Senator Inhofe coming up to offer \namendments on our side. But after Senator Santorum, we would be back \nfor I guess a jump ball if anybody wanted to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would it be acceptable to the distinguished chair of the \ncommittee and ranking minority member that I could ask unanimous \nconsent that after you all have completed the bipartisan amendment of \nthe Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Pennsylvania, that \nwhen you all have completed your business, the Wyden-Grassley amendment \ncome next?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have no objection. We are encouraging \nSenators to come to the floor with their amendments, and if Senator \nWyden would like to be next in line, that is fine. As a part of that, \nlet me ask consent that Senator Inhofe be allowed to offer the next \namendment after the Wyden-Grassley amendment so we would have a package \nof the two lined up.\n  I propose then that we have the Wyden amendment in order after the \nSantorum-Dodd proposal, to be followed by the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the distinguished chairman and the ranking \nminority member.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, does my colleague from Delaware request \ntime?\n  Mr. CARPER. I do. Can I ask for 5 minutes?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we have been trying to go back and \nforth. The last speaker was Senator Boxer. I think we have been trying \nto alternate back and forth.\n  Mr. LOTT. Does the Senator propose to speak on the pending amendment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am going to talk about the bill, and \nthen I will yield back to Senator Dodd to actually offer the amendment \nwe are working on, was my intent. That was the plan.\n  Mr. President, I, too, rise to thank Senator Lott and Senator Dodd, \nas well as Senator Kyl and Senator Lieberman. They talked about how \nthis process has been somewhat unique in the annals of recent Senate \nhistory and about how this process has worked now for the past month, a \nlittle over a month in a way that, as Senator Lott said, should be done \nmore often around here, which is sitting down and having good, \nbipartisan discussions to try to come up with a consensus piece of \nlegislation.\n  While obviously there will be lots of amendments, at least the \nfoundation of this bill is one that included a lot of bipartisan input \nand, in fact, has features from both sides of the aisle and is as much \na bipartisan bill, at least on a major bill, as has been brought to the \nfloor in a long time. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittees, in particular Senator McCain for his leadership on this \nissue, as well as others who participated in the bipartisan process, \nincluding Senator Feingold, Senator Pryor, Senator Obama, Senator \nSalazar, and others who have made contributions on the Democratic side; \nSenator Vitter, Senator Isakson on the Republican side, who have also \nbeen very involved in the process.\n\n  As a result of that process, we came up with a working document. I \nwon't call it a consensus because there were Members who had varying \npoints of view on a variety of these issues, but let's say that at the \nconclusion of our discussions we had a working draft that had broad \nsupport as a whole. At the same time, as you will see in the \ndiscussions and in the amendments we are going to have today, some wish \nto ratchet it up a little bit, make it a little tougher; others thought \nit might be a little too tough. But in the areas of concern, there was \nbroad agreement on what those areas of concern are, and suggestions of \napproaches on how to deal with it.\n  I wish to go through the areas that we agreed needed to be addressed \nand what the general idea was in how to proceed with a lot of the \nthings that are up here, which were foundational in the sense that we \nstarted with the McCain-Lieberman bill that Senator McCain and Senator \nLieberman introduced a couple of months ago, and there was some \ntinkering to that legislation. Overall, the disclosure requirements in \nthat legislation were universally embraced and adopted for disclosure \nof lobbyist contributions to Member PACs, and lobbyist disclosure of \nexecutive and congressional employment. All of those things were \nincluded, as well as others we have heard talked about on the floor.\n  Several things were not included: disclosure of contracts with State \nsponsors of terrorism. That is something I happen to believe should be \nincluded in the legislation, but so far we have had objections to that \nbeing included. I am not too sure I understand why but, nevertheless, \nit has not been included.\n  We suggested 30 days, not 60 days, to comply with the rules. That has \nnot been included.\n  Higher penalties. The penalties were increased from $50,000 to \n$100,000. Many of us believe that is not sufficient as a deterrent for \nsome who make a lot more than $50,000 or $100,000 around here on \ntransactions. So we think a higher penalty sends a stronger signal, and \nI will be offering an amendment on that to increase the penalties up to \n$200,000. Again, it is up to $200,000 for breaking these rules, \nlobbyists breaking these rules.\n  One of the important things we brought to the table that was not in \nthe underlying bill was disclosure of rule enforcement by the Secretary \nof the Senate and the U.S. Attorney. In other words, one of the \nconcerns Members have and that the public has is, What sort of \noversight is being done? Are there any actions being taken? What this \nwould require is that when there, in fact, is an action taken on the \npart of the committee, and it has been referred to a U.S. Attorney for \nprosecution--not that particular case, but at least the number of cases \nthat have been referred is made public so we know the level of \nactivity. Not the specific charge, because we don't know whether the \nU.S. Attorney will actually bring a charge, but we at least know the \nnumber.\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\n  There are several other things we did in our bipartisan discussions: \nban registered lobbyists who are former Members from the Senate floor; \nno staff contact with lobbyists who are a member of the family, which \nis an amendment I successfully offered in committee, in the Rules \nCommittee; and the earmark transparency, something Senator Lott and \nSenator Feinstein have worked with, and obviously Senator McCain. There \nwill be differences. We passed something out of the Rules Committee. \nThere will be amendments to try to expand this provision, maybe \ncontract this provision, modify it; but the idea was developed and \nsupported by a bipartisan group.\n  Another thing Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman put in their \nbill, which was very important that we brought to the table, was the \nidea of an SRO, a self-regulatory organization that many professional \norganizations use to police their own ranks. While we can pass laws and \nwe can pass rules that try to govern the lobbyist profession, there are \na lot of things within the profession that need to be upgraded, whether \nit is fees or whether it is professional ethics, and there is not a \ngood body out there that does that. There certainly isn't any kind of \nself-regulatory body that does that. We think it is vitally important \nto send a message from the Congress to the folks who make a living \npetitioning their government to clean up their own house, and \nparticularly in greater detail than what the Congress could or should \ndo with respect to the practices, the internal practices of lobbying \nfirms and lobbyists.\n  I think this is a very important suggestion, something I felt very \nstrongly about, and I appreciate Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins \nfor including it in their legislation.\n  This is the final chart, which again shows the consensus. You can see \nthe checkmarks here again, which are areas that are already included in \nthe bill that were part of the bipartisan discussion, to extend the \nlobbying ban for Members and senior staff from 1 to 2 years for Members \nand included more senior staff of Members in a separate amendment. Both \nwere discussed and supported broadly in our discussions.\n  This is something I also felt very strongly about: Members not being \nable to negotiate for private sector employment while they are a member \nof the Senate. Then we put in the date of the election of your \nsuccessor as the date you can then freely discuss employment \nopportunities for after your life here in the Senate. We have an \nexception. There needs to be an exception. If something happens, a \npersonal emergency in the family, or something comes up where you feel \nyou have to leave the Senate for some reason, the opportunity to have \nthose discussions simply must be disclosed within 3 days of having \nthose discussions. Again, we think there needs to be an escape hatch \nfor those kinds of contingencies.\n  Travel was a very big point of discussion and will be a point of \ndiscussion here on the floor of the Senate. Privately funded travel \nmust be preapproved by Ethics, be of educational value, have little or \nno R and R--rest and recreational value, disclosure of the lobbyist's \ninvolvement in the trip, as well as all activities reported after the \ntrip. In other words, you have to file a comprehensive report of what \nyou did, not just what you planned to do.\n  The area that was not done and that I will be offering an amendment \non with Senator McCain and Senator Feingold is having to do with the \nMembers and Federal candidates paying a fair market value for the cost \nof corporate travel. I know this is very controversial, particularly \nfor Members from larger States using a private aircraft in getting \naround. But as we will discuss later with Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold on the floor, we believe this is an area that needs to be \naddressed. This is clearly a subsidy. I understand, and I think we all \nunderstand, this will probably require higher amounts of money in our \naccounts to be able to pay for these costs as we travel around our \nStates that now are, in a sense, subsidized by the private sector. But \nI believe this is a very important transparency issue.\n\n  The final issue is the mandatory disclosure of travel on private \ncharter flights by Members as well as Federal candidates, so this is \nsomething that we did.\n  The last thing that is on the agenda, and then I will turn it over to \nthe Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, is the gift ban. Now we do \nhave a gift ban in this bill having to do with lobbyists. Lobbyists are \nno longer allowed to give any gift of any value to Members. The one \narea that is excluded from that is meals. To be clear, what the Rules \nCommittee did was make a change to current law which says, you are \nallowed to purchase a meal for a Member of Congress or his staff of up \nto almost $50. The Rules Committee said you have to now report it if it \nis above $10. That, I think, is worse than the current law, in my \nopinion, because it sets up a situation where Members--I can tell you \nif this is the law that would go into place, I would tell my staff, and \ncertainly I would never have a meal with a Member, because it creates \nthe impression first that you have to report it, and of course any \nactivity that occurred with respect to that lobbyist and your office or \nlegislation you voted on or campaign activities would be tied to this \nparticular event which, of course, may or may not have had anything to \ndo with that particular event, but it creates, I think, an untenable \nsituation. I think the effect of Senator Lott's suggestion would be, in \nfact, a ban on meals, so if that would be the effect of it, let's do \nit.\n  So I have offered an amendment. Senator Dodd came to the floor with \nthe same idea. We have spoken. We have decided to jointly offer an \namendment that would ban all meals from registered lobbyists to Members \nof Congress and their staff. That is the amendment Senator Dodd will be \nteeing up here in a moment. Again, we filed virtually identical \namendments.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Connecticut because of the \nfine work he has done to be the lead sponsor on this amendment. We need \nto work together and get this done because the current situation in \nthis bill, in my opinion, is simply untenable and is a potential trap \nfor the unsuspecting, which I would not like to see be visited on any \nMember of the Senate.\n  With that, again, I want to congratulate all of those who were \ninvolved. I think you see that the bipartisan process we worked on for \nseveral weeks yielded the basis--the basis of the bill we have before \nus has yielded a situation where I think most of the amendments that \nare going to be offered are going to be offered in a bipartisan fashion \nbecause discussions were actively underway that did have sincere \ncollaboration. As a result of that, I think you are going to see a lot \nof the effort being put forward today in a bipartisan fashion. I am \npleased to be able to kick that off with the Senator from Connecticut \non the issue of not allowing lobbyists to buy meals for either Members \nor their staffs here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Who yields time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2942\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague from Delaware has asked to be \nrecognized. Before he does that, I am going to send a modification--an \namendment on behalf of myself, Senator Santorum, and Senator Obama to \nthe desk and ask for a modification to be accepted of that amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay aside the Reid amendment \nfor purposes of considering this amendment and then we will go right \nback to the Reid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike the meals and refreshments exception for lobbyists)\n\n       On page 8, strike lines 8 through 16.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2942, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2942), as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike the meals and refreshments exception for lobbyists)\n\n       On page 8, strike lines 6 through 16 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(B) This clause shall not apply to a gift from a \n     registered lobbyist or an agent of a foreign principal.''\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2932\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at conclusion of the vote on the Reid \namendment, this would be the next item to be\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\nconsidered. That is the purpose for offering it now. For the purposes \nof recognition, I am going back and forth, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, to clarify, we will need to go back to the \nReid amendment or was that automatic under the agreement, so we are \nback on the Reid amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Reid amendment is once again pending.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is a \nunanimous consent we are operating under, but my only request is if the \nSenator from Delaware goes next, I be recognized after the Senator from \nDelaware for my amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the parliamentary \ninquiry before the Chair comments on it, we did get an agreement that \nyours would be next in order. That was in the previous unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  Mr. INHOFE. So I will be following the Senator from Delaware. Thank \nyou.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, my thanks to Senator Dodd and Senator \nLott. My thanks to Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins as well. By \nworking together, they have speeded along reforms that I think most of \nus agree are badly needed. I am hopeful that the bipartisan approach \nthat they have taken on this issue will rub off on the rest of us, not \nonly with respect to this particular subject but with respect to others \nthat are before us.\n  I am sure all of us have gone home and heard about how disappointed \npeople are with what they see going on in parts of Washington these \ndays. I think most Delawareans realize we are not all taking bribes and \nnot all lobbyists are crooks. I certainly agree with them. I have met \nmany more good people here during my time in the Senate than bad, and I \nam sure those sentiments are shared by my colleagues. But similar to \nthose I have spoken to in recent months, news of the Abramoff scandal \nand of the bribing of Congressmen and their staffs have hit the papers \nand television news outside the beltway. I am gravely disappointed that \nour system can allow such excesses and disrespect for the people who \nsent us here.\n  The fact is, the American people have lost some of the trust they \nhave placed in their leaders here in Washington. That is dangerous \nbecause, as we all know, a lot of the folks around our country did not \nhave a whole lot of trust in us to begin with. That is why I am proud \nto support today the amendment offered by Senator Reid. It would add \nseveral provisions from the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act \nto the bill that is before us today.\n  Senator Reid's amendment would make a good bill even better. It would \ndo so by ending certain practices that at the very least create among \nour constituents a perception of impropriety.\n  Along those lines, the Reid amendment would prohibit Members and \nstaff from receiving gifts from registered lobbyists. Many offices, \nmine included, are already implementing this kind of reform. We will no \nlonger accept meals, entertainment or any other gifts from lobbyists, \nand will abide by that standard until the Congress decides what the new \nstandard should be.\n  The Reid amendment would also ban congressional travel funded by \ncompanies and other special interests that have business before the \nSenate. Senator Reid's proposals to end the practice of receiving gifts \nand privately funded travel from lobbyists are, in my opinion, reason \nenough to vote for this amendment. Unfortunately, we find ourselves at \na time and place where even truly significant reforms will be met with \nskepticism by the American people. While none of us could be bought \nwith a $50 meal, the all too common assumption is that any reform, any \nnew restriction, any new guideline or rule will be written in such a \nway that Members, staff, and lobbyists will still have loopholes \nthrough which to operate.\n  Bans close all loopholes. In this case, the bans proposed in the Reid \namendment would go a long way toward disabusing people of the notion \nthat nothing will change as a result of the reforms that we are \ndebating today.\n  Let me add one quick comment before I close. However good our rules \nare in the Senate or House, however well intentioned our rules are, it \nis critical that the rules be enforced. When we look at what has gone \non in the House of Representatives over the last several years, a major \nproblem there was not so much the rules but the failure to enforce the \nrules that exist, the failure to enforce them with respect to lobbyists \nand apparently with respect to Members of the House and with members of \ntheir staffs.\n  I hope our work on lobbying reform sends the signal to the American \npeople that we are serious about restoring their trust in us and in \nthis institution. As we all know, that trust is absolutely essential to \nthe good health of our democracy and of our country.\n  I will yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2933. I ask the \nSenate to set aside the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding it was agreed to by \nboth sides, that I was to be recognized for the purpose of setting \naside the amendment and calling up amendment No. 2933.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that was not what was agreed to, as I \nunderstand the question, from the Senator from Oklahoma. We have the \nReid amendment, and then the next in order was going to be the \nSantorum-Dodd amendment. Then we were going to go to Senator Wyden, and \nthen the consent was that the Senator from Oklahoma would be next in \norder, to offer his amendment and have debate at that point.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If that is what you recall--that is certainly not the \nintention of this Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. Was that the way it was agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not what the Chair recalls, but that \nis what I have been told was agreed to. I will defer to someone who was \nhere before me.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask if our leader would defer for a question. I \nappreciate very much the Senator's attention. I have been down here \nsince before the bill came up with the intention of being the first \none. I yielded to Senator Santorum. We wanted to go back and forth. It \nwas my understanding Senator Carper was recognized and I would be right \nafter him and that time has arrived.\n  What is the problem?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. He came here early \non, ready to go. But there had already been discussion with Senator \nSantorum about being able to offer his amendment. We try to go back and \nforth from one side of the aisle to the other.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Last I saw, Senator Carper was a Democrat.\n  Mr. LOTT. He was just speaking. He didn't have an amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the Chair what his understanding was of the \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, No. 1, we have an order of how amendments \nwill go. On a separate track, we were debating the Reid amendment, and \nwe were alternating back and forth, having speakers speak on the Reid \namendment. That is where there seems be maybe a dichotomy. Senator \nCarper was going to speak next. Then Senator Inhofe would be able to \nspeak next. That was my understanding.\n  Mr. DODD. The two Senators from Illinois, I say to my colleague, want \nto be heard on the Reid amendment as well. We are losing some time. We \nmight have some private conversations on other matters, but let's get \nthrough on the Reid amendment before the time expires.\n  Mr. LOTT. Was there a request pending?\n  Mr. DODD. It is an informal request.\n  Mr. LOTT. What is the Chair's impression?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Chair can think for a minute, he will \ngive it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. While the Chair is thinking----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 10:37 an agreement was reached to have a\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\nvote on the Reid amendment at 11:30. At 11 o'clock, the following \nagreement was reached: Following the disposition the Reid amendment, \nwhich will be voted on at 11:30, the Senate will go to the Santorum-\nDodd amendment; following that, the Wyden amendment, and following \nthat, the Inhofe amendment. That was the agreement reached at 11 \no'clock.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the leader yield for a request? If I do not take \nmore than 2 minutes, may I go ahead and bring mine up, set the current \namendment aside and bring it up so it will be in the mix?\n  Mr. DODD. I will have to object to that. We have to talk about this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. DODD. Let's sit down and talk about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield a couple of minutes to my friend, Senator Obama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise briefly to support the amendment \noffered by Senator Reid. I also support the amendment that was \nintroduced by Senator Dodd and Senator Santorum, of which I am a \ncosponsor. But let me focus on the particular provision in Senator \nReid's bill, the honest leadership bill, that I think all of us should \npay attention to, and that is the provision which closes a loophole \nthat would still allow Members and staff to receive free meals from \nlobbyists up to $50 in value.\n  On my way over to the floor, I passed a couple of security guards and \nCapitol police. I asked them how often lobbyists had bought them a \nmeal. Surprisingly, they said none.\n  I talked to the young women who help us on the elevators on the way \nup. I asked them: Has a lobbyist ever bought you a meal? The answer was \n``no.''\n  In cities and towns all across America, it turns out people pay for \ntheir own lunches and their own dinners, people who make far less than \nwe do, people who cannot afford their medical bills or their mortgages \nor their kids' tuitions. If you ask them if they think that people they \nsend to Congress should be able to rack up a $50 meal on a lobbyist's \ntime, what do you think they are going to say? You ask them if they \nthink we should be able to feast on a free steak dinner at a fancy \nrestaurant while they are working two jobs to put food on the table. I \ndon't think we need a poll to find out the answer to that one.\n  I want to be clear. In no way do I think that any of my colleagues or \nstaffers would exchange votes for a meal. But that is not the point. It \nis not just the meal that is the problem, it is the perception, the \naccess that the meals get you. In current Washington culture, lobbyists \nare expected to pick up the tab when they meet with Members or staff. \nIt is understood by all sides that the best way to get face time with a \nMember is to buy them a meal. You don't see many Members eating $50 \nmeals with constituents who come into town to talk about issues on \ntheir minds, or with policy experts who are discussing the latest \neconomic theories. Most of these meals that are taken are with \nlobbyists who are advocating on behalf of special interests. It \ndiminishes perceptions, and it is something that I think has to stop.\n  Let me close by saying this. If people are interested in meeting with \nlobbyists or having dinner with lobbyists, they can still do so. It is \nvery simple. You pull out your wallet and pay for it.\n  I strongly urge we support the Reid amendment. In addition, I \nstrongly support the Dodd-Santorum amendment, of which I am a \ncosponsor.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, Senator Durbin from Illinois asked to be \nheard for 2 minutes as well. Senator Durbin has time during the day to \ncomment on this.\n  This is a very comprehensive amendment Senator Reid has offered. It \nstrengthens what is, in my view, already a very strong bill of the \nRules Committee. But it does close some gaps that I think are \ncritically important. I hope we can develop some bipartisan support. It \nwill take some issues we would have to debate later in the day off the \ntable because they would be included in this amendment.\n  So, again, I urge my colleagues to take a look at this. You may not \nagree with every single dotted ``i,'' as I said earlier, and crossed \n``t.'' But if you agree with the thrust of this, I think it deserves \nyour support and it is one that would strengthen this bill on lobbying \nreform and the transparency and accountability issues, which are the \nhallmarks of this joint legislative effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the Reid \namendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 35 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Byrd\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2932) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I believe we are ready to go to the Dodd-\nSantorum amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. That is true. I believe the Senator from Oklahoma has a \nunanimous consent request. I am prepared to yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. My request would be in conjunction with the Wyden \namendment but also to bring up my amendment and set it aside so I would \nbe in the mix, if that would be all right. So a couple minutes would do \nit.\n  Mr. DODD. And you have asked unanimous consent to be a cosponsor of \nthe Wyden amendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me go ahead and propound that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, there is an amendment I had submitted on \nholds, and we have been trying to do this for quite some time. My good \nfriends, Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley, have been trying to do the \nsame thing, and I think Senator Lott from Mississippi. So what I will \ndo is not offer my amendment No. 2933 in favor of the Wyden-Grassley \nnow Inhofe amendment that will be considered. That is my unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment No. 2934 be called up for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, that, as I understand it, is \nin the order after the Dodd-Santorum amendment and the Wyden-Grassley-\nInhofe amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK. We would be able to get it up and get it in without \ntaking any time. If you want to go back to that order, that is fine.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. I would like to do that, if we could, just to maintain \nthe order here.\n  I believe what the Senator would do, Madam President, after the \nconsideration of the Wyden-Grassley-Inhofe amendment, is then be next \nin line for his amendment. Is that the Senator's request?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Well, my request is to go ahead and bring it up now, but \nthat is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, has the Chair ruled on the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, let me just say to the Senator, I do not \nbelieve we will be able to get a recorded vote before lunchtime on the \nWyden-Grassley-Inhofe issue.\n  We might be able to set that aside and take up yours and get it \ndisposed of before lunch, if that would be convenient to the Senator. I \nam not asking that yet, but I believe we will probably do that.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if we could see the amendment our \ncolleague would like to offer, it would be helpful to us. Why don't we \ndo that while I am talking about this amendment, and then before we \nbreak from this, we can agree to what the Senator wants. I need to see \nwhat the amendment is.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would only say that the amendment has been at the desk \nas of 8 this morning. I assume you have already gone over the \namendments.\n  Mr. DODD. But I understand there are five amendments. I want to know \nwhich amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. This would be an amendment having to do with COLAs.\n  Mr. DODD. Cost-of-living increases. If we could see the amendment, I \nwill be glad--let me start and then he may offer that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that our colleague from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Lieberman be added as cosponsors to the Santorum-\nDodd-Obama amendment. I believe that is what my colleague was \ninterested in being heard on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2942, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2942, as modified, \non behalf of myself, Senator Santorum, Senator Obama, Senator McCain, \nand Senator Lieberman. This is to extend the ban on gifts from \nlobbyists to include meals from lobbyists as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, this amendment is simple and \nstraightforward. It would ban meals from lobbyists in the same way that \nthe current bill bans all other gifts. For purposes of the Senate gift \nrule, it would ban meals outright.\n  The Rules Committee has reported an amendment that bans all gifts. \nBut in an effort to deal with the meal issue, the language of the \nunderlying bill would allow for meals to be paid for by lobbyists but \nwould require, within 15 days of receiving a meal from a lobbyist or a \nforeign agent, that the name of the person providing that meal and the \nvalue of the meal be disclosed on the Member's Web site. In effect, we \nare banning meals almost without language. The idea that every 15 days \nwe would be reporting these meals probably would result in a ban \noutright anyway. But it is dangerous to leave language in there because \nMembers could inadvertently forget to report, as well as staff members \nand the like. It seems to me the better course to follow is to ban \nthese meals outright and to avoid any possible problems that may occur \nas a result of people having meals and failing to report these in an \nadequate way or to misreport the details. It unnecessarily creates a \ntripwire for staff who may attend meetings or events where food is \nserved but where the value is difficult to determine. None of us want \nto do that.\n  What we are trying to do with this bill is not to play gotcha or to \ncatch people but to set some very clear bright lines about what is \npermissible or impermissible behavior. Clearly, you can make a case--\nand Members have--that meals are very much a part of a culture where \nbusiness is done. I know many Members and staff over the years have had \nmeals where they discuss legislation or upcoming amendments. There is \nnothing inherently corrupt about it, but the meal is paid for. And the \nperception is that there is an undue advantage given to those who are \nable to take a Member or a senior staff member out for a meal, to then \nask them to support a particular provision or oppose something. That \ncreates the impression that Members are somehow being unduly \ninfluenced. I will not stand here and suggest that that is the case, \nbut the perception could be that it is the case.\n  All of us who serve in public life understand that perceptions are \nmore real than reality in many cases, and the average citizen doesn't \nhave the opportunity to do that. Members of our constituency who would \nlike to talk to us rarely get the opportunity that a lobbyist has to \nsit down. I happen to believe that lobbying is a right. I think it is \nincluded in the first amendment of the Constitution to be able to \npetition your Government. I don't want to be party to things that limit \npeople's ability to come and petition their Government. That is what it \nis really about.\n  The word ``lobbyist'' has become a pejorative word associated with \nevil doing. The idea of petitioning your Government is a very important \nright, but I don't think it necessarily means that petitioning your \nGovernment gives you the right to then necessarily be able to give \ngifts or provide meals to the person whom you are petitioning. The \naverage person can't do that. We don't think lobbyists should be able \nto do so as well.\n  Our language very simply takes it off the table. It is the cleanest \nway to do it. I know there are fact situations that our colleagues can \nidentify that are probably going to be disadvantageous to them, but \noverall I think we are better off without this. It is cleaner. It is a \nbright line. Let there be no questions about it whatsoever; if you are \na registered lobbyist, a foreign agent, then you cannot provide the \nmeals or the gifts that you have in the past.\n  As a Member, it is simple. If you are having a meal with them, you \npay for your own meal or set up a meeting where there is not a meal \ninvolved and listen to the petition that that lobbyist wants to bring \nto you, what cause he or she wants to make to you. But the idea that \nyou are going to be able to sit down and break bread at their cost as a \nway of engaging in that first-amendment right is something we believe \nshould be eliminated. We include it with the gifts, generally. The \nnexus between giving a gift, buying a meal, and petitioning your \nGovernment cannot be made, in my view, and, therefore, needs to be \nseparated. Therefore, we have offered this amendment to create that \nbright line and to eliminate not only gifts but also clearly to \neliminate the meals as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I echo the comments made by the \nSenator from Connecticut. He covered all the salient points. I did so \nearlier in a broader discussion on the bill. This really is a tripwire. \nThe current language could cause all sorts of problems for Members and \nstaff. The better policy is to simply ban this activity. That does not \nmean that you can't go out with people who aren't lobbyists, and if you \nhave a constituent who has come into town and you can buy them dinner \nor lunch and they can buy you dinner or lunch, that is all well and \ngood but subject to the gift limits that are in place right now. But \nwhen you are in the business of lobbying Members of Congress, as the \nSenator from Connecticut said, it does without question present the \nperception that there is some undue influence involved with the \npurchase of a meal.\n  I understand that we are talking about small meals as well as large. \nBut the bottom line is, that perception is\n\n[[Page S1870]]\n\nnot helpful to the image of this body. Perception and reality should be \na concern of ours because public confidence in this institution and \nthose of us in it is vitally important to the success of our democracy. \nThis is an important measure. It is a small measure but it is important \nto get it accomplished. I hope we can do so by consent or by voice \nvote. I don't see anybody else on the floor. I don't know if the \nSenator from Mississippi wants to speak on this amendment, but I would \nlike to suggest that we agree to this by voice vote and then have the \nSenator from Oklahoma, who has been incredibly patient in waiting to \noffer his amendment, be given the right to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for working with me \non this amendment, and I thank my colleagues, Senator McCain from \nArizona and Senator Obama, who have been deeply interested in this \nsubject matter as well as others. There is a colleague who is thinking \nabout offering a second-degree amendment to our amendment, so we will \nunfortunately not be able to vote on this right now. We are going to be \ntalking to him to work it out if we can. My hope would be that unless \nothers want to speak against this, and there may be Members who would \nlike to speak against it, in which case a recorded vote may be \nnecessary, but if we no one is objecting to this amendment, my hope is \nwe can deal with it on a voice vote and get to the next amendment.\n  I want to move this bill. I don't want to spend the next 2 or 3 weeks \non it. We have major issues that have to be confronted by this body. \nThis is an important one. I do not minimize it. But my hope is we can \nget this dealt with, done, and move on. We have issues that are very \nimportant to the people we represent. My hope is that we don't take too \nmuch time on that, and we can get to those questions.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I may inquire of the Senator from Connecticut, is he \nproposing that we go ahead and accept this on a voice vote?\n  Mr. DODD. We can't at this point. I have a colleague who wants to \noffer a second degree.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then while the Senator from Connecticut talks to his \ncolleagues and determines how we can work on that issue, I will make a \nfew brief remarks.\n  I want to say, again, to Senator Santorum how much I appreciate the \nwork he has done. He didn't just try to find a way to give this issue a \nhit and miss; he got into great detail. I had a lot of questions as we \nwent along on different aspects of his proposal. He was always able to \ngive me thoughtful answers. I appreciate that very much. He worked in \nthe Rules Committee, offered some amendments that were accepted. And in \nthis case, he agreed to make it bipartisan, once again, by joining \nSenator Dodd on the meals question. I emphasize how much I appreciate \nwhat he has done.\n  Frankly, I have no problem, personally, with banning lobbyists from \npaying for meals. Fine. Anybody around here who knows me at all knows \nthat I probably do less of that than just about anybody. I have \nbreakfast with my family: my kids, when they were still living at home \nbefore they went off to college, and my wife now. When the Sun goes \ndown, I am ready to go home because I believe there is something called \na life, family life. The Senate is not my only life. I think more of my \nwife than I do the Senate. I go home every night and eat with my wife. \nI recommend a lot of other people doing it instead of going to all \nthese blame dinners.\n  I am a little offended at the whole concept that you can be bought by \na meal. I don't get it. That is where I do get upset. I think there are \nsome things we need to do, should do, can do to make the rules tighter, \nto have more clarity, disclosure, transparency with regard to lobbying \nreform. I am going to go along with this because, personally, it will \ngive me a fine excuse just to say ``no.'' But I think we are creating \nsome unintended problems. The Rules Committee bill says that you must \ndisclose the cost of such meals that you go to 15 days after you share \nthe meal. To me, that is better. Are we going to stop eating? It might \nbe a good idea for some of us, but I have been going to meals where you \ntalk about issues since I was in elementary school.\n  Again, I believe in being honest about it, disclose what you are \ndoing, you have had a meal, whom it was with, and then let your \nconstituents decide. They don't expect me to come up here and not go to \na luncheon or a meal with school teachers or labor union members or \nexecutives from Northrop Grumman or lobbyists, somebody who represents \na group, cable television. First of all, they are a source of \ninformation. I benefit from it. But I don't just go to lunch to meet \nwith lobbyists from cable television. I also talk to telephone people. \nYou talk to everybody. That is what our republican form of Government \nis all about. People are here to try to find out the details of issues \nand then try to cast an intelligent vote. The very idea that if I sit \ndown with them or go to lunch with them or go to a dinner, which I \ngenerally don't, that is somehow questionable--no Senators are running \nup tabs of hundreds of thousands of dollars at the expense of \nlobbyists.\n  By the way, the rules now say that the maximum value of a meal we can \nreceive from a lobbyist is less than $50. I don't know that that is a \ngreat meal, but you could have a pretty good meal. Being a guy who \nlikes hamburgers and pizzas, I am very happy to get a meal of less than \n50 bucks. But I do think if we call for a ban on all these meals, that \nwe are going to have some unintended problems for ourselves and our \nstaffs.\n  What happens if you go to a luncheon that is sponsored by a lobbyist \norganization, maybe it is under $50, maybe you get a box lunch. Are we \ngoing to be scurrying around saying, what is my pro rata share of this \nlunch? Maybe we shouldn't go to these policy luncheons. That is what is \ngoing to happen. Or you go and you don't eat. It is totally ludicrous \nthat we are doing this.\n  But my attitude is, fine, if that is what the Senators want to do for \nthemselves, no skin off my back. But I do think we are going to regret \nthis, and we are going to look small. Not this amendment or the \nSenators involved, who are well intentioned, but I think we demean \nourselves by inferring that we could be had for the price of a lunch or \na dinner. That is not the case.\n  Having said that, it is clear that in a bipartisan way the Senate \nwants to do this. So be it. I will be eating with my wife and so will a \nlot more Senators after we pass this one.\n  Madam President, could I inquire, are we ready to deal with this \namendment? Do we want to set it aside and go to another amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would withhold, maybe we can temporarily \nset this aside if Senator Inhofe wanted to go forward with his \namendment. He can explain his amendment. If the Senator would withhold \na minute, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator withhold on that?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I suggest to the Senator that if the \nSenator wants to offer a second-degree amendment, it sounds like it \ncould be offered to just about every other amendment pending.\n  Mr. DODD. And he could offer it as a first degree, also.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If he should come on the floor--he or she--with a second-\ndegree amendment, I would be glad to suspend.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague is on his way over to offer the second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, Senator Inhofe has been so helpful and \nunderstanding. We have kind of, because of the effort to go back and \nforth, pushed him aside. I ask that in view of the fact that we are \nwaiting for a Senator to arrive--I think the amendment Senator Inhofe \nwants to offer can probably be accepted. Would it be possible to ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and go to the \nInhofe amendment and be prepared to come back to the pending amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. That is fine.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2934\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, I ask to bring up my \namendment, No. 2934.\n\n[[Page S1871]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2934.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To deny Members who oppose Congressional COLA's the increase)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. AMOUNTS OF COLA ADJUSTMENTS NOT PAID TO CERTAIN \n                   MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Any adjustment under section 601(a) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31) \n     (relating to the cost of living adjustments for Members of \n     Congress) shall not be paid to any Member of Congress who \n     voted for any amendment (or against the tabling of any \n     amendment) that provided that such adjustment would not be \n     made.\n       (b) Deposit in Treasury.--Any amount not paid to a Member \n     of Congress under subsection (a) shall be transmitted to the \n     Treasury for deposit in the appropriations account under the \n     subheading ``medical services'' under the heading ``Veterans \n     Health Administration''.\n       (c) Administration.--The salary of any Member of Congress \n     to whom subsection (a) applies shall be deemed to be the \n     salary in effect after the application of that subsection, \n     except that for purposes of determining any benefit \n     (including any retirement or insurance benefit), the salary \n     of that Member of Congress shall be deemed to be the salary \n     that Member of Congress would have received, but for that \n     subsection.\n       (d) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on the \n     first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or \n     after February 1, 2007.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this amendment is very simple. I have \nalways felt that the greatest single hypocrisy every year is when \nMembers come up and vote to exempt Members of Congress from a cost-of-\nliving increase. The hypocrisy comes in when all the press releases hit \nthe home State and they talk about how great this is, saying they are \ngreat reformers and then, of course, it is defeated and they end up \ntaking the increase anyway.\n  Basically, what this does is say if you vote in favor of an increase \nby voting against an exemption of Congress, then you are not entitled \nto the increase. It is as simple as that. I say this, too: I love the \nKennedys and the Rockefellers, but I don't think you should have to be \na Kennedy or a Rockefeller to serve in this body. I can think of many \npeople, such as Senator Dan Coats--Democrats and Republicans alike \nwould hold him up and say there is a guy who was an outstanding Member \nand he had to quit because of his kids getting up to college age, and \nhe knew he would be able to make enough money to send them to school \noutside of serving in the Senate.\n  If there is ever any transparency in stopping hypocrisy, that is what \nthis would be. I am glad to have this in the mix, and when the \nappropriate time comes, I will call for a vote. It doesn't necessarily \nhave to be a rollcall vote. I will leave that up to the leadership.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank Senator Inhofe for being \ncooperative and bearing with us. I am glad we were able to get this \namendment on the record. I voted for this before. I think Senator Pat \nMoynihan one time rose up in indignation and suggested an amendment of \nthis type, and I voted for it.\n  I think it is well intentioned, something that we will need to think \nabout and work on the exact language. I would propose, if Senator Dodd \nwants to be heard on it, OK; but if we can accept it after that, I \nrecommend that we do that.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague for his patience this \nmorning. He has been here a long time. He had several amendments he \nwanted to offer. Again, having been here as many years as I have been, \nI have voted for and against cost-of-living increases, depending on \nwhether I thought they were appropriate. Many times I voted for them \nand other colleagues voted against them. To their credit, some of our \naffluent Members have voted for pay increases when they clearly could \nhave avoided it. I mention my colleague from Massachusetts. I know in \nmy experience here, on every occasion--there may be some exception--he \nhas voted for them when he believed pay increases were warranted. Even \nthough he may not have needed it himself, he understands that not \neverybody is equal when it comes to financial situations. I have had \nthose feelings myself. I voted against these pay increases and then \nhaving blinked when it comes to taking the pay increase.\n  If you feel that strongly about it and you think it is the wrong \nthing to do, nothing prohibits you from turning in your pay increase. \nYou can write a check to the Department of Treasury and they will \naccept your check. People leave in their wills their hard-earned \ndollars to the Federal Government. On several occasions I have read \nthat people have actually done that. Nothing prohibits Members from \ndoing that. So I am very moved by what my colleague from Oklahoma is \nsaying, and we may want to wait until we have disposed of the Reid \namendment so you can talk to colleagues as to how they feel about it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, I want to get a vote. If I had \na chance to make my full remarks, I would go into more detail. I am one \nof the fortunate ones who have other sources of income. As most of you \nknow, I also do things that go to charity. I am probably a logical one \nto introduce this. I have heard several Members on your side of the \naisle say they are supportive, and I anticipate they will be adding \ntheir names as cosponsors of this amendment before it comes up for a \nvote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I believe there is objection to accepting \nit at this time. I hope we will be able to get that worked out. If not, \nthe Senator can speak at length. I feel so strongly about it, I ask \nunanimous consent that my name be included as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I will soon ask unanimous consent to set \naside the Inhofe amendment and return to the pending amendment, the \nSantorum/Dodd or the Dodd/Santorum amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we have checked on both sides of the aisle \nand we are, I believe, clear now to accept the Inhofe amendment. I urge \nthat the Inhofe amendment be accepted by a voice vote.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I support that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The amendment (No. 2934) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2942, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we are back to the Dodd-Santorum \namendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, once again, let me thank my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, Senator Dodd for his efforts, and Senator \nFeingold for his cooperation in getting an agreement to move forward \nwith the pending amendment. The pending issue is the Dodd-Santorum \namendment, and I believe we are clear now to act on that amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we are prepared to vote. Again, I thank my \ncolleagues. I think this is a good amendment. I appreciate my colleague \nfrom\n\n[[Page S1872]]\n\nPennsylvania as well as my colleague from Illinois, and my home State \ncolleague, Senator Lieberman, and Senator McCain, who have joined as \ncosponsors. I think we have made a good case for it, the bright line to \nget rid of the tripwires. That is a word you will hear me use quite \nfrequently during the course of this discussion. We need clear, bright \nlines. We are not trying to complicate or make life difficult for \npeople, but we are trying to make sure we have some very clear \nunderstandings as to what is permissible or not permissible in the \nconduct of our official business. So I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that before we move \nto the amendment at hand, Senator Feingold have his amendment in order \nfollowing the Santorum-McCain amendment, and we will put it in the \nqueue at that point. If it turns out not to be, we will work with the \nSenator at a later time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, let me say I appreciate the work of the Senators on \nthis. Clearly what Senator Dodd did is an improvement. I, however, \nbelieve we need to do more. I don't see this as a question of \ntripwires. What I see this as is a question of whether certain often \nwell-to-do individuals who work for companies, who are not themselves \nregistered lobbyists, be able to take Members of Congress out to lunch \nwithout the Member paying his own way for dinner, and I want to offer \nan amendment on that. But I want to acknowledge that Senator Dodd has \nachieved a significant step in the right direction.\n  I will offer my approach to this a bit later.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could modify my request, since I \nunderstand we had not gotten an agreement formally locked in. But after \nwe dispose of the Dodd-Santorum amendment and the Wyden-Grassley \namendment, the next amendment to be in order is the Santorum-McCain \namendment, to be followed by the Feingold amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2942, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Dodd \namendment No. 2942, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2942), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1872-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish as a standing order of the Senate a requirement \n   that a Senator publicly disclose a notice of intent to object to \n                  proceeding to any measure or matter)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REQUIREMENT OF NOTICE OF INTENT TO PROCEED.\n\n       (a) In General.--The majority and minority leaders of the \n     Senate or their designees shall recognize a notice of intent \n     of a Senator who is a member of their caucus to object to \n     proceeding to a measure or matter only if the Senator--\n       (1) submits the notice of intent in writing to the \n     appropriate leader or their designee; and\n       (2) within 3 session days after the submission under \n     paragraph (1), submits for inclusion in the Congressional \n     Record and in the applicable calendar section described in \n     subsection (b) the following notice:\n       ``I, Senator __, intend to object to proceeding to __, \n     dated __.''.\n       (b) Calendar.--The Secretary of the Senate shall establish \n     for both the Senate Calendar of Business and the Senate \n     Executive Calendar a separate section entitled ``Notices of \n     Intent to Object to Proceeding''. Each section shall include \n     the name of each Senator filing a notice under subsection \n     (a)(2), the measure or matter covered by the calendar that \n     the Senator objects to, and the date the objection was filed.\n       (c) Removal.--A Senator may have an item with respect to \n     the Senator removed from a calendar to which it was added \n     under subsection (b) by submitting for inclusion in the \n     Congressional Record the following notice:\n       ``I, Senator __, do not object to proceeding to __, dated \n     __.''.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if you walked down the Main Streets of this \ncountry and asked people what a hold was in the U.S. Senate, I think it \nis fair to say nobody would have any idea what it is you were talking \nabout. In fact, they might hear the world ``hold,'' and they would \nthink it was part of the wrestling championships that are going on \nacross this country right now. But the reason I am on the floor of the \nSenate today with my distinguished colleague, Senator Grassley, and \nSenator Inhofe, is that the hold in the Senate, which is the ability to \nobject to a bill or nomination coming before the Senate, is an \nextraordinary power that a United States Senator has, and a power that \ncan be exercised in secret.\n  At the end of a congressional session, legislation involving vast \nsums of money or the very freedoms on which our country relies can die \njust because of a secret hold in the Senate. At any point in the \nlegislative process, an objection can delay or derail an issue to the \npoint where it can't be effectively considered.\n  What is particularly unjust about all of this is that it prevents a \nSenator from being held accountable. I think Members would be \nincredulous to learn this afternoon that the Intelligence \nreauthorization bill, a piece of legislation which is vital to our \nnational security, has now been held up for months as a result of a \nsecret hold.\n  I am going to talk a little bit about the consequences of holding up \nan Intelligence authorization bill in a moment. But I want to first be \nclear on what the Wyden-Grassley-Inhofe amendment would do. It would \nforce the Senate to do its business in public, and it would bring the \nsecret holds out of the shadows of the Senate and into the sunshine. \nOur bipartisan amendment would make a permanent change to the \nprocedures of the Senate to require openness and accountability. We \nwant to emphasize that we are not going to bar Senators from exercising \ntheir power to put a hold on a bill or nomination. All we are saying \nis, a Senator who wants that right should also have a responsibility to \nthe people he or she represents and to the country at large.\n  Now, to the hold on the Intelligence bill that has been in place for \nmore than 3 months, I think every Member of the Senate would agree that \nauthorizing the intelligence programs of this country is a critical \npriority for America. Striking the balance between fighting terrorism \nferociously and protecting our civil liberties is one of the most \nimportant functions of this Senate. The bill that is now being held up \nas a result of a secret hold, the Intelligence reauthorization bill, \nhas been\n\n[[Page S1873]]\n\nreviewed by a number of Senate committees. It was reported by the \nIntelligence Committee late last September, by the Armed Services \nCommittee last October, and by the Homeland and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee last November.\n  I particularly commend Chairman Roberts who worked with me on a \nnumber of amendments, amendments that I felt strongly about, because \nthis legislation does ensure that there will be accountability and \noversight in the Intelligence Committee by establishing a strong \ninspector general, by requiring that the committees get the documents \nthey need to perform effective oversight over the intelligence \ncommunity, and by making the heads of the key agencies subject to \nSenate confirmation.\n  I think the Senate would particularly want to know if this \nlegislation, the Intelligence reauthorization bill that is held up by a \nsecret hold, does not move forward, it will be the first time since the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence was established in 1978 that \nthe Senate has failed to act on an Intelligence reauthorization bill.\n  What we have is a situation where a single, anonymous Senator has \ninvoked a practice that cannot be found anywhere in the Senate rules \nand has lodged an objection to a piece of legislation that is \ncritically important to the well-being of America. Senators have often \nasked Senator Grassley and myself and Senator Inhofe: Where are the \nexamples of these secret holds? Exactly why do you believe your \nlegislation is important? We now have a textbook case of a secret hold \nthat is injurious to America.\n  For all the talk about earmarks--we have been discussing that here on \nthe Senate floor, as well as the scope of conference, line-item vetoes \nand the like--I would wager that no weapon is more important and more \npowerful to each Senator than the ability to stop amendments, \nlegislation, and nominations through secret holds. I believe as U.S. \nSenators we occupy a position of public trust and that the exercise of \nthe power that has been vested in each of us should be accompanied by \npublic accountability.\n  I have no quarrel with the use of a hold. I have used them myself on \nseveral occasions. But what is offensive to the democratic process is \nthe anonymity, the secrecy, the lack of accountability when a Senator \ntries to exercise this extraordinary power in secret.\n  Let me just wrap up, because I see the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee is here, with a quick minute on the history of these \nefforts. Senator Grassley and I have been at this for almost a decade. \nThe Rules Committee held a hearing on our proposal in the summer of \n2003. We worked with Chairman Lott and with the ranking minority \nmember, Senator Dodd, extensively. This is a matter that has been \nconsidered at length by colleagues.\n  Senator Lott knows firsthand about this issue because he has \npersonally spent many hours with me as he has wrestled with it, and in \nfact tried to set in place some voluntary procedures that would curtail \nthe abuses of the secret hold.\n  These secret holds have been an embarrassment to the Senate in my \nview, and they have been an embarrassment for a long time. But I cannot \nrecall an instance where we had a hold, a secret hold on the \nIntelligence authorization bill at a time when our country is at war. \nThis is a practice that needs to end.\n  I yield now for the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I put a hold on the President's \nnominee for the Export-Import Bank. I don't usually issue a press \nrelease when I do that, but I did that because it is in relationship to \na problem we are having with the Export-Import Bank on an ethanol \nissue, and I want the people to know that it is broader than just some \nof the small reasons you do holds around here.\n  But I have had a practice, as this amendment would mandate--I have \nhad a practice over the last 7 or 8 years of putting a statement in the \nCongressional Record when I use a hold. I believe I use a hold a little \nless often than some of my colleagues do, but I agree. A lot of people \nmaybe use a hold because they do not want to put up with the fuss that \ngoes on when you make public why you are holding up a bill and who you \nare. But I want to assure you, I have been in the Senate for 25 years, \nand I have not lost one ounce of blood. I have not had one black and \nblue mark. I don't believe I have had any fight with any colleague over \nthe practice when they know who I am.\n  Of course, if they were secret and they never knew I was doing it, I \nwouldn't have to worry about any of these things. But I believe, as my \ncolleague from Oregon does, that the people's business is the people's \nbusiness, and the people's business ought to be public. I believe if \nyou have guts enough to put a special hold on legislation, you ought to \nhave guts enough to say who you are and why you are doing it. I think \nyour constituents ought to know that. But more importantly, just to get \nthings done around here, your colleagues ought to know who it is \nbecause if you have a gripe, let's get the gripe out in the open and \nlet's talk about it.\n  What is wrong in America that we do not want to talk about some \nthings? I don't know how often my constituents brag about: ``There are \ntwo things I never talk about, religion and politics.'' There are no \nthings that you ought to talk about more than religion and politics \nbecause they have more influence on your life than anything else that \nwe do in American society. But somehow you can't think that you can do \nit in a civil way when you ought to be able to do it in a civil way. In \nthe U.S. Senate you ought to be able to do all this stuff in a civil \nway.\n  I hope my experiences of not having any harm done to me in any way \nfor putting a hold on, that people will back this amendment and get the \npublic's business out. There is nothing wrong with the word ``hold,'' \nbut there is something wrong with the word ``secret.'' When you read it \nin the newspapers you never hear the word ``hold'' unless the word \n``secret'' is connected with it.\n  The people around the countryside of America, at least in my State of \nIowa, think what is wrong with American Government is that there is too \nmuch secrecy, too much behind-the-scenes dealing, too much money in \npolitics--all those things that give us kind of a black eye with the \npublic. This is not going to solve these problems, just taking the word \n``secret'' out of the hold.\n  But at least the newspapers won't be able to use the word ``secret'' \nanymore. And maybe when bit by bit we do some of these things around \nhere we will be able to elevate public service to be the honorable \nprofession that it ought to be.\n  This is a small effort on the part of my colleague and myself and now \nSenator Inhofe to do that.\n  How do you eat 10,000 marshmallows? You eat one at a time. How are \nyou going to raise public respect for the Senate? You are going to do \nit a little bit at a time. This may be too little for some people. But \nthe way caucuses are being held around here on this very subject in the \nlast hour, you know this is a big deal--and it should be a big deal.\n  This is the public's business. Having expressed those views, I would \nlike to go to a statement I have that maybe will make more sense.\n  The time has come for the Senate as a body to rid itself of a serious \nblemish. And, of course, I am talking about the practice I just spoke \nabout of placing anonymous holds on legislation or nominations.\n  The power of the hold is to stop a bill or a nomination in its \ntracks, which each Senator possesses. It was never authorized or even \nintended. It is just a practice. It is not in the books.\n  I do not object to the use of this powerful tool, so long as it is \naccompanied with some public accountability. However, the current lack \nof transparency in the process is an affront to the principle of open \ngovernment, and I think it is an embarrassment to this body.\n  The amendment by Senator Wyden and myself and Senator Inhofe which we \nproposed today would establish a standing order requiring that holds be \nmade public. We believe it is time to have the Senate consider our \nproposed standing order and then decide as a body whether to end this \nsecret process.\n\n[[Page S1874]]\n\n  For my colleagues who might be apprehensive about this change in \ndoing business, I ask you to just give it a try. I should point out \nthat this measure is a standing order which, while binding on Senators, \ndoes not formally amend the Senate rules and can more easily be changed \nif it turns out to be unworkable.\n  I have no doubt that once instituted this reform will be found to be \nvery sound and no reason will be found why it should not be continued \nfor a long period of time. For years, I have made it my practice to \npublicly disclose in the Congressional Record any hold that I place \nalong with a short explanation. It is quick, it is easy, and it is \npainless. I want to assure my colleagues of that.\n  Our proposed standing order would provide that a simple form be \nfilled out, much like we do when we add cosponsors to a bill. Senators \nwould have a full 3 session days from placing the hold to submit the \nform. The hold would then be published in the Congressional Record and \nthe Senate Calendar. It is just as simple as that.\n  This amendment is essentially the same as S. Res. 216 in the 108th \nCongress, which was a collaborative effort between myself, the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Wyden, Senator Lott, and Senator Byrd.\n  In the last Congress, Chairman Lott held a hearing in the Rules \nCommittee on the issue that is before us. Since that time, I have \nworked with Senators Wyden, Lott, and Byrd to come up with what I think \nis a very well thought out proposal to require public disclosure of \nholds on legislation or nominations in the Senate.\n  It says a lot that this proposal was written with the help of such \noutstanding Senators as Senator Lott and Senator Byrd. As chairman of \nthe Rules Committee and as former majority leader, Senator Lott brings \nvaluable perspective and experience. It is also a great honor to be \nable to work on this issue with Senator Byrd, who is also a former \nmajority leader and an expert on Senate rules and procedures.\n  I can think of no reason a single Senator should be able to kill a \nbill or a nomination in complete secrecy. Despite recent attempts by \nthe leadership to curb abuses of holds, the secret hold remains a stain \non the fabric of the Senate.\n  It is time for the whole Senate to consider our proposed standing \norder and speak as a body on this issue. If any Senator believes I am \nmisguided in this, I welcome their discussion.\n  I have yet to hear a single good reason we should allow secrecy to \ncreep into what ought to be a very public legislative process. In fact, \npublic discussion on this matter is long overdue. If this practice that \nis in the shadows of legislation is to continue, let us at least say so \npublicly.\n  I can think of no better time to consider this long overdue measure \nthan in the context of a bill titled the ``Legislative Transparency and \nAccountability Act.''\n  If we don't end this in a bill with this title, we are missing a \nchance that we have been waiting for for 10 years. I thank the chairman \nof the committee for that opportunity. That is why this measure is all \nabout transparency and accountability.\n  The purpose of the underlying bill is to restore public confidence in \nCongress by making our actions transparent and accountable. Secret \nholds run contrary to both principles. They are done in complete \nsecrecy and allow Senators to avoid public accountability for action. \nThe underlying bill requires disclosure of earmarks in advance of \nconference negotiations and increased disclosure of trips and \nemployment negotiations.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Wyden-Grassley-Inhofe amendment so \nthat we can use this one small step to restore confidence and have more \npublic accountability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin by commending the two \nsponsors of this proposal. I know that each of them has worked so hard \nand so long trying to end the practice of secret, indefinite holds \nbeing put on either nominees or placed on legislation. I believe this \nproposal is consistent with the goal of this legislation which is more \naccountability and more transparency. I commend both of them for their \neffort.\n  I would like to engage the sponsor of this amendment in a colloquy in \norder to clarify that his proposal is not intended to reach a very \ntemporary hold that is placed on a bill in order to allow for review of \nthat legislation.\n  Let me give a specific example. Occasionally, bills will be \ndischarged from their authorizing committees. These are not necessarily \non the calendar. They are discharged from the committee, and the bill \nwill be hotlined on both of our sides to see if there is any objection.\n  Obviously, putting a temporary stay on the consideration of a \ndischarged bill in order to allow a few hours for review or even a day \nfor review is completely different from the practice of secretly \nkilling a bill by putting an indefinite anonymous hold.\n  I wonder if, through the Chair, I could inquire of the sponsor if it \nis his intention to distinguish between those two situations. I would \ncall one a ``consult hold'' perhaps, and one a ``killer hold.''\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as usual, the distinguished Chair of the \nsubcommittee has put her finger on an important distinction. I want to \ntake a second to describe how the legislation addresses it. I think we \nare of like mind on it. Subsequently, a lot of time was spent by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Rules Committee and Senator Dodd and \nSenator Byrd on this matter.\n  What the distinguished Chair of the Homeland Security Committee is \ndescribing is essentially a consult. For example, a Senator wants to be \nnotified about a bill that is headed for the floor. Very often that \ncomes up, say, when a Senator is in his or her home State and \nfrequently needs to be able to come back, and it takes a day, and they \nneed to be able to review it.\n  Under the Wyden-Grassley-Inhofe amendment we make very clear it is \nnot our intention to bar those consults. We like to use the word \n``consult,'' which is a protected tool for a Senator as opposed to the \nquestion of a hold.\n  I think perhaps another way to clarify it is a consult is sort of \nlike a yellow light. You put up a little bit of caution--that we need a \nbit of time to take a look at it. A hold is a red light when you are \nnot supposed to go forward. We don't want people to be able to exercise \nthose holds in secret. We think it is fine to have the kind of consult \nthat the distinguished Chair of the Homeland Security Committee has \ndescribed.\n  In fact, to ensure that we have this kind of procedure that the \nSenator seeks, we call for 3 days before an individual has to put in \nthe Congressional Record that they have a hold on a matter.\n  I think we are clearly in agreement--that the consult is protected, \nbut the secret hold and forcing the Senate to do its business in public \nis what is going to change.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the explanation \nand clarification of the sponsor of the amendment. I am in complete \nagreement with the differences that he described. I believe his \nproposal would inject needed transparency and accountability into the \nprocess, not to mention that I would know who puts those holds on my \nbills.\n  I hope this proposal will be adopted. I intend to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment \noffered by the Senator from Oregon, the Senator from Iowa, and the \nSenator from Oklahoma. I thank them very much for doing it.\n  I must say, as I listened to the debate I thought back to the winter \nof 1988 after I was elected to the Senate.\n  Incidentally, a distinguished member of that cast was the honorable \nSenator from Mississippi, and we attended the orientation session \ntogether that winter for new Senators. I remember then Senator Wendell \nFord from Kentucky came before us to give us instructions about Senate \nprocedure.\n  He said: Look, I remember when I was just elected to the Senate. You \nare going to find a lot of things around here that don't make much \nsense to you, but they will over time.\n  Then Senator Ford stopped for a moment, and said: Take the seniority \nrule. The longer I am here, the more sense it makes to me.\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\n  I want to say the longer I am here, the less sense the secret hold \nprocedure makes to me. Honestly, it has become increasingly outrageous \nwhen you think about it--that this body can be stopped by an action \nthat is secret, and the source of the action is not known on a measure \nthat is on the Senate floor because it came out of a committee. It is \nreally outrageous.\n  I congratulate Senators Wyden, Grassley, and Inhofe for seizing this \nmoment of reform brought about by the reports from the Rules Committee \nand our own Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to \ntake this opportunity to get rid of this outdated but really outrageous \npart of Senate procedure.\n  If somebody cares enough to hold up a measure and hold up the rest of \nus from considering it on the floor, the least they can do is have the \nguts to reveal their identity.\n  That is all this change would bring about.\n  I thank my colleagues. I look forward to supporting this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I defer to the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, is the Senator from Louisiana speaking on \nthe same issue? If you would defer, Senator Inhofe has become one of \nthe lead cosponsors of this amendment. I think you would probably like \nto be heard in sequence. Then the floor would be open for questions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, at this point, after the Senator from \nOklahoma has spoken, it would be my intention to very briefly wrap up \nthe case for the Wyden-Grassley-Inhofe amendment. We would yield our \ntime at that point, and we are going to ask for a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not currently operating under a \ntime agreement.\n  Without objection, the Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I was fascinated by the comment \nfrom the Senator from Connecticut that after a few years some of this \nstuff will make sense to us. I have only been here 20 years. I am a \npatient man; I will wait.\n  Let me put this in perspective, as far as my interest in this. Back \nin 1986 I was elected to the House of Representatives. There was a \nprocedure that was used at that time called the discharge procedure \nwhereby a person could discharge a bill out of the committee without \nhaving committee action, but it could be blocked by someone and we \ncould not know the name of the person who blocked it.\n  Consequently, we found ourselves in this situation where there would \nbe legislation that everyone at home is very excited about. We could go \nhome and campaign and say, yes, I am for this. I remember several of \nthe West Texas Democrats wanting to oppose gun control. Yet their \ncaucus wanted them to support gun control. So they would tell the \npeople at home that they were opposing it. Yet they were the very ones \nwho kept it from coming up for a vote.\n  That is exactly the same thing we are dealing with here. In 1994 we \nwere able to pass that reform. When we came over here in 1994, I was \nnot even aware that you could put a hold on a bill without disclosing \nwho you were or who was putting the hold on. This is a very similar \nthing. It is transparency, bringing it out in the open.\n  I agree with my good friend Senator Wyden that if Members want to, \nthey can put a hold on a bill. This does not affect that. Members just \nhave to say who they are.\n  This morning I had my amendment on the floor and Senator Wyden and \nSenator Grassley showed me their amendment was essentially the same. I \nwas very happy to fold mine in. I am happy to be part of this.\n  After a number of years now, this will become a reality. I applaud my \nfellow cosponsors for the fine work they have done.\n  Let me review how that means of obfuscation worked--this from the \nCongressional Record, page H1131, March 10, 1992:\n\n       A good example is the method Members from the House of \n     Representatives used to hide their votes from the people \n     concerning a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution. \n     Shortly after it was discovered in a USA Today poll in 1987 \n     that over 80 percent of the people in America want a \n     balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, House Joint \n     Resolution 268 was introduced. House Joint Resolution 268 \n     immediately gained 246 coauthors from over the Nation. I can \n     just envision, at the town hall meetings back home, a liberal \n     Democrat standing up and holding House Joint Resolution 268 \n     in his hand saying, ``See here, ladies and gentlemen. This is \n     my name as cosponsor of House Joint Resolution 268.'' What \n     the Congressman didn't tell these people is that he has no \n     intentions of allowing House Joint Resolution 268 to come up \n     for a vote. How does this Congressman, who is trying to make \n     the people back home believe that he is supporting a budget-\n     balancing amendment to the Constitution, keep from having to \n     vote on it?\n       It is very simple, the Speaker merely puts it in a \n     committee and then makes a deal with the committee chairman \n     not to bring it up for consideration. The only way that it \n     can be brought up for consideration is for a discharge \n     petition to be signed by 218 Members of Congress. The \n     discharge petition is in the Speaker's desk and must be \n     signed during the course of a legislative day. However, the \n     names of those individuals who sign a discharge petition are \n     kept secret and if a Member discloses the names of other \n     Members who sign the discharge petition, he can be \n     disciplined to the extent of expulsion from membership of the \n     House of Representatives. So House Joint Resolution 268 had \n     240 cosponsors, but only 140 Members were willing to sign the \n     discharge petition.\n       Pretty cozy, huh? The Congressman can falsely represent his \n     position to the people at home and never have to vote on the \n     issue. I might add that there is a happy ending to that House \n     Joint Resolution 268 story. Several of us contacted a \n     national publication. While the publication knew we couldn't \n     divulge the names of those who signed the discharge petition, \n     they agreed to print the names of the individuals who \n     coauthored House Joint Resolution 268, but did not sign the \n     discharge petition. We found a loophole in the corrupt \n     institutional system that protects Congressmen from their \n     electorate and as a result of that, we were able to \n     immediately force it out onto the floor and we missed passing \n     a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution by only seven \n     votes.\n\n  That situation disturbed me so much that in March of 1993 I filed a \none-sentence bill on the House floor challenging the secrecy, ``Once a \nmotion to discharge has been filed the Clerk shall make the signatures \na matter of public record.''\n  I had 87 cosponsors, and it passed by a vote of 384 to 40.\n  In an article about my initiative, Reader's Digest in November of \n1994 wrote, ``The success of this legislation is proof that when \nCongress is required to do the people's business in the open, the \npeople--rather than special interests--win . . . the passage of this \none bill is an important first step in the right direction. And it took \na little-known Representative form Oklahoma to point the way.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full text \nof this article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Reader's Digest, Nov. 1994]\n\n A Story of Democracy and Capitol Hill: How the Trial Lawyers Finally \n                               Met Defeat\n\n                         (By Daniel R. Levine)\n\n       When a twin-engine Cessna airplane crashed near Fallon, \n     Nev., four years ago, the National Transportation Safety \n     Board (NTSB) ruled pilot error was the cause. But that didn't \n     stop lawyers for two of the injured passengers from suing \n     Cessna on the grounds that the seats on the 25-year old plan \n     did not provide adequate support. The seats had been \n     ripped out without Cessna's knowledge and rearranged to \n     face each other. But the lawyers claimed that Cessna \n     should have warned against removing the seats. A jury \n     awarded the two plaintiffs more than $2 million.\n       In Compton, Calf., a single-engine airplane nearly stalled \n     on the runway and sputtered loudly during take-off. Less than \n     a minute into the air it crashed, killing two of the three \n     people on board. On July 18, 1989, two days before the one-\n     year statue of limitations would expire, the survivor and \n     relatives of the deceased passengers filed a $2.5 million \n     lawsuit naming the plane's manufacturer, Piper Aircraft \n     Corp., as a defendant. Not mentioned in the suit was the fact \n     that the plane, built in 1956, had been sitting at the \n     airport unused and uninspected for 2\\1/2\\ years. The case, \n     awaiting trial, has already cost Piper $50,000.\n       The NTSB found that 203 crashes of Beech aircraft between \n     1989 and 1992 were caused by weather, faulty maintenance, \n     pilot error or air-control mishaps. But trial lawyers blamed \n     the manufacturer and sued each time. Beech was forced to \n     spend an average of $530,000 defending itself in each case \n     and up to $200,000 simply preparing for those that were \n     dismissed.\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\n       Such product-liability lawsuits have forced small-plane \n     makers such as Cessna to carry $25 million a year in \n     liability insurance. In fact, Cessna stopped producing \n     piston-powered planes primarily because of high cost of \n     defending liability lawsuits. Thus, an American industry that \n     15 years ago ruled the world's skies has lost more than \n     100,000 jobs and has seen the number of small planes it \n     manufactured plummet from over 17,000 in 1978 to under 600 \n     last year.\n       That may all change. Bucking years of intense lobbying by \n     trial lawyers, Congress voted last summer to bar lawsuits \n     against small-plane manufacturers after a plane and its parts \n     have been in service 18 years. The legislation will create an \n     estimated 25,000 aviation jobs within five years as \n     manufacturers retool and increase production.\n       This was the first time that Congress has reformed a \n     product-liability law against the wishes of the lawyers who \n     make millions from these cases. And the dramatic victory was \n     made possible because of the efforts of a little-known \n     Congressman from Oklahoma who challenged Capital Hill's \n     establishment.\n       On his first day in 1987 as a member of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.) asked colleague Mike \n     Synar (D., Okla.) how he had compiled such a liberal voting \n     record while winning re-election in a conservative district. \n     Overhearing the question, another longtime Democratic \n     Congressman interjected: ``It's easy. Vote liberal, press-\n     release conservative.''\n       This was a revealing lesson in Congressional ethics, the \n     first of many that would open Inhofe's eyes to the way \n     Congress really ran. He soon realized that an archaic set of \n     rules enabled members to deceive constituents and avoid \n     accountability.\n       When a Congressman introduced a bill, the Speaker of the \n     House refers it to the appropriate committee. Once there, \n     however, the bill is at the mercy of the committee chairman, \n     who represents the views of the Congressional leadership. If \n     he supports the legislation, he can speed it through hearings \n     to the House floor for a vote. Or he can simply ``bury'' it \n     beneath another committee business.\n       This arrangement is tailor-made for special-interest \n     lobbies like the Association of Trial Lawyers of America \n     (ATLA). For eight years, bills to limit the legal liability \n     of small-aircraft manufacturers had been referred to the \n     House Judiciary Committee, only to be buried. Little wonder. \n     One of the ATLA's most reliable supporters on Capitol Hill \n     has been Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), powerful chairman of \n     that committee and recipient of regular campaign \n     contributions from ATLA.\n       The only way for Congressmen to free bills that chairmen \n     such as Brooks wanted to kill was a procedure called the \n     discharge petition. Under it, a Congressman could dislodge a \n     buried bill if a House majority, 218 members, signed a \n     petition bringing it directly to the floor for a vote. But \n     discharge petitions virtually never succeeded because, since \n     1931, signatures were kept secret from the public. This \n     allowed Congressmen to posture publicly in favor of an issue, \n     then thwart passage of the bill by refusing to sign the \n     discharge petition. At the same time, House leaders could \n     view the petitions, enabling them to pressure signers to \n     remove their names. Of 493 discharge petitions ever filed, \n     only 45 got the numbers of signatures required for a House \n     vote. And only two of those bills became law.\n       Inhofe saw the proposals overwhelmingly favored by the \n     American people--the 1990 balanced-budget amendment, school \n     prayer, Congressional term limits, the line-item veto--were \n     bottled up in committee by the House leadership. When \n     discharge petitions to free some of the bills were initiated, \n     they were locked in a drawer in the Clerk's desk on the House \n     floor. The official rules warned that disclosing names ``is \n     strictly prohibited under the precedents of the House.''\n       In March 1993, Inhofe filed a one-sentence bill on the \n     House floor challenging the secrecy: ``Once a motion to \n     discharge has been filed the Clerk shall make the signatures \n     a matter of public record.''\n       The bill was assigned to the Rules Committee, where it was \n     buried. Three months later, on May 27, Inhofe started a \n     discharge petition to bring the bill to a floor vote. Among \n     those signing was Tim Penny (D., Minn.), a lawmaker who after \n     ten years in the House had grown so disgusted that he had \n     decided not to run for re-election. ``Discharge petitions \n     procedures are symbolic of the manipulative and secretive way \n     decisions are made here,'' said Penny. ``It's just one more \n     example of how House leaders rig the rules to make sure they \n     aren't challenged on the floor.''\n       Inhofe, though, was badly outnumbered. The Democrats82-seat \n     majority controlled the flow of legislation. But he was not \n     cowed. From his first years in politics Inhofe had shown an \n     independent streak--and it had paid off. After initially \n     losing elections for governor and Congress, He was elected to \n     three consecutive terms as mayor of Tulsa, beginning in 1977. \n     In 1986, he ran again for the Congress and won. Four years \n     later, he bucked his own President, George Bush, by voting \n     against a 1991 budget ``compromise'' that included a $156-\n     billion tax hike.\n       By August 4, two months after filing his discharge \n     petition, Inhofe had 200 signatures, just 18 shy of the 218 \n     need to force his bill to the floor, but the House leadership \n     was using all its muscle to thwart him. On the House floor, \n     Inhofe announced: ``I am disclosing to The Wall Street \n     Journal the names of all members who have not signed the \n     discharge petition. People deserve to know what is going on \n     in this place.''\n       It was a risk. House leaders could make him pay for this \n     deed. But by making public the names of non-signers, he would \n     avoid a direct violation of House rules. Inhofe collected the \n     names by asking every member who signed the petition to \n     memorize as many other signatures as possible.\n       The next day, The Wall Street Journal ran the first of six \n     editorials on the subject. Titled ``Congress's Secret \n     Drawer,'' it accused Congressional leaders of using \n     discharge-petition secrecy to ``protect each other and keep \n     constituents in the dark.''\n       On the morning of August 6, Inhofe was within a handful of \n     the 218 signatures. As the day wore on, more members came \n     forward to sign. With two hours to go before the August \n     recess, the magic number of 218 was within his grasp.\n       What happened next stunned Inhofe. Two of the most powerful \n     members of Congress--Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman \n     John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Rules Committee Chairman Joseph \n     Moakley (D., Mass.)--moved next to him at the discharge \n     petition desk. In a display one witness described as \n     political ``trench warfare,'' the two began ``convincing'' \n     members to remove their names from the petition.\n       Standing near the desk was Rep. James Moran (D., Va.). \n     Moakley warned him that if Inhofe succeeded, members would be \n     forced to vote on controversial bills. ``Jim,'' he said \n     sternly, ``I don't have to tell you how dangerous that would \n     be.'' When the dust settled, Moran and five colleagues--\n     Robert Borski (D., Pa.), Bill Brewster (D., Okla.), Bob \n     Clement (D., Tenn.), Glenn English (D., Okla.) and Tony Hall \n     (D., Ohio)--had erased their names.\n       Still refusing to quit, Inhofe faxed the first Wall Street \n     Journal editorial to hundreds of radio stations. Before long, \n     he found himself on call-in programs virtually every day of \n     the week.\n       When The Wall Street Journal printed the names of the \n     nonsigners on August 17, House members home for the summer \n     recess could not avoid the public outcry Inhofe had \n     generated. With scandals in the House bank, post office and \n     restaurant still fresh in their minds, voters were \n     demanding openness.\n       Feeling outgunned, Moakley allowed his Democratic \n     colleagues to sign the discharge petition. When Rep. Marjorie \n     Margolies-Mezvinsky (D., Pa.) affixed her name to the \n     petition on September 8, she became the 218th Signatory.\n       Inhofe's bill won overwhelming approval on the final vote, \n     384-40. Even though most Democrats had not supported him, 209 \n     now voted with Inhofe. Groused Dingell: ``I think the whole \n     thing stinks.''\n       The first real test of Inhofe's change came last May when \n     Representatives Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) and James Hansen (R., \n     Utah) filed a discharge petition to free their bill limiting \n     small-plane manufacturer liability. Even though it was co-\n     sponsored by 305 members, the bill had been bottled up in the \n     Judiciary Committee for nine months. But because members' \n     signatures would now be public, voters would finally know who \n     truly stood for product-liability reform and who did not.\n       Meanwhile, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America was \n     pulling out all the stops to kill the bill. Members \n     personally lobbied Congressmen and orchestrated a ``grass-\n     roots'' letter-writing campaign in which prominent trial \n     attorneys urged their Representatives not to support the \n     bill. ATLA even fired off a maximum-allowable contribution of \n     $5,000 to Representative Hansen's opponent in the November \n     election.\n       The pressure didn't work. Within two weeks 185 members had \n     signed, and House leaders realized it would be impossible to \n     stop the petition. Their only how was to offer a compromise \n     version. In mid-June, Brooks reported out of committee a bill \n     that differed only slightly from the original. On August 2, \n     the Senate approved similar legislation. The next day the \n     bill cleared the House without dissent. On August 17, \n     President Clinton signed it into law.\n       Glickman, whose Wichita district is home to Cessna and \n     Beech aircraft companies, said the procedural change \n     spearheaded by Inhofe was crucial to victory. ``A lot of \n     forces did not want this bill to go forward,'' he continued, \n     ``and it would not have succeeded without the discharge \n     petition.''\n       The success of this legislation is proof that when Congress \n     is required to do the people's business in the open, the \n     people--rather than special interests--win. The high cost of \n     product-liability lawsuits, to manufacturers as well as \n     consumer, will require far more sweeping reform of the tort \n     system. But the passage of this one bill is an important \n     first step in the right direction. And it took a little-known \n     Representative from Oklahoma to point the way.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. The situation is exactly the same here, Mr. President.\n  In fact, the very stated reason for this whole bill is to require \nCongress to do the people's business in the open.\n  A Senator may have a hold on a nomination or a bill or a unanimous \nconsent agreement, and that hold is secret.\n  It is just as possible for a Senator to keep his constituents and \nAmericans in general in the dark now about their holds as it was for \nHouse Members before I successfully led the charge for transparency in \ndischarge petitions.\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\n  Indeed the Wall Street Journal was strongly in favor of my House \nefforts at that time.\n  Toward that end, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the Wall Street Journal's six editorials on the issue of \ndischarge motions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 30, 1993]\n\n                           Real House Reform\n\n       On his first day in office in 1987, Rep. Jim Inhofe asked a \n     fellow Oklahoma Member how he could be so liberal and keep \n     getting elected in a conservative state. A third Congressman \n     interrupted: ``It's easy. Vote liberal. Press release \n     conservative.''\n       Rep. Inhofe took a big step toward ending such hypocrisy \n     Tuesday, when Congress voted 384 to 40 for his proposal to \n     end the secrecy of discharge petitions. Constituents will now \n     know who's signed up for the procedures necessary to \n     discharge a bill from committee and force a vote; Members \n     will no longer be able to posture one way and act another on \n     bills popular with the public but unpopular with fellow \n     legislators. Rep. Inhofe's overwhelming majority, after the \n     difficulty he had signing up 218 Members to discharge his own \n     proposal, is itself testimony to the difference between \n     smoke-filled rooms and the light of day.\n       At least the 40 opponents, whose names appear below, were \n     willing to stand up and be counted in favor of secrecy. ``I \n     think the whole thing stinks,'' declared Rep. John Dingell, \n     much-feared chairman of the House Energy and Commerce \n     Committee. General Dingell warned that reform ``means you \n     lay the basis for the entire bypassing of the committee \n     system.'' House Rules Committee Chairman Joe Moakley \n     railed against an ``aroused and enraged'' public that is \n     ``virtually impossible to engage in reasonable and \n     thoughtful debate.''\n       Watching Jim Wright's departure, the Keating Five scandals, \n     the House Bank and Post Office, much of the public doubts \n     that such debate is what goes on in Capitol corridors. \n     Indeed, it thinks it has some right to be aroused and \n     enraged. And when Congress routinely exempts itself from \n     rules it imposes on the rest of society, much of the public \n     thinks that something needs to be bypassed. So it's entirely \n     appropriate that this major reform of House rules be forced \n     on Congress by popular outcry.\n       The ideological bent of this outcry is also noteworthy. As \n     the 40 holdouts show, the drive to make Members accountable \n     was certainly not led by the liberals who have long thought \n     themselves the font of ``reform.'' We on this page were glad \n     to have played our part, and are equally glad to credit Rush \n     Limbaugh's broadcasts and the efforts of Ross Perot, whose \n     supporters held all-night vigils in front of Congressional \n     offices.\n       We would also note, though, the lack of interest from a \n     press that holds itself devoted to ``the public's right to \n     know.'' For a month after Rep. Inhofe's August 4 announcement \n     that he would publicize the names of Members who refused to \n     end secret discharge petitions, no network or other major \n     newspaper mentioned his crusade. Only after public agitation \n     forced a House majority to back Mr. Inhofe did our colleagues \n     at the New York Times and the Washington Post address the \n     issue. The Post noted that ``in a democracy, where elected \n     officials have an obligation to be candid and accountable, \n     there is no reasonable argument against this change.'' We're \n     grateful for the support, but wonder if they'd have joined \n     the battle before it was won had it been led by, say, Ralph \n     Nader.\n       It's also intriguing that secrecy was supported by Beltway \n     ``academics.'' Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein complained we \n     had created ``a wildly inaccurate portrayal of Congress as a \n     closed, secretive institution dominated by committees and \n     party barons and unresponsive to popular sentiment.'' We \n     refer them to the respected Members now departing in disgust. \n     Rep. Tim Penny, the retiring Minnesota Democrat, says it took \n     him ``only six months in Congress to realize this place \n     doesn't operate on the level.'' In particular, he says, many \n     Democrats are themselves upset that House leaders ``rig the \n     rules to make sure they aren't challenged on the floor.''\n       To the Members, the academics and the press we say this: \n     Welcome to the age of instant communications. We doubt that \n     the discharge petition reform will be the last reform. In \n     particular, some 75% of the American people support \n     limitations on Congressional terms. Last week, after it \n     became clear that discharge petitions would be made public, \n     five Members signed the petition to discharge term limit \n     legislation. While defenders of Congressional secrecy predict \n     untoward and chaotic results, we trust the public a lot more \n     than we trust the Members.\n       In 1867, the British Parliament passed the Second Reform \n     Act, sponsored not so incidentally by Disraeli's \n     conservatives. It gave the vote to the likes of rent-payers, \n     and upon passage the Viscount Sherbrooke advised fellow \n     parliamentarians to ``prevail on our future masters to learn \n     their letters.'' In the popularized version this became, ``We \n     must educate our masters.'' If the John Dingells and Joe \n     Moakleys are really worried not about their own prerogatives \n     but the future of the republic, they would be well-advised to \n     adopt the constructive attitude affirmed by Viscount \n     Sherbrooke.\n       The 40 House Members who on Sept. 28 voted in favor of \n     secrecy on discharge petitions:\n       Neil Abercrombie (D., Hawaii) Sanford Bishop (D., Ga.)

Jim Inhofe mobilized public opinion and forced \n     House leaders to allow a September 27 floor vote on his bill \n     to end secret discharge petitions, he knew they might try to \n     undermine him. Sure enough, there are signs that the \n     leadership hopes to placate the public by accepting Mr. \n     Inhofe's secrecy bill but then sneak through House-Rule \n     changes that would gut his reform. Should they try this \n     stunt, Members better be ready to take some real heat from \n     voters.\n       Only hours after Mr. Inhofe's first-round victory on \n     September 8, House Rules Committee Chairman Joe Moakley said \n     he planned an ``alternative'' to Mr. Inhofe's bill. No doubt \n     it would pay lip service to reform while it retains the \n     system that lets Congressional barons make certain that \n     popular bills never see the light of day.\n       House leaders may try to require that two-thirds of the \n     Members sign any discharge petition to bring a bill to the \n     floor, rather than a simple majority. Since less than 10% of \n     discharge petitions now reach the House floor, such \n     a ``reform'' would kill any chance of freeing popular \n     bills bottled up in committee. Exhibit A: Even though 75% \n     of voters and more than 100 Members favor term limits, \n     Speaker Tom Foley hasn't even allowed a committee hearing \n     on the issue.\n       The Rules Committee met last week to discuss altering the \n     Inhofe reform. It was suggested that successful discharge \n     petitions merely require a committee to hold hearings on a \n     bill. A floor vote would be mandated only if a committee \n     refused to take any action. But, according to the newspaper \n     Roll Call, House leaders rejected even that move. They fear \n     they'll lose iron control of the legislative process if a \n     majority of Members have a realistic way of bringing bills to \n     the floor.\n       The hearings then became a platform for Members to vent \n     their frustration with Mr. Inhofe's success at exposing the \n     gag rule that kept names on a discharge petition secret. Rep. \n     James Oberstar of Minnesota came to denounce Mr. Inhofe, but \n     ended up scoring points for him. He called Mr. Inhofe's \n     sunshine law a ``gimmick.'' However, he conceded that if \n     Democrats ``were in the minority, we'd probably be doing the \n     same.'' He also admitted that many Members introduce bills \n     only to get ``special interests off their backs.''\n       Mr. Inhofe says Mr. Oberstar's admission proves that secret \n     discharge petitions allow Members to say one thing at home \n     and then do something else in Washington. ``Standing up to \n     special interests is part of the job,'' he says. ``If you \n     can't, step aside and let someone who can serve.''\n       Rep. Inhofe says his battle to end secrecy has also \n     demonstrated the stranglehold that committee chairmen now \n     exercise over legislation. Before the August recess, Mr. \n     Inhofe's antisecrecy petition was only one signature short of \n     the needed majority. Then Chairman Moakley ``convinced'' six \n     Members to remove their names, forcing Rep. Inhofe to take \n     his case to the American people.\n       Virginia Democrat James Moran candidly explained why he \n     dropped off: ``When the chairman of the Rules Committee asks \n     me to do something and it's not in conflict with my \n     conscience, I think my ability to serve my district is \n     enhanced when I say yes.'' Mr. Moran then noted how powerful \n     Chairman Moakley is.\n       Thomas Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings \n     Institution, opposes the Inhofe reform, but he advised the \n     Rules Committee not to amend it. ``That will only inflame the \n     public further,'' he told us. He noted that if problems \n     develop, the majority party will then have a good reason to \n     push for modifications. In short, the House should have \n     cleaned up its act years ago. Now the voters are going to do \n     it for them.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 25, 1993]\n\n                       Asides: Discharge Rumbles\n\n       Some House Members have complained that we listed their \n     names among the 223 Members who haven't joined Rep.

Jim \n     Inhofe posed to them with his effort to end secret discharge \n     petitions, described in our editorial last week. Why, making \n     public the now-secret list of members calling for floor votes \n     on bills held by the Rules Committee would let constituents \n     check up on members.

A \n     large part of the problem is procedure, an arcane set of \n     rules evolved over the years to let Congresspersons protect \n     each other and keep constituents in the dark. Rep. Jim Inhofe \n     has launched a campaign against the keystone of these rules, \n     the veil of secrecy covering a device called the discharge \n     petition.\n       It works like this: The House conspires to bottle up in \n     committee all the bills that are popular in the country but \n     unpopular on Capitol Hill--balancing the budget or limiting \n     terms, for example. The Rules Committee is particularly \n     crucial, as it was in shelving civil rights bills in the \n     1950s. The Rules Committee simply sits on a bill, allowing \n     members to posture in public in support while never having to \n     vote on it, much less enact it.\n       The discharge petition is supposed to serve as a \n     protection; a bill can be forced onto the floor if a majority \n     of Members sign a petition. But that rarely succeeds, because \n     until the required number of 218 is reached, the list of \n     signers is kept strictly secret. So Members can still posture \n     in public and effectively vote the other way in secret, even \n     co-sponsoring a bill but refusing to sign its discharge \n     petition. Worse, only House leaders know who has signed, and \n     when a petition nears 218 they can pressure the most pliable \n     members to drop off.\n       Discharge petition procedures have the flavor of a covert \n     brotherhood rather than a representative body. Petitions are \n     kept locked in a drawer at the clerk's desk. The drawer can \n     only be opened during a House session and only a signing \n     Member can see a petition. Members cannot take any notes, and \n     can't even bring their own pens to the desk. They must read a \n     statement signed by the Speaker noting that disclosing any \n     names on the petition is ``strictly prohibited under the \n     precedents of the House,'' a prohibition imposed in 1931 \n     by Speaker John Nance Garner, but never made part of House \n     Rules. Violators face disciplinary action, up to and \n     including expulsion.\n       Rep. Inhofe was granted floor time last night to dare House \n     leaders to carry out this threat. Mr. Inhofe filed a bill to \n     require that signatures on a discharge petition be made \n     public, and it was promptly assigned to the Rules Committee \n     for burial. So he started a discharge petition to bring it to \n     the floor, and quietly asked each signer to memorize other \n     names on the list; by now he's painstakingly assembled a list \n     of 200 signers, only 18 short of a majority. He revealed last \n     night that he will disclose the names of all Members who have \n     not signed the petition, and is ready to face any \n     disciplinary action against him.\n       As a public service, we've agreed to print his list as \n     Congress leaves Washington to visit its home constituencies. \n     Watch this space to learn if your Congressperson wants \n     secrecy or openness in government. Of course, Members not on \n     Mr. Inhofe's petition can sign up for openness before leaving \n     town. As he advised his colleagues last night: ``It's just \n     one short trip to the secret drawer to sign discharge \n     petition No. 2. Take a friend.''\n\n  After all was said and done, the Wall Street Journal noted, ``Members \nwill no longer be able to posture one way and act another on bills \npopular with the public but unpopular with fellow legislators . . . \nWhile defenders of Congressional secrecy predict untoward and chaotic \nresults, we trust the public a lot more than we trust the Members.''\n  Mr. President, that is again exactly what I am talking about here in \nthis parallel instance.\n  I want to very strongly note that the Wall Street Journal is in favor \nof eliminating the secrecy of Senate holds at this time.\n  Toward that end, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord this Wall Street Journal editorial that endorses the concept of \neliminating secret holds, assuming no one puts an anonymous hold on \nthis unanimous consent request:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 29, 2005]\n\n Advise and Consign--The Filibuster Isn't the Only Procedure Senators \n                              Are Abusing\n\n       With a showdown looming over the filibuster of judicial \n     nominees, now is the time to point out another abuse of the \n     Senate's ``advise and consent'' power. It's called the \n     ``hold,'' whereby an individual Senator can delay \n     indefinitely a Presidential nomination, and it is seriously \n     interfering with the operation of the executive branch.\n       Call it every Senator's personal ``nuclear option.'' If he \n     doesn't like a nominee or, more likely, doesn't like a policy \n     of the agency to which the nominee is headed, all he has to \n     do is inform his party leader that he is placing a hold on \n     the nomination. Oh--and he can do so secretly, without \n     releasing his name or a reason.\n       Like the filibuster, the hold appears nowhere in the \n     Constitution but has evolved as Senators accrete more power \n     to themselves. Senate rules say nothing about holds, which \n     started out as a courtesy for Members who couldn't be present \n     at votes. Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden has said holds are ``a \n     lot like the seventh-inning stretch in baseball. There is no \n     official rule or regulation that talks about it, but it has \n     been observed for so long that it has become a tradition.''\n       Also like the filibuster--which was never intended to block \n     judicial nominees from getting a floor vote--the hold is \n     being abused by a willful minority of Senators. This being a \n     Republican Administration, Democrats in particular are using \n     it now to hamstring or stop its ability to govern. There's no \n     formal list of holds, but the current batch may well be \n     unprecedented both in number and degree. Here's our \n     unofficial list:\n       Rob Portman, U.S. Trade Representative. The Senate Finance \n     Committee unanimously backed the former Congressman this \n     week. But don't expect a floor vote soon. Indiana Democrat \n     Evan Bayh has placed a hold on his nomination in hopes of \n     forcing a vote on a protectionist bill he favors on trade \n     with China. (Think AFL-CIO and the 2008 Presidential \n     nomination.) Meanwhile, it looks like Mr. Portman will miss a \n     high-level meeting next week in Paris to jump-start trade \n     talks.\n       Stephen Johnson, head of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency. Senator Tom Carper says Mr. Johnson ``is qualified to \n     head the EPA and would serve the agency well.'' Yet the \n     Delaware Democrat placed a hold on him over a dispute \n     regarding the Administration's Clear Skies program, \n     regulating pollutants in the air. Mr. Johnson dodged an \n     earlier bullet when California Democrat Barbara Boxer \n     threatened a hold unless the EPA canceled a study of infants' \n     exposure to home pesticides. Mr. Johnson, who is acting EPA \n     head, canceled the program.\n       Lester Crawford, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner. \n     The sticking point here is Plan B, aka the morning-after \n     pill. Democrats Hillary Clinton and Patty Murray want Plan B \n     sold over the counter and say that the agency is stalling. \n     They say they won't lift their hold until the FDA makes a \n     decision.\n       Tim Adams, Undersecretary of the Treasury for International \n     Affairs. The person in this position is responsible for, \n     among other critical issues, the Chinese yuan and the World \n     Bank. But Democrat Max Baucus has higher priorities--\n     namely, trade with Cuba. He objects to a legal ruling by \n     an obscure arm of the Treasury that requires advance \n     payment by Havana for purchases of U.S. agricultural \n     products such as grain from the Senator's home state of \n     Montana. There are six more Treasury positions open--\n     including those responsible for tax policy, Fannie Mae\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\n     and terrorist financing. Mr. Baucus promises holds on all \n     of them. The Senator realizes he can't win a vote in \n     Congress on his Cuba problem, so he's resorting to this \n     nomination extortion.\n       Defense Department. Where to begin? With a war on, you'd \n     think Senators would want to keep the Pentagon fully staffed. \n     But John McCain, angry over the Air Force's tanker-leasing \n     deal with Boeing, last year put holds on numerous Defense \n     nominees, including two candidates for Army Secretary, the \n     comptroller and the assistant secretary for public affairs, \n     the long-serving Larry DiRita. Now that Mr. McCain's personal \n     punching bag, Air Force Secretary Jim Roche, has left the \n     Pentagon, the Arizona Republican has calmed down--though not \n     enough to lift his hold on Michael Wynne as Undersecretary \n     for Acquisition. President Bush gave Mr. Wynne a recess \n     appointment last month.\n       Meanwhile, Democrat Carl Levin has a hold on Peter Flory, \n     who was nominated almost a year ago as Assistant Secretary \n     for International Security Policy. Mr. Flory has the \n     misfortune to work for Undersecretary Douglas Feith, whom \n     Senator Levin has pursued like Ahab chasing Moby Dick. So Mr. \n     Flory gets harpooned, too.\n       Until Wednesday, John Paul Woodly was blocked as Assistant \n     Secretary of the Army for Civil Works by Alabama's two \n     Republican Senators. Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby said \n     Washington favored Georgia in a decade-long dispute over \n     water rights. (We're not making this up.) And in March, \n     Mississippi Republican Trent Lott placed a hold on the \n     chairman of the Base Closing Commission, which he feared \n     might shut a military facility in his home state. The \n     President again had to use recess appointments to name all \n     nine members in April.\n       Once upon a time in America, such policy disputes were \n     settled in elections or with votes in Congress. But in \n     today's permanent political combat, Senators wage guerrilla \n     warfare against the executive. No wonder so few talented \n     people want to work in Washington. Senator Wyden and \n     Republican Charles Grassley plan to re-introduce legislation \n     next month to kill holds that are secret. Better yet would be \n     to get rid of all Senate holds.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. As the Wall Street Journal mentions, neither the \nConstitution nor the Senate Rules mention holds. We need this \nlegislation to correct the current situation.\n  One of the many times I personally have run into this problem of \nholds was in the case of the nomination of Governor Mike Leavitt of \nUtah to be administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee I \nwas trying to shepherd the nomination of Governor Leavitt through my \ncommittee.\n  At that time in 2003, Governor Leavitt was being run through \nunprecedented hoops by the Democrats to obstruct his nomination even \nthough we had an affirmative statement from my Ranking Member Senator \nJeffords that he considered Governor Leavitt a friend and admission \nthat he was going to receive the vote of Senator Jeffords.\n  Pursuant to this situation, Roll Call wrote the following piece that \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Roll Call, Oct. 6, 2003]\n\n                    Inhofe Considers Rules Amendment\n\n                           (By Mark Preston)\n\n       Environment and Public Works Chairman James Inhofe (R-\n     Okla.) is considering asking his Senate colleagues to amend \n     chamber rules to terminate the minority party's ability to \n     block committees from reporting out legislation and \n     nominations.\n       Such a measure would impose uniform guidelines on how the \n     Senate's 19 standing committees and lone special panel \n     operate.\n       ``I am going to have to look to see what can be done, \n     because the Democrats could effectively shut down the \n     government altogether,'' Inhofe said.\n       The EPW chairman's contemplation of a new rule was sparked \n     by committee Democrats' successful effort last week to delay \n     a vote on Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt's (R) nomination to head the \n     Environmental Protection Agency. Democrats charge that \n     Leavitt has failed so far to adequately answer their written \n     questions posed to him, and therefore boycotted the hearing.\n       Inhofe is likely to face stiff opposition if he pursues a \n     change in the rules, which would require 67 votes on the \n     Senate floor.\n       ``I am not in favor of changing the rules much,'' said Sen. \n     Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), a staunch defender of Senate \n     tradition. ``The rules have been here for a long time and \n     they are the product of decades of experience.''\n       Currently, each committee adopts its own rules of procedure \n     at the outset of every Congress. EPW rules require that at \n     least two members from the minority party be present for a \n     nominee to be reported out of committee. Democrats took \n     advantage of that stipulation by not attending the Leavitt \n     hearing and thereby preventing Inhofe from holding a vote on \n     the nomination.\n       ``I think we may have to change the rules in the Senate in \n     terms of how committees operate because they say you can't \n     conduct business unless you have members of both sides'' \n     present, Inhofe said. ``What they did [Wednesday] is far \n     worse than stopping a guy's confirmation. It goes to the \n     whole heart of how the committee system works.''\n       Even though EPW requires at least two minority party \n     representatives to be present to take action, other \n     committees have less stringent rules. For example, the \n     Finance Committee requires that a quorum include at least one \n     member from each party to be present when the full committee \n     votes on a bill or a nomination. And the Rules and \n     Administration Committee requires that a majority of panel \n     members be present to vote on legislation or a nominee, but \n     does not stipulate that a member from either the majority or \n     minority be present when such an action is taken.\n       Inhofe said he is also interested in amending the rule that \n     allows committees to only meet for two hours after the Senate \n     gavels into session unless both parties agree--on a daily \n     basis--to waive it. In recent years, this unanimous consent \n     agreement has been rejected by several Senators for various \n     reasons.\n       ``One party can stop government completely, and I don't \n     think that was certainly the intent of those people who made \n     the rules to start with,'' the Oklahoma Republican said.\n       Inhofe's proposals for adding to and altering the current \n     rules are just two among a handful of reforms that \n     Republicans have been championing since taking over the \n     majority earlier this year.\n       ``The Senate Republican majority is going to have to look \n     at a number of them,'' Rules Chairman Trent Lott (R-Miss.) \n     said of potential changes. ``I do think our rules have not \n     been seriously considered in quite some time.\n       ``We need to take a look at the way the Senate functions,'' \n     Lott added.\n       One rules change is currently waiting action by the full \n     Senate. Lott's panel approved a measure in June that would \n     end the use of a filibuster to stop a nomination. All 10 \n     Republicans on the panel voted to report the bill out of \n     committee, but it still needs the backing of 67 Senators on \n     the Senate floor for it to be enacted. Democrats on the Rules \n     panel did not attend the June 24 hearing and have vowed to \n     prevent the rule change from passing on the floor.\n       Republicans are seeking this change to stop Democrats from \n     blocking President Bush's judicial nominees. Already, one of \n     Bush's picks for a seat on the appellate court has withdrawn \n     his name because Democrats refused to allow a vote on his \n     nomination. Currently, Democrats are blocking two other \n     judicial nominees and have pledged to block U.S. District \n     Judge Charles Pickering's nomination to the appeals court.\n       The disagreement over judges has added to the partisanship \n     in the traditionally collegial Senate.\n       ``I think the judge issue is poisoning the well around here \n     and it is unfortunate,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH). ``It \n     has never happened before this filibuster on the judges at \n     this level, and that has created frustration.''\n       But Democrats contend Bush is to blame for the judicial \n     filibusters, because he refuses to work with Democrats to \n     pick candidates acceptable to both political parties.\n       ``I would like to point out, when people are opposed to \n     some of these nominees, don't look at the Senators, ask the \n     guy who sent the nominees,'' said Judiciary ranking member \n     Patrick Leahy (D-VT). ``That is part of the problem. The \n     White House doesn't make an effort to really work with \n     everybody.''\n       Another rules change advocated by several Senators is one \n     ending the use of an anonymous ``hold.'' A hold is a tactic \n     used by a Senator to stop a nomination or a bill the lawmaker \n     opposes, or often to gain leverage on another issue.\n       It is a huge problem for the leaders,'' Lott said of the \n     use of secret holds. And Lott, a former Majority Leader, \n     warned that Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and Minority \n     Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) will experience the ``devastating'' \n     consequences of this practice when the two leaders try to \n     wrap up legislative business for the year.\n       They are fixing to find out the last week we are here they \n     are going to say, `The hold is a really bad creation,' '' \n     Lott said. ``I know it, but they have got to see it. That is \n     when conferences are coming through, and that is when bills \n     need to move.''\n       As for the Leavitt nomination, Inhofe has scheduled three \n     consecutive meetings beginning Oct. 15 in which a vote on the \n     Utah governor's nomination could occur. But it is unclear \n     what action Democrats will take.\n       ``He hasn't answered our questions,'' said Sen. Barbara \n     Boxer (D-CA). ``So if we get the answers to our questions \n     from Leavitt that is a different circumstance.''\n       ``Let's see how he answers our questions,'' she added.\n       Inhofe could change his panel's rules to allow him to \n     report Leavitt out of the committee, but he would still need \n     two Democrats present to take a formal vote on the change.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. You can see from roll-call's reporting that no matter \nwhat I achieved in my committee, an anonymous hold could always be \nplaced on the President's nomination, and thus a\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\nhalt could be brought to operations of the Senate and in turn the \nadministration.\n  The American people do not want obstruction; they want progress from \nus.\n  Obstruction was certainly practiced by Senator Daschle, and the \npeople showed their lack of appreciation at the ballot box.\n  I ask that Members join me in this effort and do what our \nconstituents want for the sake of transparency and honesty.\n  We ought to have the courage to stand up for our convictions, not \nhide in the shadows of darkness and anonymity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is my intent at this point to wrap up.\n  I particularly thank the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, who has \nhad a longstanding interest in this subject, for working with Senator \nGrassley and myself. We do have a bipartisan effort.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has highlighted another problem with it, \nand a lot of Members who served in the other body bumped into this. A \nlot of these holds over the years have not even been placed by Senators \nthemselves. They have been placed by staff, and Senators go up to each \nother and try to ask about a matter and it ends up a Senator may not \neven know about it.\n  I also see the Senator from Mississippi, the distinguished chairman \nof the Committee on Rules. He spent a lot of hours with me talking \nabout this over the years. Senator Lott, to show his commitment to the \ncause of openness, has tried repeatedly to get Senators to do this \nvoluntarily. I recall on a number of instances Senator Lott and Senator \nDaschle met with Senator Grassley and me. We put together a variety of \nletters and directives to Senators. It still would not come together.\n  We think you have to make this a permanent change in the Senate \nprocedures, put the burden on the objector rather than on the \nleadership, as we have done so often in the past, and the leaders would \nthen have to make phone calls. Senator Lott has a wonderful story that \nhe has told me over the years about sitting in phone booths at airports \ncalling Members, trying to figure out who in the world had a hold on \nsomething.\n  I say to colleagues, we have now reached that moment where the Senate \nhas had it up to here with all of the secrecy and practice of doing \nbusiness in the shadows.\n  To wrap this up, we are going to have a vote in a few minutes. The \nIntelligence Authorization bill, a bill that is vital to America's \nnational security, is subject to a secret hold. I don't think anything \ncould make the case for our bipartisan amendment more clearly than the \nneed to move ahead with this country's vital business in intelligence. \nI have talked to Chairman Roberts about this. He wants that bill to \nmove. It is a bipartisan bill. We have not had a situation since 1978 \nwhen we could not move forward on an intelligence bill.\n  I hope colleagues will finally bring the Senate into the sunshine. \nThis enormous power that each Senator has is one that will continue, \nbut if we can prevail on this vote, it will be one that will be \nexercised in the sunlight. Each Senator will be held accountable when \nthey assert this particular power.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Wyden-Grassley-Inhofe \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me clear up one point. I am not sure we are ready to go \nto a recorded vote at this moment. I thought maybe we could set it \naside and go to other amendments and have stacked votes later in the \nafternoon, allowing Senators to continue committee meetings. However, I \nhave been notified that maybe someone would object to a unanimous \nconsent to set it aside so I sent a message back to that Senator: if \nyou want to object, you better come over here. That is a problem around \nhere. We send our surrogates over to object, but they are not here. If \nhe comes, he can object. That is fine. We will try to work with \neveryone to try to accommodate everyone. There may be a need for \nfurther discussion.\n  Let me take a moment to commend the Senator from Oregon and the \nSenator from Iowa and now the Senator from Oklahoma for your tenacity. \nYou have been pecking away at this for years.\n  Typical of the leadership, there was a time when I was saying, do we \nneed to go that far; there is a misunderstanding about holds. In fact, \nthat is a misnomer. There is no such thing. A hold is a request to be \nnotified when an issue or a nominee will be brought up so we can come \nover and speak. The fact is, it ties the leadership's hands because \nquite often they say, wait a minute, I can't delay the business of the \nSenate to have this Senator come over here and talk at length--which is \nhis or her right--on a nominee or a Member.\n  The point I am trying to make, I have tried to work to deal with this \nissue of fairness. Senator Daschle and I did work with Senator Biden to \nfurther clarify, what is this thing, a hold? How do I have to comply \nwith it? We requested that it be put in writing, which, by the way, was \nnever locked into place. That is one of the reasons I am for this.\n  We need to make it clearer about how Members do this and what the \nrequirements are. We do not want to stop the practice of a Senator \nbeing able to file notice that he would like to be able to come over \nand discuss an issue.\n\n  What I have had a problem with, I do think it has been abused. We \nhave anonymous hold, we have rolling hold, and it is harder and harder \nand harder to try to do the business of the Senate. But the anonymous \npart of it is the part that bothers me the most. That is the thrust of \nthe Rules bill and particularly the bill by the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs. Let's open things, disclose things, \nhave transparency, make sure the people know what we are up to.\n  This is, in my opinion, very sinister, where Members can hold up a \nnomination, hold up a bill, and not even acknowledge they are doing it.\n  I point out that all this amendment does is to say the holds must be \nin writing and they have to be published in the Record in 3 days.\n  Is that the thrust of the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mr. LOTT. What is the threat here? I do think there is a good cause \nfor late at night, 6 o'clock, you are wrapping up, and all of a sudden \nthe leadership hits us with, we want to clear 10 bills and a Senator \ncan say, wait a minute, I want to make sure, What is the cost of this \nbill--as the Senator from New Hampshire has been inclined to do. He has \nthat right. It is appropriate he be able to have time to look at that. \nBut he ought to then have to put in writing that notice to the leader \nso the leader, if nothing else, will not forget it, and then \nacknowledge who he is. That is all this does.\n  I don't know what the vote of the Senate is going to be because some \nMembers may say they are giving up some of their senatorial \nprerogatives. No, you are not; you just can't hide. That is all.\n  In the spirit of this legislation of openness and honesty, let me \nsay, this is also an area where some Senators--no one has gotten in \ntrouble with these holds or used the holds for a response or for some \nbenefit personally, but the day will come, if we do not watch it, \nsomeone will get in trouble ethically with this procedure.\n  The leaders may have a different view and I will be very responsive \nto their views, but for now, it is time we quit talking about making \nthings more open and honest and we do it. This amendment would do that. \nI plan to support it.\n  I am advised we do not have an objection to setting aside this \namendment, unless others wish to speak on this amendment.\n  Does the Senator from New York have a comment on this issue or \nanother issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oregon for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi. I \nparticularly thank him for his extraordinarily supportive statement and \nfor\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\nall the help he has given me over this decade. It probably would be my \npreference to have a recorded vote at this time, particularly since I \nhave had the good fortune to have had such a supportive statement from \nthe distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules.\n  Is there a problem with having a recorded vote on the Wyden-Grassley-\nInhofe amendment at this time?\n  Mr. LOTT. There would be a problem having the vote at this time, just \nout of convenience for a number of Senators on both sides who have \nother commitments. We would like to perhaps stack votes a little later \nin the afternoon. I want to collaborate with the chairman of Homeland \nSecurity and Senator Dodd and Senator Lieberman about exactly what time \nwe would do that. We could get more work done without interfering with \nSenators' schedules.\n  So, yes, there would be an objection to it right now. But it has \nalready been locked in and we will have a recorded vote. It will be \nfirst in the sequence whenever we set it up.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just to wrap this up, that is a very fair \nprocedure that the Senator from Mississippi has outlined and we will be \nhappy to accept that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent we set aside the Wyden-Grassley-\nInhofe amendment and go to the next pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, could I speak, before we \nset it aside, on this amendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I withhold my unanimous consent request at this time, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The consent request is withdrawn without \nobjection.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I commend my colleague from Oregon and my colleague from \nOklahoma for their lone battle on this issue. It is an issue we all \nagree with and very much appreciate their hard work.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2959 to Amendment No. 2944\n\n  Second, I will say a word on another issue that is pending in the \nHouse of Representatives. At this point, I offer an amendment at the \ndesk as a second degree to Mr. Wyden's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Does he have to have \nconsent? He just calls it up and it would not----\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, both the Democratic leader and I will have \na few comments, but what I have just done is filed a cloture motion, \nwhich I have done so reluctantly because I really have been very \npleased over the past couple weeks as we addressed a very important \nissue on lobbying reform and ethics reform, an issue that is critical \nto restoring the faith the American people really deserve to have in \ntheir Government. We have been working together, as I said, in a \nbipartisan way. I thought until a few hours ago we had a very good \nchance of completing this bill this week.\n  At the leadership level, we worked together very well, and the four \nmanagers--we have four managers because we merged the two bills--have \nbeen working together effectively and lined up a number of amendments \nto vote on today and tomorrow as well. As I said, I thought we would be \nable to finish it.\n  Having said that, what happened today is an amendment came to the \nfloor under circumstances that I am not going to go through right now, \nbut it is such that it really would take us off the course of this \nbipartisan lobbying reform bill. We had discussions as to whether that \namendment would be withdrawn, but it was made very clear after the \ndiscussions among us that the amendment would come back later tonight, \ntomorrow, or the next day.\n  Again, this amendment has nothing to do with lobbying reform or \nethics reform of this body, something that is important, something that \nis the business of the Senate right now on the floor.\n  So what I have done is filed a cloture motion which will ensure we \nfinish this bill. We have had reasonable time for people to offer \namendments, and postcloture, once cloture is obtained, germane \namendments can still be considered.\n  Let me also add that we still have the opportunity to get the bill \ndone. What I would suggest is that with this cloture motion, since it \nwill ripen on Friday unless we are able to work out some other \nagreement to have it ripen before that, we do have the opportunity \ntomorrow to work over the course of the morning, really through\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\nthe day, and address amendments--we have to do so by unanimous \nconsent--but address amendments on the lobbying reform bill.\n  The managers were about to have us vote on some other amendments \nwhich we would be able to vote on. It will take unanimous consent. We \ncould bring them up one at a time if that is the case.\n  Without going into all the details of what happened, that is where we \nare today. The cloture motion now has been filed, and it does give us a \nroad to completing this bipartisan bill.\n  I will be happy to yield to the Democratic leader for a comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the one thing that I will do is work very \nhard over the next few hours to see if we can have the cloture vote \ntomorrow, sometime tomorrow. I will see if we can get that done. I \nthink it would be to everyone's advantage if we could resolve this part \nof the situation we have on the floor.\n  I would say that the Leader and I have had many discussions during \nthe day and in the weeks prior to this matter coming to the floor in an \neffort to move this lobbying reform bill along. I think we can get a \nlobby reform bill; it is now a question of when we will do that.\n  But in the morning, cooler heads will prevail, and we will see what \nwe can do to move the country along on these things that need to be \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1882-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOLD ON LAMBRIGHT NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am placing a hold on the \nnomination of James Lambright to serve as President of the Export-\nImport Bank of the United States.\n  I am placing this hold on Mr. Lambright's nomination as I have major \nconcerns regarding the issuance of taxpayer-guaranteed credit insurance \nby the Export-Import Bank for an ethanol project in Trinidad and \nTobago. Specifically, the approval of this credit insurance by the \nExport-Import Bank appeared to violate the Bank's authorizing statute.\n  Let me explain.\n  In March 2004, the Export-Import Bank approved the issuance of $9.87 \nmillion in taxpayer-guaranteed credit insurance to help Angostura \nHoldings Limited, of Trinidad and Tobago, finance the construction of \nan ethanol dehydration plant in Trinidad. The purpose of this credit \ninsurance was to enable Angostura to purchase equipment to be used to \ndehydrate up to 100 million gallons of Brazilian ethanol annually. \nAngostura would then reexport the resulting dehydrated ethanol to the \nUnited States duty-free under the current Caribbean Basin Initiative \ntrade preference program.\n  But section 635(e) of the Export-Import Bank's authorizing statute--\nthe Export-Import Bank Act of 1945--states that the bank is not to \nprovide credit or financial guarantees to expand production of \ncommodities for export to the United States if the resulting production \ncapacity is expected to compete with U.S. production of the same \ncommodity and that the extension of such credit will cause substantial \ninjury to U.S. producers of the same commodity. The statute goes on to \nprovide that ``the extension of any credit or guarantee by the Bank \nwill cause substantial injury if the amount of the capacity for \nproduction established, or the amount of the increase in such capacity \nexpanded, by such credit or guarantee equals or exceeds 1 percent of \nUnited States production.''\n  As of 2004, when the credit guarantees for Angostura were approved, \nthe total 100 million gallon capacity of the Angostura facility was \nnearly 4 percent of U.S. production. This amount clearly exceeded the \n1-percent threshold for causing substantial injury to the U.S. ethanol \nindustry as spelled out in the Export-Import Bank's authorizing \nstatute.\n  So it appeared to me that the approval of credit guarantees for \nAngostura by the Export-Import Bank violated the Export-Import Bank's \nauthorizing statute.\n  Moreover, as the amount financed by the Export-Import Bank was less \nthan $10 million, no detailed economic impact analysis was conducted by \nthe bank. I note that the amount approved by the Export-Import Bank \n$9.87 million was conveniently just below this $10 million threshold \namount.\n  In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, Congress asked the \nExport-Import Bank for an explanation of the credit guarantees for \nAngostura. Specifically, the 2005 act required the Export-Import Bank \nto submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate \nand the House containing an analysis of the economic impact on U.S. \nethanol producers of the extension of credit and financial guarantees \nfor the development of the ethanol dehydration plant in Trinidad and \nTobago. Congress also required that this report determine whether such \nan extension would cause substantial injury to such producers, as \ndefined in section 2(e)(4) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945.\n  In January of last year, the Export-Import Bank provided its report. \nIn its report, the Export-Import Bank avoided the issue of whether its \ncredit guarantees for Angostura caused substantial injury to U.S. \nproducers, and thus whether the approval of these guarantees was in \ncompliance with the Export-Import Bank's authorizing statute. The \nExport-Import Bank avoided the issue by claiming that the Angostura \nplant will not ``produce'' dehydrated ethanol. Rather, the Export-\nImport Bank stated that this plant will merely ``process'' dehydrated \nethanol by removing water from wet ethanol produced in Brazil, thus \nmerely ``adding value'' to the wet ethanol from Brazil.\n  However, despite the semantics of the Export-Import Bank, the \nAngostura plant will clearly be producing dehydrated ethanol. This is \ncommon sense. An ethanol dehydration plant--of course--produces \ndehydrated ethanol.\n  Moreover, the Customs Service recognizes that ethanol dehydration \nplants in Caribbean Basin Initiative countries produce dehydrated \nethanol.\n  While the Export-Import Bank currently does not have an inspector \ngeneral, the conference report for the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2006 directs the Export-Import \nBank's inspector general--once appointed to look into this credit \ninsurance approval. Specifically, the conference report provides that \nthe inspector general shall provide a written analysis to the Finance \nCommittee and the Committee on Appropriations, within 90 days of \nappointment, as to whether the loan guarantees provided to the ethanol \ndehydration plant in Trinidad and Tobago met the provisions of the \nExport-Import Bank's charter. The analysis shall include whether \n``value added'' methodology is routinely used by the bank to determine \nwhether a proposed loan guarantee or export credit meets the statutory \ntest regarding the definition of substantial injury found in the bank's \nauthorizing statute. The inspector general shall also make \nrecommendations as to whether it is appropriate to use such methodology \nin making a determination of substantial injury.\n  As the Export-Import Bank currently does not have an inspector \ngeneral, I am placing a hold on Mr. Lambert's nomination until such \ntime that I receive assurances from him that, first, the Export-Import \nBank will act quickly to appoint an inspector general, and second, that \nMr. Lambert will see that the inspector general will indeed provide a \nwritten analysis on the credit insurance approval within 90 days of \nappointment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1882-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1882-S1884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate March 8, \n2006, International Women's Day. It is an undeniable fact that as the \nworld becomes more interconnected, societies which value women's rights \nand include them in the political, economic, and civic process have a \ngreater chance of prospering and contributing to international peace \nand stability.\n  Nowhere is this more evident than in Iraq. We all know that in order \nfor Iraq to succeed as a nation, women must play an integral role in \nthe government and women's rights must be treated as fundamental human \nrights. While much work remains to be done in Iraq, I am pleased to see \nthat women are playing a prominent and active role in the government.\n  As such, it is a great honor to not only commemorate, March 8, 2006, \nInternational Women's Day but also\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\nwelcome a distinguished guest, Dr. Jinan Jasim Ali Al Ubaidi, a newly \nelected member to Iraq's Council of Representatives, who will be my \nguest and accompany me throughout the day.\n  A member of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution party, Dr. \nUbaidi is a graduate of Baghdad University and practiced medicine at \nNajaf Hospital prior to the fall of the Hussein regime.\n  Dr. Ubaidi and her female colleagues in the Council of \nRepresentatives are now confronting issues which will determine the \nfuture of women's rights in Iraq.\n  This is a critical juncture and one key question they face is. What \nwill be the extent of sharia in Iraq and how will it affect women's \nrights in that country?\n  Article 14 of Iraq's Constitution states that ``Iraqis are equal \nbefore the law without discrimination based on gender.'' Article 2 of \nthe Constitution maintains that ``no law that contradicts the \nestablished provisions of Islam may be established.''\n  Some people believe that it will be difficult to reconcile the two \narticles and still provide women with fundamental rights in Iraq. I, \nfor one, believe that Islam and women's rights can go hand in hand and \nthere is an opportunity to advance these rights in a new Iraq.\n  While the women in the Iraqi National Assembly will do their part, \nthe United States and the international community need to play a vital \nrole in advancing the role of women in Iraq.\n  Specifically, we should continue to promote democracy related \ntraining programs, female education programs, and assist with judicial \nreform and Islamic jurisprudence training so that women will become \npart of the social, political, and economic fabric of Iraq.\n  Gains for women's rights have been made in other Muslim countries \nsuch as Indonesia and Morocco, and we should look to them as examples.\n  In Morocco, successful efforts to raise the marriage age for women \nfrom 15 to 18, abolish polygamy, and equalize the right to divorce have \nbeen made. In Indonesia, Musdah Mulia, the chief researcher at the \nMinistry of Religious Affairs, has sparked considerable debate within \nthat country by calling for changes in the areas of wearing a hijab and \nmarriage based on Islamic jurisprudence. Although such rules have not \nbeen enacted, further debate on the issue is a positive step.\n  A nongovernmental organization in Indonesia, known as the Indonesian \nSociety for Pesantren and Community Development, has also been using \nIslamic jurisprudence to promote women's reproductive rights and family \nplanning education within religious schools there. These are all \nprogressive steps toward promoting women's rights in the Islamic world.\n  In the near future, an Iraqi government will be formed that will make \nimportant decisions on the role of women and sharia. The United States \nmust do everything within its power to ensure that women's rights are \nfully incorporated into every aspect of Iraqi life.\n  We must continue to support education and leadership initiatives, \neconomic empowerment programs, and specifically judicial reform, all of \nwhich will seek to increase the role of women government and assist \nIraq's transition to a stable and democratic state.\n  Let us also not forget about the women in Afghanistan. Under the \nTaliban regime, women were brutally oppressed and women's rights were \nvirtually nonexistent.\n  Women in public were forced to cloak themselves head to toe while \nbeing accompanied by a male relative. If they failed to do so, they \nrisked being beaten mercilessly.\n  Furthermore, most Afghan women were restricted by the Taliban from \nworking, receiving an education, visiting doctors, or accepting \nhumanitarian aid.\n  Now, women in Afghanistan have the opportunity to build a better life \nfor themselves and their families. It is no longer illegal for women to \nwork, and millions of Afghan girls now attend school.\n  The United States has provided grants to establish the Ministry of \nWomen's Affairs, assisted Afghan nongovernmental organizations, created \nopportunities for income generation in the private sector, and \nsupported opportunities for women in agriculture and rural \nenvironments.\n  The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \nAppropriations Act, 2006, included a $50 million earmark for programs \ndirectly addressing the needs of Afghan women and girls.\n  However, many challenges remain for women in Afghanistan.\n  Although women may legally work, many still face serious challenges \nto finding job opportunities. For them, it is extremely difficult to \nfind jobs close to home, with tolerable hours, and reasonable pay.\n  Additionally, although education is currently on the rise, most \nAfghan women have had little or no formal job training, which prevents \nthem from gaining meaningful employment.\n  Finally, women still face conservative attitudes about their \npolitical participation in many rural areas of the country.\n  The United States must not forget about these women. We must continue \nto advance women's rights in Afghanistan because if we do not, our \ntireless efforts there will have been in vain.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to stay the course and support \nadditional assistance for education, health care, and democracy \ntraining for women and girls in Afghanistan during the years ahead.\n  There are a great many challenges that face women today, and there \nare a great many challenges that faced women in the past. Issues such \nas the role of women in Iraq and Afghanistan are no less daunting than \nwomen's suffrage seemed in 1920. As such, there is cause for optimism \non International Women's Day.\n  Yet we must remain vigilant in our fight for justice and gender \nequality around the world.\n  The United States must remain a leader by proactively addressing \nthese women's issues. I am confident that if we tirelessly continue to \nfight for gender equality, we can find workable solutions to address \nthe problems that women face around the world.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today is International Women's Day, a \nchance for us to reflect upon the status of women around the globe, \nrecognize their achievements, and recommit ourselves to ensuring that \nwomen can fully realize the rights with which all humans are endowed.\n  There is much for women to celebrate this year. Women in Kuwait were \ngranted the right to vote and run for office, while women in \nAfghanistan exercised their right to vote in November's elections. In \nTanzania, and Burundi, among other countries, the number of women \nserving in elected office increased to record levels. In all parts of \nthe world, women are seizing opportunities to weigh in with their \ngovernments on the issues of greatest importance to their lives. But \nthere is still so much work to be done to help women achieve equal \nrights and equal protection.\n  The culture of corruption apparent in far too many countries has a \ndisproportionate impact upon women. In Latin America, women have \ndisappeared or been killed without proper criminal investigations. In \nother countries, women who have endured rape or sexual abuse experience \nfurther stigmatization and punishment, including forced detainment and \ndeath threats. All across the globe, women and girls are trafficked \nacross borders, often with the knowledge of local officials who \ntolerate the presence of their captors. We need to devote more energy \nto making our communities safer for women, ensure that crimes against \nwomen are given fair and full consideration by law enforcement, and \nthat bribery and cronyism do not dilute the rule of law.\n  Women, the caregivers in families and communities around the world, \nmust also have the opportunity to seek and receive appropriate health \ncare. More than 500,000 women each year die of largely preventable \npregnancy-related complications, while millions more suffer injuries, \nlike obstetric fistulas, for which they cannot get treatment. In many \ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS has had the greatest \nimpact, the majority of young women still do not have adequate \nknowledge of the ways in which HIV is transmitted. Girls and women \naccount for 70 percent of the world's hungry, and malnutrition in \npregnant women\n\n[[Page S1884]]\n\nleads to deficiencies in their children's development. We need to \nrecognize the way that gender inequality contributes to disease and \naddress these disparities through increased education and outreach and \nequal access to medical treatment and support services.\n  As international trade transforms economies around the world, we must \nensure that women have equal access to these opportunities. In one-\nthird of the world, women are the breadwinners for their families. \nFemale farmers account for 80 percent of the agricultural workforce in \nAfrica, and 60 percent in Asia. Yet despite their contributions to the \neconomy, women make up 60 percent of the world's working poor, \nstruggling to survive on less than one dollar a day. They are too often \nplaced in situations of informal employment--temporary or part-time \npositions that do not offer a formal salary or benefits. We must ensure \nthat all girls and women have access to educational opportunities that \ncan lead to employment at an adequate wage, and that women receive fair \ncompensation for labor performed outside a traditional workplace \nsetting.\n  It has been more than a decade since I traveled to Beijing for the \nFourth World Conference on Women. This week, the Commission on the \nStatus of Women at the United Nations is convening to evaluate the \nprogress we have made in achieving the goals we set at that time. We \nmust work to ensure that the commitments we made then become reality \nnow. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress and \ncounterparts in other governments to create a world in which every \nwoman is treated with respect and dignity, every boy and girl is loved \nand cared for equally, and every family has the hope of a strong and \nstable future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1884-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             IRANIAN WOMEN\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that \nresonates with all Americans, especially today--a day when the entire \nworld celebrates International Women's Day, It is important to raise \nthe issue of the oppression of women, in hope that public awareness \nwill change these practices and this prejudice.\n  I would like to specifically raise awareness of the plight of women \nin the Islamic Republic of Iran. In Iran, women are considered to be \nworth a half of a man and have extremely limited rights. It is the \npolicy of the Government of Iran to deny women the opportunities that \nmen are afforded.\n  The current Iranian Government has rescinded laws that were \nimplemented prior to the revolution regarding women's legal rights. \nThis initiative against women's rights was justified by an edict that \nlaws in conflict with Sharia Law had to be abolished. The edict \nresulted in a new set of restrictive laws for women.\n  Women in Iran are severely oppressed, and their ability to speak out \nagainst current conditions is limited. While they can speak out, they \nface certain punishment for doing so. There are many examples of \nIranian women, young and old, who have spoken out against the lack of \nopportunity for women in Iran. For example, Elham Afroutan is a 19-\nyear-old Iranian journalist who was arrested a few months ago because \nof an op-ed she wrote in a newspaper. She is now imprisoned in Tehran, \nand it has been reported that she has been brutally raped and tortured. \nElham's parents have only heard from her a couple of times, and the \nIranian Government has refused to give any updates on her condition.\n  Also of importance is the case of Zahra Kazemi, the 54-year-old \nIranian and Canadian journalist, who was arrested for photographing a \ndemonstration outside Tehran's Evin prison. It is reported that while \nimprisoned, Zahra was tortured, raped, and later murdered. The Iranian \nGovernment later claimed that she committed suicide. The doctor who \nexamined Zahra's body later determined that she died as a result of the \nbeating and torture that she endured while imprisoned. After Zahra's \nfamily demanded an autopsy of her body, it was later discovered that \nthe Iranian Government had injected Zahra's body with various chemicals \nso as to destroy her body and any evidence against her attackers.\n  This oppression of Iranian women, and all women around the world, \nmust end. Never should a woman feel afraid to walk out of her home, \nspeak up, or voice her opinion. Never should a woman have less of an \nopportunity than a man.\n  People around the world today, on International Women's Day, must \nunite behind one cause--equality, justice, and opportunity for all \nwomen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1884-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE FIVE-SEVEN PISTOL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Five-Seven handgun, manufactured by the \nBelgian firearms company FN Herstal, was reportedly designed to provide \nmilitary and law enforcement personnel with a small, lightweight, and \naccurate pistol that was powerful enough to kill or seriously injure \nenemies wearing body armor. A January 2000 cover article in the popular \nAmerican Handgunner magazine profiled the handgun and predicted that, \nfor obvious reasons, ``neither the gun nor the ammunition will ever be \nsold to civilians.'' Unfortunately, the American Handgunner article was \nwrong and FN Herstal made the Five-Seven pistol available to private \nbuyers in 2004. These high-powered firearms clearly have no sporting \npurpose and pose a great threat to the lives of our law enforcement \nofficers.\n  According to the FN Herstal website, the Five-Seven weighs less than \n2 pounds fully loaded and measures only 8.2 inches in length, making it \neasily concealable. A statement which previously appeared on the \nwebsite boasted ``Enemy personnel, even wearing body armor can be \neffectively engaged up to 200 meters. Kevlar helmets and vests as well \nas the CRISAT protection will be penetrated.'' This statement has since \nbeen removed.\n  Ballistics tests conducted by the American Handgunner for their \nJanuary 2000 article provided evidence of the armor-piercing \ncapabilities of the Five-Seven pistol. In the tests, ammunition fired \nby the Five-Seven successfully pierced level IIA Kevlar body armor and \npenetrated 6 inches into ballistics testing gelatin behind it. \nAccording to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, level IIA \nKevlar body armor is the kind commonly worn by law enforcement \nofficers.\n  The already lethal nature of the Five-Seven handgun was amplified \nwhen Congress failed to renew the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, allowing it \nto expire on September 14, 2004. Among other things, Congress's \ninaction resulted in the legalization of previously banned high-\ncapacity magazines, including the 20 round clip currently sold with the \nFive-Seven.\n  The law enforcement community is rightfully concerned about the Five-\nSeven's ability to kill law enforcement personnel, even while they are \nwearing protective body armor. Last year, a coalition of law \nenforcement groups including the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the \nNational Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives issued a \nwarning to their members about the threat posed by Five-Seven handguns.\n  Bernard Thompson, director of the National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives, warned regarding the Five-Seven:\n\n       No one is safe from a weapon like this. Police body armor \n     won't offer protection if a criminal has this pistol.\n\n  In addition, the legislative director of the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, Steve Lenkhart, called the Five-Seven \n``an assault rifle that fits in your pocket.''\n  In response to concerns raised by law enforcement officials and \nothers, Senator Lautenberg, introduced the Protect Law Enforcement \nArmor Act on March 3, 2005. Among other things, this legislation would \nprohibit the sale of the Five-Seven pistol and its ammunition to \nprivate buyers in the U.S. Unfortunately, despite the continuing threat \nposed by this high-powered pistol to our law enforcement officers, \nSenator Lautenberg's legislation has yet to receive any consideration \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee in the year since it was introduced.\n  We should not ignore the concerns of our law enforcement officers \nwith regard to the Five-Seven pistol and other military-style firearms. \nCongress should take up and pass commonsense legislation banning the \nsale of these dangerous weapons because of the threat they pose to the \nsafety of our communities and those who work so hard each day to \nprotect them.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1885-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1885-S1887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n              REPEAL OF MEDICAID VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, we must enact my legislation, S. 2305, to \nrepeal a provision in the Deficit Reduction Act that will require \npeople applying or reapplying for Medicaid to verify their citizenship \nwith a U.S. passport or birth certificate. Congress must act to repeal \nthis shortsighted policy before it goes into effect July 1, 2006, \nbecause it will create barriers to health care, is unnecessary, and \nwill be an administrative burden to implement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional letters of \nsupport for S. 2305 from the California Immigrant Welfare \nCollaborative, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los \nAngeles, the National Health Law Program, Families USA, the Children's \nDefense Fund, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople, and the American Public Health Association, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              California Immigrant\n\n\n                                        Welfare Collaborative,\n\n                                Sacramento, CA, February 16, 2006.\n     Senator Daniel Kahikina Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The California Immigrant Welfare \n     Collaborative (CIWC) is a statewide partnership of four \n     immigrant rights organizations: Asian Pacific American Legal \n     Center of Southern California, Coalition for Humane Immigrant \n     Rights of Los Angeles, National Immigration Law Center and \n     Services, Immigrant Rights and Education Network of San Jose. \n     We work directly in communities as well as with policy makers \n     in order to respond to changes in health and welfare laws and \n     to advocate for low-income immigrants.\n       We are writing in support of your Senate bill to amend \n     title XIX of the Social Security Act to repeal the amendments \n     made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requiring \n     documentation evidencing citizenship or nationality as a \n     condition for receipt of medical assistance under the \n     Medicaid program. This provision would apply to all current \n     beneficiaries and future applicants, allowing no exceptions, \n     even for those with serious mental or physical disabilities \n     such as Alzheimer's disease or those who lack documents due \n     to homelessness or a disaster such as Hurricane Katrina. \n     About 49 million U.S.-born citizens (and two million \n     naturalized citizens) who are covered by Medicaid over the \n     course of a year would be required to submit these documents \n     or forfeit their health insurance coverage. New Medicaid \n     applicants also would have to meet this requirement.\n       According to a recent survey conducted by the Center on \n     Budget and Policy Priorities and by the Opinion Research \n     Corporation the new requirement could have large consequences \n     on the health insurance coverage of millions of low-income \n     U.S. citizens. Key findings from the survey include:\n       About one in every twelve (8 percent) U.S.-born adults age \n     18 or older who have incomes below $25,000 report they do not \n     have a U.S. passport or U.S. birth certificate in their \n     possession. Applying this percentage to the number of adult \n     citizens covered by Medicaid over the course of a year \n     indicates that approximately 1.7 million U.S.-born adults who \n     are covered by Medicaid could lose their health insurance \n     because of the new requirement or experience delays in \n     obtaining coverage as they attempt to secure these documents.\n       More than one tenth of U.S.-born adults with children who \n     have incomes below $25,000 reported they did not have a birth \n     certificate or passport for at least one of their children. \n     This indicates that between 1.4 and 2.9 million children \n     enrolled in Medicaid appear not to have the paperwork \n     required.\n       Taken together, the survey indicates that Medicaid coverage \n     could be in jeopardy for 3.2 to 4.6 million U.S.-born \n     citizens because they do not have a U.S. passport or birth \n     certificate readily available.\n       Some types of citizens would shoulder a greater risk of \n     losing Medicaid than others because they are less likely to \n     have the required documents. While 5.7 percent of all adults \n     in the survey (i.e., adults at all income levels) reported \n     they lack these documents, the percentage was larger for \n     certain groups: African American adults: 9 percent; Senior \n     citizens 65 or older: 7 percent; Adults without a high school \n     diploma: 9 percent; Adults living in rural areas: 9 percent.\n       These data and earlier research also suggest that elderly \n     African Americans with low incomes may experience particular \n     difficulties because a significant number of them were never \n     issued birth certificates.\n       These results are conservative as many of those who would \n     be most likely to experience difficulty in securing these \n     documents--such as nursing-home residents, Katrina survivors \n     living in temporary facilities, and homeless people--were not \n     represented in the survey. Had the survey included such \n     people, the percentage of people likely to be harmed by the \n     requirement would almost certainly have been found to be \n     higher.\n       In California, birth certificates cost $17 and require a \n     notarized application, or sworn statement under penalty of \n     perjury. In addition to the added expense of notarizing, an \n     additional $25-$50 depending on the ability of often-\n     unscrupulous notaries to charge, making people swear under \n     penalty of perjury is intimidating and will discourage people \n     from applying. It takes four to six months to obtain birth \n     certificates for newborns and if obtained in person, require \n     travel to a different office than for duplicate copies that \n     might be needed for adults or other children who need them. \n     We see no flexibility in the amendments as passed to allow \n     for families with no disposable income to obtain the birth \n     certificates timely.\n       We understand that the new requirement for documentation in \n     Medicaid is intended to prevent undocumented immigrants from \n     declaring they are citizens and obtaining Medicaid benefits. \n     The HHS Inspector General however found no substantial \n     evidence that this is occurring. Instead, the principal \n     effect of the provision would likely be to endanger health-\n     care coverage for millions of poor U.S. citizens, because \n     substantial numbers of native-born citizens do not have a \n     passport or birth certificate readily available. We also \n     anticipate the provision will add yet another barrier and \n     have a chilling effect on the many immigrants who are \n     federally eligible for Medicaid but may get turned away due \n     to confusion in the rules when this is implemented in all 50 \n     states.

Akaka,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka, The National Health Law Program (NHeLP) \n     supports the repeal of Section 6036 of the Deficit Reduction \n     Act. This section requires documentation evidencing \n     citizenship or nationality as a condition of receipt of \n     Medicaid. The arbitrary and unnecessary documentation \n     requirements embedded in Section 6036 will adversely and \n     disproportionately deny medical care to elderly, minority, \n     and rural U.S. citizens.\n       Currently, citizens are allowed to self-declare their \n     citizenship under penalty of perjury when they apply for \n     Medicaid. Proponents of Section 6036 suggest the provision \n     will prevent immigrants from falsely obtaining Medicaid by \n     claiming they are citizens. Yet the Office of the Inspector \n     General of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     conducted a comprehensive review of this subject and did not \n     recommend new documentation requirements such as those \n     contained in Section 3145, and the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid Services concurred in that judgment.\n       Rather, to the extent that Section 6036 would produce cost \n     savings, it would do so by denying desperately needed health \n     care coverage to many of this country's neediest native-born \n     citizens, especially those who are African American, Native \n     American, elderly and/or born in rural areas. For example, a \n     study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted \n     that approximately 1.7 million adult citizens and 1.4 to 2.9 \n     million citizen children on Medicaid do not have a passport \n     or birth certificate available at home. Some of these \n     individuals cannot get a birth certificate because they were \n     not born in hospitals. For example, a 1950 study found that \n     one out of five African Americans lacked a birth \n     registration. And the difficultly of obtaining the \n     documentation, especially for those with mental disabilities, \n     will effectively preclude eligible individuals from enrolling \n     in Medicaid.\n       Even without its likely discriminatory impact, Section 6036 \n     represents bad policy. Adding new paperwork requirements \n     imposes unnecessary delays at a time when many need prompt \n     medical coverage. Individuals could face long delays in \n     getting birth certificates due to the high volume of requests \n     that state vital statistics offices will need to field. \n     Further, Section 6036 effectively creates an application fee \n     for Medicaid--a passport currently costs $97.00; copies of a \n     birth certificate can cost $5 to $23. As a result, native-\n     born citizens poor enough to qualify for Medicaid will often \n     be too poor to prove that they qualify because they cannot \n     afford the required documentation.\n       We applaud your introduction of a bill to repeal Section \n     6036. Please feel free to contact Mara Youdelman at 202-289-\n     7661 if you would like to discuss this or any other issue \n     about which we may be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Laurence M. Lavin,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Feb. 21, 2006.\n     Senator Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: Families USA thanks you for introducing \n     S. 2305, a bill that would remove provisions requiring \n     Medicaid recipients to prove their citizenship by producing a \n     passport or birth certificate, and we hope to see your \n     proposed bill enacted into law.\n       We are concerned that increasing documentation requirements \n     to access Medicaid would wrongfully block many native-born \n     American citizens and legal immigrants that qualify for \n     Medicaid from enrolling. In fact, 5.7% of all adults at all \n     income levels report that they lack birth certificates or \n     passports, and that number is even higher for African-\n     Americans, senior citizens, Americans residing in rural \n     areas, and foster children. The Center on Budget and Policy \n     Priorities estimates that more than 51 million individuals \n     would be burdened by having to produce this additional \n     documentation. If the documentation provisions are not \n     repealed, then otherwise eligible beneficiaries would be \n     unable to prove their own citizenship and therefore be forced \n     to go without health care, adding to our nation's already \n     burgeoning pool of 46 million uninsured.\n       The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services concluded that no evidence exists \n     that shows that immigrants are enrolling in Medicaid by \n     claiming to be U.S. citizens. Since government officials \n     investigating the matter concluded that there is no problem, \n     and since enacting any provisions that would require \n     beneficiaries to show more documents would cost millions of \n     dollars in increased administrative expenses to a number of \n     government agencies, Families USA believes policies calling \n     for more documentation to be neither prudent nor responsible \n     uses of taxpayers' dollars.\n       Denying Medicaid to some of our Nation's neediest citizens \n     in order to chase the phantom problem of illegal immigrants \n     dubiously enrolling in Medicaid is an unacceptable \n     inefficiency that will increase the tax burden on hard-\n     working Americans. We appreciate your insight in correcting \n     such a deficient policy and support your proposed \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I am writing to offer the support of \n     the Children's Defense Fund for your bill, S. 2305, to repeal \n     one of the harmful amendments made to Title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. We support \n     the elimination of the new requirement that U.S. citizens \n     eligible for Medicaid must confirm their citizenship by \n     submitting a birth certificate or passport (or other \n     naturalization papers) to receive Medicaid.\n       This harmful and unnecessary provision will deny health \n     care to millions of children and adults who need it to \n     address their health and mental health needs and who are \n     legally entitled to it. A recent survey conducted by the \n     Opinion Research Corporation indicates that between 1.4 and \n     2.9 million children could lose their Medicaid coverage \n     because their U.S. born parents do not have birth \n     certificates or passports for them. In California and Texas, \n     just two of the states where CDF has offices, it is estimated \n     that as many as 11 million individuals could be denied health \n     care because of this requirement.\n       While this provision was intended to prevent immigrants who \n     are not eligible for Medicaid from receiving it illegally, \n     the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Office \n     of the Inspector General agree that there is no substantial \n     evidence that immigrants are attempting to obtain Medicaid by \n     falsely attesting to their citizenship.\n       S. 2305 will help spare children and adults, who need \n     health and mental health care, from having to navigate \n     through additional red tape to receive benefits from the \n     Medicaid program. We applaud your effort to take a step \n     forward in making affordable health care available to those \n     who need it.\n       The Children's Defense Fund looks forward to working with \n     you to ensure that all children receive health care without \n     the unwanted burden of producing unnecessary documentation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marian Wright Edelman.\n                                  ____\n\n         Washington Bureau, National Association for the \n           Advancement of Colored People,\n                                   Washington, DC, March, 3, 2006.\n     Re NAACP support for S. 1580, the Healthcare Equality and \n         Accountability Act\n\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka. On behalf of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), our nation's \n     oldest, largest and most widely-recognized grassroots civil \n     rights organization, I am writing to let you know that at our \n     recent Annual Meeting we passed a resolution expressing our \n     strong support of S. 1580, the Healthcare Equality and \n     Accountability Act.\n       The fact of the matter is that huge discrepancies remain in \n     health care in the United States today. The quality and \n     quantity of health care services you receive depends greatly \n     upon your racial or ethnic background, the make-up and \n     location of the\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\n     community in which you live, and your economic status. \n     Currently, one seventh of all Americans, 42 million people, \n     lack insurance and suffer unnecessary illness and premature \n     death; a disparate number of these people are racial or \n     ethnic minority Americans.\n       Despite being first in spending, the World Health \n     Organization has ranked the United States 37th among all \n     nations in terms of meeting the health care needs of its \n     people. Furthermore, despite the numerous advances that have \n     been made in health care over the decades, racial and ethnic \n     minority Americans continue to suffer disproportionately from \n     many severe health problems and have higher mortality rates \n     than whites for many treatable health conditions. Diabetes \n     strikes African Americans 70% more often than Caucasian \n     Americans; Hispanic Americans twice as often as whites; the \n     diabetes rate for Native Americans is even higher. striking \n     members of this community 180% more often than Caucasian \n     Americans. African Americans are 40% more likely to die from \n     coronary heart disease and 35% more likely to die from cancer \n     than Caucasian Americans.\n       It is because of these glaring disparities, the NAACP \n     strongly supports the efforts of the Congressional Black \n     Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the \n     Congressional Asian/Pacific Islander Caucus to address these \n     problems with the introduction of comprehensive legislation \n     which expands health care access, improves health care \n     quality, strengthens key academic institutions and research \n     centers, and bolsters the health care infrastructure in \n     underserved communities.\n       Given the importance of this legislation, and the NAACP's \n     historic mission to eliminate racial disparities wherever \n     they exist and to promote affordable, adequate health care \n     among racial and ethnic minorities it is our honor, as well \n     as our duty as some might argue, to support this legislation \n     in the strongest terms possible. Thus the NAACP is committed \n     to using all of our available resources to see this bill's \n     quick enactment.\n       Thank you for your leadership in this area: I look forward \n     to working with you toward our common goal. Should you have \n     any questions, please feel free to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Hilary O. Shelton,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                           Health Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the American Public Health \n     Association (APHA), the oldest, largest and most diverse \n     organization of public health professionals in the world, \n     dedicated to protecting all Americans and their communities \n     from preventable, serious health threats and assuring \n     community-based health promotion and disease prevention \n     activities and preventive health services are universally \n     accessible in the United States, I write in support of S. \n     2305. This legislation would repeal the provision of the \n     Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that would require \n     documentation evidencing citizenship or nationality as a \n     condition for being enrolled in the Medicaid program.\n       APHA strongly supports efforts to reverse the cuts and \n     changes to the Medicaid program included in the Deficit \n     Reduction Act of 2005 that jeopardize the health of our \n     nation's most vulnerable, including Medicaid beneficiaries. \n     Several Medicaid reforms included in the bill have unintended \n     and severe consequences and will not result in the projected \n     cost savings. Of note is the provision in the legislation \n     that requires individuals to present citizenship or residency \n     documentation in order to enroll in the Medicaid program. \n     Although not its intent, this provision is expected to have a \n     devastating impact on the health coverage and status of \n     native-born citizens who are in every way eligible for the \n     Medicaid program.\n       Citizenship and verification requirements in Medicaid and \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program have been \n     proven to reduce enrollment in the programs among the \n     eligible population. The provision included in the Deficit \n     Reduction Act of 2005 that would require individuals to \n     present documentation proving citizenship or nationality in \n     order to enroll in the Medicaid program is expected to cause \n     thousands of Medicaid beneficiaries who are native-born \n     citizens but do not have a birth certificate or passport in \n     their possession to join the country's uninsured ranks. This \n     provision will likely exacerbate existing racial/ethnic and \n     rural/urban health disparities, as it is expected to \n     disproportionately affect elderly African Americans, \n     individuals residing in rural areas and Katrina survivors, \n     many of whom were not born in a hospital or lost such \n     documentation during Hurricane Katrina or other life \n     tragedies. Also, Medicaid beneficiaries and applicants with \n     mental disorders will likely be adversely affected, as the \n     provision did not include exceptions for any populations, \n     including those with severe physical or mental impairments \n     such as Alzheimer's disease.\n       Therefore, there is the need to now take a vital step to \n     protect the public's health and repeal this harmful provision \n     included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. We thank you \n     for taking a leadership role in doing so, and look forward to \n     working with you as this legislation moves forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Georges C. Benjamin,\n     Executive Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1887-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LIHEAP FUNDING\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has finally \npassed legislation to help hard-working families that have been \ngrappling with skyrocketing energy costs for far too long. My \ncolleagues from Maine and Rhode Island, Senators Snowe and Reed, have \nworked diligently to get LIHEAP legislation to the Senate floor and I \nthank them for their commitment. I must note, however, that the funding \napproved by the Senate yesterday is too little, too late. As we move \nforward with the appropriations process for fiscal year 2007, I will be \nurging my colleagues to fund the LIHEAP program at its fully authorized \nlevel so that next year my constituents don't again find themselves \nstruggling to pay record heating bills while Congress turns a blind \neye.\n  I would also like to respond to some of the concerns that I have \nheard a handful of my colleagues make during debate on whether we \nshould increase the amount of LIHEAP funding available. A few members \nhave spoken about the problem of earmarks and the need for responsible \nGovernment spending. I share concerns over earmarking and welcome the \nopportunity to work together on this issue so that we can look the \npublic in the face and say that their tax dollars are being spent on \nthe most meritorious projects. Increasing LIHEAP funding is not about \nearmarks--it is about helping our citizens with immediate and urgent \nneeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1887-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1887-S1888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AVIAN INFLUENZA IN AFRICA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the avian influenza, H5N1, virus has \nrecently been detected for the first time in Nigeria. International \nhealth officials have long warned about the potential danger of avian \nflu spreading throughout the African continent, and it appears we are \nnow one step closer to this danger becoming a reality.\n  While the threat of avian influenza is global, and needs to be \naddressed here in the United States, it is of particular concern in \nAfrica. Many governments in Africa are unequipped to effectively deal \nwith an outbreak, which requires early detection, quarantining, and \nculling of affected bird populations. And although there are no reports \nyet of humans contracting the disease in Nigeria, recent cases in \nTurkey and Iraq underscore the danger for people who live in close \nproximity to poultry, as is the case throughout much of Africa. In \nareas where birds, livestock, and people are in close contact, the risk \nof the virus mutating into a strain that can be transmitted between \nhumans is increased. Additionally, immunocompromised individuals may be \nmore susceptible to the disease, and it is unclear what effect avian \ninfluenza could have on populations already ravaged by HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria, and other diseases. Finally, the already overburdened or \nunderdeveloped health infrastructure in much of Africa may find itself \nunable to cope with a pandemic.\n  Avian flu is an international danger to which no country in the world \nis immune. While much attention has been paid to the problem in Asia, I \nam concerned that the international community has not prepared \nsufficiently for an outbreak in Africa. Particularly worrisome is the \namount of time it apparently took for the outbreak in Nigeria--a member \nof the recently formed West African Network on Avian Influenza, and \npresumably better prepared than many other African nations to deal with \nthe threat of avian influenza--to be reported to international health \nauthorities.\n  It is essential that the administration develop a plan for managing a \nwide-scale outbreak of avian influenza in Africa, as well as developing \ncontingency plans relating to the impact that an outbreak of avian \ninfluenza may have diplomatically, economically, and security-wise in \neach major region of the continent. I also urge the administration to \ndevelop plans to support organizations like the African Union to \ndevelop information-sharing mechanisms and a clearinghouse of \ninformation related to initial reporting, initial impact, mitigation \nefforts, and management mechanisms to prevent the spread of the virus, \nbeyond the initial efforts that have been made through\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nthe International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza.\n  Additionally, the administration should identify particularly \nvulnerable regions or countries, and provide detailed plans for how the \ninternational community can support efforts in these regions or \ncountries through both bilateral and multilateral mechanisms to help \nmitigate or alleviate the potential impact of avian flu.\n  Assisting the countries of Africa in preventing more widespread \ntransmission of the deadly H5N1 virus should be a critical priority. It \nis in the interest of millions of the world most vulnerable populations \nin some of the poorest countries, and it is also in our interest that \nwe help prepare regions like Africa to head off a humanitarian tragedy \nthat could easily spread to our own backyards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1888-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CHILDREN AND MEDIA RESEARCH ADVANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Enzi and Senator \nKennedy for placing S. 1902, the Children and Media Research \nAdvancement Act CAMRA, on the calendar today. I appreciate their \ncommitment to the health and welfare of children. I also want to thank \nthe co-sponsors of this bill, Senators Lieberman, Brownback, Santorum, \nBayh, and Durbin for being such leaders on this issue, and my fellow \nSenators on the HELP Committee for their support for this legislation. \nIn addition, I thank two groups, Common Sense Media and Children Now, \nfor raising awareness of the effect media has on children's \ndevelopment. And finally, I express thanks to two researchers, Dr. \nMichael Rich of the Center for Media and Child Health at Harvard \nUniversity Medical School, and Dr. Sandy Calvert of the Children's \nDigital Media Center at Georgetown University. Both Dr. Rich and Dr. \nCalvert have been great advocates for CAMRA. I thank them for sharing \ntheir expertise and support.\n  Last year the Kaiser Family Foundation released a report showing \ndramatic changes in the way young people consume media, and confirming \nthat children use electronic media an extraordinary amount. On average, \nchildren are spending 45 hours a week--more than a full-time job--with \nmedia.\n  Young people today are not just watching television or playing video \ngames, they are increasingly ``media multi-tasking,'' using more than \none medium at a time and packing a growing volume of media content into \neach day. According to Kaiser, a full quarter of the time children are \nusing media, they are using more than one type at once.\n  This new pattern of media consumption presents twin challenges. \nParents face new obstacles to monitoring their children's media \nconsumption. And children are exposed to a media environment with an \nunknown impact.\n  That is why the CAMRA Act--the Children and the Media Research \nAdvancement Act--is so important. This bill will create a single, \ncoordinated research program at the Center for Disease Control. It will \nstudy the impact of electronic media on children's--including very \nyoung children and infants'--cognitive, social and physical \ndevelopment.\n  The CAMRA Act will help answer critical questions about the myriad \neffects media has on childhood development. One area we need to look at \nparticularly is the effect of exposure to media on infants. Research \ntells us that the earliest years of a child's life are among the most \nsignificant for his or her brain development. But we need to know what \nforms of media--if any--contribute to healthy brain development for \nbabies. Is it OK to put a baby down in front of the TV? Are videos \nhelpful or harmful when it comes to children's cognitive and emotional \ndevelopment? Today we don't know.\n  In December the Kaiser Foundation published a report finding ``no \npublished studies on cognitive outcomes from any of the educational \nvideos, computer software programs, or video game systems currently on \nthe market for children ages 0-6.'' These products are more and more \npopular. You can see them marketed to new parents everywhere. We should \nknow what their effect is on young children and infants.\n  The CAMRA Act will also spur research on the effect of media on \nchildren's physical development. Since 1980, the proportion of \noverweight children has doubled and the rate for adolescents has \ntripled. During that same time period, the number of advertisements for \nunhealthy food that children see annually has exploded.\n  In the 1970s, children saw 20,000 commercials a year. Today, they see \n40,000. Is this a coincidence or is there a direct link? We need \nanswers to these questions. In December, the Institute of Medicine \ncalled for ``sustained, multidisciplinary work on how marketing \ninfluences the food and beverage choices of children and youth.'' CAMRA \nwill help get us there.\n  The bill I introduced with Senators Lieberman, Brownback, Santorum, \nBayh, and Durbin included pilot projects to look at the effect of media \non young children, and to look at food marketing and obesity. Although \nthose projects were not included in this manager's package, I continue \nto be very pleased with the bill. It's a step forward for children. And \nI look forward to working with my colleagues in other venues to ensure \nthat the pilot projects get done.\n  But CAMRA is just one step. We need to do more so children grow up in \na safe media environment. In December Senators Lieberman, Bayh, and I \nintroduced S. 2126, the Family Entertainment Protection Act, which \nwould prevent children from buying and renting ultra violent and \npornographic video games.\n  There is enough research out there now to show conclusively that \nplaying violent video games has a negative effect on youth. We know \nthat these games are damaging to children. We need to take the decision \nto buy them out of the hands of children and put that decision back in \nthe hands of parents. That is what S. 2126 would do, and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues in the Senate to move that bill.\n  I am so pleased that we are taking this step forward today with \nCAMRA, and I am hopeful that it will be speedily approved by the full \nSenate. It is one step to ensure that children in America grow up \nsafely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1888-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1888-S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDIES\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I take this time to draw to the \nattention of my colleagues a significant report, released on February \n9, 2006 in Washington, DC, by the Committee for Economic Development, \nCED, a group of some 200 business leaders and several university \npresidents.\n  The CED statement, ``Education for Global Leadership: The Importance \nof International Studies and Foreign Language Education for U.S. \nEconomic and National Security'', asserts that the United States will \nbe less competitive in the global economy because of a shortage of \nstrong foreign language and international studies programs in our \ncolleges and high schools and warns, too, that the lack of Americans \neducated in foreign languages and cultures is hampering efforts to \ncounter terrorist threats.\n  The cochairs of the CED subcommittee that produced the report are \nCharles E.M. Kolb, President of CED; Alfred T. Mockett, CED trustee, \nformer chairman and CEO, CGI-AMS, Inc.; and another CED trustee, Dr. \nJohn Brademas, president emeritus of New York University and former \nMember--1959-1981--of the U.S. House of Representatives from Indiana.\n  Dr. Brademas brought long and distinguished experience to his \nresponsibilities as cochair of the CED subcommittee. A member of the \nHouse of Representatives from 1959 to 1981, he served throughout those \nyears on the House Committee on Education and Labor and for 10 years \nchaired its Select Subcommittee on Education. He played a major role in \nwriting the landmark education legislation of that period, including \nthe Elementary and Secondary School Act and the Higher Education Act, \nand he was the author of the International Education Act of 1966.\n  The recommendations in the CED Report include teaching international \ncontent across the curriculum and at all levels of learning, to expand \nAmerican students' knowledge of other countries and cultures; expanding \nthe training pipeline at every level of education to address the \npaucity of Americans fluent in strategic languages, especially \ncritical, less commonly taught languages; national leaders--political\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nleaders as well as the business and philanthropic communities and the \nmedia--should educate the public about the importance of improving \neducation in languages other than English and in international studies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe remarks of Dr. Brademas on the CED report, ``Education for Global \nLeadership.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Education for Global Leadership: The Importance of International \n Studies and Foreign Language Education for U.S. Economic and National \n        Security: of CED, the Committee for Economic Development\n\n       The opportunity to serve as a co-chair of the Subcommittee \n     of the Committee for Economic Development (CED) that produced \n     a report entitled, Education for Global Leadership: The \n     Importance of International Studies and Foreign Language \n     Education for U.S. Economic and National Security, has \n     enabled me to champion anew what has been a passion of mine \n     from childhood.\n       Son of a Greek immigrant father and a Scots-English-Irish \n     mother, I read a book in elementary school in Indiana about \n     the Mayas, decided I wanted to become a Mayan archaeologist, \n     started learning Spanish, as a highschooler hitchhiked to \n     Mexico, as a Harvard undergraduate spent a summer working \n     with Aztec Indians in rural Mexico, wrote my college honors \n     essay on a Mexican peasant movement and, four years later, at \n     Oxford University, my Ph.D. dissertation on the anarchist \n     movement in Spain.\n       Although I studied anarchism, I did not practice it! In \n     1958 I was first elected to Congress, and then ten times \n     reelected, serving, therefore, for twenty-two years.\n       In 1961, as a member of the House Committee on Education \n     and Labor, I visited Argentina to study how colleges and \n     universities in Latin America could contribute to President \n     Kennedy's ``Alliance for Progress''.\n       I made other trips to Latin America--Cuba, Peru, Panama, \n     Colombia, Venezuela--honing my Spanish and learning more \n     about the Spanish-speaking Americas.\n       In 1981 I became president of New York University, where, \n     two years later, I awarded an honorary degree to King Juan \n     Carlos I of Spain, announced a professorship in his name and \n     in 1997, in the presence of Their Majesties, the King and \n     Queen Sofia, and of the then First Lady of the United States, \n     now Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, dedicated the King Juan \n     Carlos I of Spain Center at NYU for the study of the \n     economics, history and politics of modern Spain.\n       All this was the result of my having, in South Bend, \n     Indiana, read a book about the Mayas when I was a schoolboy!\n       So I know what early exposure to another culture, another \n     country, another language has meant in my own life.\n\n\n                  international education act of 1966\n\n       Indeed, while in Congress, I wrote the International \n     Education Act of 1966, to provide grants to colleges and \n     universities in the United States for the study of other \n     countries and cultures. President Lyndon Johnson signed the \n     bill into law but Congress failed to appropriate the funds to \n     implement it.\n       And I believe that among the reasons--I do not say the only \n     one--the United States suffered such loss of lives and \n     treasure in Vietnam and does now in Iraq is ignorance--\n     ignorance of the cultures, histories and languages of those \n     societies.\n       I add that the tragedies of 9/11, Madrid, London, Bali and \n     Baghdad must bring home to us as Americans the imperative, as \n     a matter of our national security, of learning more about the \n     world of Islam.\n       Here I note that only one year ago, the US Department of \n     Defense, recalling the launch by the Soviet Union of Sputnik \n     in 1957, brought together leaders from government, the \n     academy and language associations to produce a ``call to \n     action for national foreign language capabilities''. There \n     was then--and still is--particular concern about our lack of \n     Arabic speakers.\n       But it is not only for reasons of national security that we \n     must learn more about countries and cultures other than our \n     own. Such knowledge is indispensable, too, to America's \n     economic strength and competitive position in the world.\n       The marketplace has now become global. Modern technology--\n     the Internet, for example--has made communication and travel \n     possible on a worldwide basis. In the last few years, I \n     myself have visited Spain, England, Greece, Jordan, Morocco, \n     Cuba, Kazakhstan, Japan, Turkey and Vietnam.\n       New York Times columnist Tom Friedman has eloquently \n     spelled out the impact of globalization on culture, politics, \n     science and history in his book, The World Is Flat.\n\n\n                         global studies at nyu\n\n       Reflecting on my commitment to international education, \n     during my presidency of NYU, my colleagues and I established \n     a Center for Japan-U.S. Business & Economic Studies, a Casa \n     Italiana Zerilli-Marimo, Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies, \n     the Eric Maria Remarque Institute for European studies, \n     Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, and King \n     Juan Carlos I of Spain Center, and we are now planning a \n     Center for Dialogue with the Islamic world.\n       I add that NYU also has campuses abroad--in London, Paris, \n     Florence, Madrid, Prague and now, Ghana. The Institute of \n     International Education reported a few weeks ago that in \n     2003-04, NYU sent more students to study abroad than any \n     other American college or university. And next fall, NYU will \n     offer a study abroad site in Shanghai, the first for a large \n     American university there.\n       I call your attention in this respect to the report issued \n     last year, Global Competence and National Needs: One Million \n     Americans Studying Abroad. Produced by the Commission on the \n     Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program.\n       The report calls for sending one million students from the \n     United States to study abroad annually in a decade.\n       I add that New York University ranks fifth on the list for \n     hosting students from other countries.\n       I continue to be deeply dedicated to international \n     education at the college and university level.\n       But I do not think we should wait until students go to \n     college to begin learning about other countries and learning \n     languages other than English.\n       We should start in grade school and, where possible, even \n     at the pre-school level.\n       Now if as a Member of Congress and as president of New York \n     University, I pressed for more study of other countries, \n     cultures and languages, I continued--and continue--to do so \n     wearing other hats.\n       Appointed, by President Clinton, chairman of the \n     President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, which \n     in 1997 produced a report, Creative America, with \n     recommendations for generating more support, public and \n     private, for these two fields in American life, I was pleased \n     that our Committee recommended that our ``schools and \n     colleges . . . place greater emphasis on international \n     studies and the history, languages and cultures of other \n     nations.''\n       President Clinton and then First Lady Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton accepted our Committee's recommendation to hold a \n     White House Conference on ``Culture and Diplomacy''.\n\n\n                    national endowment for democracy\n\n       As for seven years, chairman of the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, the federally financed agency that makes grants to \n     private groups struggling to build democracy in countries \n     where it does not exist, I had another exposure to the \n     imperative of knowing about other countries and cultures.\n       I continue that interest through service on the US-Japan \n     Foundation, US-Spain Council, World Conference of Religions \n     for Peace, Center for Democracy and Reconciliation in \n     Southeast Europe, Council for a Community of Democracies as \n     well as on the Advisory Councils of Transparency \n     International, the organization that combats corruption in \n     international business transactions, and by chairing the \n     American Ditchley Foundation, which helps plan meetings on \n     all manner of subjects at Ditchley Park, a conference center \n     outside Oxford, England.\n       I'm also vice chair of the Advisory Council of Americans \n     for UNESCO, an organization that shares our concerns today, \n     led by its president, Richard T. Arndt, veteran of the United \n     States Information Agency and author of a recent book, The \n     First Resort of Kings: American Cultural Diplomacy in the \n     Twentieth Century.\n       Last Fall I spoke in Ottawa on the fifteen anniversary of \n     the Canada-U.S. Fulbright program, and I have been asked to \n     take part this year in conferences in the Czech Republic, \n     Guatemala, Greece, Japan, Turkey and Rwanda.\n       So you will, with these words of personal background, \n     understand my enthusiasm for this CED report, and I want to \n     congratulate the other co-chairs of the Subcommittee, Charlie \n     Kolb and Alfred Mockett, as well as the CED staff who did \n     such outstanding work in preparing it--Daniel Schecter, Donna \n     Desrochers and Rachel Dunsmoor.\n\n\n                major recommendations of the ced report\n\n       Here I want only to reiterate the major recommendations of \n     our CED report:\n       1. That ``international content be taught across the \n     curriculum and at all levels of learning, to expand American \n     students' knowledge of other countries and cultures.''\n       2. That we expand ``the training pipeline at every level of \n     education to address the paucity of Americans fluent in \n     foreign languages, especially critical, less commonly taught \n     ones such as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Persian/\n     Farsi, Russian and Turkish.\n       3. That ``national leaders--political leaders, as well as \n     the business and philanthropic communities and the media--\n     educate the public about the importance of improving \n     education in foreign languages and international studies.''\n       The report we release today contains concrete proposals for \n     action, especially for programs financed by the Federal \n     Government, with specific recommendations for appropriations \n     to implement our proposals.\n       Here I want to make a crucial point. We must put our money \n     where our recommendations are!\n       I reiterate that the failure of Congress forty years ago to \n     vote the funds to carry out the provisions of the \n     International Education Act, a measure to achieve many of the \n     purposes articulated in this CED report, meant a loss to the \n     nation we should not repeat.\n\n\n      funds for international education, foreign language studies\n\n       Accordingly, we should examine with care the budget \n     recommendations of President\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\n     Bush for Fiscal 2007 for programs to strengthen international \n     education and foreign language studies even as we must follow \n     tenaciously the response of Congress.\n       I was very pleased in this respect that last month \n     President Bush told a group of U.S. university presidents of \n     his proposal to strengthen foreign language study, \n     particularly Arabic and other critical languages.\n       The President spoke of a ``National Security Language \n     Initiative'' and asked for $114 million in Fiscal 2007 as \n     ``seed money'' to establish critical language instruction in \n     grade schools, support college-level language courses and \n     create a national corps of ``reserve'' linguists who could \n     serve in times of need.\n       Although an encouraging sign, as The New Republic said last \n     month (January 23, 2006), ``[I]t remains to be seen whether \n     the lightly funded initiative will be anything more than \n     symbolic.''\n       Now we must be sure that Congress votes even this modest \n     amount of money to carry out this promise and, indeed, do \n     much better!\n       For as the final sentence of our CED report declares, ``Our \n     national security and our economic prosperity ultimately \n     depend on how well we educate today's students to become \n     tomorrow's global leaders.''\n       Amen!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1890-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH AMERICO\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a truly \nextraordinary young student from Connecticut. Elizabeth Americo of \nGuilford has recently been selected as one of Connecticut's two \nhonorees in the 2006 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. This honor, \nis given to only one high school student and one junior high school \nstudent in each state as well as the District of Columbia. A quick look \nat Elizabeth's record of community service shows her to be truly \ndeserving of such recognition.\n  Elizabeth, who is 17 years old and a junior at Guilford High School, \nis the founder and president of Students for Health and Social Justice, \na club at her school that is dedicated to raising awareness and funds \nto assist needy people both in the United States and abroad.\n  Elizabeth was first inspired to become involved in volunteer work by \nher older brother's work with impoverished Haitians. Upon arriving at \nGuilford High School her freshman year, Elizabeth decided she wanted to \nshare her passion for helping others with her fellow students. The \nresult was Students for Health and Social Justice, which now boasts 21 \nmembers who meet regularly to discuss poverty and community health \nissues around the world and plan both awareness, and fundraising, \nevents to address these issues. With hard work, creativity, and a deep \ncommitment to helping others, the club has sponsored dances and other \nevents to help raise money for health care programs in Haiti, relief \naid for tsunami victims, UNICEF, and other causes. Elizabeth and her \nfellow club members have also not forgotten about the needy in their \nlocal community, organizing an impressive four-school-strong food drive \nfor a local soup kitchen.\n  Elizabeth's extensive record of volunteer service, done at such a \nyoung age, serves as an inspiring example to all of us about the \ndifference we can make in our communities if we are willing to put in \nthe time and energy. It is young people such as Elizabeth that give me \ngreat hope for the future of our country.\n  In recognition of her achievements, Elizabeth will be invited to \nWashington in early May with the 101 other 2006 Spirit of Community \nhonorees from across the country who were selected from a pool of \nseveral thousand nominees. While in Washington, 10 of the honorees will \nbe selected as America's top youth volunteers of the year by a \ndistinguished national selection committee cochaired by 2 of my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota and \nSenator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia.\n  I wish Elizabeth the best of luck, both with this award and in all \nher future endeavors. I would like to end my remarks, Mr. President, by \ntaking the time to thank Elizabeth Americo for the good work she has \ndone and the work I am sure she will continue to do in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1890-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING ELEANOR L. RICHARDSON\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I mourn the passing and pay \ntribute to a wonderful Georgian, a great leader, and a personal friend \nof mine. The Honorable Eleanor Richardson passed away on February 21, \n2006, leaving a tremendous void in the hearts of all who knew and loved \nthis extraordinary woman.\n  A long-time resident of Decatur, GA, she was involved in Civic \nOrganizations such as the League of Women Voters, serving as the \npresident of the Dekalb League and then the Georgia League. It was \nduring this time that a friend urged her to run for a vacant seat in \nthe Georgia General Assembly, thus beginning her memorable political \ncareer.\n  From 1975 until 1991, she served with great distinction as one of the \nfirst female members in the Georgia House of Representatives, and I was \nprivileged to serve with her for many of those years. She gained an \nimpeccable reputation as a faithful advocate for her district and a \ndetermined voice of the voiceless. Eleanor's legislative priorities \nincluded issues related to the welfare of children, women, the elderly \nand the homeless. She had an unwavering commitment to justice and \nequality.\n  Eleanor was respected by her colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nfor her determined leadership. She served on several key House \ncommittees, including the Appropriations Committee, the Health and \nEcology Committee and the State Planning and Community Affairs \nCommittee, where she served as chair of the local legislation \nsubcommittee.\n  After retiring from public office, Eleanor was appointed to the newly \nfounded Georgia Commission on Women in 1992 and served as its first \nvice chair. She remained a tireless servant to her community and to the \nState through her work on countless other boards and advocacy \norganizations. For over 45 years, she was a faithful and beloved member \nof Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church, highly active both in the \nlocal church and in her denomination.\n  Eleanor leaves behind a loving and devoted family, including her \nhusband, Merlyn Eldon Richardson; her daughter, Merlyn Richardson \nNolan; her two grandsons, Gaillard Ravenel Nolan, Jr., and Merlyn \nRichardson Nolan; and her two great-grandchildren, Hadley Jane Nolan \nand Parker Richardson Nolan.\n  This strong-willed and generous woman devoted her entire life to \nserving others, and she will always be remembered for her compassion, \nintegrity, fairness and unshakable commitment to creating a fair and \njust society. She touched the lives of many Georgians, including this \nSenator, through her efforts on behalf of our community.\n  It was an honor to know and to serve in the Georgia House with \nEleanor Richardson, and it is a privilege to be in this Senate and pay \ntribute to her great life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1890-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1890-S1891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JACK APPLEBAUM\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a truly \nextraordinary young student from Connecticut. Jack Applebaum of \nGreenwich has recently been selected as one of Connecticut's two \nhonorees in the 2006 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. This honor \nis given to only one high school student and one junior high school \nstudent from each state as well as the District of Columbia. A quick \nlook at Jack's record of community service shows him to be truly \ndeserving of such recognition.\n  Jack, who is 13 and an eighth-grader at Central Middle School in \nGreenwich, is a founding member of his school's chapter of Building \nwith Books, a national organization that raises money to build schools \nin developing countries. Jack learned about the organization and its \nmission in class and, in his own words, ``I was hooked right away.'' \nAfter learning that four-fifths of the world is illiterate, Jack \ndecided ``I wanted to make this number smaller.''\n  Instead of just talking about the problem, Jack decided to do \nsomething about it. He played a leading role in forming the Building \nwith Books chapter at Central Middle School, helping to attract members \nto the club, setting goals, and putting together fundraisers. During \nits first year, the club hosted school parties and ran an afterschool \nsnack cart that helped to raise over $4,000 to help build a school in \nMali. The club also performed other good works, such as making blankets\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\nfor children in Africa and visiting nursing home residents during the \nholidays.\n  It is really impressive, how much community service Jack has \nperformed at such a young age. I attribute this to the remarkable \nattitude he has demonstrated with his work. When Jack learned about the \nproblem of widespread illiteracy in the world, his immediate response \nwas to do something about it. He rolled up his sleeves and went to \nwork. His hard work and willingness to sacrifice his time and effort \nfor others serves as an inspiration for people of all ages. It is young \npeople such as Jack that give me such great hope in the future of our \ncountry.\n  In recognition of his achievements, Jack will be invited to \nWashington in early May with 101 other 2006 Spirit of Community \nhonorees from across the country who were selected from a pool of \nseveral thousand nominees. While in Washington, 10 of the honorees will \nbe selected as America's top youth volunteers of the year by a \ndistinguished national selection committee cochaired by 2 of my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota and \nSenator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia.\n  I wish Jack the best of luck, both with this award and in all his \nfuture endeavors. I would like to end my remarks, Mr. President, by \nthanking Jack Applebaum for the all of his volunteer service and all of \nthe volunteer service I am sure he will continue to perform in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1891-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO RONALD H. FRANCIS OF COBB COUNTY, GEORGIA\n\n   Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor in the \nRecord of the Senate my friend Ron Francis, who is a great Georgian, a \ngreat American, and a great citizen of Cobb County. I honor Ron upon \nhis retirement from the Bank of North Georgia after 37 remarkable years \nin the banking industry and for his many contributions to the quality \nof life in Cobb County, Georgia.\n  Ron received a bachelor of arts degree in sociology from Eckerd \nCollege and an MBA in finance from Georgia State University. He entered \nthe field of banking in 1969 with Trust Company bank of Atlanta, now \nSunTrust. Following 5 years at SunTrust, he joined the former First \nBank & Trust Co. as executive vice president, where he served for 9 \nyears. In 1983, Ron was an organizing director, president and CEO of \nThe Chattahoochee Bank, serving there for 6 years. In 1989, he joined \nCharter Bank & Trust Co. during its inaugural year and served as its \npresident and CEO for 15 years. Charter Bank, along with Mountain \nNational Bank, joined Bank of North Georgia in July 2004, where Ron now \nserves as vice chairman.\n  In addition to his impressive career in community banking, Ron has a \nlong history of community involvement in my hometown of Marietta, GA, \nwhere he is a well-respected and dedicated leader. He currently serves \non the board of directors of the Marietta Redevelopment Corporation and \nthe Marietta Country Club. He is a trustee of the Kennesaw State \nUniversity Foundation and an executive committee member of the Georgia \nCouncil on Economic Education. Ron is also a member of the Chairman's \nClub of the Cobb Chamber of Commerce and the Governor's Board of \nLeadership Cobb.\n  In 2004, Ron was named ``Marietta Citizen of the Year'' by the Cobb \nChamber of Commerce, and in 1997-1998 he served his professional peers \nand industry as chairman of the Georgia Bankers Association. As a \nbusinessman, Ron Francis personifies the values of honesty and hard \nwork.\n  Retirement may not be the appropriate announcement because Ron has \nnot ``retired'' from his commitment to his community, and he hopefully \nnever will. He also will continue to serve the Bank of North Georgia as \na consultant.\n  It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to \nrecognize on the floor of the U.S. Senate the contributions of Ronald \nH. Francis to the city of Marietta, Cobb County, and the State of \nGeorgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1891-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 10:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 2271.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to expand \neligibility for Combat-Related Special Compensation paid by the \nuniformed services in order to permit certain additional retired \nmembers who have a service-connected disability to receive both \ndisability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs for \nthat disability and Combat-Related Special Compensation by reason of \nthat disability; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, along with many of my colleagues, I have \nbeen fighting for sometime to end the ban on Concurrent Receipt, so \ndisabled veterans can get the fair benefits they deserve. We have made \nsome progress over the last few years, but as everyone knows, we still \nhave work to do.\n  Let's remember what Concurrent Receipt is. It is an unfair and \noutdated policy that prevents disabled veterans from collecting both \ntheir military retirement pay and disability compensation. It requires \na retired disabled veteran to deduct from his retirement pay, dollar \nfor dollar, the amount of any disability compensation he receives.\n  Our veterans have given so much to our country. We owe it to them to \nget rid of this policy, and to make sure they get the full benefits \nthey have earned and deserve.\n  I'm proud to say we have been able to chip away at this unfair \npractice in recent years.\n  In 2003, we passed my bill to allow--after a ten year waiting \nperiod--concurrent receipt for veterans with at least a 50 percent \ndisability rating.\n  In 2004, I proposed legislation to eliminate that ten-year period and \nalso to provide full concurrent receipt of military and disability pay \nto veterans with 100 percent service-related disability.\n  In November, 2005, we passed another amendment to expand concurrent \nreceipt to cover America's most severely disabled veterans, and to \nimplement the new policy immediately instead of phasing it in over a \ndecade.\n  I was pleased with the passage of that amendment last year, but \ndisappointed that the conference committee chose not to enact this \nvaluable legislation for veterans rated as ``unemployable'' until 2009.\n  Today, concurrent receipt remains one of my highest priorities. We \nneed to continue to chip away at this policy, and I am committed to \nthat goal 100 percent.\n  With that in mind, today I am introducing the Combat-Related Special \nCompensation Act of 2006. This legislation will take care of soldiers \nwho had hoped to make the military a career, but were discharged \nprematurely for an injury sustained in combat and forced to retire \nmedically before attaining 20 years of service.\n  Right now, these soldiers receive combat-related disability benefits, \nbut are not eligible to get retirement benefits because they cannot \nserve out the required 20 years. That is unfair, and this legislation \nwill make sure they can get both.\n  This is the right thing to do. These veterans have been forced into \nretirement, and we need to take care of them.\n  I would note this legislation is especially important given the \ninjuries we are seeing in Iraq. Improvised Explosive Devices have \ncreated numerous amputees and therefore, an increase in medically \ndischarged veterans.\n  I have visited military hospitals on several occasions and have seen \nfirst hand the injuries sustained by military personnel. Many of the \nmembers have reached the 10, 12, 14-year marks of their military \ncareers and have been forced to retire medically before the 20 year \nretirement norm. They'll get medical benefits, but they won't receive \nlegitimate retirement compensation because they have been injured and \nare unable to serve until retirement, as they had planned.\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\n  That's wrong.\n  We shouldn't penalize veterans because they were injured serving \ntheir country. My legislation will fix this problem, and get them their \nprorated retirement pay, along with their disability pay.\n  Taking care of our veterans is the right thing to do. We must never \nforget the sacrifices they made to protect our freedom. Taking care of \nour veterans is also key to winning the war on terror. In our all-\nvolunteer military, it is critical to attract and retain professional, \ndedicated soldiers.\n  These people serve because they love America. In turn, they expect \nthat we will honor our commitments to provide health care and other \nprimary benefits for them and their families.\n  By ending the ban on concurrent receipt, we have an opportunity to \nshow our gratitude to our veterans. While our Nation is at war, there \nis no better honor we could bestow upon them than to pass this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit \nthe unlawful acquisition and use of confidential customer proprietary \nnetwork information, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce and present to my \ncolleagues the Protecting Consumers Phone Records Act. I am pleased to \nbe the lead sponsor of this legislation and I want to thank my \ncolleagues, including Senators Stevens and Inouye, for working with me \non this important issue.\n  In recent months, a number of Web sites have been selling consumers' \nconfidential phone records to anyone willing to pay a small fee. \nAccording to experts, these records are usually obtained by \nunscrupulous individuals who fraudulently pose as customers requesting \ntheir own records. This common fraud is no less harmful, and in some \ncases even more disconcerting, than when a third-party uses false \npretenses to obtain an innocent person's confidential financial \nrecords. In some cases, even physical harm can result from one's \nprivate phone records becoming public. We cannot allow these \nreprehensible practices to continue.\n  The goal of the Protecting Consumers Phone Records Act is to prevent \nthe unauthorized and intrusive third party access of American \nconsumers' phone records. Specifically, our legislation makes it \nillegal to solicit, acquire or sell a person's confidential phone \nrecords without that person's consent. It also specifically prohibits \nthe practice commonly referred to as ``pretexting,'' where individuals \nobtain records by fraudulently misrepresenting that they have the \nauthorization to obtain the records.\n  Fully combating this problem requires a team effort. That is why our \nlegislation requires telephone companies to comply with minimum \nsecurity requirements, similar to those required of financial \ninstitutions. Companies must do their part to protect their customers' \nrecords.\n  In order to deter this bad behavior, our legislation increases the \npenalties for violators. Should someone fraudulently solicit, obtain or \nsell an individual's phone records, they will be subject to an $11,000 \npenalty for each record, up to $11 million. Phone companies are subject \nto a $30,000 penalty, up to $3 million if they do not sufficiently \nprotect their customers' phone records.\n  Finally, the Protecting Consumers Phone Records Act recognizes the \nimportance of enforcement. The legislation provides the Federal \nCommunications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and State \nAttorneys General with strengthened enforcement authority. \nAdditionally, telephone companies are given the authority to take legal \naction against those entities or individuals who have illegally \nacquired confidential phone records.\n  This legislation will send a clear message to the unscrupulous \nindividuals profiting from the invasion of an innocent individual's \nprivacy, that this fraudulent and deceptive behavior will not be \ntolerated. We are prepared to use all of the appropriate tools to \neliminate this harmful practice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2389\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the security of the United States borders \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \ncritically important bill for our national security and our immigration \nsystem. My bill is called the Border Operations Reform and Development \nof Electronic Remote Surveillance Act of 2006--otherwise known as the \nBORDERS Act. Getting control over our Nation's borders is an \nindispensable part of comprehensive immigration reform.\n  The Government of the United States has the obligation to protect its \ncitizens and to provide for homeland security by having control of its \ninternational borders. Yet, as we all know, our borders with Mexico and \nCanada are broken. Recognizing the dangerous situation that this \npresents, the bipartisan 9/11 Commission strongly recommended that the \nUnited States get operational control of its borders.\n  Because our Government has not succeeded in adequately securing our \nborders, millions of undocumented aliens have crossed into our country \nwithout our Government's permission. Despite our best efforts to have \nan orderly system of immigration and to control who enters the United \nStates, it's simply not working.\n  Comprehensive immigration reform demands that we find aggressive, \npractical, and cost-effective methods to quickly secure our borders. \nThe BORDERS Act of 2006 does exactly that, building on recent reports \nby the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, as \nwell as the Government Accountability Office.\n  Let me briefly summarize the BORDERS Act of 2006 and explain why this \nbill is so important to our national security.\n  First, and most importantly, this bill requires the Department of \nHomeland Security to implement state-of-the-art surveillance technology \nprograms to build an integrated ``virtual fence'' at our borders. These \nprograms would use unmanned aerial vehicles--like the type already used \nby our military in combat zones--to monitor remote border locations.\n  These surveillance programs also would use a host of other \ntechnologies--like cameras, sensors, satellites, and radar--to patrol \nevery inch of our United States borders. Right now, our Government has \nthe capability to use these technologies and has tried to build a \nvirtual fence. But the one major problem is that the current \nsurveillance program uses components that are not fully integrated and \nautomated.\n  For example, as the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity recently recommended, a virtual fence must use sensors that \nautomatically activate a corresponding camera to focus itself on the \ndirection of the triggered sensor. If someone if sneaking across our \nborder and trips a sensor, I want the closest camera to automatically \nfocus on the person sneaking in. And then I want the camera to send \nimages to multiple border personnel at different locations, who can \nimmediately dispatch the closest Border Patrol agents to capture the \nperson. That's what my bill does: provides for an integrated, automated \nvirtual fence that will allow our Border Patrol agents to apprehend \nanyone trying to sneak into the United States.\n\n  The BORDERS Act also requires the Department of Homeland Security to \ngreatly increase its detention facilities. Right now, the border patrol \nis sometimes able to capture illegal aliens sneaking into the country, \nbut we simply lack enough facilities to detain them. In some border \nareas, up to 90 percent of captured aliens are released, and only 10 \npercent of them show up for their immigration court hearing. Does that \nmake sense?\n  If our Government cannot detain illegal aliens who are caught, we \nlose our\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\nability to make them report to their immigration proceedings. We never \nhear from them again. Thus, this bill instructs the Department of \nHomeland Security to increase its detention space by 20,000 beds for \nthe next 5 years. The bill also instructs the Department to devise \nother ways to monitor illegal aliens who are captured, such as using \nankle bracelets that can remotely track aliens.\n  Moreover, the BORDERS Act recognizes that our Government simply lacks \nthe personnel manpower to effectively enforce our immigration laws and \nsecure our borders. Therefore, the bill authorizes the addition of \nthousands of critical Federal jobs, ranging from Border Patrol agents \nto investigators to detention officers. And the bill requires that \nthese personnel receive crucial training in matters like detecting \nfraudulent documents.\n  Another important section of this bill recognizes that in order for \nour detention mechanisms to function effectively, we need uniform \ndetention standards. The BORDERS Act requires the Department of \nHomeland Security to implement standard operating rules so that costs \nare minimized and all detained aliens are treated fairly and humanely. \nI want to note that this bill contains a section specifically designed \nto ensure that detained alien children are treated properly while in \nU.S. custody. Children are the most vulnerable of illegal aliens, and \nespecially when they are separated from their parents, we must ensure \ntheir safety.\n  Finally, the BORDERS Act of 2006 authorizes the Federal Government to \nreimburse States that incur the financial burden of detaining illegal \naliens. It is unfair of us to expect the States to shoulder this huge \ncost by themselves.\n  Again, let me stress that border security is just one aspect of \ncomprehensive immigration reform. I also will support legislation to \naddress the status of undocumented aliens currently in the United \nStates, if--and only if--such legislation is fair, humane, and \nrecognizes the role that undocumented workers currently play in our \nnation's economy.\n  But border security is a policy area that should find wide \nagreement--across both parties. By setting up a cutting-edge, \nintegrated ``virtual fence,'' and by building more detention centers, I \nbelieve that the United States can take a giant step forward in its \nquest to get control of our borders. In this post-9/11 world, our \nnational security simply demands it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of the United States has the duty to \n     protect its citizens and to provide for homeland security by \n     securing its international borders.\n       (2) The Government of the United States has failed to \n     adequately secure its international borders, which has \n     facilitated the illegal entry of millions of undocumented \n     aliens into the United States.\n       (3) Illegal immigration poses national security concerns, \n     burdens all levels of Government with extra costs, including \n     imposing hundreds of millions of dollars on States and \n     localities in uncompensated expenses for law enforcement, \n     health care, and other essential services, allows some aliens \n     to gain access to the United States before other aliens who \n     have lawfully waited in line, creates an underclass of \n     workers, and facilitates human trafficking, smuggling, and \n     document fraud.\n       (4) One critical aspect of comprehensive immigration reform \n     is to find aggressive, practical, and cost-effective methods \n     to quickly secure the international borders of the United \n     States. As the bipartisan National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States concluded, ``the United States \n     must be able to monitor and respond to entrances between our \n     borders''.\n       (5) The Government of the United States should make full \n     use of integrated and automated surveillance technology, \n     including the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, to create a \n     ``virtual fence'' around the Nation, which could be \n     constructed much more quickly than a physical fence. The \n     Inspector General of the Department recently suggested \n     numerous ways to use integrated surveillance technologies to \n     achieve this critical security goal.\n       (6) The Government of the United States should also \n     increase detention facilities to detain aliens who are \n     apprehended sneaking into the United States, as opposed to \n     catching and releasing such aliens and trusting that they \n     will report for immigration proceedings.\n       (7) In order to reduce costs of detention and to facilitate \n     the process of removing aliens from the United States fairly, \n     the Secretary should establish uniform detention standards \n     and rules.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Department.--Except as otherwise provided, the term \n     ``Department'' means the Department of Homeland Security.\n       (2) Secretary.--Except as otherwise provided, the term \n     ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n       (3) State.--Except as otherwise provided, the term \n     ``State'' has the meaning given that term in section \n     101(a)(36) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1101 (a)(36)).\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to promote the empowerment of women in Afghanistan; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday--as we celebrate international Women's Day--to strengthen and \nempower the women and girls of Afghanistan.\n  International Women's Day is an event celebrated world-wide to \ninspire women to achieve their full potential. But in so many places \naround the world, women continue to suffer from persecution and abuse, \nand many lack resources to become fully integrated\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\nand equal members of society. Despite international intervention, \nAfghanistan is one such example. More than four years after the \ninvasion of Afghanistan and the fall of the Taliban government, the \nwomen of Afghanistan still face significant hurdles as they seek to \nrealize their full potential.\n  The maternal death rate for Afghan women remains tragically high--\nwith an estimated 1,600 deaths for every 100,000 live births. The \nilliteracy rate for women continues to hover around 80 percent.\n  And perhaps most troubling, the security situation for women is \ngetting worse--threatening to slow or even reverse the gains that \nAfghan women have made over the past four years.\n  Lieutenant General Michael D. Maples, director of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, recently testified that violence by the Taliban \nand other insurgents in Afghanistan in 2005 increased by 20 percent \n2004 levels, specifically noting that the insurgency in Afghanistan \n``appears emboldened.''\n  Women and girls have felt the impact particularly hard. In recent \nmonths, attacks against schools in Afghanistan that educate girls have \nincreased substantially. According to media reports, teachers and \nprincipals are being threatened and killed--the headmaster at a coed \nschool was even beheaded in January--and eight schools have been burned \nin the Kandahar province during the current school year alone.\n  Just today, the President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai admitted that \nAfghan women and girls have much to overcome. ``We have achieved \nsuccesses in various dimensions during the past four years,'' Karzai \nsaid. ``But this journey has not ended . . . women especially are being \noppressed, there are still women and young girls who are being married \nto settle disputes in Afghanistan, young girls are married against \ntheir will.''\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Afghan Women Empowerment \nAct of 2006, will provide resources where they are needed most in \nAfghanistan--to Afghan women-led nongovernmental organizations, \nempowering those who will continue to provide for the needs of the \nAfghan people long after the international community has left.\n  The legislation will provide $30 million to these women-led NGOs to \nspecifically focus on providing direct services to Afghan women such as \nadult literacy education, technical and vocational training, and health \ncare services, including mental health treatment. It also provides \nassistance to especially vulnerable populations, including widows and \norphans.\n  In addition, the Afghan Women Empowerment Act authorizes the \nPresident to appropriate $5 million to the Afghan Ministry of Women's \nAffairs and $10 million to the Afghan Independent Human Rights \nCommission--two vitally important entities dedicated to advancing the \ncause of women and human rights within Afghanistan.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1901-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1901-S1902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 392--DESIGNATING MARCH 8, 2006, AS ``INTERNATIONAL \n                             WOMEN'S DAY''\n\n  Mr. LUGAR submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 392\n\n       Whereas there continues to be discrimination against women \n     and women are still denied full political and economic \n     equality;\n       Whereas discrimination is often the basis for violating the \n     basic human rights of women;\n       Whereas, worldwide, the lives and health of women and girls \n     are endangered by violence that is directed at women and \n     girls simply because they are female;\n       Whereas women bear a disproportionate burden of the poverty \n     in the world and constitute an estimated 75 percent of the \n     world's poor;\n       Whereas, of the estimated 600,000 to 800,000 people \n     trafficked across international borders each year for forced \n     labor, domestic servitude, and sexual exploitation, 80 \n     percent of the victims are women and girls;\n       Whereas violence against women is one of the most \n     widespread violations of human rights and it is estimated \n     that 1 in 3 women will suffer some form of violence;\n       Whereas the majority of the estimated 121,000,000 children \n     in the world who are denied a primary education are girls;\n       Whereas two-thirds of the estimated 875,000,000 illiterate \n     adults in the world are women;\n       Whereas, worldwide, women now account for half of all HIV \n     and AIDS cases, and in sub-Saharan Africa, young girls ages \n     15 to 24 are 3 times more likely to be infected with HIV than \n     young men;\n       Whereas gender inequality and sexual violence are \n     significant factors causing the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS \n     among women and girls;\n       Whereas HIV/AIDS is having a devastating effect on women in \n     the United States, and it is the leading cause of death among \n     African American women ages 25 to 34;\n       Whereas two-thirds of the estimated 19,200,000 refugees in \n     the world are women and children;\n       Whereas, in armed conflict, women are targets of rape when \n     it is used as a tactic of war to humiliate the enemy and \n     terrorize the population;\n       Whereas it is estimated that 515,000 women die every year \n     as a result of pregnancy and childbirth, and more than 99 \n     percent of these deaths occur in the developing world;\n       Whereas countries should take steps to ensure the full \n     participation and representation of women in political \n     processes, conflict prevention, and peacekeeping efforts;\n       Whereas, over the last century, March 8 has become known as \n     ``International Women's Day'', a day on which people come \n     together to recognize the accomplishments of women and to \n     reaffirm their commitment to continue the struggle for \n     equality, justice, and peace; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States should be \n     encouraged to participate in International Women's Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 8, 2006, as ``International Women's \n     Day'';\n       (2) reaffirms its commitment to--\n       (A) end discrimination and increase the participation of \n     women in decision-making positions in government and in the \n     private sector;\n       (B) end and prevent violence against women;\n       (C) pursue policies that guarantee the basic rights of \n     women both in the United States and around the world;\n       (D) improve access to quality health care for women;\n       (E) protect the human rights of women and girls during and \n     after conflict and to support the integration of gender \n     perspectives in peacekeeping missions and post conflict \n     processes; and\n       (F) end the trafficking of women and girls; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     International Women's Day with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution declaring \ntoday International Women's Day 2006.\n  International Women's Day is a day on which we celebrate the progress \nof women and rededicate ourselves to overcoming the inequities that \nthey face around the globe. Almost one hundred years ago, when the \nfirst International Women's Day was celebrated, women in this country \nand in Europe were fighting for the right to vote and to participate \nfully in the political process.\n  Today, nearly one hundred years later, we can celebrate the fact \nthat, in the United States and Europe, many of these barriers have been \nbroken down, and that women now not only vote, but participate in our \ngovernment at its highest levels. In the past year, we have seen \nhistoric elections in Afghanistan and Iraq, where women were voters and \ncandidates. In Kuwait, women are now able to vote and run for \nparliament. Voters in Liberia have elected the first female head of \nstate in Africa, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, and Chile is just days away \nfrom the inauguration of Michele Bachelet, the country's first female \npresident.\n  Despite these accomplishments, in many places around the world, women \nare still fighting for their basic rights. Often, especially in \ndeveloping countries, women and girls lack full political, academic, \nand economic equality. Two-thirds of the estimated 875 million \nilliterate adults in the world are women. Girls frequently continue to \nbe denied access to primary education, and constitute the majority of \nthe estimated 121 million children around the globe who do not attend \nschool.\n  The lives and health of women and girls continue to be particularly \nvulnerable to violence. Women are trafficked across international \nborders for forced labor, domestic servitude, and sexual exploitation. \nIn armed conflict situations and other humanitarian emergencies, women \nand children risk a range of abuses including sexual exploitation, \ntrafficking and gender-based violence.\n  The HIV/AIDS crisis is particularly devastating to women and girls. \nWomen now account for one-half of all\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\nHIV and AIDS cases, and in sub-Saharan Africa, young girls aged 15 \nthrough 24 are three times more likely to be infected with HIV than \nyoung men. Not only are women and girls more vulnerable to infection, \nthey are also shouldering much of the burden of caring for sick and \ndying relatives and friends. In addition, in the vast majority of \ncases, they are the caretakers of the estimated 14 million children who \nhave been orphaned by this pandemic. Often, widows and orphans have \ndifficulties asserting their inheritance rights, even when those rights \nare spelled out in law. This often leaves the most vulnerable women and \nchildren impoverished and homeless.\n  The inequality that is devastating the lives of women around the \nworld requires our commitment to ending it. Last year, I co-sponsored \nwith Senator Biden the Protection of Vulnerable Populations During \nHumanitarian Emergencies Act of 2005, which the Committee on Foreign \nRelations supported as an amendment to our Foreign Affairs \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007. Our bill seeks to \nensure that U.S. foreign assistance programs are a force for protecting \nwomen, children, and other vulnerable populations in the wake of \nmilitary conflict and natural disasters.\n  In addition, last year the President signed into law the Orphans and \nVulnerable Children Act, which I authored and introduced in 2004. This \nlaw requires the Administration to develop a comprehensive strategy to \nassist the millions of orphans left behind by the AIDS pandemic. The \nstrategy must include programs to remove barriers to education, such as \nschool fees, that keep orphans, and especially girls, out of the \nclassroom. The law also requires the Administration to support programs \nthat protect the inheritance rights of orphans and widows with \nchildren, and to support programs that assist village-based \norganizations, the main infrastructure for the care of orphans and the \nmillions of women taking care of them.\n  International Women's Day is a day for each of us to reflect upon the \nremarkable progress that women around the world have made, and to \nremember that much remains to be done. I am hopeful that Senators will \njoin me in recognizing this important day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1902-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1902-S1903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 393--DESIGNATING MARCH 8, 2006, AS ``INTERNATIONAL \n                             WOMEN'S DAY''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

lives of their \n     families, communities, and nations;\n       Whereas discrimination continues to deny women full \n     political and economic equality and is often the basis for \n     violations of basic human rights against women;\n       Whereas the health and life of women and girls worldwide \n     continues to be endangered by violence that is directed at \n     them simply because they are women;\n       Whereas worldwide violence against women includes rape, \n     genital mutilation, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating \n     violence, honor killings, human trafficking, dowry-related \n     violence, female infanticide, sex selection abortion, forced \n     pregnancy, forced sterilization, and forced abortion;\n       Whereas at least 1 in 3 females worldwide has been beaten \n     or sexually abused in her lifetime;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 women in the United States has been raped or \n     physically assaulted by an intimate partner at some point in \n     her life;\n       Whereas 20 percent to 50 percent of women worldwide \n     experience some degree of domestic violence during marriage;\n       Whereas, on average, 3 women are murdered by their husbands \n     or boyfriends in the United States every day;\n       Whereas it is estimated that 1 in 5 adolescent girls in the \n     United States becomes a victim of physical or

marital rape, \n     has been cited as a major cause of the rapid spread of HIV/\n     AIDS among women;\n       Whereas between 75 percent and 80 percent of the 27,000,000 \n     refugees and internally displaced persons of the world are \n     women and children;\n       Whereas illegal trafficking for forced labor, domestic \n     servitude, or sexual exploitation victimizes 2,000,000 to

children worldwide who are denied primary \n     education are girls;\n       Whereas throughout the world, girls are less likely to \n     complete school than boys;\n       Whereas that educational failure has real consequences for \n     the global economy and the security of the United States, and \n     especially for the millions of girls with limitless potential \n     who continue to lose the chance to discover their worth and \n     importance as global citizens;\n       Whereas girls who are educated are more likely to enjoy \n     healthy and stable families, lower mortality rates, higher \n     nutrition levels, delayed sexual activity, less chance of \n     contracting HIV/AIDS, and less chance of having unwanted \n     pregnancies;\n       Whereas it is estimated that women

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution honoring \n10\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\nextraordinary women in celebration of International Women's Day.\n  There is no doubt that women have made tremendous strides towards \nequality and justice in the last century. International Women's Day \nprovides an important moment to acknowledge the role that women have \nplayed in pioneering change and paving the way for millions of women \nand girls to access equal education, employment and opportunity.\n  The resolution I submit highlights the achievements of women from all \nover the world who have made strides as stateswomen, activists and \nadvocates.\n  They are women who have overcome discrimination, abuse and political \noppression to make a difference in the communities in which they live. \nWomen like Kavita Ramdas, the President and Chief Executive Officer of \nthe Global Women's Fund, the largest foundation in the world that \nexclusively centers on advocating women's rights. Her work has helped \nto improve women's economic independence and increased girls' access to \neducation.\n  Salma Hayek plays a leading role in helping battered women in the \nUnited States and her native country, Mexico. Serving as chief \nspokeswoman for the Avon Foundations ``Speak Out Against Domestic \nViolence'' campaign, she continues to stay committed to helping educate \nand empower women to bring an end to this type of violence. She has \ndonated her time and money to overcoming the horrifying statistic that \none in three women worldwide has been raped, sexually abused or beaten \nin their lifetime, inspiring others to help spread awareness concerning \ndomestic violence.\n  As Executive Director of the Texas Council on Family Violence and \nNational Domestic Violence Hotline, Sheryl Cates is leading our country \nin empowering women by offering information and referrals to victims of \ndomestic violence. Since the Hotline started 10 years ago, it has taken \nover 1.6 million calls in 140 languages and provide support for women \nacross the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nDomestic violence is often unseen and unreported because the victims \nare often too scared to seek help. The Hotline provides a place for \nvictims to turn for assistance, providing individualized support to \nensure these women that they are not alone.\n  At age 11, Lora Jo Foo was a garment worker in San Francisco, \nCalifornia. She is now an accomplished civil rights and labor activist. \nHaving dedicated her life to improving sweatshop conditions, she \nrepresents and advocates for low wage industry workers throughout the \nworld. Many garment industry workers are denied public benefits because \nthey do not speak English and government agencies fail to provide them \nwith interpreters or translated documents. A large number of Asian \nwomen are pushed into dead-end workfare jobs where they learn no skills \nand are denied the option of English-language training. The result has \nbeen an increase in hunger and illness among Asian immigrant women and \ntheir families. Lora Jo Foo represents those women, giving them a voice \nto advocate for change.\n  Women like these are why we celebrate International Women's Day, \ncommemorating their selfless achievements in advocating for equal \nrights and educating others. This past year, the global community has \ntaken significant strides forward towards gender equality and the \npursuit of human rights. On January 16, 2006, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was \nelected as Prime Minister of Liberia, becoming the first elected female \nhead of state in Africa. Germany elected its first female Chancellor, \nAngela Merkel. Chancellor Merkel overcame her childhood in North Berlin \nunder communism and triumphed in her role as a leader. This past \nspring, Kuwait transformed the very structure of their country by \namending their electoral laws and allowing women both to vote and to \nrun in parliamentary elections. In Afghanistan, women are gaining \nequality in representation, overcoming years of severe gender \ndiscrimination and gender-based violence. There are now 68 female \nparliamentarians in the lower house of parliament, making up 27 percent \nof the representatives; women make up 15 percent of the representatives \nin the upper house.\n  Despite the achievements in women's rights during the past year, \nthere is still more to be done, both domestically and internationally. \nIn our own country, the wage gap between genders still exists. Although \nit has slightly decreased, women make an average of 76.5 percent as \nmuch as men do for identical jobs. Internationally, young women are \nthree times more likely to be infected with HIV/AIDS than men because \nthey know less about how to prevent infection and how to protect \nthemselves from violence and discrimination. And while the laws of some \ncountries in the Middle East have been changed to allow women the right \nto vote and hold office, much remains to be done to ensure they have \nequal access and opportunity to freely express their political will.\n  We value the progress that has been made in ending discrimination and \nadvocating gender equality. On International Women's Day, we thank all \nthose who have contributed to our successes. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the immediate passage of the resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1903-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1903-S1904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2933.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is going \nto pass an important piece of legislation, the Trademark Dilution \nRevision Act, HR 683. The principal purpose of this law is to clarify \nCongress's intentions when it first passed the Federal Trademark \nDilution Act over a decade ago.\n  In 2003, the Supreme Court decided the case of Moseley v. V Secret \nCatalogue, Inc. The Court held that trademark holders had to show \nactual harm, not the likelihood of harm, from dilution before they \ncould seek injunctions. As an original author and sponsor of the act, I \nknow firsthand that this is contrary to what Congress intended when it \npassed the dilution statue. What we did intend was to stop diluting \nbefore actual harm could be realized and the value of any reputable \ntrademark debased.\n  H. R. 683 makes clear Congress's intent and corrects the law to \nprovide that owners of famous trademarks can seek injunctions against \nanyone who attempts to use a mark that is likely to cause dilution. It \nalso affords the court the ability to consider ``all relevant factors'' \nwhen determining whether a mark is ``famous.'' However, this \nlegislation not intended to provide for injunctive or other relief \nagainst legitimate, third party trade in products manufactured under \nauthority of the U.S. trademark owner of the distinctive, famous mark.\n  Furthermore, Senator Hatch and I were successful in including \nlanguage that definitively shelters important constitutionally \nprotected first amendment freedoms from being caught up in the \nliability net.\n  I thank Senators Hatch and Specter for their support in creating and \npassing this important bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 683), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/08/senate-section/article/S1923-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
