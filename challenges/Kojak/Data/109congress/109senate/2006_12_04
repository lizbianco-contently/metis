COLELLA\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize in the \nRecord COL Thomas V. Colella, who officially retired from the United \nStates Marine Corps last month after 30 years of honorable service to \nthis Nation.\n  Colonel Colella graduated from the United States Naval Academy in \n1976 and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps. His \nfirst tour took him to Okinawa, Japan, where he was assigned to E \nBattery, 2nd Battalion, 12th Marine Regiment. While assigned to that \nbattalion, he served as a battery officer, forward observer and liaison \nofficer. Colonel Colella then served at the Landing Force Training \nCommand, Atlantic area, as an Aide-de-Camp to the commanding general of \nthe 4th Marine Amphibious Brigade. In 1981 he entered the Marine Corps \nReserve where he held several line and staff positions including a role \nas commander of the 4th Battalion, 14th Marines and Executive Officer \nof the 4th Civil Affairs Group. Most recently, Colonel Colella was \nrecalled to active duty in support of coalition operations in \nAfghanistan related to Operation Enduring Freedom, where he served as \nChief of Staff to the U.S. Defense Representative in Pakistan.\n  In 1987, Tom joined Korn/Ferry in the firm's Washington, D.C. office \nconducting senior-level searches for a global client base in the \nindustrial, aerospace and defense sectors. Tom was also called into \ncivilian public service after accepting a position within the U.S. \nDepartment of Education in the former Bush administration, and most \nrecently serving as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the \nNavy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs in the current Bush \nadministration.\n  I have been fortunate to have Colonel Colella serve as the chairman \nof my academy review board since my election to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1999. I inherited him from former House Speaker Newt \nGingrich who also sought out Tom's expertise in the important and \nextremely difficult academy selection process. His commitment to the \nyoung men and women who make up the future of our Nation does not go \nunrecognized.\n  I could go on for hours with Tom's biography, but his distinguished \ncareer can be summarized in one word: devotion. He is a devoted father; \na devoted leader at Korn/Ferry International; a devoted public servant; \nand he has now finished his career as a devoted member of the U.S. \nMilitary. An important chapter in Tom's life is now finished, but I \nknow there are many more chapters left to be written.
