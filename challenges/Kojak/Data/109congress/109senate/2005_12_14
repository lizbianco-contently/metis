Mr. President, this morning the Senate will begin a 30-\nminute period of morning business. When that time has expired, we will \nbegin consideration of the House message to accompany the deficit \nreduction bill.\n  Last night the agreement we entered allows for up to 7 motions to \ninstruct conferees. Several Members spoke to these motions, debating \ntheir motions yesterday. Today we will vote on those, prior to lunch.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that at 11:45 this morning \nwe proceed to three consecutive votes, first on the Baucus motion to \ninstruct, to be followed by the Carper motion, to be followed by the \nHarkin motion; provided further that there be 2 minutes equally divided \nfor debate prior to each of the votes; finally, I ask unanimous consent \nthat following the third vote the Senate stand in recess until 2:15 for \nthe policy luncheon to meet.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, therefore, Senators can expect three votes \nbeginning at 11:45 today. The remaining motions will be debated this \nmorning and this afternoon, and those votes will be scheduled for \nThursday afternoon at approximately 3:30.\n  Today we expect the PATRIOT Act conference report to arrive from the \nHouse. If we are unable to reach consent for a limited debate time, \nthen I am prepared to file cloture on that conference report.\n  I do hope we can come to a consent for the debate time. If not, \ncloture can be expected. If that is the case, that vote would occur \nFriday morning. The Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations \nconference report may also be available to the Senate today. I will be \nconsulting with my colleagues about scheduling that vote as well.\n  In addition to the items I have mentioned, there is a number of other \nlegislative and executive items that remain. These include the Defense \nauthorization conference report, the Defense appropriations conference \nreport.\n  As I have said over the last several days on the floor, I urge all \nMembers to remain available and to adjust their schedules accordingly \nfor the remainder of this week and into this weekend, and perhaps \nbeyond as we schedule our final business of this year. We will make \nevery effort to conclude our work as quickly as possible, but it will \nrequire the patience and cooperation of all Senators. As all of my \ncolleagues understand, there is a lot of coordination with the House of \nRepresentatives with bills going back and forth.\n  I thank everyone for their help in advance as we move forward on \nthese matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13517-8", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13517-S13518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COMBAT METH ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I briefly speak to an issue that is \nimportant to me and important to the American people. As we continue \nour debate on the PATRIOT Act conference report, I call my colleagues' \nattention to a special crimefighting provision that promises to thwart \nthe No. 1 drug problem in America today, methamphetamine. The provision \nis called the Combat Meth Act. It enjoys broad bipartisan support in \nthis body. It is a part of the PATRIOT Act legislation.\n  In particular, I want to thank my colleague from Missouri, Senator \nTalent, for his tireless efforts in advancing this pressing issue. He \nhas been focused on it, and he has talked to all of our colleagues \nabout it. He very passionately expresses the need and the critical \nimportance of this bill. He has\n\n[[Page S13518]]\n\nworked hand in hand with our colleague from California, Senator \nFeinstein, and together they introduced the Combat Meth Act in January \nof this year.\n  As leadership, I was proud to work with our corresponding House \nleadership to encourage our Members to work with all of our \ncounterparts to get this done, to work in a bicameral way.\n  The Combat Meth Act is a victory for law enforcement, a victory for \nour communities, and a victory for every family who has experienced the \npain and the destruction of methamphetamine abuse. In 10 years--one \ndecade--meth has become America's worst drug problem. That is above \nmarijuana, cocaine, heroin--over the last 10 years. It is destroying \nindividuals.\n  We have all heard stories in our various States and districts of \nfamilies and whole communities being destroyed by the new emergence of \nmethamphetamine and the destruction it causes. My own State of \nTennessee has been hit particularly hard. In 2004, Tennessee ranked No. \n2, tied with Iowa and just behind Missouri, in the number of \nmethamphetamine lab seizures. Sandy Mattice, a former U.S. Attorney in \nTennessee, and now a Federal judge in Chattanooga, calls meth ``the \nworst stuff'' we have ever seen. It has led to some of the worst and \nmost disturbing cases of violence to hit the front pages of today.\n  This August, when I was back at home traveling across Tennessee, I \nheard stories again and again from my fellow Tennesseans of the \ndevastating destruction meth is creating in communities all across the \nState. I heard about addicted mothers and fathers abusing their \nchildren, abusing each other during the highs and the lows created by \nmethamphetamine use. I heard about addicts stealing from their own \nspouses, stealing from their own families because they were so \ndesperate to support this highly addictive drug and the habit that \nbecomes a part of it.\n  There is one Tennessee story which was so horrific that it made \nnational news. Because it was so accurately reflective of the \ndestruction and pain created by meth, the laws in Tennessee were \nchanged.\n  In June of last year, authorities found 3-year-old Haley Spicer in \nher father's mobile home in Campbell County. Haley had been burned over \nher body with cigarettes, she had been scalded with hot water, and she \nhad been severely beaten. The fumes from her father's meth lab were so \ntoxic that Haley's eyelids were nearly melted shut. Haley has undergone \nseveral surgeries to open her eyes. She faces a number of operations in \nthe future to rebuild her nose and to rebuild her injured ear.\n  Haley's father Tommy Joe Owens was sentenced in October to 95 years \nin prison for what he did to his child. His live-in girlfriend \nCharlotte Claiborne pleaded no contest and was sentenced to 20 years \nbehind bars.\n  Haley's case was so shocking that in August the State legislature \npassed Haley's Law to drastically toughen child abuse penalties. This \nwas an important victory for child abuse victims, but it didn't get to \nthe concurrent problem of meth abuse and addiction which led to this \ncrime.\n  Local law enforcement--I heard it all over the State--is literally \noverwhelmed by the meth crisis. They are calling out for our help. They \nneed us to pass the Combat Meth Act to restrict access to the cold \nmedicines that contain pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, which are the key \ningredients easily obtained today and used to manufacture \nmethamphetamine. Once you have those ingredients, meth can literally be \nmanufactured with a few pots and pans in a kitchen.\n  While some States, such as my home State of Tennessee, have passed \nlaws restricting access to these products, other States have not yet \nacted. As a result, meth cooks can jump from one State to another State \nto another State to get the over-the-counter ingredients they use to \nmake this highly addictive toxin.\n  Law enforcement and prosecutors tell me the single greatest impact we \ncould have on reducing meth abuse is to require all 50 States to \nrestrict access to the cold medicines containing the ingredients used \nto make methamphetamine. Data from States that have gone ahead and \npassed laws restricting access to these precursor chemicals proves that \nindeed to be the case. They work.\n  Oklahoma, for instance, passed a law last year and with this law has \nseen a dramatic reduction in meth lab seizures. Data from my own State \nof Tennessee--we passed a similar law earlier in the year--shows the \nsame trend, a steady decline in meth lab seizures.\n  The Combat Meth Act will require all 50 States to do what Oklahoma \nand Tennessee have done. The Combat Meth Act is critical to containing \nand defeating the meth epidemic. We need one uniform standard to close \nthe loopholes in the system so that producers can't cruise from State \nto State exploiting our differences.\n  I again thank Senator Talent and Senator Feinstein for their \nleadership and for pushing hard to get this done.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the PATRIOT Act, which includes this \nmuch needed law. The Combat Meth Act is a victory for law enforcement \nacross this land in our communities. The Combat Meth Act is a victory \nfor towns and for communities and cities all across America. It is a \nvictory for all of the innocent individuals and families who have been \nharmed by this dangerous and deadly drug.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week I had the privilege of meeting \nprivately with numerous soldiers from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of \nthe 2nd Infantry Division, which is stationed at Fort Carson, CO. These \nsoldiers had just returned from their first tour in Iraq where they \nhelped maintain the peace near the former terrorist hot-bed of \nFallujah. I spent over an hour talking with them about their \nexperiences, asking them about their challenges, and hearing their \nthoughts about whether we should stay the course in Iraq.\n  These soldiers spent the last year fighting the Iraqi terrorists, in \nsome cases house-to-house. They helped train several Iraqi security \nunits and participated in numerous reconstruction projects throughout \ncentral Iraq. Sadly, they lost 68 of their own while in Iraq. Yet, \nwhile they deeply mourn the loss of their comrades, they have no \nregrets about their time in Iraq.\n  Indeed, if there was one thing I took away from my meeting with the \nsoldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, it was that each and every one \nof these soldiers was proud of their accomplishments in Iraq. They \ncompleted their mission well and helped thousands of Iraqis better \nunderstand the value of freedom and prosperity.\n  And why shouldn't these soldiers be proud of what they achieved? The \nprogress we have made in Iraq is breath-taking, and these soldiers have \nbeen a part of it.\n  Those who believe that the war in Iraq has become a quagmire \ncertainly haven't been paying attention. The President's strategy is \nworking and we are making progress.\n  The reconstruction accomplishments in Iraq are staggering:\n  Over 3,000 schools have been renovated and refurbished; 133,000 \nprimary school teachers--a third of Iraq's educators--have received \nadditional training and technical assistance; primary school enrollment \nis up 19 percent from prewar levels; nearly 250 health care centers \nhave been renovated and another 563 have received new equipment; over \n2,500 primary health care workers have received training to better meet \nthe Iraq's health care needs; in 2005 alone, 98 percent of Iraqi \nchildren between 1 and 5 years old have been immunized against measles, \nmumps, and rubella; more than 3 million Iraqis now have clean water, \nwhich was not adequately supplied before the war; more than 4.5 million \nIraqis benefit from sewage disposal projects the United States has \nfunded; sewage in many areas of Iraq used to literally run down the \nstreets; 30,000 new businesses have registered with the Iraqi \ngovernment in the past year alone; Iraqis are buying televisions, air \nconditioners, microwave ovens, and cell phones--all goods that were \nnearly impossible to buy unless you were one of Saddam's cronies; the \ngeneration of electricity is significantly higher than prewar level, \nthough this area remains a challenge because of the power-consuming \ngoods the Iraqis are buying.\n\n[[Page S13519]]\n\n  The training of Iraqi security forces is continuing at a brisk pace. \nOver 200,000 soldiers and policemen have been trained so far. As the \nsoldiers from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team at Fort Carson will tell you, \nsome Iraqi units are highly competent and very capable. Other Iraqi \nunits have a long way to go. Yet progress is being made.\n  Just in the last 2 weeks, Iraqi security forces conducted nearly 100 \ncompany-level combat operations on their own without U.S. assistance.\n  On the political front, the progress in Iraq has been nothing short \nof amazing.\n  As President Bush pointed out in his speech 2 days ago, Iraq was in \nthe iron grip of a cruel dictator who murdered his own people, attacked \nhis neighbors, and continued his decade-long defiance of the United \nNations just 2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  Since then, the Iraqi people have assumed sovereignty of their own \ncountry, held free elections, put together a new constitution, and \napproved that constitution in a nation-wide referendum.\n  Tomorrow, Iraqis will again return to the voters booth for the third \ntime in the last year. They will be choosing a new government under a \nnew constitution, and they will be choosing democracy over tyranny.\n  Hundreds of political parties representing every element of Iraqi \nsociety, including Sunni, Shittes, and Kurds, are participating in this \nhighly competitive, completely unprecedented electoral race.\n  Despite the constant danger of terror attacks, Iraq is buzzing in a \ncampaign-like atmosphere. Baghdad, Najaf, and Mosul are full of signs \nand posters. Television and radio are filled with political ads and \ncommentary.\n  Political rallies for candidates are being held around the country. \nNothing the terrorists can do or say has stopped this march toward \nfreedom and democracy.\n  Like Shittes and Kurds, Sunni politicians are now coming under attack \nby the Iraqi terrorists. But the Sunnis now know that terror will never \novercome the political momentum that has been gaining speed in Iraq. \nThey know that an agenda of fear and tyranny will only lead to more \ndeath and destruction.\n  They see that the future of Iraq lies not in the hateful ideology of \nextremism but in freedom, prosperity, and hope.\n  As the Denver Post in their editiorial today, tomorrow marks an \nimportant milestone towards self-government for the Iraqi people.\n  The elections in Iraq are a sign of tremendous political progress, \nbut they are not the only sign. The development of the rule of law and \nbuilding of new political institutions is just as important--if not \nmore so.\n  The United States is helping build an independent, impartial \njudiciary system capable of protecting all Iraqis and is helping Iraqi \nlawmakers develop a body of law that will sustain Iraq through the \nchallenges of the future.\n  In particular, the trial of Saddam Hussein has shown all Iraqis that \neven the most despicable criminals deserve due process and an \nopportunity to prove their innocence under the law.\n  Some have questioned whether the war in Iraq is really a part of the \nwar against terror. The terrorists have made it abundantly clear that \nIraq is central in their war against the civilized world.\n  They have also made it clear that they will not stop with Iraq; they \nwill strike Iraq's neighbors as they did last month in Jordan; they \nwill strike Europe as they did in the Madrid bombings; and they will \nnot hesitate to strike America again as they did on September 11.\n  The soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 2nd Infantry at \nFort Carson understand the stakes of the war in Iraq. They know that if \nwe run away, all of their work will go for naught. They know that if we \ngive up, the lives of millions of Iraqis will be put at risk. And they \nknow that if we surrender, the fight the terrorists will be emboldened \nto hit us where it hurts the most--here in the United States.\n  I applaud the soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team for their \nservice to our Nation and to the people of Iraq. They have every right \nto be proud of their achievements, as does every U.S. soldier, sailor, \nairman, and marine who has helped bring freedom to Iraq. We owe the men \nand women in our Armed Forces a debt of gratitude--their courage and \nbravery has inspired me and should inspire every American.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this important \nissue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, shortly after 9/11 we came together on a \nbipartisan basis in Congress to try to make certain that terrible \ntragedy was never repeated. We worked on a bipartisan basis to give \ntools to our Government to fight terrorism, to upgrade the laws of the \nUnited States so our Government could stay ahead of the curve when it \ncame to that threat. We understood then, as we do now, that those tools \nwere necessary for our Government, and we understood as well that \npreventing terrorism is the most important and the most valid exercise \nof governmental responsibility.\n  But we were concerned, concerned that at that moment in our history \nwe were responding quickly, perhaps emotionally, to the threat and to \nthe tragedy of September 11. So in the wisdom of both Republican and \nDemocratic legislators, we included in the PATRIOT Act this new set of \ntools to fight terrorism, sunset provisions. We said: Four years from \nnow we will take another look at it. We are going to try to decide at \nthat point in time if we went too far because at issue here was not \njust fighting terrorism but our basic rights and liberties.\n  Giving the Government more power over the people in this country may \nbe necessary in some regards to deal with terrorism, but we should \nalways do it carefully because our basic rights and liberties, as \nguaranteed by our Constitution and the tradition of our laws, are \nthings we are all sworn to uphold and protect. So the PATRIOT Act was \npassed on a bipartisan basis with only one dissenting vote in the \nSenate and included these sunset provisions.\n  Well, the calendar has run, it is 4 years later, and now again we are \nlooking at this PATRIOT Act. I found it interesting that there were \ncertain provisions of this act which were obviously accepted by the \nAmerican people, provisions which gave the Government more authority. \nBut there were several that became controversial. And over the years, \nsince the act was first passed, a number of Members of the Senate \nstarted asking questions about whether perhaps we did go too far in \npassing the PATRIOT Act. It led to the introduction of legislation \nwhich I cosponsored with Senator Larry Craig of Idaho entitled ``the \nSAFE Act,'' an attempt not to repeal the PATRIOT Act but to change some \nprovisions which may have gone too far.\n  It was an interesting bill by political standards because the \ncosponsors could not be more different. Senator Craig is a very \nconservative Republican from Idaho. I, of course, am a Democrat from a \nblue State in Illinois. Yet we came together and believed we had a \ncommon goal of giving the Government enough power to deal with \nterrorism and protect us but not too much power to take away our basic \nrights and liberties. We attracted cosponsors from both sides of the \naisle--Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire; Senator Lisa Murkowski of \nAlaska; Senator Russ Feingold, who has been a very able leader on this \nwhole issue, as well as Senator Ken Salazar, former attorney general of \nthe State of Colorado. We have all come together to try to make certain \nthat rewriting the PATRIOT Act on this 4-year anniversary is done in a \nresponsible fashion.\n  We could not have had a better outcome in the Senate. I cannot think \nof one. We passed our revision of the PATRIOT Act out of the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously. I want to tell\n\n[[Page S13520]]\n\nyou, I have served on the Judiciary Committee for about 8 years now. It \nis rough to get a unanimous vote for a resolution praising motherhood. \nBut we had a unanimous vote--Democrats and Republicans--on the new \nPATRIOT Act, brought it to the floor, and it really struck the right \nchord with all Members of the Senate to the point where we did not have \na record vote to pass it. We passed it by unanimous consent, and that \nsays we were on to something, the right balance.\n  Then, of course, the legislative process takes that bill of the \nSenate and matches it with the bill in the House, and compromises are \nmade. That is the reason we are here today.\n  Because, sadly, some of the compromises that were made between the \nSenate bill and the ultimate bill we are being presented with were \nsignificant, historic, and some, I am afraid, were just plain wrong.\n  In about 2 weeks, several provisions of the PATRIOT Act will expire. \nThere are only a couple days left in this session of Congress. The \nSenate majority leader, Senator Frist, said this morning this is one of \nhis high priorities. And it should be.\n  Later this week, at the last possible moment, the Senate is going to \nconsider the bill to reauthorize the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT \nAct. I wish we were not doing this at the last minute because this is \nan important debate. This debate is especially important because the \ncurrent version of the bill does not include the safeguards which we \nneed to protect the basic freedoms of Americans.\n  I come to this debate with the belief we have inherent in our \ndemocracy, based on our Constitution, certain rights and freedoms and \nliberties. If this Government, or any government, wants to take that \nfreedom away from me or from any American, they have to make a \ncompelling argument. The presumption is in favor of our freedom. The \npresumption is in favor of our privacy. It is the Government's \nresponsibility to show that it has to go beyond current law to take \naway our basic freedom. That is where I start. And I think many Members \nof the Senate--conservative and liberal--feel exactly the same way.\n  Now, I understand there may be an attempt to shut off the debate on \nthis PATRIOT Act. I think that is a mistake. I think we should give it \nthe time necessary because we are talking about fundamental freedoms in \nthis country. It is rare we stand on the floor and really consider a \nbill of this importance and this magnitude. But this is one of them. We \nrushed through the PATRIOT Act 4 years ago, as I said, in the light of \nwhat happened on 9/11, with an understanding we needed to pause and \nreflect on this in 4 years. We should not rush through this debate \nagain.\n\n  Some claim we should not be concerned with problems in this bill \nbecause it includes another sunset clause, which gives Congress the \npower to review three of the bill's most controversial provisions 4 \nyears from now. A sunset is really important. I am glad we included it \nin the original bill. But it is no justification for delaying changes \nto the PATRIOT Act that are needed to protect our fundamental \nliberties. We ought to fix the PATRIOT Act now.\n  In the last 4 years, 400 communities in 45 different States have \npassed resolutions expressing concerns about the PATRIOT Act. The \nAmerican people are sensitive to the fact that this could be an \ninfringement on their basic rights. The communities that passed these \nresolutions represent about 62 million people across this country from \nevery corner of the United States.\n  Senator Craig and I introduced the SAFE Act to address these \nconcerns. Three Republican Senators, three Democratic Senators, we came \ntogether across the aisle to try to find a bipartisan and sensible \napproach to dealing with this issue. The SAFE Act, as I said, would not \neliminate the PATRIOT Act. It would only reform it.\n  And the bill has an amazing array of support: the American \nConservative Union joined with the American Civil Liberties Union. When \nwas the last time those two got together? But they did for this act \nbecause they believe whether you are on the right or on the left that \nbasic freedoms should be protected.\n  The Senate bill was based on the SAFE Act that we introduced. We \nreached an agreement. We made compromises. So some of the reforms of \nthe SAFE Act were included, some were not. The result was \nextraordinary. The Senate unanimously passed the bill.\n  The SAFE Act, like the Senate bill, retains all of the new powers \ncreated by the PATRIOT Act but places some reasonable limits on them.\n  Then came the conference report. The current version of the PATRIOT \nAct reauthorization legislation does not include some of the most \nimportant reforms of the Senate bill. In the limited time I have, let \nme speak to one or two issues.\n  Section 215 has been called the library records provision of the \nPATRIOT Act. Let me tell you what it would do. The bill would allow the \nGovernment to use this section to obtain library, medical, tax, gun \nrecords, business records, and other sensitive personal information \nsimply by showing that the information might be relevant to an \nauthorized investigation.\n  This is not in the tradition of American jurisprudence and American \nconstitutional law. It has been our premise that before the Government \ncan investigate any of us, any person who is following this debate, \nthere must be some individualized suspicion about that person. This \nsection of the PATRIOT Act says just the opposite. The Government can \nstart looking at thousands of individual records held by different \ncompanies or libraries or hospitals and look to see if there is \nanything suspicious that they can glean from looking at those records. \nSection 215 clearly allows such a fishing expedition.\n  Who has raised concerns about this provision? The U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, groups on the \nright and on the left. They argue that the Government should be \nrequired to show a judge that a person whose records they want has some \nconnection to a suspected terrorist or spy.\n  This is basic to the law of America. In this country, you have the \nright to be left alone. It is pretty basic and important to all of us. \nIf the Government wants to get into my personal life or yours, it has \nto do so with a reason, not in general terms that say: Let's look at \nall of the people who have checked books out of the New York Public \nLibrary in the last 30 days. Let's go to a hospital and ask for all of \nthe medical records of people who have had a certain medical procedure, \nregardless of who those people happen to be. This is too broad.\n\n  When the FBI is conducting a terrorism investigation, they should not \nbe able to snoop through your sensitive personal records unless you \nhave some connection to a suspected terrorist act. The original Senate \nbill would provide that protection. This bill we are going to consider \ndoes not. That is what is at stake.\n  There are other problems with section 215. Let me mention another. An \nindividual who receives a section 215 order--for example, the person \nwho is running a library, the administrator of a hospital with medical \nrecords, the administrator of a credit agency, for example, with \nsensitive financial information--is subject to an automatic permanent \ngag order that prevents that person from speaking out, even if he \nbelieves that this section 215 order has gone way too far and violates \ntheir rights.\n  The original Senate bill we supported on a bipartisan basis and \npassed unanimously would give someone who receives a section 215 order \nthe right to go to court to ask that the gag order be lifted. The \ncurrent version of the bill does not.\n  It, in fact, continues to gag those individuals who could protest the \nGovernment reaching too far with a section 215 order. This is a serious \nthreat to our freedom of speech. Courts have held that an individual \nwho is subject to a Government gag order has a first amendment right to \nchallenge that gag order in court. The current version of the PATRIOT \nAct does not provide that right. I am concerned that that on its face \nis unconstitutional.\n  I don't have time to get into all of the details of this conference \nreport. There are many provisions of the bill which trouble me. This \nmorning, I am going to be sending a letter, with several of my \ncolleagues, to our other colleagues in the Senate outlining those \nconcerns.\n\n[[Page S13521]]\n\n  In this morning's Washington Post, Attorney General Gonzales says we \nhave a choice: either accept this flawed conference report or it will \nexpire. I respectfully disagree. We must not allow the PATRIOT Act to \nexpire. There are provisions we desperately need to keep America safe. \nBut we should not pass a reauthorization that fails to protect basic \nconstitutional rights. Once we give these rights away in this act, can \nwe ever reclaim them?\n  The 9/11 Commission said it best: The choice between security and \nliberty is a false choice. Our bipartisan coalition believes this \nlegislation can be changed and improved to protect civil liberties and \ngive the Government the tools it needs to fight terrorism.\n  We believe it is possible for Republicans and Democrats to come \ntogether, dedicated to protecting our basic constitutional rights. We \nbelieve we can be safe and free.\n  The American people have already lived with the PATRIOT Act for 4 \nyears. They shouldn't have to wait any longer for Congress to take \naction to protect their constitutional rights.\n  This morning, the Senate majority leader came to the floor to speak \nabout a provision in the PATRIOT Act which I certainly support. It is \nthe Combat Meth Act. My State of Illinois, many States with rural \npopulations, knows that this insidious drug crime has been increasing \nwith these meth labs and an addiction which has destroyed lives and \ncreated chaos, starting, of all places, with rural areas and small \ntowns. The Combat Meth Act includes $15 million in COPS funding to \ncombat the growing methamphetamine problem, and I support it. However, \nwhat the Senate majority leader did not mention was that the \nRepublicans in this Chamber have consistently voted against COPS \nfunding.\n  As recently as last March, when the Senate considered the budget \nresolution--I see my friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and \nhe may respond--Senator Biden proposed an amendment to increase COPS \nfunding by $1 billion. That amendment did not receive a single vote on \nthe other side of the aisle. Time and again, the President has proposed \neliminating funding for hiring additional police officers through the \nCOPS Program to help combat this methamphetamine problem. Simply \nauthorizing another $15 million in COPS funding in the PATRIOT Act is \nnot enough. It is time for Congress to take a stand and provide real \nmoney to fund the COPS Program, to help State and local law enforcement \nfight this insidious meth epidemic across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13521-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair now lays before the Senate a message \nfrom the House.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 1932) entitled \n     ``An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section \n     202(a) of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95)'', do pass with the following \n     amendment.\n\n  The bill is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nNovember 17, 2005.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of motions to instruct conferees with \nrespect to S. 1932, and the Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now proceeding to try to appoint \nconferees for the purposes of passing, hopefully, at some point, the \ndeficit reduction bill which would reduce the deficit of the United \nStates by $45 to $48, maybe $49 billion and, thus, reduce the debt of \nthe United States and be the first piece of legislation passed in the \nlast 8 years which attempts to address one of the most serious issues \nwe have as a matter of Federal spending policy, which is the issue of \nhow we bring under control our entitlement accounts. It is important, \nas we move down this road, that we once again set the table as to what \nthe issues are. It is a complex issue, and it is one which a lot of \npeople who are not focusing on it probably do not really appreciate the \nsubtleties because it is something that takes a certain amount of \nexpertise or at least a fair amount of time relative to understanding \nit.\n  The way the Federal spending process works is that there are \nessentially two different sets of accounts. One is discretionary. Those \nare accounts that we spend every year. They are for things such as \nnational defense, education, environmental cleanup, health care, items \nwhich every year need to be appropriated. That is called the \nappropriations bills. They represent about a third of the Federal \nspending.\n  Another set of accounts is entitlement accounts. Entitlement accounts \nare programs from which you, as American citizens or an organization, \nhave a right to receive a payment. It is not a question of being \nappropriated. In other words, there doesn't have to be a law passed \nevery year for you to get that expenditure like you have to do with \nnational defense.\n  Rather, this money, you have a right to because the law says you meet \ncertain criteria. You may be a veteran. You may be a student going to \ncollege and you have a right to a student loan. You may be a senior \ncitizen who is retired and you have a right to Social Security payments \nand you have a right to health care payments. You may be a low-income \nindividual and you have a right to Medicaid payments.\n  The problem we confront in the Federal Government is that although \nthe discretionary accounts have been held at a very low rate of \nincrease--in fact, nondefense discretionary funding has essentially \nbeen frozen under the budget resolution we passed. That freeze has been \nenforced through what is known as spending caps, where in order to go \npast this essential freeze, you have to have a supermajority to do it. \nOn the entitlement side, there is no way in the regular order of the \nSenate to control the rate of growth in entitlement spending because, \nfor a certain number of people or programmatic activity, the payment \nmust be made. We confront a fiscal tsunami, driven by the fact that we \nare facing the largest retired generation in the history of this \ncountry, the baby boomers.\n  As Chairman Greenspan pointed out in what was essentially his wrap-up \nstatement as to what he thought were the concerns we as a Nation should \nbe looking at in the area of fiscal policy--or maybe not his last \nstatement but maybe a major policy statement made in London. He said \nthe one thing that most concerned him was the fact that the baby boom \ngeneration--this large generation born after World War II, through the \n1950s--when it hits the retirement system, tremendous demands are going \nto be put on the Federal Treasury and, therefore, on the taxpayers of \nthe country--the younger generation who are trying to earn and have a \ngood lifestyle--are going to be overwhelmed. We are essentially going \nto confront the situation where we will have so many people retired \ncompared to the number of people working that those people who are \nworking are going to have to pay a disproportionate amount of their \nincome in order to support the retired generation, and it will be to a \nlevel that will essentially eliminate or dramatically reduce our \nchildren's and grandchildren's ability to have a quality lifestyle. \nThese pages today are going to have a tax burden that is so high that \nbasically their ability to buy a house, to send their children to \ncollege, to have a quality of life that is equal to or better than \nours--which is, of course, what we hope to pass on to our children--\nwill be dramatically reduced.\n  To put this in context of dollars--and the dollars are so big it is \nhard to understand it--there is presently $47 trillion of unfunded \nliability out there to support the generation that is about to hit the \nretirement system. That is an unfunded liability. That means there is \nno way anybody knows how to pay for those programs. The vast majority \nof that is in the health care area, where there is about $24 trillion \nof unfunded liability between the Medicare and the Medicaid systems. \nThose numbers were not numbers I thought up or even that CBO thought up \nor OMB thought up, the in-house accounting groups we turn to for \nadvice. Those numbers came from the independent, totally objective \nsource of the Comptroller's office.\n  So we confront this huge cost, and the issue for us as policymakers \nand as\n\n[[Page S13522]]\n\nshepherds of hopefully a better America for our children is how do we \naddress that so we don't pass on to them this massive debt.\n  In the last 8 years, we have done nothing about the entitlements. \nThis section of the Federal spending apparatus has basically been \nignored, except that new programs have been added. In the last 4 years, \nwe have seen the largest increase in the history of the country added \nto entitlements in the prescription drug program, an $8 trillion \nunfunded liability in that program. So this year in the budget process, \nthe Republican majority, with the exception of a few Members, decided \nthat we would try, for the first time in 8 years, to actually do \nsomething about the entitlement accounts, and we passed something \ncalled reconciliation instructions, which essentially is a program by \nwhich we say as a Congress to the committees of jurisdiction, look at \nyour entitlement spending programs, look at the health care programs, \nthe farm programs, the various education programs and see if there is \nnot some way, without significantly impacting the quality of those \nprograms or the economic integrity of those programs or the benefit of \nthose programs to the people--isn't there some way we can rein in their \nrate of growth so they will be more affordable for our children's \ngeneration to pay for it.\n  It is the first time we have tried this in 8 years. We didn't pick a \nbig number to hit. It is a big number, but in the context of the \nFederal spending it is not that big a number. For example, in the \nMedicaid area, we suggested that the rate of growth be slowed by $10 \nbillion. That is a big number, but in the context of total Medicaid \nspending, it is not. Total Medicaid spending over the 5-year period, \nwhich we asked for a $10 billion savings in, will be $1.2 trillion. So \n$10 billion is actually less than one-tenth of 1 percent of that total \nspending, and it will slow the rate of growth of Medicaid spending from \nsomewhere around 40.5 percent down to 40 percent. That is the rate of \ngrowth. Forty-percent growth will still occur in the Medicaid account, \neven if we hit the target that the Senate has proposed. So we are \ntrying as a Congress now to reach agreement on this package of \nproposals to rein in the rate of growth of Medicaid spending and other \nentitlement account spending, and we hope to have a package within the \n$40 billion to $50 billion range. That is a big number, but today we \nneed to get to conference to do that. We have to meet with the House. \nThat is the way it works. We have to go to conference and talk about \nit.\n  Some would like to give instructions to the conference as to what the \nconference should do. Now, it is the legitimate right of everybody in \nthe Senate to offer a motion of instruction before you go to \nconference. That is so the other side of the aisle, coupled with some \nMembers on our side, have asked to set up a set of motions for \ninstructions. I believe seven will be proposed, and we will hopefully \nget a vote on conferees. There is an irony to this--in fact, it is more \nthan irony. Other terms may be more appropriate, but I will not use \nthem. But in every instance the people who are offering--the primary \nofferers--the motions to instruct conferees did not vote for the \nbudget. None of them. They did not vote for the budget. There was one \ncosponsor of one of these who did vote for it, and I appreciate her \nvote; it was the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins. But she is not the \nprime sponsor of it. The prime sponsors of those proposals did not vote \nfor the budget. They not only didn't vote for the budget which had in \nplace the spending restraint which froze discretionary spending and put \ninto place the caps necessary to control discretionary spending and put \nin place the entitlement reconciliation instructions which would allow \nus to move forward with a reconciliation bill and try to control \nspending--so the sponsors of these instructions didn't vote for any \nspending restraint proposals and now they want to instruct the \nconference as to how to proceed. And then having not voted for the \nbudget when the reconciliation bill came to the floor, which bill \ninvolved, when it passed the Senate, $3 billion of savings, deficit \nreduction, savings in spending, deficit reduction--they didn't vote for \nthat--none of the sponsors of these motions to instruct the conferees \nvoted to control spending by voting for the deficit reduction package \nor to control spending by voting for a budget. And now they come to the \nfloor in an act of what I think is exceptional irony, and they wish to \nadvise and tell and instruct the people who are going to try to put \ntogether a bill to reduce the deficit and reduce the debt as to what \nshould be done. And in most instances, most of these instructions don't \nreduce the debt, don't reduce the deficit, but actually increase the \ndebt and increase spending.\n\n  As was noted yesterday by the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the \ncommittee that has jurisdiction over this issue, the trade instruction \nin this bill, which is directed at a special interest program, will \nactually cost the American taxpayers about $3 billion.\n  So having voted against the budget to reduce spending, having voted \nagainst the deficit reduction bill to reduce spending, they now come to \nthe floor and in an act of extraordinary irony suggest instructing the \npeople who are trying to put together some fiscal responsibility around \nhere that they should spend more money or should have less available to \nspend.\n  I think these motions to instruct should be taken with a large grain \nof salt because of that fact. It would be credible if somebody who had \nvoted for this deficit reduction bill offered a motion to instruct, \nespecially if it is was an instruction, hopefully, to get more deficit \nreduction, and it would be credible if somebody who had voted for the \nbudget resolution offered an instruction. But most of these instruction \nrequests are not being offered in the context of trying to save funds, \nreduce the deficit, and reduce the debt, but are actually being offered \nfor the purposes of increasing spending, increasing the debt, and \nincreasing the deficit.\n  So we go forward with this exercise today of motions to instruct, but \nI think they need to be put in context, and that is what I have tried \nto do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate disagrees \nto the House amendment, requests a conference with the House, and \nauthorizes the Chair to appoint conferees with a ratio of 11 to 9.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] moves that the managers \n     on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment to \n     the bill S. 1932 be instructed to insist that any conference \n     report shall not include the provisions contained in section \n     8701 of the House amendment relating to the repeal of section \n     754 of the Tariff Act of 1930.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the motion that I am offering today, with \nSenator Byrd's support, urges the Senate conferees on the \nreconciliation bill to oppose efforts by the House to eliminate current \nlaw, to eliminate the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act.\n  This act, which is current law, which Senator Byrd and I originally \nintroduced in 1999 and which was signed into law in 2000, continues to \nplay a very important role in defending American companies from the \ninjuries that unfair trade causes to American workers.\n  Repealing this legislation would be a grievous mistake. Let there be \nno mistake about it, this is about jobs. This is about American jobs. \nThis is about protecting and saving jobs all across our great country \nand in my home State of Ohio, as well as in 47 other States. This is \nabout punishing illegal trade practices, and it is about giving \nsomething back to the victims.\n  The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act is really very simple. \nWe have heard a lot of talk about it. We have heard some criticism \nabout it. But when you boil it down, it is very simple.\n\n  When foreign companies illegally violate our trade laws, they get \npunished. They get fined. What this act does is it takes those fines \nand gives them to the companies that were harmed instead of giving the \nmoney back to the U.S. Treasury. That is it. That is what it does. This \ncompensation provides these injured companies and their workers with a \nremedy and helps them recover\n\n[[Page S13523]]\n\nfrom the damage done by the illegal trade practices.\n  Without this financial compensation, companies would continue to get \nhurt, jobs would continue to be lost, and that would be the end of the \nstory. When we passed this bill a few years ago, we began to change \nthat.\n  The truth is these foreign violators of the law--and that is what \nthey are, they are violators of the law--think that this is just a cost \nof doing business, and they continue to do it. That is why we labeled \nthis bill the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. The point is \nthey continue to do it. They look at the penalties they pay as a cost \nof doing business.\n  The idea behind this act when we passed it was we were not going to \nlet them continue to get away with that and look at this as a cost of \ndoing business. So instead of taking this money and giving it to the \nU.S. Treasury and letting them go merrily on their way, we would take \nthis money and give it to the affected companies so these U.S. \ncompanies who employ U.S. workers could then take that money and invest \nit back into those companies, invest it for U.S. workers. That is what \nthey have to do by law. And it has worked.\n  After the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act was implemented a \nfew years ago, the disbursement reports have demonstrated the full \nextent of the dumping and the unfair trade problems our country faces. \nLet me give an example.\n  In 2004, no less than 458 companies received funds through this act. \nThat means 458 of them were violated, had been abused. Across the \nUnited States, more than 700 producers in 48 States have received \ndistributions from duties collected under our trade laws under this act \nwhich tells us that nearly every State in the United States of America \nis affected by unfair trade. Virtually every Senator in this body \nrepresents a State that has been helped by this law.\n  These recipients range from large, medium, small companies to family-\nowned businesses, independent workers, farmers, and fishermen. In my \nhome State of Ohio alone, over 35 companies have benefited from the \nContinued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, including businesses in \nAkron, Canton, Cincinnati, Columbus, Youngstown, Warren, and Wooster.\n  The financial distributions have allowed businesses to reinvest in \ntheir operations, train workers, provide health care and pension \nprograms, and keep high-wage, high-skilled jobs in our country. It \nmatters. It is important.\n  Despite the many benefits that the Continued Dumping and Subsidy \nOffset Act has given our economy, some opponents argue that we must \nrepeal it. Why? They say we must repeal it to comply with the WTO's \nrulings against the law. We must follow what the WTO tells this \nCongress to do, tells this country what to do. I disagree.\n  There is no reason the United States should abandon this law as an \neffective tool in trade talks. Why should we give it up? Like my friend \nand colleague, Senator Craig, said on this floor yesterday, there is \nnothing in any WTO ruling that tells countries what to do with the \nproceeds from the fines collected from illegal trade practices. We \nnever agreed to that. The United States never entered into any \nagreement where we said we couldn't do this.\n  Why are we letting the WTO tell us these fines can't go back to the \ntrue victims, can't go back to the companies and the employees, can't \ngo back to the people who have been hurt by foreign companies' dumping \npractices?\n  I find it somewhat ironic that some of the people who want to repeal \nthis law that has worked so well are some of my same colleagues who \ncome to the floor and talk about and criticize activist judges in the \nUnited States. We do not like activist judges in the United States. We \ndo not like judges who dream up laws, who go beyond the letter of the \nlaw, who go beyond what Congress has written. Why do we want then to \nfollow the WTO when the WTO goes well beyond any agreement this country \nhas entered into? Why do we want to follow them down the road when they \nhave been creative, when they have been activists? Why do we want to \nfollow the logic that says we have to follow them? It makes no sense. \nThey are the ones who are being the activist judges, so to speak. We \nshould not do it.\n  The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport in this Chamber because Members know that the act has provided \na lifeline to thousands of manufacturers, farmers, and fishermen \nthroughout our Nation, people who have faced aggressive, unfair trade \npractices on the part of foreign producers.\n  Over the past couple of years, at least 71 other Senators currently \nserving in this body have joined me in opposing the act's repeal. \nToday--and tomorrow when we vote on it--we need to reiterate that \nsupport and to vote to build upon our past successes.\n  Unless our laws work to encourage all competitors to play by the \nrules, it is more difficult for U.S. producers to regain a declining \nmarket share and it makes it impossible to restore jobs that have been \nlost. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act is simply good \npublic policy. It helps ensure that our domestic producers can compete \nfreely and fairly in global markets. I strongly urge my colleagues to \noppose its repeal.\n  I conclude by one additional comment. I have heard people say that \nthis act, this law, represents special interests. I am dumbfounded by \nthat comment. When in the world did it become a special interest to \nprotect American jobs? When is looking out for American workers a \nspecial interest? Are American workers a special interest group? Is \nmaking sure we have a level playing field in regard to trade practices \na special interest? Are American workers a special interest group? I am \ndumbfounded by that comment. I do not understand it.\n  I am the strongest supporter in the world of free trade, fair trade, \nbut to say that a law such as this that only goes into effect when it \nhas already been proven that there has been a violation of trade laws, \nwhen it has already been proven that there has been illegal dumping, a \nlaw that only does the simple thing of compensating victims who have \nsuffered by illegal dumping, and to say that is special interest \nlegislation, I do not understand it. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  Seventy-one of my colleagues in this body who are currently serving \nhave said this is not special interest, that standing up for American \nworkers is the right thing to do. I hope the day never comes when \nMembers of the Senate think that standing up for American workers is \nspecial interest. So I hope when this vote comes, probably tomorrow, we \nwill do what we have every right to do, and that is to instruct the \nconferees on what the will of the Senate is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to send a motion to the desk to \ninstruct conferees on the budget reconciliation package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the previous motion is \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I assume my colleague has his own time \nunder the rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, and that will be used.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment to \n     the bill S. 1932 be instructed to insist that any conference \n     report shall not include any of the provisions in the House \n     amendment that reduce funding for the child support program \n     established under part D of title IV of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 651 et seq.), which would reduce funds by \n     $4,900,000,000 over 5 years and have the effect of reducing \n     child support collections by $7,900,000,000 over 5 years and \n     $24,100,000,000 over 10 years, and to insist that the \n     conference report shall not include any restrictions on the \n     ability of States to use Federal child support incentive \n     payments for child support program expenditures that are \n     eligible for Federal matching payments.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am offering the motion on behalf of myself \nand Senators Snowe, Harkin, Cornyn, Obama, Rockefeller and Kennedy. We \nare asking conferees to reject the deep\n\n[[Page S13524]]\n\ncuts that the House made to the child support enforcement program. \nPerhaps some of my colleagues would like to speak on this matter, and \nso I will keep my comments brief.\n  I would hope that this would be a simple vote for my colleagues. The \nSenate needs to send a strong message to conferees that the cuts the \nHouse supported are unacceptable. I would like to remind my colleagues \nwhat those cuts are, and what they mean. The House slashes funding for \nthe child support enforcement program by 10 percent, which is nearly \n$16 billion which will be cut in the next 10 years. In addition, the \nHouse language prevents States from drawing down Federal funds based on \ntheir performance incentive payments.\n  What does that mean for States, and more importantly, what will it \nmean for hard working American families? According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the House cuts will reduce child support collections by \nnearly $7.9 billion in the next 5 years and $24.1 billion in the next \n10 years. My State stands to lose $308 million in Federal funding over \nthe next 10 years, and will lose approximately $468 million in child \nsupport collections.\n  Cutting the child support enforcement program is counterproductive. \nIt means cutting one of the most successful, cost-effective Federal \nprograms in existence. In 2004, the program collected $21.9 billion, \nwhile total costs were kept at $5.3 billion, which is greater than a $4 \ndollar return on every dollar the Federal Government invested. In fact, \ncollections are rising faster than expenditures. Child support programs \nare increasing their cost-efficiency.\n  Being cost-effective, however, is not the greatest achievement of the \nchild support program. Sixty percent of all single parent families \nparticipate in the child support program, and participants are \nprimarily former welfare families or working families with modest \nincomes. It is proven that the child support program directly increases \nself-sufficiency and that families receiving child support are more \nlikely to leave welfare and less likely to return. So these cuts have \nno place in a deficit-reducing measure. If congress cuts this program, \nit will ultimately push more people onto other Federal aid programs.\n  I would also like to remind my colleagues that the Senate already has \na strong record on this issue. Two weeks ago we unanimously adopted an \namendment offered by Senator Harkin, a sense of the Senate in \nopposition to these cuts. Members from both sides of the aisle have \nconsistently opposed the cuts, with the backing of a number of groups, \nranging from the National Governors Association to the Information \nTechnology Association of America.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to find out how these cuts will affect \ntheir constituents, and would urge them to vote based on the families \nthese cuts will impact.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13524-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13524-S13531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if other matters come up, I would be \npleased to conclude my remarks and yield to others who may be speaking \nrelative to the reconciliation matter. But I want to talk at this time \nabout the PATRIOT Act, and I want to go straight to the heart of the \ncomplaint that we have had against it by first observing that most of \nthe complaints that we have heard, from my perspective, are emotive. \nThey are not specific. Generally, they boil down to say we can't allow \nour liberties to be eroded out of fear that the terrorists would win--\nwords to that effect. Certainly, that is true. There is no doubt about \nthat.\n  Some contend that we have rushed into the PATRIOT Act, that all facts \nwere not considered, that the bill was moved rapidly, and they suggest \nthat provisions dangerous to our liberties were placed in the PATRIOT \nAct as a result of the emotions that arose after 9/11. But that is not \ntrue. I was on the Judiciary Committee when all of this occurred. I \nremember the debate that occurred. This legislation was carefully \ndrafted. The best minds in our country participated. The Judiciary \nchairman, Orrin Hatch, and his ranking member, Senator Patrick Leahy, \ndeserve great credit for that. The U.S. Department of Justice was \nengaged, groups from the left and the right, civil liberties groups, \nthe American Civil Liberties Union. All of those groups knew what was \nbeing considered. They had an opportunity to and did comment on the \nlanguage.\n  The Senate gave it careful attention, and the legislation moved. But \nit took some time for it to move. We spent a great deal of time \nconsidering the language. Anything that raised the slightest \npossibility of being abused, or even some theoretical fear that it \ncould somehow be abused, was considered carefully. Every line was \nexamined. Every word was examined. Words and lines and provisions were \naltered continually to address the concerns and fears some people had.\n  Law enforcement procedures long used and long approved by the Supreme \nCourt were attacked during this process as somehow violating the \nfundamental liberties of Americans.\n  It was breathtaking to me as a prosecutor of over 15 years to hear \nsome of the charges being raised against practices that amount to \nnothing more than standard police procedure which are done in every \nState and every county in America. It was attacked as something that \nwas somehow going to destroy the liberties that this country takes so \nseriously.\n  It is OK, I would say. That is good debate. It is a free country, and \nmaybe it is good that our watchdogs are ever ready to point out any \nerror. And perhaps some of the changes we made were better as a result \nof complaints that were raised. I don't dispute that. Some changes, \nhowever, I think were probably not good. But at any rate, great efforts \nwere made to allay the fears and concerns and make sure this bill did \nnot go too far.\n  Yes, it is good to have watchdogs, but you don't want the watchdogs \nbiting the house owner. I want to have a bill that protects the owner \nof the house.\n  We discussed these issues and addressed them line by line. Senator \nLeahy, ranking member, civil libertarian for sure, made certain that \nthe process was open. So did Senator Hatch. Even the most arcane fears \nwere addressed. It was a good process.\n  We left out things in this legislation that I would liked to have \nseen. But those things eroded some support, and people were concerned \nabout it, and we left that out. But surely we have not forgotten that \nthis debate just occurred 4 years ago. It was full and vigorous, and \nthe legislation we passed was certainly not something that was rushed \nthrough without consideration.\n  Most importantly, we took down the wall that prohibited our Central \nIntelligence Agency and Defense agencies to gather intelligence around \nthe world that might be relevant to attacks on our homeland.\n  This wall--this legal barrier--prevented them from sharing that \ninformation with the investigative forces in the United States, the \nFBI, and the local police, so that they could use it to protect the \ncitizens of America. There was a wall created by the Church committee--\nan overreaction, frankly, to the Watergate problems that arose during \nthat period of time. And they created this wall. So the data and the \ninformation couldn't be shared with the FBI, and the FBI couldn't share \ninformation with them. This wall perhaps even prevented the FBI from \nfinding more information that would validate information they already \nhad, and therefore left us less able to defend America and to \neffectively utilize information about criminal elements that would be \nimportant to us. This was an unbelievable situation. But it was the law \nof the United States.\n  Some people say surely the agents are not going to do that. Surely, \nif Defense agencies or the CIA found information that a terrorist \norganization may be threatening America, they would pass it to the FBI. \nNo. They were\n\n[[Page S13525]]\n\nnot. It was against the law that Congress passed. I think there were \nbits of evidence proved that indicated that had that wall not be there \nwe might possibly have stopped 9/11. But it is easy to see after the \nfact that there are circumstances in which that wall would have allowed \nanother 9/11 to happen when, and if it had not existed, we could have \nstopped it. There is no doubt about that. It is easy to see scenarios \nwhere that would happen.\n  So that is one of the most important things that was part of this \nact. It was important.\n  This bill is expiring. If we don't extend it now, that wall will go \nback up.\n  I say to my colleagues, this legislation is critical to national \nsecurity. It is extremely critical to our national security. We are \nthankful and most pleased that we have gone now 4 years since 9/11 \nwithout another major attack on our homeland. It is something that I \nwould not have thought possible. I can tell you that one reason it has \nnot occurred and that we have not had another attack is our local law \nenforcement, our FBI, and our intelligence agencies which are working \ntogether effectively, and with a focus we have never had before on \nthese kind of issues. It is remarkable what they are doing. They have \ngiven their heart and soul to it. Frankly, it amazes me to hear people \non the floor of the Senate and outside of the Senate often suggesting \nthat the FBI and our investigative agencies are threats to us. There is \na paranoia that is not helpful.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor. I worked with the FBI for many years. \nThese individuals are patriots. They are working night and day to \nprotect our country. We have created many hurdles for them that are \ndifficult for them to overcome and which can actually impair their \nability to identify and prosecute terrorist cells that may be operating \nin our country today. It is not a theoretical matter. This is a matter \nof tremendous importance. We need to focus on it.\n  I will go straight to the areas raised as concerns and that have \nformed the basis of objections from many of our colleagues--some of our \ncolleagues, not many--and from outside groups.\n  I recall the Senate PATRIOT Act bill cleared the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee 18 to 0. It passed the Senate unanimously by unanimous \nconsent. The legislation then went to conference committee. Much \ndiscussion and debate went on with regard to the House version and the \nSenate version. Frankly, they were not that much apart. Compromises \nwere reached. The Senate bill did rather well as these things go in \nterms of our side prevailing. We came out with a pretty good bill. I \nwas excited about it.\n  I am disappointed now we have Members of this Senate filibustering \nthe PATRIOT Act, alleging that there is some sort of big change that \nhas occurred that threatens the liberties of Americans and that we do \nnot need to extend it. It is beyond my comprehension.\n  Let's talk about some of the issues. I will do it the best I can, \nfairly and objectively. I will try to say what I think the provisions \nmean. I will try to give a historical context for these provisions and \nmake some comments with regard to why they are important tools for our \nlaw enforcement.\n  Our investigators are American heroes. They are working in every \ncommunity. Before September 11, we had, I believe in Arizona, people \nlearning to fly an airplane. They did not want to learn how to land it; \nthey just wanted to learn how to fly it. In Wisconsin, Minnesota, we \nhad other information that came up which was not properly assimilated \nand not properly evaluated. We had information from Florida that a \nnumber of terrorist groups had been stopped for speeding and other \nactivities. The dots were not connected at that time. We know those \nstories. We were not as focused at that time as we are today post-\nSeptember 11. We are more focused today.\n  Some of the problems we had at that time were a result of inadequate \nlaws and procedures that made it even more difficult for investigators \nto investigate national security threats and terrorist threats, than it \nis to investigate dope dealers and tax evaders--unbelievable, but it is \nso.\n  There has also been a lot of discussion about national security \nletters, what they are and how they operate. I would like to have seen \nterrorist investigators given administrative subpoena power. That is \nsomething other agencies have. The Drug Enforcement Administration can \nissue subpoenas for financial records, telephone toll records, motel \nrecords, and bank records. They just issue a subpoena, and they give \nthem a record. The IRS can get records like that in the same way. The \nCustoms Service and many other agencies have the ability to obtain \nrecords administratively.\n  But people were concerned about this and said this would be abused. \nWe worked and worked on it. This is what we came up with. It is a very \nmodest proposal. It is a proposal and a legislative enactment which is \nfair, which is restrained, which is consistent with our history as a \nnation and consistent with approved criminal justice procedures by the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  For example, the national security letter is a procedure by which the \nFederal investigative agent can request information from a third party \nto obtain financial records, telephone toll records, credit reporting \nrecords, and a limited number of records like that. You cannot get \nmedical records. You cannot get library records with a national \nsecurity letter. But these are the routine things often critical to \ninvestigating a terrorist organization. It is extremely important. \nThese cases can move very fast. If you have to have a court order to \nget it and you need the information on Friday night but cannot get a \njudge somewhere, death can result. It can be a matter of life and \ndeath. It can be a matter of whether an investigation breaks your way \nand you get the key information necessary to penetrate a terrorist cell \nor not. This is absolutely consistent with what other agencies have as \na matter of their legitimate power. We ought to be able to do that in \nterrorist investigations, for heavens' sake. There is no doubt about \nthat. This is extremely important.\n  Looking at the perspective, it is very important--and I know the \nPresiding Officer is a lawyer--to understand the principles of privacy \nand search and seizures that are at stake. These subpoenas are not \nsubpoenas to an individual's personal, private records; these are \nsubpoenas issued to third parties. A defendant does not own the \ntelephone toll records. If he does not want the telephone company to \nknow whom he has called, he should not use the phone company. Everyone \nin the phone company can access the phone numbers he calls--not the \ncontents of the conversation--and can find out whom that person has \ncalled. When you go to the bank and use it, the bank maintains records \non your account. Those are not your records; they are the bank's \nrecords. If you have a credit reporting agency that has collected \npublic data on your payments, they can examine it; why can't an \ninvestigator investigating a terrorist have access to that, pray tell? \nIn these areas, there is not the same expectation of privacy.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has said repeatedly for the last 100 years or \nmore that you do not have the same expectation of privacy you have in \nthose records because they are not yours. They are somebody else's \nrecords. You have an expectation of privacy and the search and seizure \nlaws and search warrants apply to matters in your house, matters in \nyour car, matters at your office desk, any location in which you have \nexclusive control and dominion. If it is yours, you have a right to it, \nand the Government cannot come into your house, cannot come into your \nbusiness and take those kinds of records without a search warrant \napproved by a Federal judge based on probable cause. They have to file \naffidavits under oath stating what facts are there to justify the entry \ninto an individual's home or business to obtain those personal records.\n  This national security letter has nothing to do with the records \npeople own. It in no way changes that historic right that your private \nproperty cannot be taken or searched without a warrant approved by a \nFederal judge in a Federal case. These are records belonging to third \nparties, and they are subpoenaed every day. Every district attorney in \nAmerica can subpoena your telephone toll records if he believes they \nare relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. That is the \nstandard. That is the standard for Federal prosecutors. The U.S. \nattorney--which I\n\n[[Page S13526]]\n\nwas for 12 years--issued tens of thousands of subpoenas for those kinds \nof records routinely on the simple test of whether it is relevant to an \nongoing criminal investigation. If you are investigating a drug dealer, \na drug deal goes down, and the dealer says, I don't know John Jones, \nand you subpoena his telephone toll records and see that he made 8 \nphone calls or 25 phone calls to John Jones in the hours leading up to \nthe dope deal, you have pretty good proof to use at trial. That is the \nway you make cases. That is the way investigations are done. If they \nsay, I didn't make any money off that, you check his bank record, and \nsee that he deposited $10,000 in cash. That is proof that goes toward \nwhether this person was engaged in selling dope for cash. That is the \nway you prove cases every day. This is the way you have to prove cases \nagainst terrorists. I make that big point.\n  I have heard people on national television say they can go into your \nhouse and search your house without a warrant. Absolutely not true. The \ngreat protections to your home and property were changed not one whit \nby the PATRIOT Act.\n  It simply allowed the Federal investigators in terrorist \ninvestigations to have a much improved ability to timely obtain \nrecords. I am telling you, when you are investigating one of these \ngroups and you get a call, a tip, from someone who says, there is a \ngroup over here that is pretty dangerous, and we just heard one of the \nterrorists is coming in from out of the country to meet with them, and \nyou need to check their telephone toll records or check the motel to \nsee if they have been at this motel, to verify whether this occurred, \nsubpoenas can be issued like that. But you do not need to have to go to \nthe FISA court, a Federal court, to get approval any more than a local \ndistrict attorney would have to do that. As I have indicated, other \nagencies have these requirements, have these abilities today. It is no \nbig deal, in my view.\n  Now, what else did we require here? We required that the individual \nissuing this national security letter, the Federal agency that approves \nit, certify that it is a national security matter. That is an important \ncertification. They have to do that under oath. Some people may think: \nWell, they may not comply with that. They could go and break in your \nhouse without any warrant. But that is not the way Federal agencies \noperate. I have worked with them for the biggest part of my career. \nThey do not violate the law. They do not violate this wall between the \nCIA and the FBI. We have seen that to be true. They do what they are \ntold according to the law. Congress makes these laws, and we need to \nmake sure that laws make sense and do not undermine the ability of \nthose out there working every day to be successful in their work. So it \nhas to be certified, and if an agent lies about that, he or she can \nlose his or her job, trust me.\n  They also have to certify that it is a matter that endangers the \nnational security. I think that is too high a burden, frankly. Maybe \nyou do not have that much proof right now that it actually endangers \nnational security, but it is a terrorist organization that you need to \ndig into and watch more closely. But we have to certify to that. That \nwas part of what it took to get the bill passed, and we just have to \nlive with that. It is something I am not happy with.\n  Remember, the recipients of these national security letters are third \nparties who have records--the phone company, the bank, and those kinds \nof agencies. They can object. They said: Well, they can't object. Yes, \nthey can object. They can file a motion to quash under this bill if \nthere is any abusiveness there, and they can object to the secrecy \nrequirement, and it then requires, if they object, the Attorney General \nof the United States or one designee of his--the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral probably--to personally certify that this is a need in which \nthe national security is implicated. That is what you can do.\n  Let me just pause for a second. Nothing is more important in this act \nthan the fact that we have a system by which our investigators, in \nterrorist cases, can obtain information from entities that have records \nrelating to these terrorist organizations without those entities \ntelling the terrorists we are investigating them. The last thing you \nwant them to know is that you are onto them. That is so basic in law \nenforcement. I have been there. I have seen the investigations of drug \norganizations and things of that kind. You do not want them to know you \nare onto them. Once they know that, they will scatter like a covey of \nquail and not be around. They will regroup somewhere else to carry on \ntheir evil deeds. Now, you can do that today, but let me tell you the \nhistory of it.\n  When I became an assistant U.S. attorney in the 1970s, if you \nsubpoenaed bank records, you would ask the bank or their agents not to \nreport it to the customer, and they would not do it. But in the years \nthat have gone by, the banks have been sued, so they have gotten \nlawyers and feel they have an obligation to their customers. Almost all \nof them have a policy that if a customer's records are subpoenaed, they \nnotify the customer. So that has been a change in policy, and it can be \ndevastating. Sometimes, you desperately need some of those records, but \nyou do not need to tip off the organization you are investigating them. \nMost of the time, these companies have no real objection, because this \neliminates their legal responsibility that lawyers say they may have, \nand this allows them to reveal it. They are satisfied. You get the \nrecords, and they do not tell the terrorist that you are getting them. \nThat is one of the most important things in this whole legislation.\n  So, as I said, they can object. They can object to the fundamentals \nthrough a motion to quash a national security letter, and they can \nobject to the secrecy requirement and require the Attorney General of \nthe United States to certify that it is appropriate to be maintained \nsecret.\n  Further, the bill says the Department must issue an annual public \nreport to the Nation on how many of these have been issued and under \nwhat category.\n  Also, as part of the conference, we dropped legislation that made it \na misdemeanor, with up to 1 year in jail, for a business to violate the \ncourt order and reveal the subpoena to the terrorist. I am amazed we \ndid that. But people objected, and to make people happy, we removed the \ncriminal misdemeanor penalty for somebody who tips off the terrorist \nthat the Government has obtained information on them. I think that is \nterrible, but it is part of it, so it is one of the things I have to \naccept. If some of my colleagues have concern on the other side, they \nhave to realize no bill is perfect, and we take what we can get.\n  I see our Budget Committee chairman, Senator Gregg. I was prepared to \ntalk about some of the issues relating to section 215. We can do that \nlater at another time, and I would be pleased to yield to Chairman \nGregg if he has some matters he wishes to discuss at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I would actually like to get a \nclarification from the Senator from Alabama because I know he is an \nexpert on this issue, having been a U.S. attorney and having been one \nof the leading authorities on legal activity here in our country. \nBecause earlier in the day the assistant leader from the Democratic \nside of the aisle came to the Senate floor and made an extensive \nstatement about how abusive the present bill, which is being moved \nforward, is, and specifically toward libraries, and how, as he \nrepresented it, somebody's records could be subpoenaed from a library, \nbasically carte blanche, and then the library would be gagged from \ndisclosing that information.\n  As I understood it, the bill, as it has worked its way through \nconference, has actually put in place stronger protections for \nlibraries, and actually a terrorist gets more protection than, say, \nsomebody who is in the Mafia; is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I think the Senator is fundamentally \ncorrect. Sometimes investigators need to know which books have you \nchecked out. I prosecuted an individual one time who was a doctor. They \nmade a TV movie out of it. He had a book, a death dealer's manual in \nhis possession and another one on deadly poisons. But when you are \ntrying to prosecute a case, the fact is that this covers even book \nsales, for example.\n  Any district attorney in America today can subpoena the book store \nand\n\n[[Page S13527]]\n\nfind out what you or I bought, if it is relevant to a criminal \ninvestigation. In this case, not only must it be relevant to any \ninvestigation, it must be relevant to a national security investigation \nin which the issuer of the subpoena must certify that it endangers the \nUnited States. It is a very rare occurrence. The only difference is \nthat there is an automatic ability for the Government to request that \nit not be revealed to the person investigated on an immediate basis.\n  These records are available today. The library association, in my \nview, has misunderstood the principle of law enforcement. Yes, you do \nnot want people willy-nilly probing library records to see what people \nare reading. Of course, that is not legitimate. But when you certify it \nis a national security investigation, important to the safety of the \nUnited States, when you issue one of these subpoenas, I can't imagine \nanybody would object to that. It is certainly consistent with the \ngeneralized principle of subpoenaing records. I thank the Senator for \nraising that. I do believe this is out of sync with reality and the \ncomplaints are not justified.\n  If we were to find out that people, agents were probing, going around \nthe country willy-nilly inspecting people's reading habits, this \nCongress would react just like that, and we would pass laws to stop it. \nWe would get people fired if they were doing those kinds of things. \nThat is in violation of Department of Justice procedures and policies. \nAnybody caught doing that would be fired on the spot. That is \nabsolutely improper. But when you are investigating a terrorist \norganization, this is a modest proposal that requires the Government to \nhave a high standard of proof, to support how they have done it, and is \notherwise constrained in a way that the Senate Judiciary Committee \nagreed to by unanimous vote of 18 to nothing.\n  I would like a little later to talk about section 215 which requires \na higher standard, and library records are part of that. With regard to \nlibrary records in particular, along with medical records, you must \npresent that to a Federal court, a FISA court, and get an approval in \nadvance before you can get library records. It requires advance \napproval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order, the first vote be on the Carper \nmotion to instruct, followed by the Baucus motion, and then the Harkin \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, on behalf of myself and Senator Smith of \nOregon, I call up the motion at the desk to instruct conferees \nregarding cuts to Federal food assistance programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] (for himself and Mr. \n     Smith) moves that the managers on the part of the Senate at \n     the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on \n     the House amendment to the bill S. 1932 be instructed to \n     insist that any reconciliation conference report agreed to \n     jointly by the House and the Senate does not contain any cuts \n     to Federal food assistance programs, including the food stamp \n     program established under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 \n     U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), for the following reasons:\n       (1) The Federal food stamp program is the first-line of \n     defense in the United States against hunger and food \n     insecurity, providing nutrition assistance for over \n     25,000,000 people in the United States.\n       (2) 80 percent of benefits under the food stamp program, \n     over $23,000,000,000 in 2005, are provided to families with \n     children, making the program the most important form of \n     nutrition assistance for children in the United States.\n       (3) Hunger and food insecurity in the United States are \n     rising, with a recent study by the Department of Agriculture \n     finding that--\n       (A) 38,200,000 people in the United States live in \n     households that were food insecure in 2004;\n       (B) the number of food insecure individuals increased by \n     nearly 2,000,000 between 2003 and 2004; and\n       (C) since 2000, the number of individuals classified by \n     Department of Agriculture as food insecure rose by 7,000,000.\n       (4) The food stamp program plays an important role during \n     natural disasters and has provided emergency food assistance \n     to approximately 2,200,000 individuals affected by Hurricanes \n     Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, allowing disaster victims to obtain \n     critical food within days.\n       (5) The food stamp program operates efficiently and \n     effectively, with its error rate at an all-time low.\n       (6) Reductions in funding for the food stamp program would \n     constitute cuts in or loss of benefits to currently eligible \n     individuals and families and would not come out of fraud, \n     waste, or abuse.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I understand that under the order, I \nhave a couple minutes to speak about this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was told I had 2 minutes and then 1 minute before the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order was 2 minutes evenly divided \npreceding the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I apologize. Then is there another minute before the \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the Senate has considered cuts to food \nassistance programs this year on a bipartisan basis. It rejected such \ncuts. I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, especially \nChairman Chambliss for his leadership. This motion is simple. It \ninstructs the Senate conferees to insist upon the underlying Senate \nposition of no cuts to Federal food assistance.\n  First, we are at a time when hunger and food insecurity in the United \nStates is increasing rapidly. The number of Americans experiencing food \ninsecurity has increased by approximately 7 million people. This is no \ntime to cut the food stamp program.\n  Secondly, with all of the emergencies this year with the hurricanes, \nwe have been reminded again of how the food stamp program works in \nemergencies. There were 2.2 million individuals affected by these \nhurricanes who got critical food assistance within days.\n  Finally, again, this has nothing to do with waste, fraud, and abuse. \nThe error rate is at an all-time low in the food stamp program. We have \nworked on this for over 20 some years to bring it that low. It is \nworking very effectively. The fact is, the House reconciliation bill \ndoes not go after fraud, waste, and abuse, but they cut 250,000 people \noff the food stamp program. That is the wrong way to go.\n  I thank my colleagues for standing up for hungry families earlier \nthis year. Especially at this Christmas season, let's stand up for them \nonce again and say we are not going to take the food out of the \nchildren's mouths.\n  I urge my colleagues to agree to the motion, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I call up a motion to instruct which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment to \n     the bill S. 1932 be instructed to not report a conference \n     report that would impair access to, undermine eligibility \n     for, make unaffordable by increasing beneficiary cost-\n     sharing, adversely affect Medicaid services, or in any way \n     undermine Medicaid's Federal guarantee of health insurance \n     coverage with respect to low-income children, pregnant women, \n     disabled individuals, elderly individuals, individuals with \n     chronic illnesses like HIV/AIDS, cancer, and diabetes, \n     individuals with mental illnesses, and other Medicaid \n     beneficiaries.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this motion instructs the Senate \nconferees on the spending reconciliation bill not to bring back a \nconference report that hurts Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  Last month, the House passed a spending reconciliation bill that \nwould increase health costs and cut benefits for millions of seniors \nand lower-income Americans who depend on Medicaid.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, three-quarters of the \nMedicaid savings in the House bill came\n\n[[Page S13528]]\n\nfrom the these cuts. The bill would increase costs for 17 million \npeople, cut benefits for 5 million people, and force tens of thousands \noff of Medicaid.\n  We know the damage that increasing health costs can cause. We have \nseen it happen. Oregon imposed just a nominal premium for some on \nMedicaid--from $6 to $20 a month. Within 10 months, nearly half of the \npeople forced to pay had been dropped from coverage. Three-quarters of \nthose who were dropped became uninsured.\n  These changes impose a tax on our poorest citizens.\n  And these changes also burden doctors, hospitals, and clinics that \ntreat Medicaid patients. States will deduct the fees regardless of \nwhether providers ever get paid. Healthcare providers will pass these \nuncompensated costs along through higher rates for all patients in the \nprivate market.\n  Many poor people will pay more, but get less. The House bill allows \nStates to cut Medicaid benefits. Although the bill would protect the \npoorest children, millions of children would no longer get the medical \ncare that they need. People with disabilities and chronic conditions \nwould also be at risk.\n  Some say we need to look at Medicaid's rising costs, and I agree. We \nneed to get a handle on spending and make this program sustainable. But \nshifting costs and cutting benefits for our poorest and least able to \npay is not the smart way to do it.\n  This motion instructs Senate conferees on the reconciliation bill to \nreject the House changes to Medicaid that would hurt Medicaid \nbeneficiaries or undermine Medicaid's guarantee. The Senate must take a \nstand in support of the neediest among us.\n  Let us ensure that we do no harm to the vulnerable people whom \nMedicaid serves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes on the Baucus motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, there is general feeling that the Baucus \nproposal is--I don't use this in a pejorative sense--benign enough so \nthat everybody can agree to it.\n  But I do think it is important to understand, relative to the \nMedicaid issue, that Governors, in a bipartisan way, have come forward \nand put down some proposals that are really creative, where they feel \nthey can dramatically expand coverage and significantly save money. \nSome of those do involve using copays of some sort relative to higher \nincome individuals. Having been a Governor--and I know there are other \nformer Governors in this Chamber--I think the flexibility the Governors \nwant is reasonable.\n  I hope we will come back from conference with language that will give \nGovernors the flexibility necessary to allow them to do creative things \nin the Medicaid accounts which will save us money, save the States \nmoney, and end up with more coverage. That should be our game plan--\nmore people being covered. I think it is doable because a creative \nGovernor who has energy and guts and staff people who are effective--\nand most Governors do--can do a lot if they are given flexibility and \nthe ability to move forward without being straitjacketed by Federal \nregulations. So that will be our goal in conference. I don't think it \nis inconsistent with what the Senator from Montana has proposed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is to be recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 2 minutes on a motion I have at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment to \n     the bill S. 1932 be instructed to insist that any conference \n     report shall not include the provisions in the House \n     amendment relating to the reauthorization of the Temporary \n     Assistance for Needy Families Program, including those which \n     would increase work hours for single mothers with young \n     children, impose new cuts on already inadequate child care \n     funding and other proven work supports such as child support, \n     restrict education and training, and reduce State \n     flexibility, and insist that Congress enact free standing \n     legislation that builds on the bipartisan Senate Committee on \n     Finance's reported version of the Personal Responsibility and \n     Individual Development for Everyone Act (the PRIDE Act, S. \n     667) to reauthorize the Nation's welfare-to-work laws.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, for the last 3 years that we have been \nin the Senate, I have been pushing my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and pushing the administration and my colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives to reauthorize Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies. We first authorized it in 1996. There was a 5- or 6-year \nauthorization that had lapsed, and we need to renew it and establish a \npath forward for welfare programs in my State, your State, and all \nother States across this country.\n  The Senate Finance Committee has approved unanimously, without \ndissent, legislation to reauthorize it for another 5 years. It is out \nof committee and ready to come to the floor. We should take it up, \ndebate it, amend it, if we see fit, pass it, and go to conference with \nthe House.\n  The House passed their own reauthorization measure, which is \nimperfect in my view. I will mention a couple of problems I have with \nit. As the Governor of Delaware and lead Governor of the National \nGovernors Association on welfare reform, it occurred to me that if you \nwant people to get off welfare and go to work, they need help with \ntaking care of their kids, and we needed to make sure they had decent \nhealth care for the children. If they don't have that, they are not \ngoing to be successful in going to work. The measure reported out of \nthe Committee provided extra money for childcare support. It is needed.\n  There is another problem. Under current law, if you are on welfare, \nyou have to work 30 hours a week. However, if you have young kids under \nthe age of 6, you can work as little as 20 hours a week, not 30 or 40 \nhours. The House measure says everybody has to work 40 hours a week if \nyou are on welfare. That may sound good at the outset, but if you don't \nhave money for childcare to help with the extra time people are going \nto be working, it is not going to work. Say somebody has a week-old or \nmonth-old or year-old child. They are going to have to work 40 hours a \nweek.\n  I ask for support on the motion. Let the committee bring the bill \nforward and debate it and vote and go to conference.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I support Senator Carper's motion to \ninstruct reconciliation conferees to reject the House TANF provisions. \nAssisting needy families is too important an issue for this Chamber to \ncede its legislative authority to the House of Representatives. The \nTANF Program affects millions of American children and families. It \ndeserves a full and fair debate.\n  The reconciliation process does not permit that debate. \nReconciliation is not the place for policy changes.\n  The right starting point for Senate debate is the PRIDE bill. PRIDE \nis not a perfect bill. But it is a reasonable bipartisan effort that \naddresses childcare, transitional medical assistance, and certain \neducational opportunities.\n  Mr. President, we should have a full debate on the PRIDE bill. We \nshould consider what the evidence actually says about moving people \nfrom welfare to work, from dependence to independence, from poverty to \nprosperity. We should have a full debate about what is really required \nto provide all Americans with equal opportunity.\n  Unfortunately, reconciliation does not permit that debate. Worse yet, \nthe House provisions are based not on evidence and experience but on \nideology.\n  The cynical increase in the work hour requirement, for example, is a \nFederal mandate with no basis in the\n\n[[Page S13529]]\n\nreality of what works to promote work and reduce poverty. The data \nshows that people meeting the current 30-hour requirement work about 35 \nhours now. That is a bit more than the national average for ``full \ntime'' work for all employees, whether they receive TANF or not. \nIndeed, among all mothers with children under the age of 6, only 43 \npercent work as much as 35 hours.\n  People who don't meet the 30-hour TANF requirement now--for whatever \nreason--are not going to work more just because the requirement has \nbeen increased. What will happen is that Congress will punish the \nStates and reduce State flexibility to do what works.\n  In my own State of Illinois, we are committed to moving people off \nwelfare and into work. And Illinois is not cynical about it. This isn't \nabout pinching pennies but about providing opportunity.\n  Illinois is serious about the need for work. Tens of thousands of \nfamilies have worked their way off assistance. But we understand why \npeople find themselves in need of assistance. We have adopted flexible \nrules to accommodate families where the wage earner was medically \nunable to work, where a spouse or child was disabled, where the worker \nwas finishing up a training program.\n  Illinois requires work but allows people to work part time while they \ntake care of their obligations. And to get mothers out of their homes \nand into the workforce in a productive way, we have improved the child \ncare subsidy system. We have invested in it.\n  And you know what? People in Illinois have not lingered on TANF. If \nthey could work their way off the program, they have done so.\n  Unfortunately, the House TANF provisions which raise participation \nrates to 75 percent will make it harder for States to deal with family \nsickness, the realities of raising children, and natural disasters. To \navoid penalties, States will have to find make-work activities even for \nTANF recipients who are working full time.\n  Another problem is that raising work hours and participation rates \nwill increase the need for childcare well beyond the funding provided \nin the House bill. Childcare funding makes work possible for many \nwomen. If we want people to work and be responsible parents, we have to \nworry about who will care for their kids. Under the House proposal, \nStates will be forced to fund other activities that will leave them \nwith less money for childcare. That makes no sense.\n  The House TANF provisions make it harder for States to support \nworking families. I urge my colleagues to reject those provisions in \nreconciliation, and I look forward to an honest debate about TANF and \nthe PRIDE bill here on the Senate floor.\n  I also rise today to speak in favor of the motion to instruct offered \nby Senator Kohl. This motion expresses the Senate's view that the \nSenate conferees should not accept the cuts to the child support \nprogram that have been proposed by the Committee on Ways and Means in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The child support program is an effective and efficient way to \nenforce the responsibility of noncustodial parents to support their \nchildren. For every public dollar that is spent on collection, more \nthan four dollars are collected to support children. That is a good \nreturn on our investment in families. Moreover, these families are then \nless likely to require public assistance and more likely to avoid or \nescape poverty. This is a program that works.\n  The evidence is compelling. For example, in 2004, enforcement efforts \nhelped collect almost $22 billion in child support. Our aggressive \nState and Federal efforts have translated into $1 billion in collected \nchild support payments in Illinois alone this year. That means 386,000 \nIllinois families will be better equipped to provide for their \nchildren.\n  Preliminary budget estimates suggest the cuts proposed by the Ways \nand Means Committee will translate into $7.9 billion in lost \ncollections within 5 years, increasing to a loss of over $24 billion \nwithin 10 years. This proposal is not even penny-wise, and it is \ncertainly pound-foolish.\n  Today, the State of Illinois reports a 32 percent child support \ncollection rate. Let's not take a step backward in the progress that \nhas been made by stripping the States of necessary Federal support. The \nwelfare of too many is at stake.\n  Child support is the second largest income source for qualifying low-\nincome families. We should not balance our budget on the backs of \nfamilies that rely on child support to remain out of poverty.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion as well. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, we yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to instruct conferees offered by \nthe Senator from Delaware.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that on the next \ntwo votes they be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes evenly divided prior to \nthe vote on the Baucus motion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this motion instructs the Senate \nconferees on the pending reconciliation bill not to bring back a \nconference report that hurts Medicaid beneficiaries. In fact, these \nchanges amount to a tax on our poorest citizens. They also burden \ndoctors, hospitals, other providers who will pass on the costs to them. \nMore poor people will pay more, but they will get less. It does not \nmake sense. We are cutting Medicaid to take it out of the hide of the \npoorest people of our country, and that is Medicaid recipients.\n\n[[Page S13530]]\n\n  May I also say I am supported by a strong letter from a number of \nSenators on the other side of the aisle. This letter asks the same; \nthat we do not adopt these harsh House Medicaid cuts. I ask unanimous \nconsent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13, 2005.\n     Hon. William H. Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist: Throughout the budget process \n     we have been concerned about the impact to America's lowest \n     income and most vulnerable from policies implemented to \n     secure budget savings. We were heartened by the Senate's \n     effort to protect these Americans by utilizing system \n     efficiencies and eliminating waste and abuse from the \n     Medicaid program. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives \n     did not take a similar path. Therefore, as the Senate begins \n     its work to reconcile the two budget reconciliation bills, we \n     urge you to hold firm in defending the Senate's policies \n     regarding Medicaid.\n       Medicaid is a vitally important program that serves almost \n     54 million poor, disabled, chronically ill and elderly \n     Americans. It provides a range of benefits from screenings \n     and vaccinations for the young, to home health and long term \n     care for the elderly. Given the breadth and diversity of the \n     people it helps, Congress must remain committed to the \n     strength and viability of Medicaid.\n       As indicated by the strong support from beneficiary groups, \n     advocates and providers, the Senate bill ensures that the \n     most vulnerable among us are not called upon to carry the \n     burden of balancing the budget. This was accomplished by \n     adhering to a few key principles. First, the Senate bill \n     limits the cuts to a total of $10 billion, the savings level \n     which the Finance Committee was instructed to achieve. The \n     bill utilizes both Medicare and Medicaid to reach the \n     required $10 billion in budget savings, and holds the net \n     level of Medicaid cuts to under $5 billion. Most importantly, \n     the Senate bill does not achieve any savings through policies \n     that would negatively impact beneficiaries. We strongly urge \n     you to continue to defend these principles and preserve the \n     Senate's policies on Medicaid in the final budget \n     reconciliation agreement.\n       In particular, we are concerned with policies included in \n     the House bill that would impose new cost-sharing \n     requirements on beneficiaries, alter eligibility policies for \n     long term care that impact the middle-c1ass, and provide \n     unlimited flexibility to states to change benefits. These \n     proposals were debated within the Senate and soundly \n     rejected.\n       We look forward to working with you on developing a \n     conference report that can garner wide support among Senators \n     and supporters of the Medicaid program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gordon Smith.\n     Norm Coleman.\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Lincoln Chafee.\n     Susan Collins.\n     Olympia Snowe.\n     Mike DeWine.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, this will be a 10-minute vote, as well as \nthe following vote, so I hope Senators will stay around to accomplish \nthose votes promptly.\n  Second, we intend in conference, should we be successful in going to \nconference under the leadership of Senator Grassley, to bring back a \nbill which will effectively address the issues of Medicaid, and we see \nthe opportunity here to follow very closely, hopefully, the proposals \nof the Governors, which are bipartisan in nature.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe we hope to follow closely the proposals of the \nGovernors, which are bipartisan in nature, and give the Governors the \nflexibility they need in order to accomplish significant Medicaid \nreform, which will mean extending Medicaid to more people but doing it \nin a more efficient way, which will save us more money. We actually \ndon't see that this language impairs that effort, and we think we can \nreport a very effective bill with or without this language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are 2 minutes equally divided in \nrelation to the motion by Senator Harkin to instruct conferees.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are now going to vote on a motion to \ninstruct conferees. Stick with the Senate's position dealing with cuts \nin the Food Stamp Program. I know arguments have been made about waste, \nfraud, and abuse. What the House does does not cut waste, fraud, and \nabuse but cuts 200,000 people off the food stamp rolls. They are \nworking poor. They work every day. They have children. This sends them \nback on welfare rolls.\n  I point out there was a letter sent to Senator Chambliss on December \n8 from 15 Republican Senators saying, please stick with the Senate \nposition. I compliment those Senators. I publicly thank Senator \nChambliss for his great leadership both on the Agriculture Committee \nand in the full Senate on this issue.\n  This is not the time to cut food stamps from people who are working \nand struggling with their children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I also wish to compliment the \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, who brought to us reconciliation \ninstructions out of his committee which did not cut food stamps. But I \ndo think it would be a mistake for us to tie Senator Chambliss's or \nanybody's hands as they move forward in conference.\n  The language which I have concern about in this proposal is the last \nparagraph. Everything up to the last paragraph is OK, but that last \nparagraph catches you because he says:\n\n       Reductions in funding for the food stamp program would \n     constitute cuts in or loss of benefits to currently eligible \n     individuals and families and would not come out of fraud, \n     waste, or abuse.\n\n  Well, it represents the fact that we cannot save any money from food \nstamps out of fraud, waste, and abuse. That is just wrong. There are \nways to save money in food stamps by addressing fraud, waste, and \nabuse. There are a lot of ways. Anybody who has been exposed to the \nprogram knows that.\n\n[[Page S13531]]\n\n  I believe this instruction would be counterproductive to the \nflexibility that Senator Chambliss and others would like as they move \nforward in this conference, and I intend to vote no on it.\n  Mr. President, I believe the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to support the conference \nreport for the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005. \nThat is a long title. We are talking about the PATRIOT Act.\n  I am pleased to report to my colleagues and to the President that the \nHouse just passed the PATRIOT Act with a very strong bipartisan vote. \nWe need to do the same. I thank Chairman Specter for his hard work in \ngetting this important legislation to the conference.\n  This conference report is one of the most important that we will pass \nthis year. We must do it prior to leaving because it contains a number \nof provisions that are absolutely vital to our national security. I say \nthat from my perspective as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Like the original PATRIOT Act, this legislation does contain a number \nof compromises that are not to my liking. But it is often said that the \nmark of a good compromise is that it leaves both sides unhappy. We have \na great number, apparently, who are unhappy about this bill. I think we \ncan safely say that no one is entirely happy with all of the provisions \nin the legislation. Simply put, this is not the best possible bill but \nthe best bill possible under difficult circumstances. Again, it is \nabsolutely needed on behalf of our national security.\n  My primary concern as a conferee was to ensure that the intelligence \ncommunity retains its ability to effectively use the important tools \nthat are provided by the PATRIOT Act, and I think we have accomplished \nthat goal.\n  This act reauthorizes all of the PATRIOT Act provisions that are \nscheduled to sunset at the end of this year. It does, however, impose a \n4-year sunset on the use of FISA court orders for business records and \nroving electronic surveillance and an additional sunset on the FISA--\nwhat is called the lone wolf authority.\n  Personally, I am opposed to these extended PATRIOT Act sunsets. I \nknow Congress has conducted extensive oversight of these provisions. I \nknow the Intelligence Committee and other committees have, and we have \nyet to find any evidence--I know this is not the perception we read \nabout in the newspapers or that we hear on the electronic media, but we \nhave yet to find any evidence of abuse or overreaching with respect to \nthese or any other provisions of the PATRIOT Act.\n  Moreover, this very legislation makes modifications to address the \nperceived problems with the FISA business records and roving wiretap \nprovisions. I ask this simple question: If we fixed these provisions, \nwhy is there need for additional sunsets? It seems to me that Congress \nalways retains the ability to amend the law that is enacted. We have a \nduty to conduct vigorous oversight with the use of these provisions. \nThe Judiciary and Intelligence Committees certainly do that. We don't \nneed and should not use sunsets to compel oversight of these important \nissues. That ought to be our reasonable obligation, and we do meet \nthose obligations.\n  Having said that, I want to highlight the modifications made to two \ninvestigative tools that have been widely mischaracterized, in my view, \nby critics and some in the media--FISA business record court orders and \nnational security letters.\n\n  With regard to the FISA business record court orders, one of the most \ncontentious issues during this conference was whether a relevance-plus \nstandard should be added to the FISA business record provisions. \nCritics argued this tool could be used for fishing expeditions. Our \noversight did reveal that this was not the case, but we agreed that \nrelevance was the proper standard for obtaining a business record court \norder.\n  Some are not satisfied with this approach and demand that we include \nnot only a relevance standard but a requirement to specify facts that \nwould tie the requested records to a foreign power or to an agent of a \nforeign power, a so-called relevance-plus standard. The problem with \nthis is very easy to understand. It is a standard not used on any other \nsubpoena, certainly not requiring the prior approval by a judge like \nthese FISA orders. The standard would also leave gaps in the FBI's \nability to use what is in reality a nonintrusive investigative tool. \nUnder relevance-plus, by then the FBI would have lost the use of \nsection 215 in important circumstances.\n  Ultimately, the conferees reached a compromise to address the \nmisperceptions about section 215. Under the conference report, the \nstandard remains relevance to an authorized investigation. Let me say \nthat again. The standard remains simple relevance to an authorized \ninvestigation. There is no increased burden of proof. The standard \nremains the same as every\n\n[[Page S13532]]\n\nother subpoena that Congress has ever enacted.\n  If the FBI seeks records that are relevant to any authorized, full \ninvestigation or a preliminary investigation, it should be able to \nobtain those records. Under this conference report, it still can. But \nto address the allegations that the scope of lawful national security \ninvestigations is too broad, the conferees included language that does \nprovide for a presumption of relevance if the FBI does provide a \nstatement of facts explaining the link between the requested records \nand one of three statutory categories. Thus, the compromise language \nencourages the FBI to seek the protection of presumptive relevance by \nincluding a link to one of the three statutory categories in its \napplication, but it also maintains the use of investigative technique \nin those limited circumstances that fall outside the three categories.\n  The conferees also placed additional restrictions on section 215 \norders. Under the conference agreement, the records obtained with a \nFISA business record court order must be screened through minimization \nprocedures adopted by the Attorney General. These procedures are not \nrequired for any other subpoena, grand jury, court order, \nadministrative, or otherwise. In my opinion, minimization procedures \nshould not be required for this low-level investigative activity, \nespecially in light of the requirement for prior judicial approval of \nan order.\n  These procedures unfortunately were part of the price we paid to get \nthis legislation passed--a price that I did reluctantly accept to \npreserve this investigative tool. I urged the Attorney General when \nthis bill was passed to adopt flexible minimization procedures.\n  These procedures must maintain the ability of the intelligence \ncommunity to analyze the important foreign intelligence information now \nobtained by FISA business record orders. That information must be made \navailable over an extended period of time so that the intelligence \ncommunity will not lose its ability to connect the so-called dots. One \ncurrent phone number that would be connected to one 2-year-old credit \ncard record that would be connected to one 10-year-old hotel receipt \nmight be the information necessary to stop an attack. We should never \nforget that, especially in the age in which we live.\n  Severe retention or any rules of dissemination for these third-party \nbusiness records will limit the FBI's ability to prevent attacks, and \nthat is the standard we have demanded post-9/11. I can assure you that \nthe Intelligence Committee will examine these procedures with great \ninterest once they are issued.\n  Next, with regard to national security letters--and the acronym for \nthat is NSL--this conference report makes three important \nmodifications.\n  First, it will provide for express enforcement of national security \nletters by creating criminal penalties for noncompliance with the \nrequest.\n  Second, this bill clarifies the process by which the recipients of a \nnational security letter may seek judicial review of requests that are \neither unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise unlawful.\n  Third, this legislation does replace the current blanket \nnondisclosure rule with a process that requires a special certification \nby a high-level official to invoke the protection of the nondisclosure \nprovision. If the official is sufficiently high level, the \ncertification that the disclosure would endanger national security or \ninterfere with foreign relations will not be overturned by a court \nwithout a showing of bad faith.\n\n  Some have questioned the need for nondisclosure provisions on these \nnational security letters or complained that they can be invoked or \ndefended much too easily. I have an opposite concern. I am concerned \nthat the disclosure of the fact that the FBI has sought business \nrecords might hinder the investigation of a terrorist network or an \nespionage ring. Nondisclosure requirements on these national security \nletters are absolutely necessary for the protection of our national \nsecurity. We must all keep in mind that these so-called NSLs are issued \nin the context of classified investigations of terrorists and spies.\n  Make no mistake, the national security letter that requests \ninformation in support of a classified investigation should also be \nclassified. But because many phone companies, Internet service \nproviders, financial institutions, or credit card companies don't have \nthe facilities to handle classified information, these national \nsecurity letters are submitted in unclassified form. The FBI relies on \nthe nondisclosure provisions in the NSL statute to prevent the \ndisclosure of classified investigations of terrorists and spies. \nWithout the protection of a nondisclosure provision, the FBI would have \nto choose between not using a national security letter or taking the \nrisk that its investigation will be disclosed to the spy or terrorist \nunder investigation. We can't afford either option.\n  If a terrorist becomes aware of an FBI investigation that was \ndirected at him based on the fact that a national security letter has \nbeen issued, he obviously can take actions to protect other members of \nhis cell, ensure that the terrorist network does proceed with other \nplanned attacks, or, in the worst-case scenario, speed up the time line \nof a planned attack.\n  We also cannot afford for the FBI to walk away from valuable \nintelligence information from fear the disclosure of a national \nsecurity letter might undermine an ongoing investigation. These NSLs do \nprovide access to limited categories of third-party business records \nthat form the building blocks of national security investigations. They \nallow the FBI to identify the activities of a terrorist or spy and \nothers who associate with them.\n  The conference report maintains the protections of the NSL \nnondisclosure provision. It does modify the nondisclosure provision so \nit is no longer automatic; it must be invoked. It provides the \nrecipients with the avenue to challenge the nondisclosure not once, but \nevery single year. Subsequent challenges also require the Government to \nreexamine the need for secrecy.\n  With these modifications, it seems to me the conference report \nstrikes the balance needed on this issue. First, we protect the very \nlegitimate rights of the recipients and ensure the sensitive \ninvestigations of terrorist and spies certainly are not compromised.\n  So as my colleagues can see, the protections that are provided in the \nconference report for privacy and civil liberties are extensive. In \nfact, I think the modifications to the FISA business record orders and \nthe national security letters should address all concerns raised about \nthese tools. I hope my colleagues who have concerns about this know \nwhat is in this bill as opposed to what the perception is.\n  The conferees did not stop there. In addition to the modifications I \nhave mentioned, the conference report includes the provisions enhancing \nexisting oversight of these tools. For example, the bill requires the \nDepartment of Justice Inspector General to conduct extensive audits of \nboth the use by the FBI of the national security letters and FISA \nbusiness record orders. The bill also expands public reporting on these \ninvestigative tools.\n  I cannot help but note at this point that many of the protections for \nprivacy and civil liberties incorporated in this bill were derived from \nthe protections that the intelligence committee would have applied to \nthe national security administrative subpoena that we reported in June \nin our bill. This conference report has essentially taken all of the \nprotections that were contained in the national security administrative \nsubpoena provision, but it has failed to provide the FBI with the same \nability to access records that now exist in 335 other contexts.\n  Far too often we legislate to the possible rogue FBI agent, one-tenth \nof 1 percent who might go beyond the law. When we take this step, we \ndeprive the other 99.9 percent of FBI agents of a lawful investigative \ntool, and then if something is missed or we have an attack, why, of \ncourse, we blame the FBI. Our oversight reveals no abuses. Yet we \ndeprive our national security investigators of these constitutional \ntools.\n  I challenge opponents of national security administrative subpoenas \nto provide one good reason the FBI should not have the authority. I \nhave listened to their arguments. I still have not heard one good \nreason. Four years removed from 9/11, it is far too easy to put \nrestrictions on the intelligence community that are not necessary or \nappropriate. It seems to me we must\n\n[[Page S13533]]\n\ncontinue to ensure that we provide lawful access to data with \nappropriate precautions. We must tear down the remaining walls that \nprevent access to lawfully collected intelligence information. One of \nthe top priority goals of the intelligence committee is information \naccess. That is the one thing that seems to me that we must reach out \nand accomplish, and obviously passing this act and not rebuilding walls \nto make this problem worse is a top goal.\n  When we needlessly restrict intelligence investigations, we increase \nthe possibility that the next attack will succeed. I will oppose such \nrestrictions and will continue to fight for new authorities for the \nintelligence community. I believe the national security administrative \nsubpoena is an appropriate tool that would increase our security \nwithout sacrificing our civil liberties. I will continue to ask a \nsimple question: Why are we withholding administrative subpoenas from \nthose who investigate spies and terrorists when they are being used \nevery day by those who investigate health care fraud, drug violations, \nand other similar matters.\n  As I have asked many times before, why can the Attorney General use \nan administrative subpoena to stop a dirty doctor or a dirty drug \ndealer but not a dirty bomber? That does not make sense. This is a tool \nthat the President, the Attorney General, and the Director of the FBI \nhave all asked Congress to provide in regard to our national security \ninvestigators. Once again, Congress has denied them.\n  Before concluding, I want to highlight one more important \nintelligence-related provision in this bill: section 506. That is the \nsection that will establish a national security division within the \nDepartment of Justice that is consistent with the recommendations of \nthe executive WMD Commission. The national security division will be \nheaded by the Assistant Attorney General for National Security who will \nbe appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the \nSenate.\n  This process, in regard to confirmation, will be subject to the \nshared jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee and our \nIntelligence Committee.\n  The provision also requires the Attorney General to consult with the \nDirector of National Intelligence before recommending a nominee to the \nPresident. I believe the creation of the national security division \nwill help prevent the rebuilding of these walls that I keep talking \nabout that once hindered access to foreign intelligence information. \nThis new national security division will help ensure that law \nenforcement and intelligence are indistinguishable partners in the \nprotection of our national security.\n  Finally, I strongly oppose passing a short-term continuing \nresolution, as some have suggested, to reauthorize existing \nauthorities. The conferees have already worked extremely hard to \nreauthorize the existing authorities. I do not believe that any \nadditional time or negotiations will close the gap between the \nopponents and the supporters in regard to this act.\n\n  In fact, on the one issue that prevented some conferees from across \nthe aisle from signing onto the conference report, the so-called bad-\nfaith certification provision, this conference report is actually more \nprotective of national security letter recipients than the version \npreviously passed by the Senate.\n  I hope the folks who are upset about this know that is in this bill \nand that this is actually more protective. As convinced as I am that an \nadditional 3 months will not close the gap between opponents and \nsupporters, for those who want a continuing resolution, I am equally \nconvinced that further negotiations will only result in additional \nconcessions that will make the PATRIOT Act tools virtually useless.\n  I remind my colleagues again that 4 years of oversight of the use of \nthe authorities that are provided by the PATRIOT Act have not revealed \none single substantiated--let me emphasize that, substantiated--\nallegation of abuse. Yet despite this fact the conference report before \nus today contains numerous additional checks on the use of the PATRIOT \nAct tools.\n  The arguments for these additional checks and restrictions are not \nbased on any factual allegations of abuse but, rather, on \nunsubstantiated allegations, hypotheticals, innuendo, and perception. I \nunderstand the concern, but facts are stubborn things, and there has \nbeen no abuse. Nonetheless, this conference report will place more \nburdens on national security investigators using these constitutional \ntools to defeat terrorists and spies. Further compromise will only \nserve to negotiate away these very crucial tools. I urge my colleagues \nto base their position on this important legislation on facts. Facts \nare stubborn things, as I said before: The fact that terrorists \ncontinue to seek to kill Americans, the fact that they continue to plot \nattacks against us, the fact that they are determined to continue their \nwar against us, the fact that this conference report does provide \nsignificant increased protections for privacy and civil liberties, and \nthe fact that our national security investigators have not abused \nauthorities that are provided under the original act.\n  We have had plenty of time to oversee the use of authorities that are \nprovided by the PATRIOT Act and plenty of time to separate fact from \nfiction or the wheat from the chaff.\n  I am deeply committed to the men and women of the intelligence \ncommunity. The USA PATRIOT Act has provided them with important tools \nto keep us safe. We should continue to do that. I will vote for cloture \nif necessary--I hope it is not necessary--and in favor of this \nconference report. I, again, am very glad that the House has passed the \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act by a large bipartisan vote because \nthis allows the intelligence community to retain these important \nPATRIOT Act tools and keep America safe. I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Maryland is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Mikulski pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2097 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Delaware is recognized for \n30 minutes.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, 10 days ago, I returned home from a \nbipartisan, bicameral congressional factfinding mission that took a \nnumber of Members, including Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, myself, \nand Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher from California, to a number of Middle \nEastern countries. There we met with, among others, the leaders of \nIsrael, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, as \nwell as with our own civilian and military leaders. For me, our visit \nwas informative, highly informative, even illuminating, and provided me \nwith a number of insights that I wish to share today with my colleagues \nand with the American people.\n  For the past several months, Americans have become increasingly \nskeptical about our ongoing military presence in Iraq, leading to a \nfierce debate on how to succeed in Iraq and when to begin to redeploy \nAmerican troops. With so much discord at home, I was surprised and, \nfrankly, heartened to learn during our mission that there is a growing \nconsensus among both U.S. and Iraqi civilian and military officials on \na reasonable path forward that I believe many Americans can embrace.\n  As our President acknowledged somewhat belatedly today, a number of\n\n[[Page S13534]]\n\ngrievous mistakes were made during his administration following the \nouster of Saddam Hussein--for example, literally telling the Iraqi army \nto go home, you are disbanded, not needed anymore. Having said that, \nthere is a whole lot at stake, too much at stake, for us to just cut \nand run. But somewhere between withdrawing all U.S. forces within 6 \nmonths and staying the course is a commonsense policy and a path \nforward for the United States, for Iraq, and for its Arab neighbors.\n  I believe tomorrow's parliamentary elections and the likely emergence \nof a coalition government in Iraq gives us a great opportunity, not so \nmuch to stay the course but to begin to alter it. This altered course \nwould provide for a moderate but significant redeployment of U.S. \ntroops from Iraq beginning early next year. It could start with our \nNational Guard men and women, might start with our Reserve Forces. We \nmight bring some of them home. Some of them we may wish to deploy to a \nplace such as Afghanistan where they probably would be needed.\n  Redeployment or drawdown is, maybe, a good beginning, but by no means \ndoes it end there. We must also redouble our effort to enlist the full \ncooperation of the Arab League and others to stabilize Iraq politically \nand economically as we continue to help Iraq militarily and their \npolice force shoulder more of the burden in providing security in their \ncountry.\n  On the sensitive issue of withdrawing U.S. troops, I believe if we \nwere to withdraw all of our military forces within the next 6 or even \n12 months, we would leave that country in danger of a civil war, and \nAmerica and Iraq's neighbors would be less safe, not more safe, than \nthey were before we invaded Iraq. The truth is, though, a modest \nAmerican force may well be needed in Iraq for some time. While it will \nnot be close to the 160,000 or so troops we have there now, America \nwill likely maintain some kind of military presence in Iraq, if the \nIraqis want us to, just as we currently do in Afghanistan and Kosovo \nand several other places around the world.\n  The President's open-ended statements, however well intentioned, \nabout staying the course cause many Iraqis to question our Nation's \ntrue intentions. More and more, Iraqis view our troops as occupiers, \nnot liberators. To a lot of them, the President's rhetoric is code for \n``We are here for your oil, and we are going to stay until we get it.'' \nThat is an interpretation that fuels the very insurgency we are trying \nto defeat.\n  That is why it makes sense to me to announce as early as January that \nwe plan to redeploy a significant number of American troops from Iraq \nin 2006 and then begin to do so shortly thereafter. Taking this step \nwill help make clearer to most Iraqis our desire ultimately to leave \nIraq and its natural resources where they belong--in the hands of \nIraqis.\n  These views are not mine alone. They reflect the views of Iraq's \ncivilian and military leaders as well as those of top American \nofficials on the ground. We should listen to them. In the words of one \nof our top American military commanders, he said, pointing toward the \ndoor of the room in which we were meeting, it is time for us to begin \nmoving toward the door. And I believe he is right. Otherwise, I fear \nour troops, who continue to perform courageously under incredibly \ndifficult circumstances, will remain targets of opportunity for months \nor even years to come.\n  Although much of the debate in America has focused on withdrawing \ntroops, if all we do by the end of next year is reduce our troop \nlevels, we will not set Iraqis up for success; we will set them up for \nfailure. There is also a political war to win, and it is not going to \nbe easy. I believe America's Ambassador to Iraq, the gifted Zal \nKhalilzad, has done a remarkable job this year in narrowing the \ndifferences among competing factions in Iraq. Now it looks like \ntomorrow's turnout for the parliamentary elections will be strong, even \namong minority Sunnis, and result in the need to form a coalition \ngovernment.\n  In fact, when we were there, we heard that the Sunnis--of which only \n3 percent of them voted a year ago when they formed their interim \ngovernment, and barely a third of them voted 2 or 3 months ago when \nthey voted on their constitution--I understand now that over half the \nSunnis are going to vote tomorrow. They will elect anywhere from 50 to \n55 to maybe 60 members of this new parliament. The Kurds are expected \nto elect a similar number, and the Shiites will elect maybe 100, 110. \nThere is not enough among any of them to have a majority. That outcome \nwill create a need, and that is a need to form a coalition government.\n  The real challenge will come, though, after the vote, as Iraqis \nconfront at least two enormous tasks. One is setting up a functioning \ngovernment, and the second is rewriting or amending the constitution \nthey just adopted a couple months ago, while at the same time trying to \nsubdue an armed insurgency.\n  America must do all we can to make sure that the Iraqis' experiment \nwith democracy does not founder, even if this experiment results in \nsomething less than a Jeffersonian democracy. But to succeed and become \na new and prosperous country, Iraq will need more than just our help. \nEuropean countries and other nations, including democratic nations, can \ndo their part by helping Iraq set up government ministries and agencies \ndesigned to oversee everything from defense and finance to human \nservices and environmental protection.\n  In fact, I strongly support a proposal that would call for individual \ncountries to adopt a new ministry in Iraq and help them to develop and \nimplement and execute sound policies. For example, Nation A might adopt \na finance ministry, Nation B might adopt a foreign ministry, Nation C \nmight adopt the petroleum industry, Nation D might adopt the \ntransportation industry, and on and on and on. It should not be just \nus; it should be a whole lot of countries joining with us in this \neffort.\n  Arab countries that have been extremely critical of the war and of \nAmerica's occupation must realize they have a dog in this fight, too. \nOn that point, I am more optimistic than I was before my trip. As Saudi \nKing Abdullah told us a week or so ago--these are his words--``In Iraq, \nwhat's done is done.'' That is coming from a monarch, a King, who, \nfrankly, did not appreciate, nor did his people much appreciate, our \ninvading Iraq and taking down the regime of Saddam Hussein. But his \nwords: ``In Iraq, what's done is done.'' And from that, I infer he \nmeans it is time to turn a page. It is time for them and other Arab \nnations in that region to get off the bench and get into the game. And \nthey sure need to.\n  To that end, I sense that many of Iraq's neighbors, including Saudi \nArabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar, realize it is in \ntheir interest to make sure that Iraq does not erupt into civil war, a \ncivil war that could become a regional war or turn Iraq into a haven \nfor terrorism. Those nations could help ensure a better outcome in Iraq \nby, among other things, forgiving the Iraqi debt they hold while also \nworking to improve political relations within Iraq. The United States, \nperhaps through the Arab League, should exert considerable influence in \nthe region to make sure this happens.\n  Another area in which the United States and other nations can be \nhelpful is to assist Iraq in formulating and implementing, next year, \nan economic recovery and growth strategy. Iraq, as we all know, is \nblessed with enormous oil and gas revenues. Yet it is almost beyond \nbelief that today, some 30 months after the U.S. invasion of Iraq and \nthe lifting of the oil embargo in Iraq, oil production in that country \nis really no higher today than it was on the day of our invasion. In \nfact, we were told on our visit that oil production today continues to \nhover at barely one-third of Iraq's capacity of some 5 million barrels \nof oil per day. But, roughly, that leaves 3 million barrels of oil a \nday untapped in the ground, even though there is the capacity to draw \nit out and to refine it and to sell it. At $50 per barrel and 3 million \nbarrels per day, that means that Iraq is leaving approximately $150 \nmillion per day on the table in unrealized revenues. That is about $1 \nbillion a week. For $1 billion a week, you could hire several armies to \nprotect the generating capacity, the oil production capacity in that \ncountry.\n  That kind of revenue also would allow the Iraqis to have some money \nleft over to meet a number of their needs. And they have plenty of \nneeds to\n\n[[Page S13535]]\n\nmeet. That is money that could be used to lower the 25-percent \nunemployment rate among young Iraqis, along with the unemployment rate \namong adults in that country. How? By putting them to work on a host of \nworthy projects around the country--schools, health centers, roads and \ntransit projects, housing, wastewater treatment, electricity \ngeneration, telecommunications infrastructure, and the list goes on.\n  Speaking of economic development, Saudi Arabia continues to increase \nits oil revenues by more fully integrating their oil and gas business \nto include surveying, exploration, drilling, recovery, refining, and \ntransportation, as well as providing feedstocks to a growing \npetrochemical industry. There is no reason why Iraq could not also do \nthe same over time.\n\n  But unlike a number of other Arab nations, Iraq's economy does not \nhave to be what I call a one-trick pony. Iraq is blessed with an \nadequate water supply and plenty of fertile land. Crops, produce, and \nfruits raised on that land can feed all of Iraq and much of that \nregion. We can help the Iraqis figure out how to realize their \npotential, and we ought to do it.\n  Iraq is also blessed with a well-educated workforce, many of whom \nwould like to be entrepreneurs in their country as they move away from \na command-and-control economy to more of a free enterprise system. I am \ntold that last year some 30,000 Iraqis applied for business licenses to \nstart their own businesses. A lot of them could have used an infusion \nof capital to get started, too. They did not need $50,000 or $100,000, \neither. In a number of instances, as little as a couple of hundred \ndollars is all they might have needed.\n  One of the missing ingredients in Iraq in terms of an economic \nrecovery is a banking system that can make and service loans, including \nloans to small businesses, which generate a lot of the jobs. In \nAmerica, we know banking. So do some other nations. We need, \ncollectively, to do more to help Iraqis establish a banking system to \nfuel, among other things, the growth of small businesses--the engine \nfor job creation.\n  On a positive note, USAID has begun operating in Iraq trying to \ndevelop those micro-loan programs that they are putting in place in \nother nations around the world where maybe $100 or $200 or $300 is \nextended in a loan to a small businessperson. That is a good program. \nIt is just beginning, but it is one we ought to kick into high gear \nthere.\n  The idea of Iraq as a tourist mecca was not the first thing that came \nto mind as we headed for that part of the world. Having said that, Iraq \nis the home of several of the holiest shrines in the Muslim world, and, \nlest we forget, it was also the cradle of civilization. Muslims come \nfrom all over the world already to visit a number of those holy shrines \nin Iraq. Given the chance, I believe a lot more of them would come to \nvisit some of those holy places, other holy places, in Iraq if there \nwere airports to serve them, along with restaurants and hotels, bus \nservice, auto rental agencies, and the like.\n  Next, let me add a word or two about Iran, a largely Shiite nation \nthat borders Iraq, as we know. Iraq's Shiite population lives primarily \nin the southern part of Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of people have \ncrossed over the border from Iran into Iraq over the past year or two. \nTens of millions of dollars have followed them into Iraq. Many in the \nregion fear, understandably, that Iran is attempting to expand its \ninfluence through southern Iraq all the way to its border with Saudi \nArabia. Others fear a balkanized Iraq divided into three parts, and \nmaybe eventually three countries, will evolve, and those fears are \nunderstandable.\n  Last week, in an unprecedented move, Iran's supreme religious leader, \nthe real boss in that country--not the President, the real boss in that \ncountry--sent a personal emissary to Saudi Arabia to meet with its \nKing, King Abdullah, apparently to begin a dialog. That was 2 weeks \nago. I said 1 week. It was 2 weeks ago.\n  Recently, Iran has also sent word to U.S. officials in Iraq, through \nthe U.N., through Shiite persons in Iraq, that the Iranians would also \nlike to send, I believe, their national security adviser to meet in \nIraq with our representatives there. I am told that our administration, \napparently, is not prepared to give the green light for those talks, \narguing that any talks should involve much lower level Iranian \nrepresentation.\n  The words of another Arab leader we spoke to on this subject are \ninstructional. That Arab leader said to us during our stay--he was \ntalking about the U.S. unwillingness to join multilateral talks over \nIran's nuclear policy but this monarch said to us:\n\n       Ignoring someone doesn't mean they cease to exist.\n\n  Think about those words: ``Ignoring someone does not mean that they \ncease to exist.'' I would encourage our own administration to give \nAmerican officials in Iraq the green light and find out what is on the \nIranians' minds. It is hard to imagine much damage coming out of such a \nconversation, and there may be some upside to it. Time will tell.\n  If we are willing to engage in multilateral discussions with some of \nthose wild and crazy North Koreans, I don't know that there is a lot of \ndanger in sitting down and being involved in direct or multilateral \nrelations with Iranians, all the while making clear that their \npossession of nuclear weapons is not acceptable to us and the views \nthey have toward Israel and pushing Israel into the sea is anathema to \nus and something we would never countenance.\n  Let me conclude on the Middle East by sharing with my colleagues an \nold Navy story. Long before I came here, I served as a naval flight \nofficer during the Vietnam War in Southeast Asia and later on as a \nReserve naval flight officer and mission commander of a Navy P-3 \nairplane, a four-engine airplane. Our Presiding Officer may have seen \nthe Navy P-3s land at Jacksonville, FL, any number of times in our job \nto hunt for Red October and patrol the oceans of the world.\n  Every now and then, we would have to change an engine in one of our \nplanes. They break. You land the plane. You pull into the hangar and \npull off the engine and put another one on. It takes a day or two, and \nyou have to test it before you go up in the air again. In the Navy, if \nyou had a really hard job to do, we would liken it to changing an \naircraft engine in one of our planes. But a really tough job is one \nthat we had to do by changing the engine of the airplane while the \nairplane was in flight. When you are doing that, that was a tough job.\n  What the Iraqis face in the coming weeks and months is the political, \neconomic, and military equivalent of changing the aircraft engine while \nthe aircraft is in flight. Tomorrow, they are going to hold elections. \nThe good news is that for 275 parliamentary seats, some 6,500 \ncandidates have filed and are running. That is an astounding number. \nWhen the smoke clears literally and figuratively later in the week, \nthey will have to figure out who won and who of those 6,500 lost. They \nwill have to seat a parliament. Then they will have to start putting \ntogether a coalition government, not unlike what the Israelis do from \ntime to time. Nobody is going to have a majority. The Shiites may have \n100 or 120. But they will need other forces. Or maybe some of the rest \nof the people who are there, the Kurds or the Sunnis and others, can \ncreate a majority coalition on their own.\n  They will have to figure out who is going to be the prime minister or \ndeputy prime ministers. They have to figure out who is going to be the \nminister of finance, of foreign affairs, of transportation, of housing, \nthe environment, petroleum, on and on. They have to put the right \npeople in the leadership roles of those agencies and have good people \nup or down the line in those agencies so they can formulate, implement, \nand execute policy.\n  While they are doing all of that, they will have to rewrite their \nconstitution, or at least part of it. To make matters more challenging, \nthey have to do it all while in the face of an armed insurgency. I \nsuggest to my colleagues, doing any of those things in and of itself--\ngoing through the elections tomorrow, electing a parliament, standing \nup a government, putting the right people in place to lead those \nministries, rewriting the constitution--any one of them by itself is a \nhard thing to do. Doing them all almost simultaneously during the \ncourse of an armed insurgency, achieving that would be\n\n[[Page S13536]]\n\nlike the triumph of man's hope over experience.\n  I returned from Iraq more hopeful than when I left. I acknowledge \nthat a lot of hard work lies ahead for us and, hopefully, for a new \ncoalition of the willing in the Middle East. While there are no easy \nchoices or solutions, I acknowledge that. I think we know that. But if \nwe do begin to alter course, as I have outlined earlier, I believe we \nincrease the likelihood that America, Iraq, and its neighbors will \narrive at the destination we all seek.\n\n\n               Sergeant First Class James ``Shawn'' Moudy\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a young man who lost \nhis life last Sunday in Iraq. He is an Army sergeant first class who \ngrew up in Delaware, a graduate of Tatnall High School. His name is \nJames ``Shawn'' Moudy. He is the ninth soldier from Delaware to have \ndied in Iraq.\n  Shawn epitomized the best of our country's brave men and women who \nfought to free Iraq and to secure a new democracy in the Middle East. \nShawn exhibited unwavering courage, dutiful service to his country and, \nabove all else, honor. The way he lived his life and how we remember \nhim, Shawn reminds each of us how good we can be.\n  Shawn was born in Wilmington, DE, on July 14, 1968, to James and \nThelma Moudy who now reside in Newark, DE. Shawn attended the \nIndependence School and graduated from Tatnall School in 1986, where he \nenjoyed playing football and lacrosse. Shawn then attended 1 year at \nMarion Military Institute in Marion, AL.\n  After earning a nomination to the Coast Guard Academy, Shawn decided \ninstead to enlist in the Army. For almost two decades, Shawn traveled \nthe world on tours of duty in Korea, Germany, Bosnia, and later at Ft. \nBenning, GA. It was in Korea that he met his wife Myong Sun, and today \nthey have a daughter, Sandra Rebecca. She is 13 years old.\n  In September 2004, Shawn was transferred to Ft. Drum in Watertown, \nNY, where his family resides today. He was deployed to Iraq in August \n2005, a few months ago. Shawn's mission was to train Iraqi troops, and \nhe joined in the security patrols there. Shawn was a member of the 71st \nCavalry Regiment of the 10th Mountain Division. He always knew he \nwanted to be a soldier. He had several uncles who served in the \nmilitary. As a child, his mom and dad told me, he always drew pictures \nof soldiers. According to his mom, with whom I was privileged to speak \nthe night before last, Shawn believed that ``the world needs to be safe \nand protected and free. That's what his whole life was dedicated to.'' \nThose are her words and his.\n  Shawn's parents take comfort in knowing their son was doing what he \nbelieved was right. Their son was resolute in his belief that the \nUnited States should not leave Iraq until a free society has been \nestablished. He died Sunday in western Baghdad when the humvee he was \ndriving struck another one of those roadside bombs we hear so much \nabout.\n  I rise today on behalf of Senator Biden and our whole congressional \ndelegation and the people of Delaware to celebrate his life, to \ncommemorate his life, and to offer his mom and dad and family our \nsupport and our deepest sympathy on their tragic loss and on ours.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, on behalf of our leadership, I ask \nunanimous consent that the following Senators be recognized to speak as \nin morning business:\n  Senator Clinton for 1 hour, followed by Senator Collins for a time to \nbe determined; Senator Kennedy for 30 minutes to make a motion to \ninstruct; Senator Landrieu for 20 minutes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that Republican Senators be \naccommodated, if seeking recognition, in between two Democratic \nSenators, and that Republican Senators be allocated time that is equal \nto that consumed by the minority Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, tomorrow, we are going to have a series \nof votes in the Senate to give instructions to our conferees. It is an \nexpression of the Senate to give instructions to conferees on priority \nitems that are going to be before the conference. In this particular \ninstance, it is dealing with the issues of higher education.\n  I intend to address the Senate again tomorrow. I want to urge a \nfavorable vote by Republicans and Democrats alike because the \nresolution I will be offering is a reflection of the action that was \ntaken in our HELP Committee, chaired by Senator Enzi, in which there \nwas extremely broad bipartisan support--virtually unanimous support--\nfor that position. That position basically was that the committee would \nhave $8 billion in additional savings for need-based aid.\n  Our intention is to give this additional aid to Pell eligible \nstudents. We would also offer an additional grant of up to $1,500 to \nPell-eligible juniors and seniors who are majoring in math or science.\n  We know that one of the great challenges we are facing in the United \nStates is how we are going to deal with the challenges of \nglobalization.\n  We have to ask ourselves as Americans whether we are going to be \nconsumed by globalization or whether we are going to accept the \nchallenge and equip every man, woman, and child with the ability to \ncompete in a global market and to equip our country with the ability to \nsucceed in a global market. That means we must be the country, the \nsociety, the economy that is innovative and creative, and that is going \nto mean new opportunities that are presented. That is going to be \nessential not only for our economy but for our national security. The \nkind of investments we have and those recommended by our committee are \na good start.\n  I believe we are going to have to do more, and I welcome the \nopportunity to do more in the next session of this Congress.\n  This motion that I offer and others support, that will be voted on \ntomorrow, is a reaffirmation of the importance of strengthening higher \neducation. There are many different aspects of the education budget \nwhich are of concern to us. Senator Harkin and others have outlined \nthose concerns. I join them in expressing our anxiety and disapproval \nat the fact that we are either going to support education or support \ngreater tax incentives, essentially giveaways, to the wealthiest \nindividuals in our country.\n  This is really the issue. This is the question. We will have an \nopportunity to express ourselves tomorrow. The whole battle over the \nbudget is an issue about priorities for our Nation. We can say \nexpending more resources in the area of education isn't going to solve \nall of our problems, but it is an expression of a nation's priorities: \ninvesting, investing, investing to make sure that every young person \nwho has ability, who wants to continue their education is going to be \nable to do it.\n  Finally, I will just mention that the additional reason this motion \nis needed is because the Republican proposal from the House could \nactually increase the cost of college loans by more than $2,000.\n  Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk. As I understand, the \nleadership will work out the voting sequence, and we will have an \nopportunity tomorrow to go into greater detail on this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment to \n     the bill S. 1932 be instructed to insist that the Senate \n     provisions increasing need based financial aid in the\n\n[[Page S13537]]\n\n     bill S. 1932, which were fully offset by savings in the bill \n     S. 1932, be included in the final conference report and that \n     the House provisions in the bill H.R. 4241 that impose new \n     fees and costs on students in school and in repayment be \n     rejected in the final conference report, for the following \n     reasons:\n       (1) The cost of public college tuition and fees has \n     increased by 46 percent since 2001.\n       (2) The lowest income student at a 4-year public college \n     faces an average of $5,800 in unmet need.\n       (3) For families in the lowest income quartile, the average \n     cost of attendance at a 4-year public college represents 47 \n     percent of their income.\n       (4) More than 5,300,000 students received Federal Pell \n     Grants in 2004 through 2005.\n       (5) The buying power of the maximum Federal Pell Grant has \n     decreased from 57 percent of public college tuition to 33 \n     percent in the last 20 years.\n       (6) The gap between the cost of attendance at a 4-year \n     public college and the maximum Federal Pell Grant has \n     increased from $5,282 in 2001 to $8,077 in 2005 through 2006.\n       (7) The typical student who borrows money graduates with a \n     bachelor's degree from a public college with $15,500 of debt.\n       (8) A person with a bachelor's degree makes $1,000,000 more \n     over the course of the person's lifetime than a person with \n     only a high school degree.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I associate myself with the comments of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts and underscore the importance of the \npoints he was making about the need for us to be better prepared to \ncompete in the global economy. I look forward to supporting the \nSenator's motion, and hopefully the conferees will pay heed to the \nSenator's strong admonition about what is in our Nation's best interest \nin terms of investments. I hope I may be added as a cosponsor of that \nvery important effort.\n  Mr. President, the holiday season is upon us, presenting an \nopportunity to give thanks for our blessings, reflect on the past year, \nand consider how we can better demonstrate goodwill to one another. \nThat is the true spirit of this wonderful and blessed season.\n  Sadly, the budget we are debating this week and, quite frankly, the \nwork of the Congress this entire session has failed to keep faith with \nthe spirit of the season or the priorities of the American people. We \nare not following through on the promise to rebuild New Orleans. We are \nnot taking the necessary steps to reduce health care costs or make \nenergy more affordable. We are not investing in education as we should \nto prepare the next generation.\n  This entire legislative season has been about the misplaced \npriorities of the White House and the Republican majority in Congress \nwho are unable or unwilling to recognize the realities facing America's \nfamilies.\n  Washington Republicans seem oblivious to the fact that 1.1 million \nmore Americans fell into poverty last year for a total of 37 million of \nour fellow citizens, including 13 million children. In New York City, \none in five residents lives below the poverty line. They have turned a \nblind eye to the fact that 45 million Americans are without health \ninsurance, including almost 3 million New Yorkers.\n  They have ignored the devastating effects of the job losses that \nworkers at GM, Ford, and Delphi face and our huge and growing national \ndebt, now $8.1 trillion, that threatens the future of our children.\n  The Republican budget lays bear the priorities of Washington \nRepublicans: Loopholes for oil companies instead of student loans for \nmiddle-class families; irresponsible tax breaks instead of affordable \nhealth care for the working poor. Now these are choices that would even \ngive Ebenezer Scrooge pause--choices that not only ignore the \nchallenges facing American families but make those challenges more \ndifficult to overcome.\n  Congress is on the verge of enacting a fatally flawed budget plan \nthat finances further irresponsible tax breaks on the backs of \nAmericans who struggle to pay college tuition, to provide health care \ncoverage for their families, and keep their homes warm in winter.\n  This budget plan is written in the full spirit of the ``Grinch Who \nStole Christmas.'' But instead of taking away the presents and the \nChristmas decorations like the Grinch did, Congress is ringing in the \nholiday season by taking away Medicaid benefits, food stamps, child \nsupport enforcement, childcare programs, affordable housing grants, and \nstudent loan benefits.\n  At the end of the story, the Grinch sees the error of his ways. I can \nonly hope that the Members of this Chamber experience a similar \nrevelation.\n  We have been told that these steps are necessary to pay down the \ndeficit. We have been told that the proposed additional cuts and tax \nbreaks are the priorities of the American people necessary to continue \neconomic growth.\n  Cutting Medicaid, food stamps, childcare, affordable housing, and \nstudent loans is no way to balance the budget or secure our children's \nfutures. It is not in the long-term interest of our country, and it is \nnot in keeping with the values of the American people.\n  What is more, under the Republican majority's budget proposals, the \nbudget deficit would actually increase by anywhere from $10 billion to \n$20 billion.\n  Democrats in the Congress know what real deficit reduction looks \nlike. It involves difficult choices on both the revenue and spending \nside. During the Clinton administration, making the tough choices not \nonly eliminated the deficit but produced the largest budget surpluses \non record. If those in Congress who support this budget, the Grinch \nbudget, were truly concerned about deficits, then they would not have \nopposed the restoration of the pay-go rule, a very simple rule which \nmeans you don't spend money you don't have. They certainly would not \nhave approved an additional $70 billion in tax breaks along with the \nbudget cuts, tax breaks skewed toward the most affluent among us that \nwill worsen our Nation's growing fiscal imbalance.\n  What this bill represents is not only an abandonment of our \nresponsibility to middle-class and working families but the steady \nerosion of the work support programs that have enabled millions of \nAmericans to find work, get off the welfare rolls, and rise above the \npoverty line.\n  The right way to cut the deficit is clear.\n  Instead of cutting programs that help working families get ahead, cut \nthe subsidies flowing to corporate tax breaks, delay further tax cuts \non capital gains and dividends while passing those cuts that benefit \nthe middle class such as AMT reform. The tax cuts going already to the \nwealthiest in this country are nearly seven times larger than all of \nthe proposed budget cuts in the House and Senate. Moreover, there are \ntax cuts not yet in effect, such as the repeal of the phaseout of \npersonal exemptions and limitations on deductions that go into effect \nnext year, which will cost over $27 billion in the next 5 years.\n  We could also allow the Government to negotiate with drug companies \nto lower the cost of prescription drugs, which was prohibited in the \nflawed Medicare drug benefit. If Medicare were able to reap the kinds \nof savings we have seen through the VA system's negotiations, seniors \ncould expect to save more than $100 billion over the next decade in \ndrug costs. This alone is more than four times the savings achieved \nthrough the harsh budget cuts being proposed.\n  We could establish a fund for alternative energy investments by \nrequiring that oil companies, which as we know are experiencing amazing \nrecord profits this year, to invest in alternative energy. We could \nrequire that they help with people's heating bills this winter. We \ncould bring in $20 billion a year with the right energy investments \nthrough the strategic energy fund that I have recommended that would \nhave the benefit of making us less energy dependent on foreign oil.\n  Of course, we could eliminate the $2.6 billion in new tax breaks that \nthose same record profit-making oil companies lobbied for and won in \nthis year's Energy bill. Why do we not take the oil companies off \nwelfare? I think that is an idea we at least ought to debate in this \nChamber. Unfortunately, the Republican majority and the administration \nhave made their choice: Breaks for the special interests instead of \ncompassion for common citizens who face new hardships. They must \nliterally wake up each morning and ask, what are we going to do to help \nour friends today? Never has so much been done for so few who need it \nso little.\n  Look at their plans for Medicaid. The Republican majority is \nrecommending cuts of up to $11.4 billion over the next 5 years. The \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that these cuts will\n\n[[Page S13538]]\n\nresult in higher premiums and copays for over 7 million people, \nincluding 3.5 million children. Some 70,000 people may lose their \nhealth care altogether. A family just above the poverty line could see \nan increase of more than $1,000 annually to maintain their health care \ncoverage.\n  New York would bear a disproportionately high burden of these cuts, \nas we would stand to lose over $1.37 billion, putting at risk the more \nthan 4 million New Yorkers who depend on Medicaid. Over 97,000 New York \nchildren and 12,400 New York seniors would lose a substantial portion \nof their services under the cuts being debated. Instead of closing tax \nloopholes, Washington Republicans are cutting health care. It is very \ndifficult to understand how we could be doing this. If we took that \n$2.6 billion in new tax subsidies for oil companies that are having an \naggregate year of profits of--give or take a billion or so--around $100 \nbillion, with that $2.6 billion we could cover the health care costs of \nan additional 1.7 million children nationwide.\n  Sadly, the majority has chosen health care cuts and Medicaid as the \ntip of the iceberg. We can take a look at other damage that will come \nto American families because of these misplaced priorities. Working \nparents struggling to pay for child care, health care, and housing will \nnow have the added burden of losing their food payment assistance. Two \nhundred and twenty-five thousand people will see their food stamps \nvanish, including up to 14,000 New York residents and some 5,000 New \nYork children.\n  To put this in perspective, the Republican majority is proposing an \napproximately $700 million cut in food stamps. If we simply reinstated \nthe Superfund polluter tax, which forces companies that pollute to bear \nthe expense of cleaning up instead of passing it on to the average \ntaxpayers to clean up their mess, that would generate $7.3 billion over \nthe next 10 years, more than 10 times the cost of the food stamp cut.\n  Additionally, children in households receiving food stamps are \nautomatically eligible for school meals. The Republican bill in the \nHouse, while reducing the number of people who will receive food \nassistance, also eliminates the automatic link and makes it more \ndifficult for hundreds of thousands of low-income children in New York \nState, as well as many more around the country, to qualify for free or \nreduced priced meals at school. The House budget is literally taking \nfood from the mouths of children.\n  Then, what are they thinking when it comes to child support \nenforcement? If there ever was a win-win program, it is this. It is \ndesigned to go after deadbeat parents, collect the money that is owed, \nwhich in turn can be provided to the families that are in need, helping \nlift those single-parent families out of poverty by requiring that \ntheir parents work and make regular payments to support their children. \nWell, no, that is going to be cut as well. Funding would be slashed by \n$16 billion. That means some $24 billion in child support payments \nwould go uncollected. In the next 10 years, children in my State would \nstand to lose over $1.4 billion in child support payments.\n\n  It is almost impossible to imagine this happening at any time but \nhere we are in the Christmas season, and we are giving a boon to \ndeadbeat parents, taking food out of the mouths of children, cutting \npeople off of health care and, of course, under the radar screen, the \nRepublican majority is trying to use this budget reconciliation process \nfor a major overhaul of our Nation's welfare rules.\n  I am very proud of welfare reform. In 1997, we created a welfare \nprogram that valued work, built around the notion that people should \nwork and that people who do work should not still be poor after they \nhave worked. And that work leads to dignity and self-sufficiency and \nprovides strong role models for children. Back then--it was not so long \nago--Republicans claimed to agree that we should support working \nfamilies, but the policies they are pushing today will punish working \nparents. It will push those who are literally tottering on the brink of \npoverty over the edge.\n  Under their proposal, 330,000 families would lose child care \nassistance and cities and towns throughout my State would be the ones \nthat would have to provide some kind of help but not with Federal \nassistance because they would be required to eliminate subsidies for \nworking families. They are the ones down at the local level who will \nsee the results of these wrong-headed policies.\n  As working families grapple with rising home prices, the Republican \nmajority is trying to eliminate critical grants that create more \naffordable housing. These grants have been an invaluable source of \nfunds, providing for the rehabilitation of homes that would otherwise \nbe out of reach for low-income working families.\n  Since 1995, New York has saved 1,746 units of housing as a result of \nthis program; on the chopping block. Goodbye to help for housing. I do \nnot know where the working families in my State or other States will \nend up living. A lot of them will end up being homeless.\n  Then we come to a program that is about the future. It is \nparticularly stunning--I am sure many in this Chamber and the House \nbelieve that a college education is certainly critical for their own \nchildren and grandchildren and is part of the route to success in \ntoday's competitive global economy. Well, one would not know by the \nbudget numbers that are coming out of the Republican majority that they \nhave any value for education at all because they are instituting an \nadditional $14.3 billion in charges for student loan recipients, making \nan education even more difficult to finance. This would be the largest \ncut in student aid in the history of the loan program.\n  So while with one hand we paint college education as the path to \nachievement, with the other we are erecting an even higher barrier for \nmiddle class families and working families, let alone poor families, \nwho all of a sudden are going to be told they better try to get their \nkid to go to college, but tuition is rising so we know it is more and \nmore expensive. Instead of giving more help as we used to do, we are \ngoing to make it harder to get the financial assistance that is needed \nto go to and complete college.\n  An average student would be saddled with a lot more in costs. For \nexample, if a student had $17,500 in student loans they might pay an \nadditional $5,800 under the Republican plan. In my State, approximately \n472,000 students would see an increase in their costs. I do not \nunderstand what we are trying to achieve. If we simply took the $18 \nbillion revenue-raising package adopted by the Senate in its tax bill, \nwhich repeals among other loopholes another $4.3 billion tax giveaway \nto oil companies--honest to goodness, don't the oil companies ever get \nenough tax breaks? I mean, it is not enough that we are paying so much \nmoney to them out of our daily paychecks, now they are going to ask us \nto pay it out of our tax payments--more and more and more subsidies to \ncompanies that are making tens of billions of dollars in profits. It \ndoesn't add up to me.\n\n  But if we took away those $4.3 billion in new tax giveaways to oil \ncompanies and we cracked down on abusive corporate tax transactions \nsuch as setting up offshore tax havens in places such as Bermuda to \navoid paying United States taxes, we would not have to make it more \npainful and costly for students to go to college.\n  So what is the tradeoff here? More subsidies for the oil companies, \nmore offshore tax havens for companies that call themselves American \nbut are not willing to pay their fair share to fund our young men and \nwomen in uniform, to help pay for the victims of Katrina or literally \nanything else? We could keep doing that. I guess that is the Republican \nphilosophy. Or, we can say: Wait. Enough is enough. We don't have to \ngive the oil companies any more tax breaks and let's close these \nloopholes. It is unpatriotic for these companies to pay not one penny \nin taxes to this Government, to our national defense, for the blessings \nthat make it possible for them to do business and have a good standard \nof living. It is wrong.\n  Apparently that is not the way the Republican majority sees it. What \nthey say is that these spending and tax cuts are progrowth. They are \nright about that. They are progrowth for the oil companies. They are \nprogrowth for the tax haven companies. But they are sure not progrowth \nfor somebody trying to get through college or some working mom who \nneeds to collect child support\n\n[[Page S13539]]\n\nfrom an ex-husband. I do not see anything progrowth about that for \nthem.\n  They do not even make economic sense. You know, we know how to do the \neconomy right. We did it in the 1990s. We not only balanced the budget \nand created a surplus but helped to create 22 million new jobs and \nlifted millions and millions of people out of poverty. We enjoyed a \nlong period of sustained economic growth. We took on the challenges of \nthe day and we tried to prepare for the future.\n  That is not what is happening in Washington today, and I am deeply \ntroubled and regretful about the choices that are being made on both \nends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I have spent many years working on behalf of children in foster care. \nThey are probably the most vulnerable of all of our children, the \npoorest of the poor--abused, neglected, children who get taken away \nfrom their families because their families are unable or unwilling to \ncare for them. When they are taken away by the police or by a court or \nsocial worker--maybe they are turned in by a neighbor or relative--they \nbecome our children. They become the responsibility of every single one \nof us and we have to work very hard to try to get them reunited with \nfamilies, to try to find a relative who will love and care for them; \nabsent that, to try to make sure they are safe and secure in foster \ncare while hopefully we try to find a permanent, loving family for \nthem.\n  It is going to be a lot harder because the Republicans are choosing \ncorporate tax breaks instead of foster care. They are going to slash \n$600 million from foster care support.\n  I grew up loving the Christmas season, telling the story over and \nover again about how Mary and Joseph found themselves with no place to \nstay and how Jesus was born in the manger. Many people say: Look, they \nwere shut out, left behind. We are shutting out and leaving behind a \nlot of our children with these budget decisions. It is wrong. It is \nwrong to reward special interests who can do perfectly fine for \nthemselves and slam the door on foster children who need all kinds of \nhelp to even have a chance in life.\n  It is wrong to give more tax breaks to oil companies and not be sure \nwe are going to have enough money to help families pay their heating \nbills this winter. It is wrong that we are using Orwellian language to \ncall a budget bill that actually raises the deficit a deficit reduction \nbill. It may be clever. You might fool some of the people but not for \nlong. The deficit will continue to be a drag on our economy and a \nburden for future generations.\n  The American people, and particularly our children, deserve better. \nThe Republican majority's proposals for this budget are not in the best \ninterests of America. They will undermine the hopes and dreams of a lot \nof hard-working people, people who took us at our word 8 years ago. \nThey got off welfare and they are working now. I see them every day. I \ngo into offices or restaurants all over New York and somebody will come \nup to me and they will say: Senator, I used to be on welfare, but I am \nworking now and my children are so proud. Thank you. Tell your husband \nthank you.\n  I always say: Well, God bless you, take care of those children.\n  Now what are we doing? We are going to cut the childcare that people \nneed to help take care of their children while they are at work. We are \ngoing to cut the housing assistance that people need in order to be \nable to afford a house or an apartment in most places of which I am \naware. We may be cutting their children off Medicaid with all these \ncuts in Medicaid, so that little girl who needs that expensive asthma \nmedicine in order to keep going to school may be out of luck. We are \ngoing to be cutting child support so we are not going after those \ndeadbeat parents to collect money that will help that family stay on \nthe right path, stay out of poverty.\n  It doesn't make any sense to me, but those are the choices that the \nelected representatives of the people of this country are about to \nmake. It is time that we go back to arithmetic and reality; we go back \nto a conservative fiscal policy that pays as you go, doesn't spend what \nyou don't have, produces balanced budgets and surpluses, and takes care \nof people who are working as hard as they can or who are vulnerable and \nneed our help.\n  There is a lot of talk about family values. Well, let's value \nfamilies and let's do it, not just with rhetoric, but with money, \ndecisions, budgets that show what our values are.\n  So in the spirit of this holiday season I call on the Members of this \nbody to reflect on the choices they will be making in the next few \ndays. These choices are going to have a profound impact on millions of \npeople, less fortunate than we are, but there but for the grace of God \ngo any of us. It will not just be for a holiday season, it will be for \nyears to come.\n  I think we can do better. I know America deserves better. We can get \nback on the right path of fiscal responsibility and moral \ndecisionmaking that takes into account the needs of the least among us.\n  We can build a nation that reflects the best of what we can and \nshould be. I hope we will take this opportunity to do so. If we do not, \nthere will be consequences, and they will reflect badly on our \nGovernment.\n  Let us have a happy ending to the story. The Grinch had an epiphany. \nThe Grinch came back and said: I don't want to be a bad guy. I want to \nshare in the Christmas spirit.\n  So let us replace this ``Grinch budget'' with an American budget that \ndoes what it should do for all the people of our country.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          American Priorities\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank \nyou for the opportunity to speak.\n  I had not intended to come to the floor today but I passed my \ntelevision set in my office, and I caught the preceding speech \nregarding American priorities and certain allegations regarding \nleadership at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. I felt compelled for a \nsecond to try to answer some of the rhetorical questions that were \nasked but never responded to in the speech. If I heard it right--I \ncould be corrected--one of the questions was ``I don't understand what \nwe are trying to accomplish.'' It was stated in the context of \nextending the tax cuts, I presume the tax cuts the House passed--to \nextend on capital gains and dividends. I will assume for a second that \nwas part of them. There may have been others, and I will address some \nof them, but I thought it was time, at least for those who might be \nwatching and listening today.\n  There are two distinct philosophies in Washington, DC. One has just \nbeen characterized. My hope is, in the few minutes I have been \nallocated, to be able to characterize the other.\n  When George Bush took office at the beginning of his first term, this \ncountry was moving into a serious recession which was realized shortly \nafter that term began.\n  In September, on the 11th day of September, in the year 2001, America \nhad the most unbelievable, heinous attack upon us that has ever been \nperpetrated, even worse, both in death toll but also in tragedy, than \nthat of Pearl Harbor. That event, on top of the declining economy which \nwas inherited in large measure by the administration, this President, \nand in turn this Congress, set on a new course to do two things: One, \nempower the great economic engine of America, which is American \nbusiness and free enterprise. We did so by strictly passing legislation \nin terms of tax cuts and changes in tax policy that would empower \nAmerican business, offer the incentives for more jobs and bring us out \nof the economic difficulty we were having.\n\n  I submit that is precisely what has happened. If you look at the last \n5 years, we have gone from a period of recession, which began in 1999, \npeaked probably in 2000-2001, and since, we have continued to climb and \nimprove. Why have we done so? We have done so because we empowered the \nAmerican business person and the American employer and the American \nemployee by allowing them to keep a little bit more of their business \nand invest it in this great country, spend it in discretionary \nspending, buy a new home. Economic\n\n[[Page S13540]]\n\nenterprise breeds economic enterprise which breeds more economic \nenterprise.\n  We know from the standpoint of our side of that philosophical issue, \nif you empower business to do more business, the American Government \nwill prosper. Our revenues have gone up in this country. They have not \ngone down because of tax cuts. June 15, 2005--this year--was the \nlargest single take in tax revenue in the history of the United States \nof America. It was because our country is running on all cylinders, or \nalmost all cylinders.\n  When I went to college, 95 percent employment was full employment. We \nhave that today. We have had an unbelievable sustained period of very \npositive interest rates. We have had an economy that has not been \nattacked by inflation, and inflation continues to be under control. The \njobs that were lost because of the recession in the early part of this \ndecade are coming back, and they are coming back at a rapid rate. \nBusiness formations, prosperity, American home ownership is at an all-\ntime high. The real estate industry is at an all-time high. American \nbusiness enterprise is thriving, and I submit it is not confusing to \nme. I do understand what we are doing. What we are doing is we are \nempowering that which has always taken this country to great heights: \nthe American free enterprise system, the American taxpayer, the \nAmerican employer, and the American employee. We are empowering them \nwith their money and believing they can do it better, and we can \nprosper together.\n  The other side's philosophy is, you charge the people more money to \ntake care of the problems you perceive. Instead of empowering them, you \nshackle them with less money, you empower government, you breed \nmediocrity. That is wrong.\n  No one predicted September 11. Nobody could have ever predicted \nSeptember 11. But while in the process of reinvigorating the American \neconomy through strategic tax cuts, this administration has confronted \nthe most horrible fate a country could confront on September 11 in the \nattack of terrorism. We have pursued terrorists around the world. We \nhave secured our airports. We are securing our ports. We have been \nfortunate not to have an attack on our soil since that date. That did \nnot come cheap. It came at a great price. A great price we have \nfinanced, in part, obviously, with the deficits that were referred to. \nBut we paid for an awful lot of it with the growth in our revenue from \nan empowered taxpayer and an empowered employer and an empowered \nemployee.\n  I just want to make a couple things clear. I am one member of the \nmajority party of this Senate, and I can only speak for myself. But I \ntake issue with being characterized as someone who is trying to cut \nhealth care, someone who is trying to take food out of the mouths of \nchildren, somebody who is trying to take welfare and turn it back \naround and hurt people on welfare to recovery, someone who is trying to \nmake it harder for kids to go to college.\n  All of those examples that I heard in the previous speech were \nexamples of taking an issue and distorting an issue to make it appear \nthat one side is against children, for hunger, against education, for \nignorance--all those negative connotations. So for a second I will \naddress them, if I can.\n  We had an earlier motion in the Senate today with regard to Medicaid. \nWe have a lot of Governors in this country who are attempting to get \nflexibility with Medicaid. I happen to be one who supports giving the \nGovernors flexibility from the standpoint of Medicaid. Why? First of \nall, they and their legislatures administer Medicaid, we don't. We pay \nfor two-thirds of it, but we hold them accountable for its \nadministration. If they are accountable for its administration, and \nthey are paying a third of the costs, and we are holding them \naccountable, by golly, they ought to get flexibility to use some of the \ntools. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer knows about tools in \nmedicine today and applies them to health care for our poorest.\n  Being more flexible for our Governors to deal with one of the largest \nsingle expenditures of State government, the largest in my State, is \ngood common sense. It is not cutting health care. It is empowering the \npeople who are helping to get it to the people who need it.\n\n  This business of taking food out of the mouths of babes, I do not \nknow what the Senator from New York was referring to specifically, and \nI will give her the benefit of the doubt. But I will say, cutting the \nrate of growth in programs is not taking food out of the mouths of \npeople who are getting it. Cutting the rate of growth in spending is \ntrying to manage our budget. I have never seen a time, even back in the \nearly 1990s, when the Republicans were attacked in the House for taking \nthe food out of the mouths of young children. It was the rate of growth \nin programs that was talked about. It was not real dollars. I submit \nthe reference today was probably precisely the same thing.\n  As far as welfare rules are concerned, one of the great legislative \ninitiatives of the 1990s was welfare reform and welfare-to-work. I have \nbeen to the centers in my State. I have seen the bulletin boards, the \nsuccess stories today of people who were on welfare, shackled for a \nlifetime, and then empowered by welfare-to-work legislation. We have \nreduced our roles in this country tremendously. We have not really \nreduced the cost of welfare that much because we are providing \nchildcare, we are providing training, we are providing transportation, \nand we are providing education.\n  But do you know what we did. We slowed the growth of the cost of \nwelfare to the American taxpayer. In the process of doing it, we \nempowered Americans who thought they were shackled for a lifetime in \npoverty, in welfare, because we got them job training. We got them \nchild assistance while they were being trained. We empowered them and \nchallenged them to go off of welfare and on to work. And they are there \ntoday. That is a great accomplishment.\n  As to the student loan business, I do know a little bit about that. \nWe were tasked in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee \non budget reconciliation with finding some savings. The \ncharacterization in the previous speech was it will cost students more \nmoney to go to college and to borrow on student loans. There are going \nto be some costs, that is correct. We still, however, as a government, \nprovide through Pell grants and through assistance in the College Loan \nProgram unparalleled assistance to students wanting to go to college \nand to finance that education. We are merely trying to make that \nprogram accountable and live to a certain extent within our means.\n  There was a comment in the preceding speech that it is time to get \nback to arithmetic and reality. I will address my remarks to that for \njust a second.\n  There is not one Member in here who likes the deficit situation we \nhave been in. I applaud the White House for encouraging us, and I \napplaud Senator Gregg in his diligent leadership to force us to try to \nbring about savings and begin to reduce the rate of spending in \nprograms. The reconciliation bill we passed, which I believe was $39.4 \nbillion in savings, is a start. It is only a start. We will have to do \nmore.\n  In the case of the reconciliation and those savings, whatever the \nprogram might be, there is going to be somebody who says: Don't cut \nhere, cut there. But for us eventually to make this budget process \naccountable, we will have to be able to open all of government, look at \nall of government, analyze all of government, and make hard choices. \nThe reality of arithmetic is you cannot tax America into prosperity. \nYou cannot solve everyone's problem by taxing those who are producing \nthe jobs that employ the people of the United States of America. What \nyou can do, however, is hold yourself accountable on the spending side \nand empower those who produce the revenues to do more.\n  The arithmetic of our tax cuts is simple, because of capital gains \nreductions, mature assets which were held and not liquidated because of \nthe tax rate were sold, and new money was made, and it was deployed in \nnew investments with growth because dividends became equalized with \ncapital gains and, in fact, were lowered in a rate of taxation. Wall \nStreet began to focus on dividends as being a positive thing for \ncompanies to do.\n  There has been a tremendous move on Wall Street, and the market is\n\n[[Page S13541]]\n\nstronger and investment in America is stronger because of what we did \nin bonus depreciation, because of what we did in expensing. In every \none of those things that was called a cut, we raised revenue, and we \ndid so because we empowered American business.\n  But if the Senator from New York or anybody else thinks that if you \nhave a billion-dollar problem, you can just raise taxes by a billion \ndollars and solve it, and that is the way for us to go in the 21st \ncentury, they are dead wrong. Because there is a point at which when \nyou tax, you suppress prosperity, you cause people who have money to \nmake the decision not to deploy that money anymore. You cause the exact \nopposite of what has happened in this country for the past 3 years \nsince the tax programs were passed.\n  So while I may have missed some of the points because I caught this \nin passing and stopped at the TV to listen, I did not miss one point. \nThe point was the question: I don't understand what it is we are trying \nto accomplish. I will tell you what we are trying to accomplish. We are \ntrying to accomplish empowering the great locomotive of prosperity, \nAmerican free enterprise, the American employer and employee to do \nbetter. And as they do better, the American Government does better, and \nrevenues go up, not because we raised rates but because we raised hope \nand we raised opportunity.\n  Secondly, I know where we are trying to go in budget reconciliation. \nWe are trying to go where every American is every day of their life. We \nare trying to sit around the kitchen table, setting priorities, looking \nto the future, seeing where we can slow the rate of growth of \nGovernment expenditures. We are not trying to take food out of the \nmouth of a single person, nor to take health care away from a single \nperson. Nor do we want a deadbeat dad not to get caught. We want every \nchild support payment to be made. To characterize one party as being \nfor those things and the other being against them, to me, is quite \nludicrous. But you have to go through a budget process of \nreconciliation and savings by looking at programs, analyzing programs, \nsetting realistic goals for the future, and trying to make them more \naccountable.\n  The United States of America is a great and prosperous nation for a \nlot of reasons. But the most important reason of all, it is a land of \nhope and opportunity. Taxation can destroy the hope and, in turn, \ndestroy the opportunity when it is carried to the excess no matter how \nnoble the cause on which it is levied.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time yielded to me. I thank you \nfor the opportunity to serve with you in this body. In the next few \ndays, as we close out this legislative session, I hope we can, in the \nend, be where we started this year, with a goal of empowering the \nAmerican taxpayer, doing a better job handling the expenses of this \ncountry, and doing what we always do in giving thanks to live in the \ngreatest Nation on the face of this Earth, the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Georgia for his \nexcellent statement. He presented the themes and the basic philosophy \nwhich are behind this bill, the deficit reduction bill, which includes \nthat we, as a government, need to come close to living within our \nmeans. Hopefully, we could live completely within our means. Secondly, \nthe American people should not always have money taken out of their \npockets to support the largess of the Federal Government. We should \nhave a tax burden that is reasonable, but to the extent we can, we \nshould allow Americans to keep their hard-earned money and allow them \nto make decisions as to where their money should go.\n  If we increase taxes dramatically, we basically reduce the incentive \nof people to go out and be productive, which translates directly into a \nloss of jobs because people are not willing to take risks, are not \nwilling to be entrepreneurs because if their tax burden is so high, the \npractical effect is they do not create jobs. A job, of course, is the \nultimate economic benefit for any family.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Georgia. I think his statement was \nright on. I especially appreciate his comments relative to trying to \nput in context the comments of the Senator from New York because the \nSenator from New York used a few hyperboles, referring to ``The Grinch \nThat Stole Christmas.'' ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' of course, \nis a classic story. First, I congratulate her. I do congratulate her \nfor using the term ``Christmas'' and recognizing this is the Christmas \nseason, not the holiday season, something which my wife continually \nreminds me about. We don't have a holiday tree; we have a Christmas \ntree.\n  But independent of that small aside, let me point out that ``How the \nGrinch Stole Christmas'' is a wonderful story. It was written by a \nfellow who went to school in New Hampshire. It is a fantasy. He wrote \nsome other things such as ``The Cat in the Hat.'' And quite honestly, I \nthink the Senator from New York was talking through her hat when she \ndelivered her statement because it, first, was inconsistent with all \nthe facts on the ground, and, second, it represented a philosophy which \nessentially says, as the Senator from Georgia has pointed out, if you \nsimply tax people more, you can solve your problems as the Federal \nGovernment. All it takes is you take more of people's money and we can \nsolve any problem around here.\n  Where is it factually inaccurate? Well, to begin with, the deficit \nreduction bill which we passed was a very unique bill. It has only been \ndone once in the last 8 years. This is the first attempt to do it \nagain. It was unique because the way it was structured, as it came out \nof the Senate--and I congratulate the various chairmen who did this, \nespecially the chairman of the HELP Committee and the chairman of the \nFinance Committee and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, which \nbore the biggest reductions here, and the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee. Other chairmen also participated, but they had the big, \nheavy lift.\n  The way it came out of the Senate was this: It actually ended up \nsaving about $70 billion. But there were decisions made that as we \nsaved some of this money we should reallocate it toward better ideas \nand better concepts. The practical effect of this was that we \nsignificantly, under this bill, expanded the availability of loans \ncalled Pell grants to people who want to go to college, low-income \npeople who want to go to college. We significantly expanded it. So 5 \nmillion more people, 5 million more kids who want to pursue a college \ncareer or college path are going to be able to do so under this bill \nbecause of the expansion of the Pell grants.\n\n  Why was that decision made? That decision was made because we \nbelieve, as Republican Members of this Senate, that if you give people \na good education, you give them a better chance to be productive, you \ngive our Nation a better chance to be productive, that as we give more \npeople a better education, we become globally more competitive, and we \ncreate more jobs and more economic activity in the United States. As a \nresult, we end up probably benefiting the Federal Treasury because we \nhave more people earning higher incomes who pay more in taxes. But we \nbelieve very strongly in that type of commitment.\n  So this bill, rather than as was represented earlier by the Senator \nfrom New York as being some sort of a negative event around here for \nlow-income people, was actually the most significant expansion of the \nPell grant program for low-income individuals, certainly in the last 12 \nyears since the beginning of the Pell grant program.\n  Secondly, the bill again, under this same philosophy, dramatically \nexpanded the availability of funds for low-income and disabled children \nunder Medicaid. This bill, as it passed the Senate, will add 1.1 \nmillion people, make Medicaid available for 1.1 million people, \nbasically kids who are disabled and of extremely low income so they \nwill have health care coverage. So some of the savings we took and we \napplied there.\n  In addition, the bill expanded the effort to try to help out people \nwho have been impacted by Katrina--unfortunately, a lot of people have \nbeen devastated by that storm--and had the effect, and will have the \neffect, if it is passed, of helping 1.9 million people\n\n[[Page S13542]]\n\nwho were dramatically impacted by Katrina get Medicaid coverage. Again, \nthat was a decision that was made to reallocate resources.\n  So the bill itself is probably the biggest and most aggressive effort \nto try to help people of low income that has gone through this Senate \nin recent history, probably since the welfare reform bill that was \nsigned by the husband of the Senator from New York.\n  How were these savings generated which were able to be reallocated? \nRemember that the bill overall, on a net basis, as it left the Senate, \nsaved about $39 billion. My hope is, after we go to conference, it will \nsave about $45 billion, maybe $46 billion, maybe be as high as $48 \nbillion, $49 billion in net savings. But there are other savings that \nwe have taken and reallocated. Where did those savings come from? Did \nthey come from low- and moderate-income individuals? Were they slashing \nprogrammatic activity that benefited low-income individuals, as would \nbe represented by the statement of the Senator from New York that the \nGrinch has been at work? No. As I said, a more appropriate analogy \nwould have been the Cat in the Hat because she was talking through her \nhat on that issue.\n\n  The savings that expand the Pell grant come directly out of the \nlenders who, if we do not act under this bill, will realize a $12 \nbillion windfall because the interest rate which students will have to \npay will be artificially high unless we adjust that rate to \nappropriately reflect the marketplace. What this bill did, under the \nleadership of Chairman Enzi--and interestingly enough, this language \ncame out of that committee in a bipartisan way.\n  The Senator from New York serves on that committee, as do I. I don't \nthink there was any opposition to this proposal. We essentially said, \nrather than allowing this $12 billion windfall, which will occur if we \ndon't act by the end of the year, which will occur so that these \nlenders, these corporations which lend this money to students, and they \ndo a service for the Nation by doing that, but they are getting this \nartificially inflated rate of return. Because of the way the law was \nstructured, it didn't reflect the actual interest costs or what the \nreal interest costs are today, if we don't act, they will get a $12 \nbillion windfall.\n  What Chairman Enzi and the HELP Committee said was: That doesn't make \nany sense. Let's take back that windfall, which was artificially \ncreated by Federal law, and take a significant amount of it and expand \nthe Pell grant program so 5 million more kids will be able to get Pell \ngrants, low-income kids. In fact, the whole program is targeted to the \nlowest of low-income kids who want to go to college. And take another \nbig chunk of it and use it to reduce the debt of the Federal \nGovernment. That is a pretty logical approach, certainly not a Grinch \napproach. It is a rather thoughtful approach, a good approach.\n  I would say the characterization of the Senator from New York of this \nbill is inconsistent with the facts on the ground and inappropriate.\n  The Finance Committee looked at places where we could save money in \nthe Medicaid system. It came to the conclusion that a considerable \namount of money could be saved by changing the way pharmacies are \nreimbursed under Medicaid. So they made a decision. They said: Rather \nthan having an artificially high reimbursement for pharmacies and drug \nmanufacturers, they would rather more accurately reflect the cost of \nthose drugs and what those drugs would go for on the open market and \nthus take the savings from that and, once again, split those savings. \nThey said: Part of those savings should go to expand assistance to low-\nincome kids, adding another 1.1 million kids to the SCHIP program, the \nMedicaid Program for low-income kids, and taking another part of the \nsavings and applying it to debt reduction, creating a deficit reduction \nevent.\n  In addition, they said: Listen, if we don't do something about doctor \nreimbursements, doctors will end up with their fees being cut by 4.8 \npercent at the end of the year. We are going to have doctors dropping \nout of the Medicare system. That is not a very good idea. Low-income \nsenior citizens who want to go see a doctor aren't going to have \ndoctors to see because doctors are going to say: I am not going to \npractice because my income is being cut. Everytime I see one of these \npatients who is a Medicare patient, I am losing money. I have to pay \ninsurance, my nurses. I have to pay my overhead. I can't take a 4.8-\npercent cut.\n  So the committee said: Let's hold the doctors harmless, basically \ngive them no cut. Well, they gave them a 1-percent increase, but it \nbasically amounts to no cut. And they paid for that, again, by \nbasically reducing areas of Medicare which legitimately should be \nreduced. Specifically, there is $5.6 billion sitting in the Medicare \nPart D trust fund, which is actually in Part C, but it applies to Part \nD, which was euphemistically called the stabilization fund, which \nessentially was walking-around money for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to basically pay out to various insurance companies, \nHMOs, and drug companies in order to buy them into the drug program \nbecause there was some concern that not enough people would participate \nin the drug program.\n  It turns out, in every State, there has been an overwhelming number \nof different drug companies and insurance companies offering \npharmaceuticals that have been willing to participate. In my State, we \nhave 41 different plans. The problem isn't that there aren't enough. \nThe problem is there are so many people getting confused as to what is \navailable. And that is good news. We hope that there are so many \nparticipating. We hope to be able to clarify who is offering what. The \nfact is, the logic behind the stabilization fund didn't come to \nfruition. So there was no need to have this walking-around money. It \nhas been referred to as a slush fund. So this committee decided to take \nthat walking-around money and basically use it to make sure that \npatients, when they go to see somebody under Medicare, when they need a \ndoctor, will be able to find a doctor.\n  Tell me what is Grinchlike about that. What is Grinchlike about the \nidea of creating a system where there is actually a doctor when a \nsenior citizen wants to find a doctor because they have a problem and \nhaving a proposal which accomplishes that? Obviously nothing. Once \nagain, on the facts of it, the Senator from New York was inaccurate as \nto the implications of this bill and how it affects seniors and low-\nincome seniors.\n  Yes, this bill does reduce the debt by, as it passed the Senate, $39 \nbillion. And I suspect if we get it back from conference, it will \nprobably be closer to $45, $46, maybe even higher, $48 billion. Again, \nwhat is Grinchlike about that? I ask: What is wrong with reducing the \nFederal debt? What is the Federal debt? It is our generation spending \nmoney to benefit, in most cases, people today, and then taking the bill \nfor that and saying to our children and our children's children: You \nhave to pay for it. It is akin to using a credit card only you don't \npay the credit card. You give the bill for the credit card to your \nchildren or grandchildren. That is not very nice. That is Grinchlike. \nIf the Senator from New York wants to talk about something that is \nGrinchlike, it is having a Government that continues to run up debt for \ncurrent expenses, passing those current expenses on to the next \ngeneration and the next generation after that to pay for it. That is \nunfair. That is stealing the Christmas of our children and our \nchildren's children or at least undermining their capacity to go out \nand have the funds to have as good a life as we have had.\n  The purpose of this bill was, for the first time in 8 years, to step \nup to the plate on the most significant part of the Federal budget \nwhere the most money is spent and where the most growth is occurring \nwhich is the entitlement accounts. As I mentioned before, people need \nto understand how the Federal Government works in the area of spending. \nWe have the account called appropriations. It represents 30 percent of \nthe Federal Government. It is everyday expenses such as national \ndefense, education, laying out roads, environmental expenses. Those \ndollars are a decision we make every year to spend. We decide to spend \ndollars to buy our military equipment. We decide to spend dollars to \nassist a State in laying out a road. But we don't have to spend that \nmoney. We can decide not to buy that piece of military equipment or not \nto lay out that road.\n  We can do it every year, and it is called the appropriating process.\n\n[[Page S13543]]\n\n  In the appropriation accounts, we have essentially frozen spending, \nunder this budget, under the budget which was passed in nondefense \ndiscretionary activity. But again, it only represents 30 percent of the \nFederal budget. The rest of the Federal budget, outside of debt \nfinancing, is entitlement spending or mandatory spending. Those are \nprograms where people, because of their situation, or institutions or \ncorporations, because of their situation, have the right to come to the \nFederal Government and get paid.\n  They may be veterans, students, senior citizens on health care or on \nMedicaid or on Social Security. They have a right to that benefit \nbecause they fit certain criteria--age or income or experience. Those \nentitlement accounts are the fastest growing element in the Federal \nGovernment. They have been for years. Now they are projected to explode \nin their rate of growth because of the fact that we have something \ncalled the baby boom generation that is about to enter the Federal \nsystem. A CBO report is coming out that reflects that it is going to \noverwhelm our capacity as a society to support it.\n  The concept that you can tax your way out of this, which appears to \nbe the proposal of the Senator from New York, cannot stand in the face \nof facts. It cannot stand in the face of facts. Three programs--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid--make up about 80 percent of the \nmandatory spending. Those 3 programs today absorb I think probably \naround 8 or 9 percent of the Federal budget. Maybe it is higher.\n  When the full baby boom generation has retired by the year 2030, \nthose three programs will cost the American taxpayer 20 percent of the \ngross national product of the Federal Government. Why is that an \nimportant number? Because 20 percent of the gross national product is \nhow much we have, historically, as a Federal Government been willing to \nspend for all Government activity, including defense spending, \neducation, environmental protection and health care for senior citizens \nand Social Security. But by 2030, those three programs alone will cost \nas much as the entire Government spends today as a percentage of our \ngross national product.\n  What are the implications of that? The implications are that in order \nto pay for that, and to have a functioning government, you would have \nto raise taxes on our children and grandchildren over this 20 percent \nlevel. That number keeps going up because the unfunded liability of \nMedicare and Medicaid alone is $27 billion. The unfunded liability of \nMedicare and Social Security and Medicaid together and all of the other \nentitlement programs is about $44 billion. So the number keeps going up \nwell beyond 20 percent, so by 2040 you are looking at 25 to 30 percent \ngross national product for those three programs. Maybe the Senator from \nNew York is willing to raise taxes as a percentage of the gross \nnational product well above what we have done as a Nation, generally. \nWe have never had a tax rate which has exceeded 21 percent. That has \nbeen hit occasionally, but usually the tax rate has been about 18 \npercent of GDP. Once you get above 18 percent of GDP as your tax rate, \nyou suppress the Nation's ability to be productive. People will come to \nthe conclusion that there is no point in going out and working harder \nbecause the Federal Government is simply going to take their money.\n  That is what happened in the late 1970s when tax rates were up to 70, \n75 percent. People said: Why should I go out and work hard to produce \nthat extra dollar? They are just going to tax it away from me. So \nRonald Reagan came along, following the ideas of John Kennedy, and \nsaid: Let's cut the tax rate, and it will produce more incentive for \nproductivity, more entrepreneurship, and therefore more jobs and more \nrevenues, and that is exactly what happened.\n  That is also what happened with George W. Bush. He cut the tax rate \nin the middle of a very severe recession, followed by the attack of 9/\n11. As a result of the tax-rate cut, we have seen a huge increase in \nrevenues in the last 2 years. That revenue increase is a direct result \nof the fact that we have created an incentive for people to be \nproductive and create jobs.\n  So you cannot, as a practical matter, even if you wanted to do this, \nfollow the course that has been outlined by the Senator from New York, \nwhich is essentially trying to tax your way out of the problem we \nconfront, which is called the Federal deficit, and the spending of the \nFederal Government resulting from entitlement spending. The only way \nyou can address this issue is if you take a hard look at the \nentitlement programs and begin to restructure them so that they become \naffordable for the next generation.\n  I wish this deficit reduction bill was much more expansive than it \nis. I wish it took a hard look at Medicare. I wish we were addressing \nSocial Security. Both of those issues were taken off the table through \nthe political realities of the time. Our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, in I think an act of real fiscal irresponsibility, \nbasically demagogued the President when he suggested that we address \nthe Social Security issue. So we could not move forward on that. \nRegrettably, the President took Medicare off the table because he said \nwe should let Medicare Part D go forward before we start to move to try \nto restructure Medicare. I think that was a mistake, but that was the \ndecision. We were left with a narrow number of entitlement programs to \nlook at. Even within those narrow programs, we were asked to limit \nsignificantly the scope of our review.\n  For example, in the area of Medicaid, which we will spend $1.2 \ntrillion to $1.3 trillion on over the next 5 years, our suggestion was \nsimply to reduce that rate of growth of spending by $10 billion. So the \nrate of spending in Medicaid, instead of being 40.5 percent, would fall \nback to 40 percent. Even with that, less than a one-tenth-of-1-percent \nreduction in the rate of growth of Medicaid, it has been described as \nGrinchlike, even though none of it, as proposed in the Senate, came out \nof beneficiaries. In fact, as I mentioned, the number of beneficiaries \nthat will receive Medicaid under the Senate bill will expand by 1.1 \nmillion people. Rather, the savings came out of pharmacy and drug \nmanufacturers as a result of pricing. But that, under the theory of the \nSenator from New York, is Grinchlike.\n  It is hard to accept that on its face, if you look at the facts \nbehind this bill. But what we do know will be Grinchlike is if we pass \non to our children a continued expansion of the Federal debt and \ndeficit, so that undertakings which we pursue today as a Government \nthat benefit people today--they are not capital expenses, but they are \nbasically the ordinary operating expenses of the Government from day to \nday. Those undertakings will continue to be paid for by our children \nand our children's children. That would be Grinchlike. That takes away \nfrom them the opportunity to have as high a quality of life as we have \nhad because their tax burden to pay for our bills will be added to \ntheir general tax burden to pay for their bills and, as a result, they \nwill have less money available to do things for their kids, whether it \nis buying toys, putting them through college or buying a decent family \nhome.\n  So this deficit reduction bill, which was structured in a very \ncareful way to make sure it expanded benefits to low-income \nindividuals, adding 5.5 million new people to Pell grants, 1.1 million \nkids to Medicaid, and 1.9 million people who were impacted by Katrina \nrelative to health care costs.\n  At the same time, it moves forward for the first time in 8 years in \nan attempt to address the issue of reducing the debt. It is the right \npolicy and it is, rather than being a Grinchlike event, truly an \nappropriate gift, should we get around to passing it, to our children \nand our children's children and to those people who benefit from this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nRhode Island in offering a motion to instruct the conferees to include \n$2.9 billion in additional funding for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program as part of the budget reconciliation bill.\n  This funding is absolutely critical to help our Nation's low-income \ncitizens keep warm this winter. I believe we simply must provide more \nLIHEAP funding this year. Let me describe the situation we are facing \nin my home State.\n\n[[Page S13544]]\n\n  Just yesterday, I was in northern Maine, in Aroostook County, which \nis where I come from, and the high for the day was 12 degrees. That was \nthe high temperature for the day. In weather like this, people simply \nhave no choice but to devote a very large part of their household \nbudget to heating their homes. Unfortunately, with the escalating cost \nof home heating oil, many people simply cannot afford to do so.\n  In Maine, 78 percent of the households use home heating oil to heat \ntheir homes. Currently, the cost of home heating oil is approximately \n$2.34 per gallon. That is 38 cents above last year's already inflated \nprices. These high prices greatly increase the need for assistance, and \nat least 3,000 additional Mainers are expected to apply for LIHEAP \nfunding this year.\n  So we have a situation where there are more people in need of \nassistance compared to last year. The prices are much higher than last \nyear, and yet the average benefit is expected to fall by roughly 10 \npercent to $440 per qualifying household. Unfortunately, at today's \nhigh prices, $440 is only enough to purchase 188 gallons of oil. That \nis far below last year's equivalent benefit of 251 gallons. I can tell \nyou, that is not nearly enough to get even through the first half of \nthe winter in Maine. With rising prices and falling benefits, we have a \nreal problem. Just to purchase the same amount of oil this year as last \nyear, the State of Maine would need an additional $10 million in LIHEAP \nfunds.\n  Just a few months ago, we passed and the President signed into law \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2005. This law passed the Senate \noverwhelmingly, and it authorizes $5.1 billion for the LIHEAP program \nfor fiscal year 2006. The chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, \nSenator Specter, worked very hard to find some funding to increase \nLIHEAP. He increased it to $2.2 billion. I commend him for his efforts \nand hard work, but $2.2 billion is not nearly enough.\n  Our Nation has been struck by three extremely powerful hurricanes. \nThese hurricanes have been devastating to the people of Florida and the \ngulf coast, but we need to remember that they have had a major impact \non the rest of the Nation as well. Just as the Nation should have been \nbuilding oil supplies for the winter heating season, these hurricanes \ndisrupted our already strained supplies and sent both home heating oil \nand gasoline prices to painfully high levels.\n  While high energy prices have been challenges for many Americans, \nthey impose an especially difficult burden on our low-income families \nand on our elderly living on limited incomes. Low-income families \nalready spend a greater percentage of their incomes on energy, and they \nhave fewer options available when energy prices soar. High energy \nprices can even cause families to choose between keeping the heat on, \nputting food on the table, or paying for much-needed prescription \nmedicine. In America today, in a country as prosperous as our country, \nno family should have to make such a choice. No elderly person should \nhave to choose between buying the fuel oil they need to keep warm to \navoid hypothermia and filling a much-needed prescription to stay \nhealthy.\n  With winter upon us and energy prices soaring, home heating oil bills \nare already pounding family budgets mercilessly. For low-income \nfamilies, LIHEAP funds can be the factor that prevents them from having \nto choose between paying their bills and putting food on the table.\n  I call on my colleagues to support this motion to instruct the \nconferees to include this vital assistance as part of the budget \nreconciliation bill.\n  I wish to recognize the efforts of my colleague from Rhode Island. We \nhave worked very closely toward this common goal. Those of us who live \nin the Northeast or the Midwest or cold-weather States have a special \nappreciation for just how much hardship will be imposed if we do not \nincrease this funding.\n  I commend the administration for calling for $1 billion in additional \nfunding, but, frankly, that is simply not enough. We need to do more. I \nhope that just as many of us are responding to the needs of those \nvictims of the hurricanes in the gulf region, that our colleagues from \nthat area of the country and from other areas of the country will join \nus in averting this looming crisis.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague, Senator \nCollins, for her leadership on this issue and for the eloquence and \npersuasiveness of her statement today. She has truly been in the \nforefront of all these efforts to increase the funding for the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk a motion to instruct conferees on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Collins, Senator Kennedy, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Leahy, Senator Bingaman, Senator Coleman, \nSenator Salazar, Senator Stabenow, Senator Clinton, Senator Lugar, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Smith, Senator Kohl, Senator Dayton, and \nSenator Corzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n     The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendments \n     to the bill S.1932 (to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \n     section 202(a) of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95)) be instructed to insist \n     on a provision that makes available $2,920,000,000 for the \n     Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 \n     et seq.), in addition to the $2,183,000,000 made available \n     for such Act in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act, 2006, for the following reasons:\n       (1) High energy prices threaten to overcome low-income \n     households in the United States. On average, households \n     heating their homes primarily with natural gas will likely \n     spend 38 percent more for home energy this winter than last \n     winter. Households heating their homes primarily with heating \n     oil will likely spend 21 percent more for home energy this \n     winter than last winter. Households heating their homes \n     primary with propane will likely spend 15 percent more for \n     home energy this winter than last winter. For many low-income \n     households, including households with individuals with \n     disabilities or senior citizens living on fixed incomes, \n     those price increases will make home energy unaffordable.\n       (2) An appropriation of $2,920,000,000 would bring funding \n     for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 for \n     fiscal year 2006 to $5,100,000,000, the amount authorized in \n     section 2602(b) of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act \n     of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)), as amended by the Energy Policy \n     Act of 2005, for fiscal year 2006.\n       (3) In the United States, no family should be forced to \n     choose between heating its home and putting food on the table \n     for its children. No senior citizen should have to decide \n     between buying lifesaving pharmaceuticals or paying the \n     senior citizen's electric bill.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have very little to add to what Senator \nCollins said. Her remarks were compelling and eloquent. With the \nincrease in prices, with the severity of the winter which is already \nupon many parts of this country, Rhode Island, and particularly Maine, \nit is obvious we need more funds just to keep what we were able to do \nlast year. In fact, even if we are successful--and I hope we are--in \nauthorizing the full allocation of $5.1 billion, there will still be a \nsignificant number of Americans who qualify for the program who will \nnot be able to receive any type of help this winter. So this is an \nimportant step, but it is certainly not a complete solution to the \nproblem of low-income people struggling to heat their homes.\n  As the Senator also pointed out so accurately, there is a real \ndilemma. Many families will have to give up food to heat their homes, \nand they will have to make other sacrifices. This is an extraordinary \nburden and particularly so this winter because of the huge increase in \nheating costs and the severity of the weather that is predicted for the \nregion.\n  There has been some suggestion, or objection, I should say, to our \nproposal on several grounds. There is a suggestion that we have been \ninconsistent in what we have asked for. Last September, Senator Collins \nand I authored a letter, and we were joined by 40 of our colleagues, \nfor an increase of about $1 billion. Forty-three Senators, including \nmyself and Senator Collins, wrote to the Appropriations Committee. What \nwe were asking for was allocation of emergency funding, funding that \nwould go to the President so that at his discretion he could identify\n\n[[Page S13545]]\n\nareas of the country under severe conditions and make allocation of \nthese funds.\n  What we are talking about today is fully funding the State grant \nprogram. One of the reasons it is essential to fully fund the State \ngrant program at the level of about $5.2 billion is because of the \ncomplexity of the formulas. Unless we fully fund this program, many of \nthe States that are in the most dire circumstances won't receive \nfunding.\n  Essentially, what happens is there is a front loading of funds to the \nareas of the country that are affected by winter, but as the funds in \nLIHEAP increase, appropriations and allocations go to areas of the \ncountry--the Southwest, the Southeast--that have problems in the \nsummertime and need cooling assistance. The irony would be if we \nincrease money but do not really increase it to the full level, we \nwould be funding--and I think it is appropriate to do that--States that \nare not affected by the winter and providing very little for the States \nsuch as Wisconsin, Maine, New Hampshire, and others that need the \nheating assistance today. So that is the rationale underlying our \nrequest.\n  I point out that we have brought this issue to the floor on numerous \noccasions, and we have had the support of a majority of the Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle and across the country. This is not a regional \nissue; this is a national issue. This is not a Republican or Democratic \nissue; this is a bipartisan issue. We have had that support because the \nmajority of our colleagues recognize the reality. Prices are up, the \ntemperature is down. People are going to suffer if we do not act.\n  There has also been a suggestion that this is inappropriate because \nit is not offset by cuts in other programs. Well, I would hasten to add \nthat in the next few weeks we are going to consider many programs and \nfunding requests that are not offset. Today, if one reads the \nnewspapers, the Pentagon is preparing about a $100 billion supplemental \nrequest for funding in Iraq and Afghanistan. That may come down; it may \ngo up. No one is proposing that we not consider that because it will \nnot be offset by cuts in other programs. I think we are going to see, \nat least in the House version of the tax reconciliation bill, \nsignificant tax cuts which I believe are not offset. I think we should \nmove to a balanced budget. I think we should take the tough steps that \nwe took in the 1980s. I came here as a Congressman in January 1991, and \nwe were running huge deficits every year. It took us a while. It was \nunder the leadership of President Clinton that we were able to reverse \nthat.\n  At the end of the 1990s, in the year 2000, we were looking at a \nprojected surplus. Lo and behold, it is now the year 2005, and we are \nback into annual deficits and a projected deficit over many years \nbefore us. So we can do it, but I suggest those are not strong \narguments to stop us from doing what we have to do today to help people \nwho really will suffer if we do not take appropriate action.\n  I hope my colleagues would join Senator Collins and I--and again I \nwould point out that this is a bipartisan, broadly based group of \nSenators who are coming together to make a simple request that I think \nis compelling, given the obvious reality, huge increase in prices, \nfalling temperatures, people who will give up eating to heat their \nhomes, people who will take drastic steps. Unfortunately, we read about \nit every winter in our part of the country, Senator Collins and I, \nwhere they turn the stove on at night, they go to sleep, and there is a \nfire, an explosion, a terrible tragedy. They are just trying to keep \nwarm. We can help them. I hope we will.\n  I am pleased and proud to be doing this with my colleague and friend, \nSenator Collins from Maine.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to just \nkind of talk a little bit about the process of the end of the year here \nin the Senate and something that I do not think is healthy for the \nAmerican people. It is certainly not healthy for the Senate, but in the \nlong run it is not healthy for our country.\n  I have thought a lot about this, considering the campaign I went \nthrough to become a U.S. Senator. The theme that keeps recurring in my \nmind is that we are all Americans. There are multiple parties, there \nare differences within parties, there are conservative Republicans, \nliberal Republicans, conservative Democrats, liberal Democrats, but we \nare all Americans. If there ever was a time our Nation required \nleadership instead of partisanship, it is now.\n  We are on an absolutely unsustainable financial course. We have heard \ngreat criticisms today, not by a member of any party but by a person \nwho chooses to make those criticisms of the direction it is trying to \ngo in terms of trying to get us off that unsustainable course. It kind \nof grieves me for our country that we lack the leadership to stay \nfocused on what is important for the country and instead focus on what \nsomebody else does wrong or is perceived to do wrong.\n  We can have tremendously intelligent and respectful debate that is \ndirected toward a difference of opinion about issues. But the problems \nthat face this country today are greater than any in my lifetime. This \nlast year, we charged to our children and our grandchildren $528 \nbillion. That $528 billion is how much the debt grew last year. It is \ngoing to require absolutely zero partisanship over the next 20 years in \nthis country for us to try to attack the structural problems that are \ngoing to undermine the future opportunities of our children.\n  I am reminded of history because Franklin Delano Roosevelt, facing a \nsimilar situation to what we have right now in our country, cut out \nthree of his most favorite programs and cut discretionary spending by \n22 percent so he could do what was right for the next two generations.\n  I worry we lack that foresight, or if we do not lack it, we place \npartisan political positioning and elections that are coming ahead of \nthe best interests of our Nation.\n  We have heard about cuts. We have heard about taxes. We have heard \nabout all sorts of things, described in a way so you would think \nanybody who believed opposite of that would just be terrible. That is \nnot the truth. It is not anywhere close to the truth. Anybody who is a \nMember of this body cares immensely about this country. They just \ndiffer about how they want to go about getting to a solution.\n  If we have half a trillion dollars that we added to our children's \ndebt this year and we are on a course, with Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity, and interest on the national debt--by the way, which nobody \never speaks of, which is the fourth largest item and will soon become \nthe largest item--if we do not have the desire and the will to work \ntogether as loyal opponents, with the best interests of our country at \nheart, taking the partisanship out of it--nobody is bad, they just have \na different idea.\n  I hope as we wind up the Senate year that we will keep in mind that \nwhat I believe to be true throughout the country and that is that \ncountry is nauseated by partisanship. It doesn't build our country, it \ntears our country down. It doesn't promote unity, it promotes division, \nit promotes polarization, and our problems are so great that we ought \nto be following the advice of John Kennedy. We ought to be following \nthe advice that says: Don't ask what your country can do for you, ask \nwhat you can do for your country.\n  If there is ever a time that we needed to be doing that, both as \nMembers of the Senate and as citizens of this country, it is now. The \nnumbers that face us in the future--a war in Iraq, the devastation on \nthe gulf coast, and a structural deficit--require that we have a shift, \nand the shift is that we look to the long run, that we don't try to \ngain the short run, and that we do what is in the best interests of the \ncountry, and the first thing we do that is in the best interests of the \ncountry is to put partisanship aside.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S13546]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if I might inquire of my friend and \ncolleague from Louisiana, I know she is preparing to speak. Might I ask \nabout how long she may speak? I have a speech. I ask unanimous consent, \nafter the Senator from Louisiana finishes speaking, that I be \nrecognized for up to half an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, we will be very brief. I know we have two \nof our colleagues on the floor prepared to speak.\n  What we have just done is turn to the conference report on the \nPATRIOT Act, a vitally important piece of legislation, that in \nbipartisan way our colleagues have addressed, in a bicameral way, and \nit is now our intention to address the PATRIOT Act, discuss it over the \ncourse of, I am sure, later this evening as well as tomorrow.\n  Because we were unable to come to a unanimous consent agreement to \naddress this bill in a limited amount of time, in an appropriate amount \nof time, and then to vote up or down on the bill, I filed a cloture \nmotion, and that cloture vote will actually be Friday morning. I will \nhave more to say about that.\n  Let me briefly turn to my distinguished colleague, who is chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, who has put together, again in a bipartisan \nway with a lot of negotiation and compromise over the long period of \ntime, a bill that, as we all know, has passed the House of \nRepresentatives earlier today with I believe 44 Democrats voting for \nthe PATRIOT Act in the House of Representatives, a bill that we now \nwill be addressing on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I shall be brief. I know two Senators are \nwaiting to speak.\n  I congratulate the House of Representatives for approving the \nconference report by a significant margin.\n  I thank the majority leader for moving ahead procedurally with filing \nof the cloture motion. There have been a number of public statements \nmade by Senators about an intention to filibuster. We are obviously at \nthe conclusion of our work and we want to proceed. I am advised by the \ndistinguished majority leader that this conference report will be on \nthe floor tomorrow.\n  I urge my colleagues to come to the Senate to debate the issue. It is \na complicated bill. I addressed it at some length the day before \nyesterday with a floor statement, moving into the critical areas. \nYesterday, Senator Feingold and I had an opportunity to discuss the \nbill for almost an hour. It is valuable for our colleagues to know the \ndetails as to what is in the bill. That can be best accomplished by an \ninterchange of ideas, those who have objections stating them, and \nhearing the responses so that we may fulfill our responsibility as the \nworld's greatest deliberative body. I look forward to that exchange and \ndebate.\n  I believe it is an acceptable bill, a good bill, not a perfect bill. \nI am prepared to go into detail. I have talked to many of my colleagues \none on one, individually, and I have found, understandably, because of \nthe complexity of the bill, that many of its provisions are not fully \nunderstood as to what they mean and what the import is and why we have \ncome to this.\n  Ideally, I would like to have seen the Senate bill go through \nunanimously, passed by the Judiciary Committee 18 to 0, and then on the \nunanimous consent calendar here, which is, I think, unprecedented for a \nbill of this magnitude. But we have a bicameral system, and we \nconferred at length with our colleagues in the House of Representatives \nand are presenting the conference bill, which I submit is a good bill \nthat I am prepared to advocate tomorrow.\n  I urge those who want to speak to come to the Senate tomorrow morning \nwhen we take up the bill and have a constructive debate so our \ncolleagues may be informed about the contents and vote on the cloture \nmotion in a timely way and hopefully move forward to consideration on \nan up-and-down vote.\n  I thank my colleagues from Louisiana and Iowa for yielding this time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me very briefly close in stating my \nstrong support for the legislation, the substance of the legislation, \nbut also underscore the importance of this Senate acting on this \nlegislation. I encourage our colleagues who have talked about \nfilibuster to do exactly what our distinguished chairman has talked \nabout, and that is look at the substance of the bill. A lot of changes \nand modifications have been a product of compromise and negotiation and \nhave been put into the bill. It is very strong in terms of issues such \nas terrorist financing and protection of our ports and addressing \nissues surrounding mass transit and privacy and personal liberties.\n  This bill does present us with a stark and clear choice: Should we \ntake a step forward, which we have an opportunity to do in the next \nseveral days, or take a step backwards in that goal to make America \nsafer? It does expire on December 31. The PATRIOT Act expires on \nDecember 31, but the terrorist threat does not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I begin as my leader is in the Senate to \nsay the bill they most certainly have presented for our consideration \nis one that needs attention and needs deliberation. The PATRIOT Act is \na very important part of the security of our Nation. We can debate the \ninside and pieces of it, but I strongly suggest to the leadership that \nprotecting America is more than just the chapters and statutes related \nto the PATRIOT Act.\n  Protecting America is about protecting patriots in the gulf coast, in \nLouisiana, in Mississippi--not just citizens who are patriots, taxpayer \ncitizens, hard-working citizens who have come to believe the notion \nthat in America they are safe, or should be safe, and if disaster does \nstrike, the government, with the private sector and with their own \neffort, will be there to help.\n  What about the patriots on the gulf coast who are veterans \nthemselves, the 400,000 veterans in Louisiana, the 250,000-plus \nveterans in Mississippi--just for two States that were affected--men \nand women who have put on the uniform, served their time, true \npatriots. What are we doing to secure their homes, their schools, their \nchurches?\n  I suggest to the leadership that while the PATRIOT Act itself has \nmany pieces of what helps make America secure, it is one piece but not \nthe only piece. We should most certainly not be comfortable leaving \nhere without securing the homes and businesses and dreams of average \nAmericans, patriots, on the gulf coast.\n  As I speak for just a few minutes this afternoon, it has been over \n100 days\n\n[[Page S13547]]\n\nsince two of the deadliest storms hit the coast of America: Katrina and \nRita, Katrina on the southeastern part of Louisiana, on the Mississippi \nsection as well, and Rita, just a little over a week later hitting the \nsouthwest part of Louisiana and Texas counties as well.\n  As the days and weeks have unfolded and as there have been \ninvestigations and hearings and committees that have looked into what \nhappened, I suggest it was not just a natural disaster that led us to \nthis point but a manmade disaster.\n  The Times-Picayune, the major newspaper in New Orleans, and other \npapers in the region, have written extensively on this subject. I ask \nunanimous consent that this article, ``Evidence Points to a Man-Made \nDisaster,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Times-Picayune, Dec. 8, 2005]\n\n                  Evidence Points to Man-Made Disaster\n\n         (By John McQuaid, Bob Marshall and Mark Schleifstein)\n\n       As investigators and residents have picked through the \n     battered New Orleans levee system's breaches, churned-up soil \n     and bent sheet pile in the 100 days since Hurricane Katrina \n     struck, they have uncovered mounting evidence that human \n     error played a major role in the flood that devastated the \n     city.\n       Floodwall breaches linked to design flaws inundated parts \n     of the city that otherwise would have stayed dry, turning \n     neighborhoods into death traps and causing massive damage. In \n     other areas, poorly engineered gaps and erosion of weak \n     construction materials accelerated and deepened flooding \n     already under way, hampering rescue efforts in the wake of \n     the storm.\n       These problems turned an already deadly disaster into a \n     wider man-made catastrophe and have made rebuilding and \n     resettlement into far tougher and more expensive challenges.\n       That's the picture that emerges from investigations of the \n     levee system by teams sponsored by the state government, the \n     American Society of Civil Engineers and the National Science \n     Foundation, as well as from dozens of interviews with local \n     residents, officials and engineers.\n       Experts say the New Orleans flood of 2005 should join the \n     space shuttle explosions and the sinking of the Titanic on \n     history's list of ill-fated disasters attributable to human \n     mistakes.\n       The evidence points to critical failures in design and \n     construction, as well as a lack of project oversight and \n     responsibility that allowed small problems to metastasize \n     into fatal errors. Twisted lines of authority led to cursory \n     inspections, communications snafus and even confusion about \n     such basic information as wall dimensions.\n       Outside engineers, political leaders and many New Orleans \n     residents now question the judgments and even the once-\n     unassailable competency of the Army Corps of Engineers, which \n     had final authority over the system. The corps and some of \n     the same firms involved in the original design and \n     construction of the levees are spearheading the effort to \n     repair the system and already are planning to build stronger \n     protections.\n       Sen. David Vitter, R-La., who sits on two Senate committees \n     investigating the levee failures, says the U.S. system for \n     building flood defenses is broken. The corps, he said, should \n     be overseen by outsiders who can ensure it will do the job \n     right.\n       ``We need a new model, a new structure, a new process to \n     get this done which has to include outside, independent \n     review of the corps by outside, independent engineering \n     experts,'' he said.\n\n\n                           ``The best minds''\n\n       The levee flaws also raise troubling questions about the \n     integrity of flood defenses elsewhere.\n       ``Everybody who has a levee out the back door now has to \n     look out and wonder, is this going to fail? Was it designed \n     right?'' said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for \n     Common Sense, a Washington fiscal watchdog group critical of \n     the corps' priorities.\n       Corps spokesman David Hewitt said the agency has several \n     experts and engineers from outside agencies, private firms \n     and academia to aid its investigation. ``We are determined to \n     find out exactly what happened both in the technical \n     engineering and the planning and execution process so that we \n     can prevent another occurrence,'' Hewitt said. ``We are \n     engaging the best minds and professional expertise in this \n     important effort.''\n       Engineers say most structures that fail do so not because \n     they're hit by overwhelming forces, but because of flaws that \n     creep in unnoticed during design, construction and upkeep. A \n     paper published this month by Robert Bea, an engineering \n     professor at the University of California at Berkeley who is \n     studying the levee failures, concluded that 80 percent of 600 \n     structural engineering failures he studied in the past 17 \n     years were caused by ``human, organizational and knowledge \n     uncertainties.''\n       Bea said everything he has seen about the New Orleans levee \n     system so far tells him it belongs in that category.\n\n\n                       Not as good as advertised\n\n       The levee system's design dates to the 1950s, when \n     understanding of hurricane risks and flood dynamics was \n     primitive compared to today. The system was never built to \n     take a hit from the most powerful hurricanes, storms in \n     Categories 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The levees \n     were designed by congressional mandate to fend off floodwater \n     heights--up to about 11 or 13 feet, depending on location--\n     that Category 1 or 2, and some Category 3 storms would kick \n     up.\n       But the investigations show that the levees did not live up \n     even to that billing. When Katrina's storm surge rolled in \n     from the Gulf of Mexico before dawn Aug. 29, the huge dome of \n     water followed a path up the Mississippi River and then along \n     the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet into Lake Borgne.\n       In a matter of hours, the sheet of water--reaching 25 feet \n     high at some locations--moved relentlessly north and west, \n     pouring over the tops of and eroding large stretches of \n     levees surrounding Chalmette, clearly exceeding their \n     design capacity.\n       When the surge reached New Orleans' southern edge along the \n     Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, it caused as much as five miles \n     of the 17.5-foot tall levee there to disappear, creating a \n     back door for water into eastern New Orleans.\n       Water pushed west through the waterway into the Industrial \n     Canal, where it met water already rising from storm surge \n     that had entered Lake Pontchartrain. The water topped levees \n     on both sides of the canal, causing walls to fail on the east \n     side, flooding the Lower 9th Ward, and leaking through \n     smaller levee breaks and a pump station on the west side, \n     flooding the rest of the 9th Ward.\n\n\n                           Breaches by design\n\n       Later that morning, as surge rose in Lake Pontchartrain, \n     floodwalls along the 17th Street and London Avenue canals \n     breached, even though the water was well below their tops. \n     Investigators say those breaches shouldn't have happened. \n     Observational data and computer modeling indicate that storm \n     surge entering the canals from the lake reached heights \n     ranging from 9 to 11 feet in the 17th Street Canal and 11 to \n     12 feet in the London Avenue Canal. The walls were 13.5 feet \n     high or higher along much of the two canals and were designed \n     to withstand water rising to 11.5 feet.\n       Investigators say the walls broke when floodwater, pushing \n     through the soft, porous earth under the steel sheet pile \n     foundations, started moving the soil. In the 17th Street \n     Canal, one breach opened on the east side, and in the London \n     Avenue, two breaches occurred. Water poured into the \n     Lakefront area and moved south, inundating much of central \n     New Orleans over the course of the day and night.\n       Engineers say some systemic design problem--not merely a \n     localized fluke--caused the breaches because walls gave way \n     in two canals and some walls appear to have been close to \n     breaching at other points.\n       While it's easy to second-guess after a disaster, outside \n     engineers say the depth of the sheet pile foundation appears \n     too shallow. A survey by Team Louisiana, the state-sponsored \n     forensics group, found--and the corps confirmed last week--\n     that the sheet pile depth was about 10 feet below sea level \n     in the breached areas at both canals, much shallower than the \n     18.5 foot below-sea-level depth of the canals and 7 feet \n     shorter than the corps thought.\n       Modjeski & Masters, the firm that designed the 17th Street \n     canal wall, said last week it had initially recommended a 35-\n     foot depth for the piling on the 17th Street Canal, then \n     shortened it at the corps' behest, but the firm offered no \n     documentation to back the claim.\n\n\n                            Soil and safety\n\n       It's still unclear exactly what went wrong, though \n     engineers suggest the soil's resiliency was overestimated.\n       New Orleans soil is swampy and mushy, with alternating \n     layers of peat, clay and sand. Along the length of a \n     floodwall it varies wildly in consistency and strength. Along \n     both canals, a layer of peat--the weakest and spongiest of \n     soils--lies directly under breaches a few feet below the base \n     of the sheet pile. Along the London Avenue Canal, coarse sand \n     underlay the peat and now lies throughout nearby residential \n     yards and homes, another layer of weakness, the engineers \n     said.\n       ``Those are the kinds of subsurface conditions that lend \n     themselves to having weak pockets or stronger pockets, and \n     Mother Nature will always find the weak pockets,'' said \n     Joseph Wartman, a Drexel University geotechnical engineer \n     studying the levee failures. ``What makes levee design and \n     engineering so challenging is you can have a system that's \n     many, many miles long and you only need the weakest 150 \n     feet to rupture for the whole system to fail.''\n       Another factor in the breaches, one with national \n     implications, is the low safety factor used in constructing \n     the levee banks and floodwalls. A safety factor is a kind of \n     cushion that engineers include in a structure's design to \n     ensure it can withstand all the punishment it's designed to \n     take, plus a little more.\n       Corps standards for levees and floodwalls date back \n     decades, officials say, and were intended to protect sparsely \n     populated areas, not cities and billions of dollars of \n     infrastructure. The safety factor of 1.3 used in the designs \n     is significantly lower than those used in structures with \n     similarly large-scale tasks of protecting lives and property.\n\n[[Page S13548]]\n\n       With data from soil borings spaced at more than 300-foot \n     intervals along the canals, engineers could develop only a \n     fragmentary picture of what is underground. They were \n     supposed to account for that uncertainty. That is typically \n     done by raising the safety factor or by making conservative \n     estimates of soil conditions.\n       Team Louisiana investigators said last week that based on \n     new calculations, they think engineers working for \n     contractors Eustis Engineering and Modjeski & Masters \n     miscalculated the depths of the 17th Street Canal walls. The \n     team has not yet released detailed findings. University of \n     California engineers say the designers might not have \n     accounted for storm surge's effects on the soil.\n       According to project and court documents, those designs \n     were reviewed and approved by corps engineers.\n       It's not clear yet whether additional factors such as cost-\n     cutting or specific on-site construction problems contributed \n     to the levee breaches, but the failures can also be linked to \n     a chain of political and managerial decisions.\n       The corps originally proposed building floodgates at the \n     mouth of each canal--and at the mouth of the Orleans Canal \n     that runs along the west side of City Park--to block surge. \n     But local officials, including those at the Orleans Levee \n     Board and New Orleans Sewerage & Water Board, insisted on \n     building floodwalls because floodgates would have made it \n     difficult to pump water out during a storm. Engineers say the \n     obvious, though expensive, solution is to build pumping \n     stations at the lakefront rather than miles inland.\n       A 1980s-era Sewerage & Water Board dredging project in the \n     17th Street Canal next to the breached area left the Orleans \n     Parish canal-side levee wall much narrower than that on the \n     Jefferson Parish side. Investigators say that change probably \n     contributed to the failure of the wall.\n       Pittman Construction, the contractor that built the 17th \n     Street Canal wall, ran into trouble driving sheet piles in \n     1993. When the concrete tops to the walls were poured, \n     documents show, the walls tipped slightly. Though the corps \n     attributed this to Pittman's methods, not the site \n     conditions, and a judge agreed, some engineers say the \n     difficulty they encountered was an early warning sign.\n\n\n                           What lies beneath\n\n       Meanwhile, state and local officials have admitted they \n     generally skipped the canal floodwalls in annual inspections \n     of levees--and the levees they did inspect were examined in a \n     cursory fashion.\n       Though necessary, visual inspections are of limited use. \n     Absent an obvious problem like water bubbling to the surface, \n     most levee problems go on out of sight, meaning a system's \n     problems can go undetected for years without a more \n     aggressive inspection program that includes probing beneath \n     the surface with soil sampling, sonar or other methods.\n       ``It looks perfect from the outside. It looks in good \n     shape. Even if you had a 10-man crew walking along there \n     every day, you would not have seen the problem,'' said Jurjen \n     Battjes, a retired professor of engineering from the \n     Technical University of Delft, Netherlands, who is on an \n     American Society of Civil Engineers panel reviewing the \n     corps' investigation.\n       To the east, assessing the levee system's performance is a \n     more complicated task. Water flowed over levees and \n     floodwalls along the Industrial Canal, Gulf Intracoastal \n     Waterway and Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet. In many spots, \n     the water scoured out earth along the dry side and the walls \n     gave way.\n       In general, engineers say that once a levee is topped, its \n     structural integrity cannot be guaranteed. But the speed with \n     which many of the walls breached or eroded and the large \n     scope of the damage have alarmed investigators. The outer \n     levee along the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet protecting St. \n     Bernard Parish and the levee along the north side of the Gulf \n     Intracoastal Waterway protecting part of the Lower 9th Ward \n     were all but washed away by the storm, for example.\n       Engineers say that if a wall is sturdy enough to remain in \n     place while water flows over it, flooding will be minimized, \n     lasting only until the surge drops. When a breach opens, \n     adjacent neighborhoods basically become part of nearby \n     waterways and the scale of the flooding is many times \n     greater.\n\n\n                           The funnel effect\n\n       One source of the scouring and multiple breaches is \n     actually a corps policy, dictated by Congress. Corps \n     officials say they are not allowed to put rip-rap, concrete \n     or other forms of scour protection on the dry side of levees. \n     Doing that anticipates flood level higher than the walls are \n     designed for, which is beyond the corps' mandate for Category \n     3 protection.\n       A report published last month by the American Society of \n     Civil Engineers and National Science Foundation teams \n     identified other unanticipated weaknesses in the levee \n     system. Builders used weak, sandy soils in the now-\n     obliterated St. Bernard Parish hurricane levee, and that \n     likely contributed to its rapid destruction. In areas where \n     two different levee sections came together, investigators \n     found many awkwardly engineered transitions that allowed \n     water through.\n       A much larger problem lies in the overall design of the \n     levees along the city's southeastern flank. Unlike areas \n     fronting Lake Pontchartrain, southeastern areas are more or \n     less directly exposed to waters from the Gulf, and hurricane \n     floods are more likely to strike there and rise higher when \n     they do.\n       The levee system forms a V-shape where the MR-GO and \n     Intracoastal Waterway meet. That acts as a giant funnel, \n     driving water heights even higher and channeling storm surge \n     directly into canals leading into the city.\n       Computer modelers have complained for years that the corps \n     had underestimated the risk to those areas, and former corps \n     modeler Lee Butler estimated the actual risk was double the \n     corps estimate in a 2002 study done for The Times-Picayune. \n     The corps only recently announced it will stop dredging the \n     MR-GO.\n\n\n                          Waiting for answers\n\n       It will take months, and possibly years, to arrive at a \n     detailed assessment of what went wrong and assess \n     responsibility, engineers familiar with the situation say. \n     Investigators must determine not only why individual wall \n     sections failed, but they also must trace the roots of \n     decisions, untangling overlapping responsibilities of the \n     corps, private contractors and local agencies. A federal \n     interagency team investigating the system won't make its \n     report until June. A National Research Council team is only \n     now being formed.\n       So far, the scope of the disaster, and the human element \n     central to it, have only begun to sink in among political \n     leaders and agency heads, including the corps, which is at \n     the center of all the inquiries. The corps has declined to \n     comment on the causes of the levee failures, pending the \n     outcome of its own studies.\n       People familiar with the agency say the disaster means \n     things might never be the same.\n       ``In the old days the corps used to get criticized for \n     being way too conservative in their designs,'' said Don \n     Sweeney, a corps economist for 22 years who left after \n     exposing irregularities in the agency's economic impact \n     statements and now teaches at the University of Missouri. \n     ``They would design a structure with a safety factor of 4 or \n     5. They did have that reputation of building things with \n     integrity that were built to last. And if they said it was \n     built to do something, it would do it.''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord ``Corps' Own Study Backs Critics of Levee Engineering.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Corps' Own Study Backs Critics of Levee Engineering\n\n                [From the Times-Pacayune, Dec. 10, 2005]\n\n                         (By Mark Schleifstein)\n\n       An internal review by the Army Corps of Engineers supports \n     most of the criticisms leveled against the New Orleans area \n     levee system by an independent team of engineers, including \n     questions about soil strength, levee maintenance and whether \n     the system was built as designed.\n       In a Dec. 5 interim report released Friday, the Interagency \n     Performance Evaluation Task Force said its conclusions \n     already have been passed on to engineers who are working to \n     restore the levee system to its authorized protection level \n     before it was overwhelmed by Hurricane Katrina, flooding more \n     than 70 percent of the city.\n       ``The IPET team vigorously agrees that everything possible \n     should be done to reconstitute an effective and resilient \n     flood protection system for the New Orleans area,'' the \n     report said.\n       While the level of protection is still limited by past \n     congressional authorizations to the equivalent of a fast-\n     moving Category 3 hurricane, the report said the task force \n     will evaluate the risk and reliability of that system.\n       ``This will provide a clearer perspective of the overall \n     performance capacity of the system for use by individuals and \n     governments in their decision making,'' the report said.\n       The task force concurred with the independent engineers \n     from the American Society of Civil Engineers and the National \n     Science Foundation that the failure of levee walls at the \n     17th Street and London Avenue canals were likely caused by \n     failures in the foundation soils beneath them. The engineers \n     also have noted that sheet piling beneath the walls was too \n     short to properly support the walls.\n       The independent engineers said soft peaty soils under the \n     17th Street levee and a combination of soft peat and sand \n     beneath the London Avenue levees allowed water from the \n     canals to push the walls and earth beneath them out of the \n     breach areas, allowing water to flood into much of the city.\n       ``Extensive observations by a number of teams found no \n     signs of major overtopping of these systems at the breach \n     sites,'' the report said, pointing to a structural failure of \n     the floodwalls at those sites.\n\n\n                           Analyzing failures\n\n       The corps task force is studying a variety of other factors \n     that also may be involved in the failures at those two \n     canals:\n       The potential for differences between how the levee and \n     floodwall structures were built and the plans and \n     specifications that were supposed have guided their \n     construction.\n       Properties of soil layers beneath the levees to a depth of \n     60 feet below sea level.\n       The kinds of soil materials, including whether they were \n     natural deposits or were\n\n[[Page S13549]]\n\n     compacted properly to remove moisture and be more dense.\n       Whether the soil layers included tree stumps or other \n     organic materials.\n       The way the soil may have coped with the forces imposed by \n     Katrina's wind and water.\n       The effect of trees, swimming pools and other objects in \n     nearby back yards that may have affected the levee strength.\n       How close the levee failures were to bridges, and whether \n     the connection between them was adequate.\n       Whether operations and maintenance practices by the corps \n     and individual levee boards differed from the corps' \n     Operations and Maintenance Manual.\n       The task force said it had found evidence that scour, \n     probably from water going over the top of the levee, occurred \n     along the London Avenue Canal at the southeast corner of its \n     intersection with the Robert E. Lee bridge, near a part of \n     the wall that looks deformed. That levee section is directly \n     across from a breach.\n       Damage near a pump station at the southern end of the \n     Orleans Canal also appears to indicate water topped the levee \n     wall there, the report said.\n       Along the levee walls of the Industrial Canal and along \n     earthen levees on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and \n     Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet, Katrina's storm surge went \n     over the top, causing scouring or in some cases simply \n     washing away large parts of the levees, the report said.\n       At the Industrial Canal, the water pouring over the wall \n     scoured the levee on what was supposed to be the protected \n     side of the I-shaped levee wall.\n       ``The erosion appeared to be so severe that the sheet piles \n     may have lost all of their foundation support, resulting in \n     failure,'' the corps report said.\n\n\n                       Protecting back of levees\n\n       The task force also agreed with the independent engineers \n     that those designing repairs to the levee systems should \n     consider ways of protecting the back sides of levees from the \n     effects of water scour in the event another major hurricane's \n     storm surge tops the levees.\n       Officials with the corps' Task Force Guardian, which is in \n     charge of the rebuilding effort, already have said they plan \n     to use more protective inverted-T levee walls in the 17th \n     Street and London Avenue canals where breaches occurred. \n     Water topping such a wall would splash down on a concrete \n     strip before running off.\n       The investigative task force also said the use of erosion \n     protection, including riprap, concrete mats or slabs, or \n     paving, should be considered in areas where erosion by waves \n     and surge are possible. The report said additional study is \n     under way into where structures in the levee system are most \n     likely to sustain unusually large surge and wave conditions.\n       And the report recommended using stronger clay soils in \n     building levees ``to improve their survivability chances.''\n       The investigative task force also recommended that in \n     rebuilding, more effort should be put into assuring that \n     connections between different types of protective systems--\n     such as walls and earthen levees--be better designed.\n       ``A common problem observed throughout the flood protection \n     system was the scour and washout found at the transition \n     between structural features and earthen levees,'' the report \n     said. Similar problems occurred where ``penetrations,'' such \n     as streets or railroad tracks, went through levee structures, \n     the report said.\n       The task force also agreed with the independent engineers' \n     conclusion that a lack of access to the land side of levees \n     and levee walls, such as found along the canals in New \n     Orleans, led to major problems for emergency personnel \n     attempting to make repairs.\n       In the aftermath of Katrina, corps contractors had to build \n     a road behind homes along Bellaire Drive to reach the 17th \n     Street canal breach.\n       Corps officials told the Orleans Levee Board this week that \n     they expect to expand the canal levee walls' rights of way by \n     15 feet to build an access road.\n\n\n                          Looking for weakness\n\n       The task force also recommended that corps officials \n     undertake an in-depth investigation of the area's levees to \n     determine where other weaknesses might lie.\n       ``Detailed inspection of the entire hurricane protection \n     system using appropriate remote sensing, surveying, \n     inspection and investigation techniques and equipment \n     implemented and analyzed by properly trained and experienced \n     professionals is recommended to identify those structures \n     that have been weakened but have little visual evidence of \n     degradation,'' the report said.\n       The corps task force held off on agreeing with a \n     recommendation from the independent engineers to keep sheet \n     piles in place along bridges on the northern end of the 17th \n     Street and London Avenue canals so they could be easily \n     plugged in advance of a storm during the next hurricane \n     season.\n       That decision will require further study, the report said.\n       The report said it was outside the task force's authority \n     to concur with the independent engineers' recommendation that \n     the corps should retain an independent board of consultants \n     to review the adequacy of interim and permanent repairs.\n       The report points out that Katrina's sustained winds were \n     at 147 mph when it crossed the Louisiana coast early Aug. 29.\n       ``The sustained wind speeds for the standard project \n     hurricanes used to design many of the flood protection \n     structures in and around New Orleans were in the neighborhood \n     of 100 miles per hour,'' the report said. ``While wind speed \n     alone is not a complete measure of the surge and wave \n     environments experienced by specific structures, it is a \n     clear indicator of the level of the forces to which the \n     system was subjected.''\n       According to National Weather Service records, the highest \n     winds recorded in the immediate New Orleans area were gusts \n     of 105 mph at Lakefront Airport and Belle Chasse Naval Air \n     Station. But much higher wind speeds were believed to have \n     occurred in eastern New Orleans and St. Bernard and \n     Plaquemines parishes, which were directly in the path of \n     Katrina's eye.\n       The report said the task force is conducting an analysis of \n     Katrina's surge and wave effects in Lake Borgne and the rest \n     of the New Orleans area so the data can be used in \n     determining the forces acting on levees and floodwalls \n     throughout the area.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The point is, this was not just a natural disaster, it \nwas a manmade disaster. One of our columnists captured it correctly. \nYou could almost argue, based on the evidence that is in, independent \nevidence, that it was a Federal Government-sponsored disaster.\n  Let me repeat, these are strong words: A Federal Government-sponsored \ndisaster because it was the Corps of Engineers, the failing of a \nsophisticated and supposedly a strong levee system that failed, that \nput a major American city underwater 10 to 15 feet for 2 weeks and \nflooded a region, with multiple levee breaks in an urban area.\n  It has never happened in the recent hitory of America. It has not \nhappened since the great floods of 1927 when the Mississippi system was \ndesigned. It is written and documented beautifully in John Barry's \nbook, ``Rising Tide.''\n  We have a natural disaster of unprecedented proportion coupled by a \nmanmade disaster of neglect, poor design, faulty design, and no telling \nwhat else will be discovered. This is the result. These are homes that \nresulted. A hurricane did not do this. Katrina did not do this. Rita \ndid not do this. We did this. The Federal Government sponsored this \ndisaster by not securing and supporting the levee system, by not \nengineering it properly, and this home that is in Chalmette, which is \nin St. Bernard Parish which lost almost every home in the parish. This \nis why I say we shouldn't go home because people in St. Bernard, in St. \nTammany, in Orleans, in Vermilion, in Cameron, in Calcasieu, in \ncounties along the Mississippi gulf coast from towns such as Biloxi and \nWaveland, this is what their homes look like.\n  Let me show another picture. The sun is shining, but it is not a \nhappy time for the family that lived in this home. This could have been \ndone from a hurricane, from wind damage. There may or may not have been \nflooding in this home. I am not sure if this was on the gulf coast, but \nI can promise, hundreds of thousands of homes along the gulf coast \nlooked like this.\n  What our delegation has said with the rising voices of the \nMississippi delegation, as well as the Louisiana delegation, without \naction, homes are going to stay looking like this for months, if not \nyears.\n  I do not know how to express any more clearly that what we have done \nto date is wholly insufficient. FEMA, on its best day, being led by the \nfinest executive you could find in the country, is not designed to meet \nthe challenges of this kind of disaster. Let me repeat, on its best \nday, with the finest executive we could find, it is not designed to \nmeet this disaster. So when people continue to say, and legislators and \nCongressmen, ``Well, we have sent $62 billion to FEMA. We have done \nenough,'' I, please, want to plead with my colleagues and the citizens \nof our Nation, do not confuse sending money to FEMA with giving help to \nhomeowners, businesses, large and small, in Mississippi and Louisiana. \nPlease do not confuse that. They are two separate things. You can send \nmoney to FEMA and then maybe cross your fingers to see if any of that \nmoney gets to solve this problem.\n  This is a picture I have used a lot because it reminds me of my own \ngrandmother who had a camp a lot like this. There is virtually nothing \nleft of the camp we owned. But this is typical of senior citizens \nthroughout the gulf coast. This would be what most of our grandparents \nand parents are going to do this holiday. This picture--it really is \none of the most heart wrenching,\n\n[[Page S13550]]\n\nmoving pictures, and I have seen thousands of them.\n  What does this woman do? FEMA is not enough to help. That is why I \nhave said we are going to slow this process down. I know people are \nanxious to get home for the holidays. I know this is not the only issue \nbefore America. But it goes to the heart of what homeland security is \nabout--or should be about. If you cannot be secure in your own \nhometown, if you cannot be secure in your own home, if you cannot be \nsecure when you are kneeling in your own church or when you are in your \nown business, where can you be secure? I am not suggesting we are \npowerful enough to stop hurricanes, but I am suggesting we should be \nsmart enough and powerful enough to mitigate against their damage, to \nprevent manmade disasters by underinvestment in civil works systems \nthat are important for the growth of the country, and men and women \nenough when the disaster does happen to step up and think outside the \nbox and do something that actually helps people. So I am not anxious to \ngo home because the people I represent do not have any homes to go home \nto.\n  Now, this next picture is not as dramatic a picture, but it will tell \nyou the story. In the South, we have been talking about Hurricane \nAndrew since it hit. I think it was in 1992. Yes, here it is, 1992. \nHurricane Andrew in the South is like a legend. People talk about \nCamille, they talk about Betsy, but then everybody says: Andrew. It hit \nFlorida. It did not hit us, but a lot of our people went over to \nFlorida to help. We remembered Andrew. We saw pictures of Andrew for \nmonths, and we did everything we could to try to help in Florida. And \nit was the worst, costliest storm ever to hit.\n  Can I show you what Katrina is? This is not even counting Rita. For \nKatrina, insured losses are twice--twice--that of Hurricane Andrew. And \nthis is not even showing the costs for Rita. It could be triple the \ncostliest storm in the history of the United States. It is not because \nthe hurricanes were really maybe as bad. And maybe they were equal. But \nthis differential is about a levee break in an urban area, putting \n200,000 homes underwater and uninhabitable, and 18,000 businesses.\n  I believe, if I am not wrong about Hurricane Andrew, we lost 28,000 \nhomes. That is a lot of homes. Think about a town with 30,000 people. \nThat is a pretty big-sized town. Think about every home in the town \nbeing destroyed. That is a very terrible tragedy. We had 205,000 homes \ntotally destroyed, uninhabitable, from Katrina. These are not homes \nwith blue tarps on the roof until the roofer can come in, with people \nin the kitchen; these are homes that you cannot stay in for more than 5 \nminutes or maybe an hour or two to clean up. There is no water. There \nis no electricity. There is mold. There is mildew. People are gutting \ntheir homes, basically sitting on slabs. That is 205,000 homes totally \ndestroyed. Mississippi had 68,000 homes totally destroyed, we had \n205,000 homes totally destroyed, for a total of almost 300,000 homes--\npoof--gone, destroyed. That is not damaged. That is not thousands of \nhomes that have a tree through the roof or the porch fell off or there \nwas water in the kitchen and the appliances do not work but you can \nsleep in the bedroom and just kind of wait for the kitchen to get back. \nThese are 300,000 homes gone.\n  Many of them did not have insurance because they were not required to \nbecause our laws were not written correctly to require them to. They \nwere sitting in high places, in places that had never flooded before. \nAnd they looked up, and because our levee system failed, they have lost \ntheir house, they have lost their business, they have lost their \nfinancial future. Their children are not going to college. Their kids \nare not in the school. They are not worshiping in their church. And we \nare sitting around here passing 100 bills that have nothing to do with \nhelping them.\n  Yes, this chart is what I was looking for. Sometimes I cannot keep \nnumbers in my head and sometimes I can. There were 28,000 homes lost \nfrom Andrew. Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne--we still talk about \nthose hurricanes. They were terrible hurricanes and 27,000 homes \ndestroyed. Look at Katrina--275,000 homes destroyed.\n  Now, this graph is why we are struggling to a point where I just \ncannot quite describe that if we do not get some real help real soon, \nthis region is not going to be able to stand back up. Now, we will \neventually--I will get to that point in a minute--but it is going to be \nvery difficult. We lost 18,752 businesses in Louisiana alone. \nMississippi lost close to 2,000. Let me repeat: 18,000 in Louisiana, \n2,000 in Mississippi.\n  Now, I am not saying this to minimize what happened to the gulf \ncoast. As I have shared with Senators with whom I serve, I grew up on \nthe gulf coast. I love Pass Christian probably as much as they do, but \nthey had 2,000 businesses destroyed. But when levees break in a major \ncity, this is what happens. This is virtually every small business or a \nlarge part of the small businesses in the metropolitan area.\n  Now, we stand up here in this Senate all the time and say: Small \nbusiness is the backbone of our economy. Please, let's help small \nbusiness. Could somebody tell me how FEMA is actually going to stand up \nthese 18,752 businesses that pay taxes, that were patriots, that played \nby the rules, paid their employees? These are not big corporations. We \nonly have one Fortune 500 company. But we have a lot of good people who \nworked hard to build those businesses, and--poof--they are gone. Some \nof them had insurance, but some of them did not.\n  So we put in a bill 7 weeks ago. Olympia Snowe and John Kerry passed \na bill almost unanimously in the Senate. It is sitting somewhere \nbecause we just cannot get out of the box enough to help these people. \nWe have to go through the same old regular process that is not working. \nAnd last time I checked, under the administration's proposal, we had \nprocessed a grand total of six--six--six--GO Loans in Louisiana. I have \n18,000 businesses gone, and we processed 6 GO Loans last week.\n  When I suggest we have been about as patient as we can be, that is \nwhy we may be staying here through Christmas.\n  The system is not working. Business owners are losing everything they \nworked for, not in one lifetime, three lifetimes--grandfather, father, \nson, or grandmother, daughter, granddaughter, 60, 70 years, businesses \ngone. And this Congress can't figure out how to help these businesses. \nBut we are building infrastructure in Iraq. We are building businesses \nin Iraq, but we can't help our own American businesses.\n  Political allies of the White House have said that more has been \naccomplished than any other American disaster including 9/11. The claim \ncannot be justified. That claim is inaccurate. It is not valid. It \ncannot be substantiated. It is not justified under any objective \ncriteria. What might be true is that we have sent more money through \nFEMA to try to help, but it is anemic. It is not functioning well. And \nthe money is not getting to the people who need it.\n  That is why Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd have stepped up with a \nreallocation and said: OK, we hear you Louisiana. We hear you \nMississippi. Let's not add any money, but let's take $30 billion of the \nFEMA money, since it is sitting in a bank account not being used, and \nmove it over, give it to our Governors with community development block \ngrants, full accountability, full flexibility.\n  We will send you some money, $6,000 per child for your education, \nbecause the schools took these children in. They knocked at the door. \nThe schools took our children in, 370,000. They were never asked if \nthey could pay. They have been educating these children for 6 months. \nThe Federal Government has yet to give one of these school systems in \nHouston or Baton Rouge or Lafayette or Jackson, MS, one penny for \ntaking these kids in. I don't know, do we expect schools that are \nhaving trouble anyway to take in children and educate them for free? \nThey have added teachers, classrooms, and the Federal Government sits \nhere giving money out right and left through every door as fast as it \ncan get out, and we can't give money to school systems educating kids \nwhose homes flooded and whose parents have no business anymore.\n  Senator Cochran has put that in his bill, mostly for Louisiana. We \ndon't think that we have to keep saying that if we don't get better \nlevees, not only can we not rebuild our city and region,\n\n[[Page S13551]]\n\nbut it would be morally the worst thing that could be done not to help \npeople feel safe and protected as they make decisions to go back. We \nhave put a substantial amount of money in the budget with Senator \nCochran's proposal for category 3 real levee protection and a \ndownpayment on category 5 which is essential to us as we rebuild. With \nthe community development block grant, the Governors, along with our \nparish presidents and municipal officials, can take that money and \nfashion it to help match private sector donors, to help supplement \ninsurance payments, to help with some strategic housing initiatives and \nbegin getting tools and capital and money out in these communities in \nthe right ways to help stand them up.\n  We have to argue about this, not adding money to the budget, \nreallocating FEMA, and yet we are still arguing with the House on the \ntotal amount. Maybe they don't want to do 17, so we are down to this or \nthat.\n  This week we cannot leave until we pass a Cochran-Byrd reallocation \nof the President's supplemental. With all due respect to the \nadministration, the supplemental that was sent to us was a bill of $17 \nbillion, except for some serious levee money which I thank the \nadministration for. I thank the administration for putting that money--\nI think it was $1.6 billion--in their original request. We appreciate \nit. But the rest of the money in that bill was basically to refurbish \nFederal facilities.\n  I want to show again the picture of the lady. This is what I want to \nrefurbish. I understand we have to refurbish Federal facilities. I know \nthat Federal bureaucracies are important. But this is where we are \ntrying to get the money, to citizens such as this woman who have worked \nhard their whole life, raised their family, never asked anybody for too \nmuch. Now they are sitting in a house with nothing. This is whom we are \ntrying to help. We are trying to get money to the private sector, to \nprivate property owners, not to refurbish Federal Government buildings. \nSo Senator Cochran took that bill and said: If you want to help \nrefurbish Federal buildings, fine, but we need to add money to help \ncitizens, patriots, business owners in our States.\n  I sure hope we can do that because it will be a shame if we do not.\n  I want to add a quote from Governor Haley Barbour. There has been a \nlot of discussion about Mississippi's approach and Louisiana's \napproach. But pain has a way of bringing people together.\n  Governor Barbour said yesterday:\n\n       We are at a point where our recovery and renewal efforts \n     are stalled because of inaction in Washington, D.C., and the \n     delay has created uncertainty that is having a very negative \n     effect on our recovery and our rebuilding.\n\n  If this is coming from Governor Barbour, who is part of the party in \npower and was head of the Republican Party for many years, who lost a \nfraction of the homes that we lost, how do you think the people of \nLouisiana are feeling about the stalled recovery effort and the \ndesperation as they see Congress winding down for the holidays? They \nask: Why aren't people in Washington understanding what we are going \nthrough?\n\n  I want to read for the Record an appropriate and moving quote, right \non target as far as I am concerned, from Vanity Fair in November. It \nsays:\n\n     . . . when the damage is this catastrophic, the people so \n     helpless, the government so weak and clumsy, we expect it to \n     take place somewhere else--on the coast of Sri Lanka or \n     Bangladesh, for instance--somewhere distant and more poor. . \n     . . We do not expect to see our government so impotent and \n     indifferent that it is completely paralyzed . . .\n\n  I know the men and women with whom I work. I don't find them to be \nincompetent or paralyzed. I believe they are sensitive and smart and \nintelligent people. What is it that is keeping us in this Congress from \nunderstanding FEMA isn't working. The Red Cross is not sufficient. \nPeople are suffering. New tools are needed. Let's get about helping \npeople here at home.\n  There has been some unbelievable debate about whether New Orleans \nshould be rebuilt. Our city has been there for 300 years. Thomas \nJefferson leveraged the entire Treasury to buy the city of New Orleans \nbecause of its strategic advantage, which was true then. It is true \nnow. Andrew Jackson took his troops and defeated the British to protect \nit in 1815 because it is the greatest port system in America. It is \nAmerica's only energy coast. You can't have a great nation without \nprotecting your Southern border. You can't have great trade. What \nthought of anyone would be that we can't rebuild New Orleans in the \nregion of south Louisiana after we have given so much to this economy? \nWe are not a charity case. We need help, we need respect, and we need a \npartner.\n  We will rebuild New Orleans and south Louisiana and the gulf coast of \nMississippi. The people have spoken, and the spirit is strong. We may \nnot have houses to live in or businesses to go to, but the people who \nhave lived in this part of the world are strong people. We are Black \nand White, Hispanic, different socioeconomic levels, but we have lived \nthere. The question is, Will we have a partner in the Federal \nGovernment? This week we will see if we have a partner.\n  Let's get on to the business of getting these bills passed. We will \nbe slowing it down until we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, is there a speaker designated to go \nnext?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is previously designated \nto follow the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In light of the fact that the Chair indicated that the \nSenator from Iowa is to be next, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nspeak next, and that I may use as much time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Childhood Obesity\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the last several years, we have \nrepeatedly heard alarming reports about the rising tide of overweight \nand obesity in the United States, particularly among young children. \nOver the past two decades, the rate of obesity has doubled in children \nand tripled in adolescents. Fifteen percent of the children in this \ncountry are now overweight. In fact, the United States has a higher \npercentage of overweight teens than any other industrialized country.\n  This comes at a high price for our country, both in terms of the \nlong-term physical health of our citizens and the enormous health care \ncosts our Nation faces. Just last week, the Institute of Medicine of \nthe National Academy of Sciences released a new report: ``Food \nMarketing to Children and Youth; Threat or Opportunity?''\n  The report focused on one big factor that contributes to the \nchildhood obesity epidemic: the relentless multibillion-dollar \nmarketing of junk food to our children. This landmark report is the \nmost comprehensive and systematic review to date of the impact of food \nmarketing on the diets of American youth. Its conclusions are \ntroubling, but they hardly come as a surprise to parents who know well \nthe effects of food marketing on their children.\n  In a nutshell, the Institute of Medicine concluded that there is \nstrong scientific evidence that food marketing influences food \npreferences, the purchases and diets of children age 12 and below. Even \nmore important, the Institute of Medicine confirms what many had \nsuspected before, that ``television advertising influences children to \nprefer and request high-calorie and low-nutrient food and beverages.''\n  Let me just read two sentences from the executive summary. I am \nquoting directly from the Institute of Medicine's finding:\n\n       It can be concluded that television advertising influences \n     children to prefer and request high-calorie and low-nutrient \n     foods and beverages.\n\n  That is a key finding. Next, on the broad conclusions: Food and \nbeverage marketing practices geared to children and youth are out of \nbalance with healthful diets and contribute to an environment that puts \ntheir health at risk.\n  There you have it. Now, 2 years ago, I requested this study to be \ndone. We put money in the appropriations bill for the CDC to do the \nstudy. They contracted with the National Academy of Sciences and the \nInstitute of Medicine to do the study. This is an unbiased landmark \nstudy. It proves conclusively that our kids are being inundated nonstop \nwith advertising that puts their health at risk.\n\n[[Page S13552]]\n\n  The food industry is a $900 billion-a-year business. It spends \nbillions of dollars promoting food products, much of it targeted at \nkids. The IOM report is important because it outlines in great detail \nhow over the past decade advertising directed at our children has grown \nto a point where they are bombarded nonstop with ads. Indeed, food \nmarketing has expanded in both intensity and variety into nearly all \nareas of kids' lives.\n  The food industry spends more than $11 billion a year targeting kids \nwith marketing campaigns through television, movies, magazines, \nInternet, in-school marketing, kids clubs, toys, coupons, and product \nplacement in movies and books. Marketing to kids has become so \npervasive and sophisticated that over the past several years marketing \nfirms have even begun to employ child psychologists who specialize in \nthis field to help devise their strategies.\n  On the advice of these psychologists, advertisers make use of media \nfantasy figures, celebrities, and cartoon characters. They use messages \ncrafted to imply that products will give kids power, make them popular. \nThe aim is simply to exploit kids' imaginations and their \nvulnerabilities and to sell them products or to get them to nag their \nparents to buy certain products.\n  What kind of foods are they marketing to our kids? We are not talking \nabout apples and pears and peaches and broccoli and carrots. We are \ntalking about high-fat, high-sugar, high-sodium foods with little or no \nnutritional value.\n  The food industry contends it is concerned about the health and \nnutrition of our children, and that it is taking active steps to change \nits marketing practices to introduce new products that are healthier \nfor our children. But is that really the case?\n  In limited instances, the industry has taken some positive steps. For \nexample, in the past year, both Kraft Foods and Pepsico have announced \nthey will take steps to curb the marketing of unhealthy food products \nto children, and instead focus on the promotion of healthier products. \nI have commended publicly, and I do so again today on the floor of the \nSenate--both Kraft and Pepsico for taking a leadership position in this \narea.\n  But here is the problem. This Institute of Medicine report is clear \nthat such responsible actions are far from the industry norm. As you \ncan see from this chart, the number of new products that the food \nindustry has targeted to kids have gone up tenfold over the past 10 \nyears, from around 50 to just under 500 in 2004--500 new products per \nyear--not apples, not salad bars. According to the Institute of \nMedicine, these 500 products are high in calories and sugar and low in \nnutrients. This is what dominated those products.\n  Let's take a look at some of the examples of what is happening to our \nkids. Many advertisements for junk food snacks use characters popular \nwith children. Here is one. They range from Spiderman to Sponge Bob \nSquare Pants. Kids know these characters. They admire these characters. \nQuite frankly, when I saw ``Shrek 1'' and ``Shrek 2,'' I kind of liked \nShrek. He became a loveable, nice guy who wanted to do good. Now what \ndo we see? Here is Shrek advertising Twinkies, green Twinkies with a \ngreen filling.\n\n  Now Shrek has a powerful appeal to kids' minds. Kids see the movie \nShrek and they like Shrek. And Shrek, why, he likes Twinkies, so \nTwinkies must be OK to eat. That is what that message says.\n  What do we know about Twinkies? The nutritional value is zero, \nharmful to kids' health.\n  Shrek now becomes a bad guy trying to get our kids to eat unhealthy \nfood. Shame on the advertisers who take a likable, loveable character \nwhen he was first introduced to kids in the movies and now using Shrek \nto poison our kids. I use the word ``poison'' because that is what this \nfood does, it poisons our kids by making them obese and unhealthy.\n  Then what you can do when you see this ad, you can visit \ntwinkies.com. I will show that a little bit later in my presentation.\n  It is not just limited to television. Food marketing has gone on in \nnumerous ways that we are just beginning to explore. The Institute of \nMedicine report was shocking. One thing--I didn't know this--only 20 \npercent of all food and beverage marketing in 2004 was devoted to the \ntraditional methods of television, radio, and print. Only 20 percent. \nEighty percent is going to new forms of marketing--product promotions, \ncharacter licensing, school marketing.\n  At one time, our schools were considered safe havens for our kids, \nplaces of learning that insulated our kids from crass commercial \ninfluences. No longer is that the case. Our schools have been inundated \nwith commercial messages that are now a major advertising medium that \nthese food companies are using to establish brand loyalty and to get \nkids to eat junk food.\n  Here is a photograph of a hallway in a high school. You have the Coke \nmachine, you have a POWERade machine. You have a vending machine with \npotato chips, Fritos, cookies, candy bars, M's. Nothing in this \nentire display is of any nutritional value. That is what is happening \nin schools.\n  Let's not forget that a lot of these food marketing companies have \nexclusive contracts with schools and school districts to link the sale \nof soda pop to cash payments or equipment assistance to schools. These \nare the very foods that are making our kids obese, contributing to \ntheir unhealthy lifestyles.\n  I often ask parents, What would you think of a parent who sat down \nwith his or her child before they went to school in the morning and \nmeasured out 15 teaspoons of sugar, put it in a little plastic bag and \ntold the kid: Here, you can take this to school and eat it. Or, on \nsecond thought, measure out 30 teaspoons of sugar, give it to the kid \nand say: Here, take this to school and eat it. You would think no \nparent would ever do that. But some children to buy two soda pops every \nday and two of those 20-ounce soda pops will have 15 teaspoons of sugar \neach. One 20-ounce soda pop equals 15 teaspoons of sugar. That is why \nothers call this liquid candy. A 20-ounce Coke, liquid candy, that is \nall it is, 15 teaspoons of sugar.\n  Why do we allow this? Why do we allow this in our schools? It is \nsending a message to our kids that this is OK? It is in school, it is \npromoted by the schools, so it must be OK. That is a new marketing \ntechnique they have.\n  Now we have other techniques such as branded toys and new marketing \ntechniques aimed at babies? Hang on, wait until you see this one: A \nbaby with a 7-Up bottle. Here is a baby being nursed on a bottle that \nhas a 7-Up logo on it. One might say, well, that baby can't buy 7-Up. \nNo, but that baby's eyes are picking up things. When that baby gets \nolder, that is going to be stuck in that baby's mind somewhere in the \ndeep recesses, that was good because what that baby got out of that \nbottle was good healthy milk, formula probably. And now they are going \nto associate that with 7-Up. Imagine that, that early in life.\n  You think that is bad, hang on, you haven't seen anything yet. Look, \nbefore I put this picture up here, let's agree on one thing. We all \nagree--I know the occupant of the Chair and I bet he agrees with this, \nbeing a doctor--that the most beneficial, nutritious food for a newborn \nbaby is a mother's milk, breastfeeding. We all know that breastfeeding \nis the best, and any doctor will tell you if you are capable, you ought \nto breastfeed your child.\n  Now look what we have here: A billboard with a baby breastfeeding on \na McDonald's Burger. That just about borders on the obscene. It can't \nget any worse. I understand this did not run in the United States, but \nit ran on billboards in Europe. Here is a baby, obviously less than a \nyear old supposedly breastfeeding on a McDonald's hamburger bun. Not \nonly does this ad imply that fast food is a developmentally appropriate \nproduct for infants, it suggests that fast food is an appropriate \nreplacement for the nutrition of breastfeeding, which is the perfect \nform of nutrition for babies.\n  Equating a McDonald's hamburger with breastfeeding, while it might be \nintended to be humorous, is no laughing matter. It sends very subtle \nmessages that breastfeeding is nutritious and so are McDonald's \nhamburgers.\n  Now we have other ways of marketing. I tell you, these are \npsychologists who devise these ads. They know what they are doing. How \nabout the candy counting books? Here we have ``Reese's Pieces Count by \n5,'' ``Hershey's Subtraction'' book, the\n\n[[Page S13553]]\n\n``Skittles Riddles Math'' book, the ``Twizzlers Percentage'' book, the \n``Hershey's Fraction'' book, and the ``Hershey's Kisses Addition'' \nbook.\n  Here is where I am going to pay tribute again to Kraft Foods. On this \nfloor periodically in the past I have shown the Oreo counting book. \nKraft Foods discontinued that practice. Kraft Foods does not allow that \nany longer. God bless them; good for Kraft Foods.\n  But here is the problem: You get one company who actually acts \nresponsibly, and look what the rest of them do. They move into the \nmarketplace and take market share away with their counting books.\n  Again, 2-year-olds, 3-year-olds learn with counting books--Hershey's, \nM's, and Reese's Pieces. I don't have it here, but I saw one counting \nbook where you lay it out and you actually put the M pieces on there, \nand when you count one, you get to eat that one piece, and when you \ncount two, you get to take the two pieces of M's off and eat those \ntwo, until you get to 10 M pieces. Junk food, building brand loyalty \nearly.\n  Then we have toys. How about the toys? It is an emerging trend that \nputs the food on the toy so you don't just get it for 30 seconds, you \nget it all the time you play with your toys.\n  Here we have a Coca Cola princess, whatever, a cheerleader. We have a \nJell-O Barbie. We have a McDonald's Barbie.\n  So little kids play with these and they build that brand loyalty. \nThey play with a Barbie wearing a McDonald's logo or a Jell-O or a \nLittle Debbie brand. That is what we have come to, where kids are \ninundated day after day not with just 30-second ads but with everything \nthey play with, everything they see. Now they go to school, and they \nsee the same thing in school. This is a recent innovation. It was not \nlike this 20 years ago.\n  Now we have the Internet, which is becoming a growing segment of the \nfood marketing industry. Remember, I said earlier that Shrek urges \nchildren to visit twinkies.com, well, here you go. If one goes to \ntwinkies.com, they go to Planet Twinkie. At Planet Twinkie, there are \nall of these little interactive things, visit the Twinkie shop, the \nHostess Hall of Fame, the chocolate and cupcakes and snowballs. That is \nPlanet Twinkie.\n  So a kid sees Shrek, Shrek says: Visit my Web site, visit \ntwinkie.com.\n  Well, again, what are they saying to kids? They are saying: Eat junk \nfood. It is fun and it is an adventure just to eat junk food and eat \nTwinkies and to eat candy and stuff, and it is good for you. And guess \nwhat, it will make you smart because we do it in school; you go there \nto school to learn, so since we do it all in school it makes you smart, \ntoo.\n  So when one looks at all of these marketing techniques together, \ntelevision, schools, product tie-ins, promotions, the Internet, branded \nbaby products, what we are seeing is that the food marketers seek to do \nnothing less than envelop our children every day during all of their \nwaking hours in a commercial environment that encourages them to eat \nunhealthy food.\n  For years the food marketers have been saying: One cannot really \nprove that food marketing influences children's diets. Not anymore. \nWith this study, food marketers can no longer say that food marketing \ndoes not influence children's diets. The evidence is quite clear that \nmarketing has a negative influence on children's food preferences and \non their diets.\n  Some might say: Well, that is obvious. The food industry does not \nspend $11 billion a year on marketing to kids because it does not work, \nbecause they want to throw that money away. They spend it because it \nworks brilliantly, inducing children to purchase it themselves or to \nbeg, whine, and cajole their parents into buying it for them.\n  Some might say: What about the parents' responsibility? Parents \nshould be responsible, but parents' control is being eroded. Food \nmarketers are inserting themselves between parents and their kids. \nTheir control is being eroded in the face of a highly sophisticated \nbillion-dollar industry. This is not a level playing field.\n  Again, what can we do? Someone who has been listening to me might \nsay: Well, OK, Harkin, what can you do? That is the way business works. \nWhat can we do about it?\n  There is plenty we can do about it. The IOM report makes \nrecommendations on what we ought to do. First, they say the industry \nneeds to exhibit a greater level of corporate responsibility. Amen. \nSome of them have. But here is the problem: If it is not industrywide, \none food company may do something good such as Kraft did, got rid of \nthe Oreo cookie counting book. So what happens, their competitor moves \nin with other counting books. So it has to be industrywide.\n  IOM calls for sweeping change in the way the food industry, the \nbeverage industry, the fast food restaurant industry, the media, and \nthe entertainment industries do business. They call on all of those \nindustries to use the same creativity, resources and marketing \npractices that they currently use to sell junk food to instead promote \nhealthier diets for kids. They call on the food companies to change the \nproducts they advertise as well as the products they produce. They say \nthat business as usual has to change and has to change now.\n  I hope corporate America is listening because if they do not change, \nthen we in Congress will make them change. Almost 25 years ago, the \nFederal Trade Commission warned Congress about the dangers of \nadvertising aimed at children. What did Congress do? We attacked the \nFTC and took away its regulatory authority as it pertains to children's \nads.\n  In 1978, the FTC undertook an investigation and found that TV \nadvertising directed at young children was both unfair and deceptive. \nThey found that the advertising of high sugar foods to children is \nunfair and deceptive. They suggested that restrictions on ads directed \nat the young and vulnerable minds might be appropriate. But the \nbroadcast industry went nuts. The food industries went nuts. The \nadvertisers went nuts, and they got Congress to kill the messenger.\n  In 1981, this Congress stripped the Federal Trade Commission of its \nregulatory authority as it pertained to children's advertising. It \nexpressly prohibited the Federal Trade Commission from following \nthrough on its proposals to ban or restrict advertising directed at \nchildren. This new law made it next to impossible to regulate \nadvertising directed at kids. It is a little known fact that right now \nthe FTC has more authority to regulate advertising at me and you and \nadults than it does to our kids, and here is how it does that.\n  There are two ways the Federal Trade Commission can regulate \nadvertising: If it is unfair or deceptive.\n  In 1981, this Congress cut off one arm of the FTC in regulating \nadvertising to kids. The FTC can only regulate advertising to kids if \nit is deceptive, not if it is unfair. Interesting point. One might say: \nWell, an advertisement of junk food is not deceptive, but is it unfair? \nIt is, according to the Institute of Medicine because the Institute of \nMedicine said that kids lack the cognitive ability to discern between \nadvertising, persuasive intent advertising and a program.\n  It stands to reason, if one is a young kid, they do not understand \nwhat advertising is all about. They get inundated with all of this, and \nit makes an impression on them, sticks with them, but they do not \nunderstand this is advertising. That is what the Institute of Medicine \nsays. This is a medical report.\n  So I submit that any advertising that advertises high-calorie, high-\nin-fat junk food to kids that has no nutritional value, that is \ninherently unfair because kids do not understand the intent. Forget \nabout deceptive. It is unfair. It may not be unfair to adults, since we \nunderstand what advertising is about--we should have that ability--but \nit is to kids. That is why we need to give the Federal Trade Commission \nthe authority to regulate advertising to children both on unfairness \nand deceptiveness, as it does to adults. I want to point out, in \nclosing, that I have introduced legislation to give FTC that authority.\n  In addition, the IOM talks about Government responsibility. It says \nthat:\n\n       Government at all levels should marshal the full range of \n     public policy approaches (e.g., subsidies, legislation, \n     regulation, federal nutrition programs), to foster the \n     development and promotion of healthful diets for children and \n     youth.\n\n  It says, ``Government and industry should work together to set higher \nstandards for marketing to children.''\n\n[[Page S13554]]\n\nThey called for changes in the school environment, to get rid of the \njunk food and the vending machines.\n  When we come back next session, Senator Specter and I will introduce \nthe Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act. This \nlegislation will, per the recommendation of the IOM, require the \nDepartment of Agriculture to update its nutritional guidelines for \nschool food sales and ensure that the foods available to kids during \nthe school day promote, rather than undermine, their health and \nlearning.\n  We in this Congress have a responsibility to protect America's \nchildren from the sophisticated, aggressive, relentless marketing of \njunk food to our children. We have a responsibility to stick up for our \nparents. Our parents don't have a chance when our kids are inundated, \nday after day, hour after hour, even in places where parents don't have \ncontrol--in our schools, when they watch a movie, when they pick up a \nbook, a counting book.\n  I was in a school not too long ago, looking at some renovations in a \nschool, an elementary school. Do you know what the kids had to sit on? \nCoca-Cola chairs; little chairs with the Coca-Cola legend, red and \nwhite, with Coca-Cola written on it. I assume that they donated the \nchairs to the school. But this is the idea, to get it into the kid's \nhead early, that education and having a high sugar soft drink go hand \nin hand.\n  Late in her life, Jackie Kennedy said a very wise thing. She said, \n``If you botch raising your children, nothing else you do in your life \nmatters very much.''\n  With what we now know, thanks to the IOM report, what we know about \nthe destructive impacts of junk food marketing to the kids, with the \nnew insights thanks to the Institute of Medicine, it is clear by \nallowing the food industry to market junk foods to our kids we are \nbotching the raising of all of our children.\n  Again, this is enough. This report makes it clear that it is time to \nsay to those who are enveloping our kids in this sort of 24-hour-a-day, \n7-day-a-week nonstop advertising, that it is enough. Foods that are \nhigh in fat, sugar, and salt have their place. We all like to have a \ncookie. I enjoy a piece of candy as much as anybody else. They have \ntheir place. But they ought to be kept in their place--not in schools, \nnot in advertising. They ought to be kept in their place and the place \nto start is with sensible, long overdue regulation of the advertising \nand marketing of junk food to children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. On behalf of Senator Dodd, I wish to inform our \ncolleagues that for health reasons Senator Dodd will necessarily be \nabsent from Senate business for the remainder of the week. He thanks \nhis colleagues for their courtesy and understanding.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleagues who came to the floor \nyesterday to discuss the PATRIOT reauthorization, and I thank Chairman \nSpecter for initiating a very interesting debate with me when we were \nboth on the floor. That is exactly the kind of dialog we want to see on \nthe floor more often. I hope we will see a lot more of it over the next \nfew days. The PATRIOT Act reauthorization conference report has come to \nthe Senate and the Senate will be faced with a very important choice. I \nexpect this debate will be lengthy and hard fought, so I wanted to take \nsome time tonight to lay out the background and the context for this \ndebate, and to discuss my concerns about the conference report with \nsome specificity.\n  Because I was the only Senator to vote against the PATRIOT Act in \n2001, I want to be very clear about something from the start. I am \nnot--not--opposed to reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. I supported \nthe bipartisan compromise reauthorization bill that the Senate passed \nearlier this year, that had no Senator at all objecting. I believe the \nbill should become law. The Senate reauthorization bill is not a \nperfect bill, but it is a good bill. If that were the bill we were \nconsidering today, I would be on the floor speaking in support of it. \nIn fact, we could have reauthorized the PATRIOT Act several months ago \nif the House had taken up the bill the Senate approved without any \nobjections.\n  I also want to respond to those who argue that people who are \ndemanding a better conference report want to let the PATRIOT Act \nexpire. That is actually nonsense. Not a single Member of this body is \ncalling for any provision of the PATRIOT Act to completely expire. As \nSenator Sununu eloquently argued yesterday, just because we are coming \nup against the end of the year does not mean we should have to \ncompromise the rights of law-abiding Americans. There are any number of \nways we can get this done and get it done right before the end of the \nyear.\n  Let me also be clear about how we ended up voting on a badly flawed \nconference report just days before certain provisions of the PATRIOT \nAct expired. The only reason we are debating this conference report in \nthe middle of December, rather than in the middle of September or \nOctober, is because the House--the House--refused to appoint its \nconferees for 3\\1/2\\ months. It passed its reauthorization bill on July \n21, but it did not appoint the conferees until November 9. In the \nSenate, on the other hand, we passed a bill by unanimous consent on \nJuly 29 and we appointed our conferees the very same day. We were ready \nand willing to start the process of resolving our differences with the \nHouse right away, leaving plenty of time to get this done without the \npressure of the end-of-the-year deadline.\n  So when I hear Members of the House already attempting to place blame \non those of us in the Senate who object to this conference report, I am \na little bit frustrated. If there is anyone to blame, it is the House \nleadership for playing a game of brinkmanship with this crucial and \ncontroversial issue. Senators who are standing strong for the rights \nand freedoms of the American people will not be at fault if parts of \nthe PATRIOT Act expire.\n  I also want to clear up one related misconception. I have never \nadvocated repeal of any portion of the PATRIOT Act. In fact, as I have \nsaid repeatedly over the past 4 years, I supported most of the \nprovisions of the bill. There are many good provisions in the bill. As \nmy colleagues know, the PATRIOT Act did a lot more than expand our \nsurveillance laws. Among other things, it set up a national network to \nprevent and detect electronic crimes such as the sabotage of the \nNation's financial sector, it established a counterterrorism fund to \nhelp Justice Department offices disabled in terrorist attacks to keep \noperating, and it changed the money laundering laws to make them more \nuseful in disrupting the financing of terrorist organizations. One \nsection of the PATRIOT Act even condemned discrimination against Arab \nand Muslim Americans.\n  Even some of the act's surveillance sections were not troubling. In \nfact, one provision authorized the FBI to expedite the hiring of \ntranslators. Another added terrorism and computer crimes to the list of \ncrimes for which criminal wiretap orders could be sought. And some \nprovisions helped to bring down what has been termed ``the wall,'' the \nwall that had been built between intelligence and law enforcement \nagencies.\n  This week we have heard a lot of people saying we must reauthorize \nthe PATRIOT Act in order to ensure that this wall does not go back up. \nLet us make this clear. I supported and continue to support the \ninformation-sharing provisions of the PATRIOT Act. One of the key \nlessons we learned in the wake of September 11 was that our \nintelligence and law enforcement agencies were not sharing information \nwith each other, even where the statutes permitted it. In the PATRIOT \nAct we tore down the remaining legal barriers.\n  Unfortunately, the law was not so much a legal problem as a problem \nof culture and the report of the 9/11 Commission made that very clear. \nI am sorry to report that we have not made as much progress as we \nshould have in bringing down those very significant cultural barriers \nto information sharing among our agencies.\n  The 9/11 Commission report card that was issued last week gave the \nGovernment a ``D'' for information sharing because their agencies' \ncultures have not changed enough these 4 years after the change in the \nlaw in the PATRIOT Act.\n  There is a statement issued by Chairman Kean and Vice Chairman \nHamilton that explained:\n\n\n[[Page S13555]]\n\n\n       You can change the law, you can change the technology, but \n     you still need to change the culture. You still need to \n     motivate institutions and individuals to share information.\n\n  So far, unfortunately, our Government has not met the challenge.\n  Talking about the importance of information sharing, as \nadministration officials and other supporters of the conference report \nhave done repeatedly, is part of a pattern that started several years \nago. Rather than engage in a true debate on the controversial parts of \nthe PATRIOT Act, as Senator Specter did yesterday, unfortunately many \nproponents of the PATRIOT Act point to noncontroversial provisions of \nthe PATRIOT Act and they talk about how important they are. They say \nthis bill must be passed because it reauthorizes those noncontroversial \nprovisions.\n\n  That doesn't advance the debate. It just muddies it further. In fact, \nit is a red herring.\n  I have news for those who would try to use that tactic. It won't \nwork. We don't have to accept bad provisions to make sure that good \nprovisions become law. I hope the Senate will make that lesson very \nclear this week.\n  Tonight, I want to advance the debate, spend some time explaining my \nspecific concerns about the conference report in some key areas. It is \nvery unfortunate that the whole Congress could not come together, as \nthe Senate did around the bipartisan compromise reauthorization bill. \nBack in July, the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, voted \nunanimously in favor of a reauthorization bill that made meaningful \nchanges to the most controversial provisions of the PATRIOT Act to \nprotect the rights and freedoms of innocent Americans. Shortly \nthereafter that bill passed the full Senate by unanimous consent. It \nwas not easy for me to support that Senate bill which fell short of the \nimprovements contained in the bipartisan SAFE Act.\n  At the end of the day, the Senate bill contained meaningful changes \nto some of the most problematic provisions of the PATRIOT Act, \nprovisions that I have been trying to fix since October of 2001. So I \ndecided to support it. I made it very clear at the time, however, that \nI viewed that bill as the end point of negotiations, not the beginning. \nIn fact, I specifically warned my colleagues that the conference \nprocess must not be allowed to dilute the safeguards in this bill. I \nmeant it. But it appears that people either weren't listening or \nweren't taking me seriously.\n  This conference report, unfortunately, does not contain many \nimportant reforms of the PATRIOT Act that we passed in the Senate. So I \ncannot support it. In fact, I will fight it with every ounce of \nstrength I have. And I am delighted to be part of a strong bipartisan \nconsensus that believes, as I do, that this conference report is \nunacceptable.\n  Let me start with section 215, the so-called ``library'' provision, \nwhich has received so much public attention.\n  I remember when the former Attorney General of the United States \ncalled the librarians who were expressing disagreement with this \nprovision ``hysterical.''\n  What a revelation it was when the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Senator from Pennsylvania, opened his questioning of the \ncurrent Attorney General during his confirmation hearing by expressing \nhis concern--the chairman's concern--about this provision of the \nPATRIOT Act. He got the Attorney General to concede that, yes, in fact, \nthis provision probably went a bit too far and could be improved and \nclarified. That was an extraordinary moment. It was a moment, I am \nafraid, that was very slow in coming and long overdue.\n  I give credit to the Senator from Pennsylvania because it allowed us \nto start having, for the first time, a real debate on the PATRIOT Act. \nBut credit also has to go to the American people who stood up despite \nthe dismissive and derisive comments of Government officials and said \nwith loud voices: The PATRIOT Act needs to be changed. And these voices \ncame from the left and the right, from big cities and small towns all \nacross the country. So far, over 400 State and local governmental \nbodies have passed resolutions calling for revisions to the PATRIOT \nAct. I plan to read some of those revisions on the floor of the Senate \nin this debate, and there are a lot of them. Nearly everyone mentions \nsection 215.\n  Section 215 is at the center of this debate over the PATRIOT Act.\n  It is also one of the provisions that I tried unsuccessfully to amend \non the floor in October 2001.\n  So it makes sense to start my discussion of the specific problems I \nhad with the conference report with the infamous library provision.\n  Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act allowed the Government to obtain \nsecret court orders in domestic intelligence investigations, to get all \nkinds of business records about people, including not just library \nrecords but also medical records and various other types of business \nrecords. The PATRIOT Act allowed the Government to obtain these records \nas long as they were ``sought for''--that is all, ``sought for''--in a \nterrorism investigation. That is a very low standard. It doesn't \nrequire that the records concern someone who is suspected of being a \nterrorist or a spy, or even suspected of being connected to a terrorist \nor a spy. It didn't require any demonstration of how the records would \nbe useful in the investigation.\n  Under section 215, the Government simply said--this is fact--all the \nGovernment has to do is say the magic words, that it wanted records for \na terrorism investigation, then the secret FISA court was required--\nrequired--to issue the order, period. No discretion. The judge had to \ngive the order.\n  To make matters worse, recipients of these orders are subjected to an \nautomatic gag order. They cannot tell anyone that they have been asked \nfor the records.\n  Some in the administration and even in this body took the position \nthat people shouldn't be able to criticize these provisions until they \ncan come up with a specific example of abuse.\n  The Attorney General makes that same argument today in an op-ed in \nthe Washington Post when he simply dismisses concern about the PATRIOT \nAct by saying: ``There have been no verified civil liberties abuses in \nthe 40 years of the Act's existence.''\n  That has always struck me as a strange argument since 215 orders are \nissued by a secret court, a secret court. And people who receive them \nare prohibited by law from discussing them.\n  In other words, the way the law is actually designed, it is almost \nimpossible to know if any abuses have occurred. How would we find out? \nIt is a secret court and nobody can talk about it.\n  The Government should not have the kind of broad, intrusive powers it \ngave itself in section 215. And the American people shouldn't have to \nlive with a poorly drafted provision that clearly allows for records of \ninnocent Americans to be searched and just hope that the Government \nuses it with restraint.\n\n  A government of laws doesn't require its citizens to rely on the \ngoodwill and the good faith of those who have those powers, especially \nwhen adequate safeguards can be written into the laws without \ncompromising their usefulness as a law enforcement tool.\n  After lengthy and difficult negotiations, the Judiciary Committee \ncame up with language this year that achieved that goal. It would \nrequire the Government to convince a judge that a person has some \nconnection--some connection--to terrorism or espionage before obtaining \ntheir sensitive records. When I say some connection, that is what I \nmean.\n  The Senate bill standard is the following: One, that the records \npertain to a terrorist or a spy; two, the records pertain to an \nindividual in contact with or known to a suspected terrorist or spy; \nor, three, that the records are relevant to the activities of a \nsuspected terrorist or spy.\n  That is a three-pronged test in the Senate bill. I think it is quite \nbroad. I think it is more than adequate to give law enforcement the \npower it needs to conduct investigations but also at the same time \nprotecting the rights of innocent Americans.\n  It would not limit the types of records that the Government could \nobtain, and it does not go as far to protect law-abiding Americans as I \nmight prefer, but it would make sure the Government cannot go on a \nfishing expedition into the records of innocent people.\n  The Senate bill would also give recipients of a 215 order an \nexplicit, meaningful right to challenge business record orders and the \naccompanying gag orders in court. These provisions\n\n[[Page S13556]]\n\npassed the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously after tough \nnegotiations late into the night. Unfortunately, the conference report \njust did away with their delicate compromise.\n  First and most importantly, it does not contain the critical \nmodification to the standard for section 215 orders.\n  The Senate bill permits the Government to obtain business records \nonly if it can satisfy one or more prongs of the three-pronged test \nthat I just described.\n  This is a broad standard with a lot of flexibility. But it retains \nthe core protection that the Government cannot go after someone who has \nno connection whatsoever to a terrorist or a spy or their activities.\n  What does the conference report do? The conference replaces the \nthree-pronged test with a simple relevant standard. It then provides \nthe presumption of relevance if the Government meets one of the three \nprongs I just described.\n  But it is silly to argue that this is adequate protection against a \nfishing expedition. The only actual requirement in the conference \nreport is that the Government show that the records are relevant to an \nauthorized intelligence investigation. Of course, ``relevance'' is a \nvery broad standard that can arguably justify the collection of all \nkinds of information about law-abiding Americans.\n  The three prongs now are just examples of how the Government can \nsatisfy the relevance standard, and that is simply a loophole, or an \nexception that swallows the rule. The exception is the rule.\n  In fact, a better way to say it is that this is actually a complete \nrule, and the exception has been rendered meaningless.\n  I will try to make this as straightforward as I can. The Senate bill \nrequires the Government to satisfy one of three tests. Each test \nrequires some connection between the records and a suspected terrorist \nor spy. The conference report says that the Government only is required \nto satisfy a new fourth test, which is just relevance, which does not \nrequire a connection between the records and a suspect. So basically \nthe other three tests no longer provide any protection at all.\n  The conference report also does not authorize judicial review of the \ngag order that comes with a 215 order. While some have argued that the \nreview by the FISA court of a Government application for a section 215 \norder is equivalent to judicial review of the accompanying gag order, \nthat is simply inaccurate. The statute does not give the FISA court any \nlatitude to make an individualized decision about whether to impose a \ngag order when it issues a section 215 order. It is required by statute \nto include a gag order in every section 215 order. That means that the \ngag order is automatic and permanent in every case. This is a serious \ndeficiency, one that very likely violates the first amendment.\n  In litigation challenges, a semi-permanent national security letter \nstatute, two courts have found first amendment violations because there \nis no individualized evaluation of the need for secrecy. I have these \ndecisions right here; perhaps I will have a chance to read them in \ndetail during the debate.\n  I will discuss other provisions in the conference report that fail to \nadequately address the concerns expressed in this Senate and around the \ncountry about the PATRIOT Act. Section 215 is a linchpin of this \ndebate. To keep faith with the American people and with our \nconstitutional heritage, we have to address the problems with section \n215 in this reauthorization bill. There is no way around that.\n  Let me turn next to a very closely related provision that has finally \nbeen getting the attention it deserves--the national security letter, \nor NSL, an authority that was expanded by sections 358 and 505 of the \nPATRIOT Act. This NSL issue has flown under the radar for years even \nthough many of us have been trying to bring more public attention to \nit. I am gratified that we are finally talking about these NSLs, in \nlarge part due to a lengthy Washington Post story published last month \nexplaining just what these authorities are and reporting that the use \nof these powers has increased dramatically.\n  What are NSLs? Why are they such a concern? Let me spend a little \ntime on this because it is important. National security letters are \nissued by the FBI to businesses to obtain certain types of records. \nThey are similar to section 215 orders but with one very critical \ndifference: The Government does not need to get any court approval \nwhatever to issue that. It does not have to go to the FISA court and \nmake even the most minimal showing. It simply issues the order signed \nby the special agent in charge of a field office or some other \nsupervisory official. NSLs can only be used to obtain such categories \nof business records, while section 215 can be used to obtain ``any \ntangible thing.''\n  Even the categories reachable by NSLs are broad. Specifically, they \ncan be used to obtain three types of business records: subscriber and \ntransactional information related to Internet and phone usage, credit \nreports, and financial records. That category has been expanded to \ninclude records from all kinds of everyday businesses such as jewelers, \ncar dealers, travel agents, and even casinos.\n  Just as with section 215, the PATRIOT Act expanded the NSL's \nauthorities to allow the Government to obtain records of people not \nsuspected of being or even connected to terrorists or spies. The \nGovernment need only certify that the documents are either sought for \nor relevant to an authorized intelligence investigation--a far-reaching \nstandard that could be used to obtain all kinds of records about \ninnocent Americans. Just as with section 215, the recipient is subject \nto an automatic permanent gag rule, and the conference report does very \nlittle to fix the problems of the national security letter authorities.\n  In fact, I disagree with the Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman \nof this committee, on this point. In fact, I believe it could be argued \nthat the conference report makes the law worse. Let me explain why.\n  First, the conference report does nothing to fix the standard for \nissuing a national security letter. It leaves in place the \nbreathtakingly broad relevant standard.\n  Some have analogized NSLs to grand jury subpoenas issued by grand \njuries in criminal investigations to obtain records relevant to the \ncrime they are investigating. So the argument goes, What is the big \ndeal if NSLs are also issued under a relevant standard for intelligence \ninvestigations? Two critical differences make that analogy break down \nvery quickly.\n  First of all, the key question is, Relevant to what? In criminal \ncases, grand juries are investigating specific crimes, the scope of \nwhich is explicitly defined in the Criminal Code. Although the grand \njury is quite powerful, the scope of its investigation is limited by \nthe particular crime it is investigating. In sharp contrast, \nintelligence investigations are by definition extremely broad. When you \nare gathering information in an intelligence investigation, anything \ncould potentially be relevant.\n  Suppose the Government believes a suspected terrorist visited Los \nAngeles in the last year or so. It might want to obtain and keep the \nrecords of everyone who has stayed in every hotel in Los Angeles or who \nbooked a trip to Los Angeles through a travel agent over the past \ncouple years, and it could argue strongly that information is relevant \nto a terrorism investigation because it would be useful to run all \nthose names through the terrorist watch list.\n  I don't have any reason to believe that such broad use of NSLs has \nhappened. But the point is, when you are talking about an intelligence \ninvestigation, relevance is a very different concept than in criminal \ninvestigations. It is certainly conceivable that NSLs could be used for \nthat kind of a broad dragnet in an intelligence investigation. Nothing \nin the current law prevents it. The nature of criminal investigations \nand intelligence investigations is different. Let's not forgot that.\n\n  Second, the recipients of grand jury subpoenas are not subject to the \nautomatic secrecy that NSL recipients are. We should not underestimate \nthe power of allowing public disclosure when the Government \noverreaches. In 2004, Federal officials withdrew a grand jury subpoena \nissued to Drake University for a list of participants in an antiwar \nprotest. Why? Because there were public revelations about the demand. \nThat could not have happened if the request had been made under section \n215 or for records available via the national security letter \nauthority.\n\n[[Page S13557]]\n\n  Fortunately, there are many other reasons the conference report does \nso little good on NSLs. Let's talk about judicial review. The \nconference report creates the illusion of judicial review for NSLs, \nboth for the letters themselves and for the accompanying gag rule, and \nif you look at the details, it is drafted in a way that makes the \nreview virtually meaningless.\n  With regard to the NSLs themselves, the conference report permits \nrecipients to consult their lawyer and seek judicial review, but it \nallows the Government to keep all of its submissions secret and not \nshare them with the challenger regardless of whether there are national \nsecurity interests at stake. So you can challenge the order, but you \nhave no way of knowing what the Government is telling the court in \nresponse to your challenge. Parties could argue about something as \ngarden-variety as attorney-client privilege with no national security \nissues, and the Government would have the ability to keep this secret. \nThis is a serious departure from our usual adversarial process. I \nbelieve it is very disturbing.\n  The other significant problem with the judicial review provisions is \nthe standard for getting the gag rule overturned. In order to prevail, \nthe recipient has to prove that any certification by the Government \nthat disclosure would harm national security or impair diplomatic \nrelations was made in bad faith. Now, that is a standard of review that \nis virtually impossible to meet. So what we have here is the illusion--\nthe illusion--of judicial review. When you look behind the words in the \nstatute, you realize it is a mirage.\n\n  I also want to take a moment to address again an argument made \nyesterday by the Senator from Pennsylvania about the NSL provisions of \nthe conference report. He argued that many of the complaints I have \nabout the NSL provisions of the conference report apply equally to the \nNSL provisions of the Senate bill. And then he says because I supported \nthe Senate bill, by some convoluted theory, my complaints are, \ntherefore, invalid and I should support the conference report.\n  As I said yesterday, that does not make any sense.\n  The NSL section of the Senate bill was one of the worst sections of \nthe bill. I did not like it then, and I do not like it now. But in the \ncontext of the larger package of reforms that was in the Senate bill, \nincluding the important changes to section 215 that I talked about \nearlier, and the new time limit on sneak-and-peek search warrants, \nwhich I will talk about in a moment, I was able to accept that the NSL \nsection was there even though I would have preferred additional \nreforms.\n  The argument was made yesterday that after supporting a compromise \npackage for its good parts, now I am supposed to accept a conference \nreport that has the bad parts of the package even though the good parts \nhave been taken out. Now, that is nonsense. Every Member of this \nChamber who has ever agreed to a compromise--and I must assume that \nincludes every one of us--knows it.\n  The other point I want to emphasize is that the Senate bill was \npassed before the Post reported that there has been extensive use of \nNSLs and the difficulties that the gag rule poses for businesses that \nfeel they are being unfairly burdened by them, as reported by the \nWashington Post. At the very least, I would think that an NSL sunset is \njustified. But the conferees refused to make that change. Nor would \nthey budge at all on the absurdly difficult standard of review, the so-\ncalled conclusive presumption.\n  I suspect that the NSL power is something the administration is \nzealously guarding because it is one area where there is almost no \njudicial involvement or oversight. It is the last refuge for those who \nwant virtually unlimited Government power in intelligence \ninvestigations. And that is why the Congress should be very concerned \nand very insistent on making the reasonable changes we have suggested.\n  We had an interesting discussion on the floor yesterday also about \nthe sneak-and-peek searches. This is another area where the conference \nreport departs from the Senate's compromise language, and it is another \nreason I must oppose the conference report.\n  Yesterday, the Senator from Pennsylvania made what seems on the \nsurface to be an appealing argument. He says the Senate bill requires \nnotice of a sneak-and-peek search within 7 days of the search, and the \nHouse said 180 days.\n  The conference compromised on 30 days. ``That's a good result,'' he \nsays. ``They came down 150 days, we went up only 23. What's wrong with \nthat?''\n  Well, let me take a little time to put this issue in context and \nexplain why this is not just a numbers game. An important \nconstitutional right is at stake. One of the most fundamental \nprotections in the Bill of Rights is the fourth amendment's guarantee \nthat all citizens have the right to ``be secure in their persons, \nhouses, papers, and effects'' against ``unreasonable searches and \nseizures.'' The idea that the Government cannot enter our homes \nimproperly is actually a bedrock principle for Americans, and rightly \nso.\n  The fourth amendment has a rich history and includes in its ambit \nsome very important requirements for searches. One is the requirement \nthat a search be conducted pursuant to a warrant. The Constitution \nspecifically requires that a warrant for a search be issued only when \nthere is probable cause and that the warrant specifically describe the \nplace to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.\n  Why does the Constitution require that particular description? For \none thing, that description becomes a limit on what can be searched or \nwhat can be seized. If the magistrate approves a warrant to search \nsomeone's home, and the police show up at the person's business, that \nsearch is not valid. If the warrant authorizes a search at a particular \naddress, and the police take it next door, they have no right to enter \nthat house.\n  But, of course, there is no opportunity to point out that the warrant \nis inadequate unless that warrant is handed to someone on the premises. \nAnd if there is no one present to receive the warrant, and the search \nmust be carried out immediately, most warrants require that they be \nleft behind at the premises that were searched. Notice of the search--\nnotice of the search--is part of the standard fourth amendment \nprotection. Without the notice, it does not mean much. It is what gives \nmeaning, or maybe we should say ``teeth,'' to the Constitution's \nrequirement of a warrant and a particular description of the place to \nbe searched and the persons or items to be seized.\n  Over the years, the courts have had to deal with Government claims \nthat the circumstances of a particular investigation require a search \nwithout notifying the target prior to carrying out the search. In some \ncases, giving notice would compromise the success of the search by \nleading to the flight of the suspect or the destruction of evidence. \nThe two leading cases on so-called surreptitious entry, which would \ncome to be known as sneak-and-peek cases, came to very similar \nconclusions.\n  Notice of criminal search warrants could be delayed--delayed--but not \nomitted entirely. Both the Second Circuit in U.S. v. Villegas and the \nNinth Circuit in U.S. v. Freitas held that a sneak-and-peek warrant \nmust provide that notice of the search will be given within 7 days--7 \ndays--unless extended by the court. Listen to what the Freitas court \nsaid about such searches:\n\n       We take this position because surreptitious searches and \n     seizures of intangibles strike at the very heart of the \n     interests protected by the Fourth Amendment. The mere thought \n     of strangers walking through and visually examining the \n     center of our privacy interest, our home, arouses our passion \n     for freedom as does nothing else. That passion, the true \n     source of the Fourth Amendment, demands that surreptitious \n     entries be closely circumscribed.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from that case.\n  So when defenders of the PATRIOT Act say that sneak-and-peek searches \nwere commonly approved by the courts prior to the PATRIOT Act, they are \npartially correct. Some courts permitted secret searches in very \nlimited circumstances, but they also recognized the need for prompt \nnotice unless a reason to continue to delay was demonstrated. And they \nspecifically said that notice had to occur within 7 days--7 days.\n  Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act did not get this part of the balance \nright. It allowed notice to be delayed for any reasonable length of \ntime. Information\n\n[[Page S13558]]\n\nprovided by the administration about the use of this provision \nindicates that delays of months at a time are now becoming commonplace. \nNow, those are hardly the kinds of delays that the courts had been \nallowing prior to the PATRIOT Act.\n  The sneak-and-peek power in the PATRIOT Act caused concern right from \nthe start, and not just because of the lack of a time-limited notice \nrequirement. The PATRIOT Act also broadened the justifications that the \nGovernment could give in order to obtain a sneak-and-peek warrant. It \nincluded what came to be known as the catch-all provision, which allows \nthe Government to avoid giving notice of a search if it would \n``seriously jeopardize an investigation.'' Some think that that \njustification in some ways swallows the requirement of notice since \nmost investigators would prefer not to give notice of a search and can \neasily argue that giving notice will hurt the investigation.\n  The SAFE Act, the bipartisan bill that many of us worked on, worked \nto fix both of these problems. First, it tightened the standard for \njustifying a sneak-and-peek search to a limited set of circumstances--\nwhen advanced notice would endanger life or property, or result in \nflight from prosecution, the intimidation of witnesses, or the \ndestruction of evidence. Second, it required notice within 7 days, with \nan unlimited number of 21-day extensions if approved by the court.\n  The Senate bill was a compromise from this. It kept the catch-all \nprovision as a justification for obtaining a sneak-and-peek warrant. \nThose of us who were concerned about that provision agreed to accept it \nin return for keeping, and actually getting back, in my view, from the \ncourt cases, the 7-day notice requirement. And we accepted unlimited \nextensions of up to 90 days at a time. The key thing was prompt notice \nafter the fact, or a court order that continuing to delay notice was \njustified.\n  That is actually the background of the numbers game that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and other supporters of the conference report point \nto. They want credit for walking the House back from its outrageous \nposition of 180 days, but they refuse to recognize that the sneak-and-\npeek provision still has the catch-all justification, and unlimited 90-\nday extensions. And here is the crucial question they refuse to answer: \nWhat possible rationale is there for not requiring the Government to go \nback to a court after 7 days and demonstrate a need for continued \nsecrecy? Why insist that the Government get 30 days free without \ngetting an extension? Could it be that they think the courts usually \nwon't agree that continued secrecy is needed after the search is \nconducted, so they would not get the 90-day extension? If they have to \ngo back to a court at some point, why not go back after 7 days rather \nthan 30? From the point of view of the Government, I don't see the big \ndeal. But from the point of view of someone whose house has been \nsecretly searched, there is a big difference between notice after 1 \nweek and notice after a month.\n\n  Suppose, for example, that the Government actually searched the wrong \nhouse, as I mentioned. That is one of the reasons that notice is a \nfourth amendment requirement. The innocent owner of the place that had \nbeen searched might suspect that somebody had broken in. They might be \nliving in fear that someone has a key or some other way to enter. \nShould we make that person wait a month to get an explanation rather \nthan a week? Presumably, if the search revealed nothing, and especially \nif the Government realized the mistake and does not intend to apply for \nan extension, it surely will be no hardship, other than perhaps \nembarrassment, for notice to be given within 7 days.\n  All of this is about why I am not persuaded by the numbers game on \nthe sneak-and-peak provisions. The Senate bill was already a compromise \non this very controversial provision. There is no good reason not to \nadopt the Senate's provision. No one has come forward and explained why \nthe Government can't come back to the court within 7 days of executing \nthe search. In fact, on a discussion of this last night on one of the \ntelevision programs, one of my colleagues literally said, 7 days versus \n30 days, what is the big deal? That is the strength of the argument. \nThere is no merit to the idea of making the notice be as potentially \nlate as 30 days.\n  Let me put it this way: If the House had passed a provision that \nallowed notice to be delayed for 1,000 days, would anyone be boasting \nabout a compromise that requires notice within 100 days, more than 3 \nmonths? Would that be a persuasive argument? I don't think so. The \nHouse provision of 180 days was arguably worse than current law, which \nrequired notice ``within a reasonable time,'' because it created a \npresumption that delaying notice for 180 days, 6 months, is reasonable. \nIt was a bargaining ploy. The Senate version was what the courts had \nrequired prior to the PATRIOT Act. It was itself a compromise because \nit leaves in place the catchall provision for justifying a warrant in \nthe first place. That is why I believe the conference report on the \nsneak-and-peak provision is inadequate and must be opposed.\n  Let me make one final point about sneak-and-peak warrants. Don't be \nfooled for a minute into believing that this power is needed to \ninvestigate terrorism or espionage. It is not. Section 213 is a \ncriminal provision that could apply in whatever kind of criminal \ninvestigation the Government has undertaken. In fact, most sneak-and-\npeak warrants are issued for drug investigations. So why do I say they \nare not needed in terrorism investigations? Because FISA also can apply \nto those investigations and FISA search warrants are always executed in \nsecret and never require notice. If you really don't want to give \nnotice of a search in a terrorism investigation, you can get a FISA \nwarrant. So any argument that limiting the sneak-and-peak power, as we \nhave proposed, will interfere with sensitive terrorism investigations \nis also a red herring.\n  I have spoken at length about the provisions of this conference \nreport that trouble me. But to be fair, I should mention one \nsignificant improvement to the conference report over last month's \ndraft. This new version does include a 4-year sunset on three of the \nmost controversial provisions: Roving wiretaps, the so-called library \nprovision which I discussed at some length, and the ``lone wolf'' \nprovision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Previously, the \nsunsets on these provisions were at 7 years. It certainly is an \nimprovement to have reduced that number so the Congress can take \nanother look at these provisions or can take a look at these provisions \nsooner.\n  I also acknowledge that the conference report creates new reporting \nrequirements for some PATRIOT Act powers, including new reporting on \nroving wiretaps, section 215 sneak-and-peak search warrants, and \nnational security letters. There are also new requirements that the \nInspector General of the Department of Justice conduct audits of the \nGovernment's use of national security letters and section 215.\n  In addition, the conference report includes other useful oversight \nprovisions relating to FISA. It requires that Congress be informed \nabout FISA court rules and procedures and about the use of emergency \nauthorities under FISA. And it gives the Senate Judiciary Committee \naccess to certain FISA reporting that currently only goes to the \nIntelligence Committee. I am glad to see that it requires the \nDepartment of Justice to report to us on its data-mining activities.\n  But adding sunsets and new reporting and oversight requirements only \ngets us so far. The conference report remains deeply flawed. I \nappreciate sunsets and reporting. I know that the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania worked hard to ensure that they were included. But these \nimprovements are not enough. Sunsetting bad law for another 4 years is \nnot good enough. Simply requiring reporting on the Government's use of \nthese overly expansive tools does not ensure that they won't be abused. \nWe must make substantive changes to the law, not just improve \noversight. This is our chance. We cannot let it pass by.\n  Last Thursday, after the conference deal was announced, the Attorney \nGeneral termed it a ``win for the American people in that it would \nresult in continued security for the United States and also continued \nprotection of civil liberties for all Americans.'' In a way,\n\n[[Page S13559]]\n\nthat comment shows that we have made some progress. The administration \nseems to understand now that protecting civil liberties is pretty \nimportant to our citizens. That is quite an improvement from the days \nwhen people who expressed these concerns were termed hysterical. But \nthe Attorney General also said: ``people have seen how the Department \nof Justice has been very responsible in exercising [its] authorities.'' \nThis comment reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the \nrelationship of the Government and the governed in our democracy. Trust \nof Government cannot be demanded or asserted or assumed. It must be \nearned. This Government has not earned our trust. It has fought \nreasonable safeguards for constitutional freedoms every step of the \nway. It has resisted congressional oversight and often misled the \npublic about its use of the PATRIOT Act. And now the Attorney General \nis arguing that the conference report is adequate protection for civil \nliberties for all Americans? It isn't.\n\n  We sunsetted 16 provisions of the original PATRIOT Act precisely so \nwe could revisit them and make necessary changes, to make improvements \nbased on the experience of 4 years with the act, and with the careful \ndeliberation and debate that, quite frankly, was missing 4 years ago. \nThis process of reauthorization has certainly generated debate. But if \nwe pass this conference report as currently written, we will have \nwasted a lot of time, and we will have missed an opportunity to finally \nget it right. The American people will not be happy with us for missing \nthat chance. They will not accept our explanation that we decided to \nwait another 4 years before addressing their concerns. They will not \nsettle for half a loaf because we ran out of time to reach consensus.\n  I submit that an acceptable consensus was reached unanimously by this \nSenate, every one of us, back in July. We should insist that the House \npass that bill and give the American people a reauthorization bill that \nis worthy of their support and their confidence. I am prepared to keep \nfighting for as long as it takes to make that happen.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts \nabout the PATRIOT Act and its importance to the security of this \ncountry, its reasonableness, the careful way in which it has been \ncrafted and adopted, the full debate to which it has been subjected, \nand I urge our colleagues not to allow this bill to expire, not to \nallow the wall to return so that our foreign intelligence agencies \ncannot share with our domestic intelligence agencies information that \nmay be directly relevant to an attack on the people of the United \nStates. That is exactly what was taking place on 9/11. It is precisely \nwhy we have had a failure to share important information. And many \npeople believe that the PATRIOT Act possibly could have prevented the \n9/11 attacks. It is easy to contemplate situations where other \ninformation not shared could have resulted in the lives of Americans \nbeing placed at risk or being lost. That is why we passed this bill.\n  We have had a full debate about it. This past reauthorization came \nout of the Senate Judiciary Committee 18 to 0. Senator Feingold \nsupported it. It came out of the Senate floor by unanimous consent. It \nwent to a conference committee with the House. They had some different \nprovisions in their version, as they always do, and the conference \ncommittee hammered out the differences. As Senator Specter, a civil \nlibertarian himself, and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who was \ninvolved in that process said, about 80 percent of what was disputed \nwas decided in favor of the Senate bill. Now we are faced with a \nfilibuster, an effort to block an up-or-down vote on the PATRIOT Act. \nIt is really an extraordinary thing. In fact, some of the provisions \nput in by the conference committee strengthened the bill, from a civil \nliberties point of view, more than the Senate bill that left this body.\n  I want to just say, first of all, that the provisions in the PATRIOT \nAct are in no way extreme, in no way novel, in no way contradictory to \nthe principles of the constitutional law this country has operated \nunder since its founding. I mean that very sincerely. I would say that \neverything here, in any fundamental way that results in a method by \nwhich law enforcement can investigate terrorist activity--those \nprocedures, those techniques, those abilities are clarified in this \nbill. These are standards that they must comply with, and that have \nbeen approved by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I remember at one of the hearings I asked witnesses this question: Do \nyou think any of the provisions in this act are going to be found to be \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court as required to protect our \nliberties and enforce the constitutional protections that we as \nAmericans have been given? Every one of them said no. They said that \nbecause there is nothing in here that is going to be found \nunconstitutional. All of these principles and techniques that are \nprovided with clarity, and standards in this act are consistent with \nwhat we have already approved in America. But we find that many of the \ninvestigatory techniques available to an IRS agent who is investigating \nsomebody for a nonviolent crime involving taxes, or a drug enforcement \nagent that may be investigating someone for cocaine or marijuana, and \nmany of those procedures that have been approved under the Constitution \nby the Supreme Court, are not available to investigators investigating \nterrorists who would kill us.\n  Everybody knows that it is a different matter when dealing with \ninternational entities, people who operate outside the laws of our \ncountry, who represent foreign powers, who represent international \nterrorist groups or other groups that are hostile to the interests of \nthe United States. We have always understood that there are spies and \nwe need a counterspy system in our country which will protect our \nNation from those who would destroy it. We have always had principles \nthat deal with that. For example, there have been complaints about the \nnational security letters and section 215. Many of these complaints and \nthose who oppose these provisions worry and suggest that something in \nthe PATRIOT Act is novel, unusual, or unprecedented. But it is not so. \nI think we have had people who are utterly misinformed or sometimes \nmaybe even deliberately failing to accurately articulate what is \nimportant and what is correct.\n  The national security letters that have been referred to by some of \nthose who oppose this legislation were not created by the PATRIOT Act \nof 2001. This tactic, this procedure has been available since the \n1980's. All the original PATRIOT Act did was add credit reports to the \nlist of things you could get with a national security letter during the \ncourse of an investigation involving terrorism. Sometimes you might \nneed a credit report to determine something about an individual, like \nwhere he is moving his money, and that kind of thing. That is all that \nwas really added with regard to national security letters. Use of \nnational security letters is limited to six very specific items: \ntelephone toll records, bank records, credit reports, and things of \nthat nature. These are all things that a drug enforcement agent can get \nwith an administrative subpoena this very day to investigate someone \nfor a drug crime.\n  Yet we don't have similar provisions for the FBI agent who is \ninvestigating a terrorist? What kind of idiotic principle of \ninvestigation is that? So the bill allows us to do that with national \nsecurity letters. It has been the law for some time--over 20 years. So \nwe added to the original PATRIOT Act the ability to use a national \nsecurity letter to get credit reporting records of suspected \nterrorists--a big change that won't be used much. The conference report \nmore than adequately addresses concerns about the national security \nletters by setting an extremely high requirement for nondisclosure.\n  Under the report, in order for the recipient to be precluded from \ntelling others that they received a national security letter, a high \nGovernment official must certify that doing so would\n\n[[Page S13560]]\n\n``endanger the national security of the United States or interfere with \ndiplomatic relations.'' That is an extremely high standard. In fact, I \nthink it is too high. I think that in a terrorist or national security \ncase, the disclosure is not such an important principle that needs this \ntype of protection.\n  In my view, the standard of certification is high because we may not \nalways be able to make such certification. An investigator may not be \nable to certify to every one of those things and therefore may be \ndenied the right to obtain a record and not have the business notify \nthe person about it.\n  By the way, I will repeat, we are talking about obtaining by national \nsecurity letter from a third party, records that belong to the third \nparty, not to the defendant or terrorist. You are not going into their \nhouse or their automobile or their desk in order to obtain their \npersonal records. These are records being held at a bank, records to \nwhich everybody in the bank has access. These records are being held at \na telephone company, and show the telephone toll records that you get \non your monthly statements.\n  They are not in your control. They are in the telephone company's \ncontrol. What used to happen was people would subpoena the toll records \nand ask the telephone company not to tell the customer, if it was a \nsensitive investigation. That has been done by every district attorney \nin America. They issue thousands of these subpoenas. Tens of thousands, \nI suggest, literally every month are issued for bank records, toll \nrecords every day. You have some expectation of privacy, but you don't \nhave an expectation that those records will be secretly maintained by \nthe bank or the telephone company when they are requested by a law \nenforcement officer for a law enforcement purpose, and relevant to an \nongoing criminal investigation. That is the law, and it has been that \nway forever.\n  So now, when asking for these records during the course of an \ninvestigation into terrorism, we have to certify that if the recipient \ndiscloses to the terrorist that we are investigating their records, it \nwould endanger the national security of the United States or interfere \nwith diplomatic relations. Those are extremely high standards.\n  I know my colleague--and I respect him--Senator Feingold voted for \nthe less restrictive certification requirements that unanimously passed \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. He was one of the 18 who voted for it. \nI don't understand an objection now to the conference report that has a \nhigher certification standard. The conference report makes clear that a \nrecipient of an NSL, such as a bank, can consult with their attorney \nabout the NSL without worrying that the consultation would be an \nunlawful disclosure. The conference report makes clear that the bank \ncan also file a motion to quash the NSL if it does not want to give the \ngovernment the information requested, and it makes it clear that the \nbank could ask the court to quash the nondisclosure requirement and \nallow them to share that information with the customer. So really, the \nprovisions in this conference report only improve the situation from \nthe perspective of civil libertarians, if we reject the conference \nreport these extra protections will not become law.\n  Let's be frank about this. I am telling you how it works in the real \nworld. I have been there. The banks simply want to be protected. If it \nis lawful for them to turn over the documents they have on a customer \nto a law enforcement agency without notifying their customers, they are \nperfectly willing to do so. But if they are told that in the law, their \nlawyers are now telling them to protect themselves by notifying \ncustomers that they gave their records, and they routinely do so to \nprotect themselves today. They didn't used to do that 25 years ago, but \nit is because of the threat of being sued that they do that routinely \nnow.\n  So it is critical that they not disclose because when you are looking \nat a terrorist organization, a cell that may be plotting to bomb \nsomeone but you are not sure who is in it and what it is about, and you \nare trying to find out about it, maybe you want their bank records, \nmaybe you want motel records, maybe you want telephone toll records. \nThey can provide incredibly valuable information to an investigator. \nThis can prove whether the person being investigated is connected to \nterrorists. If you get their toll records and there are 25 phone calls \nto Yemen to somebody who has been identified by foreign intelligence as \nbeing connected to al-Qaida, then you have something. So that is very \nimportant. You may not be prepared at that moment to arrest the person. \nThere may not be enough evidence to arrest them, but now you have a \nseries of phone calls from a person who is a suspect in some city or \nState in this country calling a known terrorist in some other part of \nthe world. You want to proceed with this investigation, but you don't \nwant them to know you are on to them.\n  That is so basic. Talk to investigators. This is what it is all \nabout. It is not academic. This is life and death. We can't ask too \nmuch of our investigators. We can not tie their hands by demanding they \nprove these things beyond a reasonable doubt, and certify all these \nfacts that they are looking for as true before they do an \ninvestigation.\n  How do you get the facts? How do you get them? You have to gather the \nfacts. But if we are not able to gather the facts in a terrorism \nprosecution with reasonable investigative tools, then how can we ever \ninvestigate a case and make a good case?\n  I feel strongly that this is an incredibly important provision and, \nin fact, is more civil liberties protective now as it has come out of \nconference than it was when it went to conference.\n  With regard to several other matters, I find the debate to be out of \nsync with reality.\n  Let's talk about the delayed notice search warrants, the so-called \nsneak and peek. This provisions is dealing with an everyday, regular \nsearch warrant. These are the type of warrants you need a court to \napprove if you are going to search someone's private house or office. \nThis is not the same as going to the bank and getting a record on third \nparties. This is a search warrant to get somebody's own property. You \ncan't take that property without a search warrant approved by a judge, \nand if it is a Federal case, such as a terrorist case, it will be a \nFederal judge. To get that warrant, you must prove to that Federal \njudge through an affidavit by real witnesses that there is probable \ncause to believe that person possesses evidence relevant to an \nimportant criminal investigation.\n  Senator Feingold is correct, when you get a warrant approved on \nprobable cause and then conduct the search, you should do it and give \nthe return on the warrant to the individual whose property has been \nsearched. If for some reason they are not there, you usually tack it on \nthe door so they will know you have come, and that is the traditional \nway search warrants are done.\n  In the course of these kinds of investigations, I have had the \npersonal experience on rare occasion to seek delayed notification, and \nI have heard of it on other occasions, I have read about situations \nwhere delayed notice is needed. Courts have approved through the common \nlaw process search warrants which they approve delaying notification to \nthe person being searched. There can be many reasons, as one can \nimagine, why this delayed notice could be good. It had been done for a \nlong time, long before the PATRIOT Act was passed. The U.S. Supreme \nCourt has approved the procedure for delaying notice of a search.\n  All the delayed notification language does in the PATRIOT Act is set \nforth standards about how delayed notice procedure should be done.\n  The Senate bill, when it came out of our committee and voted on the \nfloor, said you have to either to notify the defendant in 7 days that \nyou did the search or come back to the judge within 7 days and ask the \njudge for more time before you notify them and set forth a reason for \nneeding more time.\n  The House passed bill said you could delay notification for up to 180 \ndays before you had to go back to the judge and ask for more time as a \nreason to delay the notification. Maybe you have gone in there and \nfound they are putting material together to make a bomb, or you may \nfind information that bad guys are coming into town and you need to \nwait on them, those kinds of things might justify further delaying \nnotification. There may be a very delicate investigation of the most \ncritical national importance. That is\n\n[[Page S13561]]\n\nwhy delayed notice has been around for decades and that is why the \nPATRIOT Act sought to provide a national standard for delayed notice.\n  So, the House was at 180 days, and the Senate was at 7 days, and we \nhad a conference. We reached an agreement on 30 days. Well, you would \nthink this is the end of the world if you believed some of my \ncolleagues. If you are going to have delayed notification, how long \nshould it be? Seven days is not a disaster for an investigator, \nalthough it is pretty tight deadline that could cause a good bit of \nproblem. Thirty is much healthier, in my view. But whether it is 20 \ndays, 40 days, whatever, this search has to be approved by a judge \nbefore it can be conducted. And if the defendant is not notified \nimmediately, then they have to go back and establish to the court \nthrough evidence and proof that the delay should continue beyond the \ntime period set.\n  It is not a big deal. To suggest that 7 days or 30 days is a \ndifference that invokes some sort of huge constitutional principle that \nwe should block this bill over and not even give it an up-or-down vote \nbecause of is beyond my comprehension. It is not a critical difference \nto our liberties whether it is 7 or 30 days. Some might have a \ndifferent opinion. We had to reach a compromise. We rejected the 180 \ndays. We took the 30 days, which is a lot closer to 7 than 180. In my \nview, the Senate already won on this issue.\n  There are a lot of other issues of the same import. I believe we have \ngone beyond the pale in criticizing this bill. It has been in effect \nfor 4 years. None of it has been found to be unconstitutional. It is \nnow going to be extended. It is already being curtailed by this \nconference report in a number of different ways to make the act even \nmore friendly to civil liberties than it was when we first passed it. \nNothing in the first bill, frankly, represented any reduction in any of \nour liberties, the claim that it did is simply untrue. This conference \nreport has the full support of Chairman Specter and former Chairman \nHatch. Senator Leahy voted for the reauthorization bill before. He \nvoted for it in committee and then did not object to it moving by \nunanimous consent off the floor this year in the Senate.\n  So now we have some that are making objections to some of the modest \nchanges that were made in conference. I, frankly, think these changes \nwere very minor. Our colleagues should not do that. To jeopardize the \ncontinuation of the tremendously valuable principles of the PATRIOT Act \nby filibustering this bill--and it will extinguish, critical parts of \nit will end soon if we do not break this filibuster and pass the \nreauthorization this week--is unthinkable to me. So I encourage my \ncolleagues, please do not get upset about the conference report by \nbelieving the misinformation that is out there, please read and think \ncarefully about what is in this bill. If they do so, they will find \nthat all the provisions in it are consistent with sound constitutional \nlaw. All of these actions and provisions will be affirmed by the \nSupreme Court, many of them already have been, and it will be a \ntremendous advantage to our investigators who are working their hearts \nout this very day, this night, some places in this country today, \ninvestigating those who would do us harm.\n  I will probably share some more thoughts on some of the other \nprovisions tomorrow but at this time would yield the floor and in a \nmoment would, on behalf of the majority leader, do a wrap-up before we \nconclude. So therefore I will not put us in a quorum call at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13561-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13561-S13562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REPORTING ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. FORCES\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

This supplemental report covers operations in \n     support of the war on terror, Kosovo, and Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n\n\n                           THE WAR ON TERROR\n\n       Since September 24, 2001, I have reported, consistent with \n     Public Law 107-40 and the War Powers Resolution, on the \n     combat operations in Afghanistan against al-Qaida terrorists \n     and their Taliban supporters, which began on October 7, 2001, \n     and the deployment of various combat-equipped and combat-\n     support forces to a number of locations in the Central, \n     Pacific, and Southern Command areas of operation in support \n     of those operations and of other operations in our war on \n     terror.\n       I will direct additional measures as necessary in the \n     exercise of the right of the United States to self-defense \n     and to protect U.S. citizens and interests. Such measures may \n     include short-notice deployments of special operations and \n     other forces for sensitive operations in various locations \n     throughout the world. It is not possible to know at this time \n     either the precise scope or duration of the deployment of \n     U.S. Armed Forces necessary to counter the terrorist threat \n     to the United States.\n       United States Armed Forces, with the assistance of numerous \n     coalition partners, continue to conduct the U.S. campaign to \n     pursue al-Qaida terrorists and to eliminate support to al-\n     Qaida. These operations have been successful in seriously \n     degrading al-Qaida's training capabilities. United States \n     Armed Forces, with the assistance of numerous coalition \n     partners, ended the Taliban regime and are actively pursuing \n     and engaging remnant al-Qaida and Taliban fighters in \n     Afghanistan. Approximately 280 U.S. personnel are also \n     assigned to the International Security Assistance Force \n     (ISAF) in Afghanistan. The U.N. Security Council authorized \n     the ISAF in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1386 of December \n     20, 2001, and has reaffirmed its authorization since that \n     time, most recently, for a l2-month period from October 13, \n     2005, in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1623 of September \n     13, 2005. The mission of the ISAF under NATO command is to \n     assist the Government of Afghanistan in creating a safe and \n     secure environment that allows reconstruction and the \n     reestablishment of Afghan authorities. Currently, all 26 NATO \n     nations contribute to the ISAF. Ten non-NATO contributing \n     countries also participate by providing military and other \n     support personnel to the ISAF.\n       The United States continues to detain several hundred al-\n     Qaida and Taliban fighters who are believed to pose a \n     continuing threat to the United States and its interests. The \n     combat-equipped and combat-support forces deployed to Naval \n     Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in the U.S. Southern Command area \n     of operations since January 2002 continue to conduct secure \n     detention operations for the approximately 500 enemy \n     combatants at Guantanamo Bay.\n       The U.N. Security Council authorized a Multinational Force \n     (MNF) in Iraq under unified command in U.N. Security Council \n     Resolution 1511 of October 16, 2003, and reaffirmed its \n     authorization in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546 of \n     June 8, 2004. In U.N. Security Council Resolution 1637 of \n     November 8, 2005, the Security Council, noting the Iraqi \n     Government's request to retain the presence of the MNF, \n     extended the MNF mandate for a period ending on December 31, \n     2006. Under Resolutions 1546 and 1637, the mission of the MNF \n     is to contribute to security and stability in Iraq, as \n     reconstruction continues, until the completion of Iraq's \n     political transformation. These contributions have included \n     assisting in building the capability of the Iraqi security \n     forces and institutions, as the Iraqi people, represented by \n     the Transitional National Assembly, drafted and approved a \n     constitution and progressed toward the establishment of a \n     constitutionally elected government. The U.S. contribution to \n     the MNF is approximately 160,000 military personnel.\n       In furtherance of our efforts against terrorists who pose a \n     continuing and imminent threat to the United States, our \n     friends and allies, and our forces abroad, the United States \n     continues to work with friends and allies in areas around the \n     globe. United States combat-equipped and combat-support \n     forces are located in the Horn of Africa region, and the U.S. \n     forces headquarters element in Djibouti provides command and \n     control support as necessary for military operations against \n     al-Qaida and other international terrorists in the Horn of \n     Africa region, including Yemen. These forces also assist in \n     enhancing counterterrorism capabilities in\n\n[[Page S13562]]\n\n     Kenya, Ethiopia, Yemen, and Djibouti. In addition, the United \n     States continues to conduct maritime interception operations \n     on the high seas in the areas of responsibility of all of the \n     geographic combatant commanders. These maritime operations \n     have the responsibility to stop the movement, arming, or \n     financing of international terrorists.\n\n\n                      NATO-LED KOSOVO FORCE (KFOR)\n\n       As noted in previous reports regarding U.S. contributions \n     in support of peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, the U.N. \n     Security Council authorized Member States to establish KFOR \n     in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999. \n     The mission of KFOR is to provide an international security \n     presence in order to deter renewed hostilities; verify and, \n     if necessary, enforce the terms of the Military Technical \n     Agreement between NATO and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     (which is now Serbia and Montenegro); enforce the terms of \n     the Undertaking on Demilitarization and Transformation of the \n     former Kosovo Liberation Army; provide day-to-day operational \n     direction to the Kosovo Protection Corps; and maintain a safe \n     and secure environment to facilitate the work of the U.N. \n     Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).\n       Currently, there are 25 NATO nations contributing to KFOR. \n     Eleven non-NATO contributing countries also participate by \n     providing military personnel and other support personnel to \n     KFOR. The U.S. contribution to KFOR in Kosovo is about 1,700 \n     U.S. military personnel, or approximately 10 percent of \n     KFOR's total strength of approximately 17,000 personnel. \n     Additionally, U.S. military personnel occasionally operate \n     from Macedonia, Albania, and Greece in support of KFOR \n     operations.\n       The U.S. forces have been assigned to a sector principally \n     centered around Gnjilane in the eastern region of Kosovo. For \n     U.S. KFOR forces, as for KFOR generally, maintaining a safe \n     and secure environment remains the primary military task. The \n     KFOR operates under NATO command and control and rules of \n     engagement. The KFOR coordinates with and supports the UNMIK \n     at most levels; provides a security presence in towns, \n     villages, and the countryside; and organizes checkpoints and \n     patrols in key areas to provide security, protect minorities, \n     resolve disputes, and help instill in the community a feeling \n     of confidence.\n       In accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, \n     UNMIK continues to transfer additional competencies to the \n     Kosovar provisional Institutions of Self-Government, which \n     includes the President, Prime Minister, multiple ministries, \n     and the Kosovo Assembly. The UNMIK retains ultimate authority \n     in some sensitive areas such as police, justice, and ethnic \n     minority affairs.\n       NATO continues formally to review KFOR's mission at 6-month \n     intervals. These reviews provide a basis for assessing \n     current force levels, future requirements, force structure, \n     force reductions, and the eventual withdrawal of KFOR. NATO \n     has adopted the Joint Operations Area plan to regionalize and \n     rationalize its force structure in the Balkans. The UNMIK \n     international police and the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) have \n     full responsibility for public safety and policing throughout \n     Kosovo except in the area of South Mitrovica, where KFOR and \n     UNMIK share this responsibility due to security concerns. The \n     UNMIK international police and KPS also have begun to assume \n     responsibility for guarding patrimonial sites and established \n     border-crossing checkpoints. The KFOR augments security in \n     particularly sensitive areas or in response to particular \n     threats as needed.\n\n\n              NATO HEADQUARTERS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\n       Pursuant to the June 2004 decision made by NATO Heads of \n     State and Government, and in accordance with U.N. Security \n     Council Resolution 1575 of November 22, 2004, NATO concluded \n     its Stabilization Force operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and \n     established NATO Headquarters-Sarajevo to continue to assist \n     in implementing the Peace Agreement in conjunction with a \n     newly established European Force. The NATO Headquarters-\n     Sarajevo, to which approximately 220 U.S. personnel are \n     assigned, is, with the European Force, the legal successor to \n     SFOR. The principal tasks of NATO Headquarters-Sarajevo are \n     providing advice on defense reform and performing operational \n     supporting tasks, such as counterterrorism and supporting the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\n       I have directed the participation of U.S. Armed Forces in \n     all of these operations pursuant to my constitutional \n     authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander \n     in Chief and Chief Executive. Officials of my Administration \n     and I communicate regularly with the leadership and other \n     Members of Congress with regard to these deployments, and we \n     will continue to do so.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of \nPreston Robert ``Bob'' Tisch, who died this past November after a \nbattle with cancer.\n  Bob left a permanent impression on many lives, including my own. He \nwas a pillar in his community, well-liked and respected, considerate, \nwise, and passionate about life and serving others. He will be missed.\n  Bob was born in New York City and proudly lived there for most of his \nlife. He was chairman of the board of Loews Corporation, a company he \ncofounded along with his late brother, Lawrence. Bob was also chairman \nand cochief executive officer of the New York Football Giants.\n  Bob was a proud New Yorker and greatly assisted in enhancing New \nYork's position as an international business center. He held a number \nof civic posts, including chairman of the New York City Convention and \nVisitors Bureau, founding chairman of the New York City Convention and \nExhibition Center Corporation, chairman of the New York City \nPartnership and the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n  Bob believed that along with success comes great responsibility and \nexemplified this by giving back to his country and community. He served \nas chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Democratic National \nConventions held in New York City in 1976 and 1980. From 1986 to 1988, \nhe served as U.S. Postmaster General. In May 1990, Mayor David Dinkins \nappointed him New York City's Ambassador to Washington, DC.\n  He also served chairman of New York City Public Private Initiatives, \na public-private partnership that funds vital community programs, and \nwas a founding director of New York City Meals-on-Wheels. A graduate of \nNew York City public schools, Bob founded Take the Field, a nonprofit \norganization dedicated to renovating the athletic fields of New York \nCity's public high schools.\n  With Bob's passing, we have lost an extraordinary philanthropist, \nbusinessman, and a great American. I express my heartfelt sympathies to \nJoan, his wife of 57 years, his sons Steven and Jonathon, daughter \nLaurie, and the entire Tisch family. May they be comforted by all that \nBob did to enrich the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13562-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13562-S13563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PELL GRANT PROGRAM INTEGRITY ADJUSTMENTS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, for several years the Pell Grant Program \nhas been accumulating a shortfall. This shortfall has recently been \nestimated at $4.3 billion. For a program that costs around $13 billion \nto run each year, this is a significant problem that puts the entire \nprogram in jeopardy. The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \nyear 2006 addressed this issue by including a new scorekeeping rule to \nensure that the program is fully funded each year and by providing a \nreserve fund to retire the $4.3 billion shortfall that has already \naccrued.\n  Section 303 of H. Con. Res. 95, the concurrent resolution on the \nbudget for fiscal year 2006, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to make adjustments to the 302(a) allocations when certain \nconditions are met relating to retiring the Pell grant shortfall. These \nconditions having been met in the Labor-HHS appropriations conference \nreport, I am making the reserve fund adjustment. The following table \nreflects revised 302(a) allocations. The revised allocations for budget \nauthority and outlays are the appropriate levels to be used for \nenforcement of the congressional budget.\n  Additionally, the Senate-passed Labor-HHS appropriations conference \nreport included additional funds for three program integrity \ninitiatives as specified in the 2006 congressional budget resolution, \nand accordingly on July 28, 2005, I submitted changes to the \nAppropriations Committee's discretionary 302(a) allocation, increasing \nboth budget authority and outlays by $309 million. However, the Labor-\nHHS-Education conference report does not include these additional funds \nfor the program integrity initiatives. Therefore, the discretionary \n302(a) allocation will be reduced by $309 million in budget authority \nand outlays.\n  Pursuant to sections 303 and 404, I hereby ask unanimous consent to \nhave the following revisions to H. Con. Res. 95 printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13563]]\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nCurrent Allocation to Senate Appropriations Committee:\n  FY 2006 Budget Authority--General Purpose Discretionary......$843,020\n  FY 2006 Outlays--General Purpose Discretionary................916,836\n  FY 2006 Budget Authority--Mandatory...........................531,782\n  FY 2006 Outlays--Mandatory....................................512,469\n  FY 2006 Budget Authority--Total.............................1,374,802\n  FY 2006 Outlays--Total......................................1,429,305\nAdjustments:\n  FY 2006 Budget Authority--General Purpose Discretionary..........-309\n  FY 2006 Outlays--General Purpose Discretionary...................-309\n  FY 2006 Budget Authority--Mandatory.............................4,300\n  FY 2006 Outlays--Mandatory........................................  0\n  FY 2006 Budget Authority--Total.................................3,991\n  FY 2006 Outlays--Total...........................................-309\nRevised Allocation to Senate Appropriations Committee:\n  FY 2006 Budget Authority--General Purpose Discretionary.......842,711\n  FY 2006 Outlays--General Purpose Discretionary................916,527\n  FY 2006 Budget Authority--Mandatory...........................536,082\n  FY 2006 Outlays--Mandatory....................................512,469\n  FY 2006 Budget Authority--Total.............................1,378,793\n1,428,996utlays--Total............................................\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13563-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PASSAGE OF U.S.-BAHRAIN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the past several years the Congress \nhas worked hand-in-hand with the administration to foster greater peace \nand stability in the Middle East through trade. We have concluded and \nimplemented free trade agreements with Israel, Jordan, and Morocco. We \nrecently concluded negotiations with Oman and negotiations are ongoing \nwith United Arab Emirates. Perhaps soon, we will launch negotiations \nwith our good friend and ally, Egypt.\n  Yesterday, with the passage of S. 2027, the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade \nAgreement Implementation Act, we took another historic step forward. \nOnce this agreement enters into force, 98 percent of our agricultural \nexports to Bahrain will enter duty-free and 100 percent of our two-way \ntrade in industrial and consumer products will be duty-free. The \nagreement sets a new standard on services, with broad commitments by \nBahrain to open their service sector to our exports.\n  Passage of the U.S.-Bahrain FTA will help advance the President's \ngoal of achieving a Middle East Free Trade Area, MEFTA, by 2013. This \nvisionary agenda is a key element in our efforts to help foster \neconomic growth and prosperity in an important region of the world. It \nalso reflects keen appreciation by the Bush administration of the 9/11 \nCommission Report recommendation that ``a comprehensive U.S. strategy \nto counter terrorism should include economic policies to encourage \ndevelopment, more open societies, and opportunities for people to \nimprove the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their \nchildren's future.''\n  I am pleased that we are able to take another step toward fulfilling \nthis recommendation with passage of the Bahrain agreement. This would \nnot have been possible without the hard work and dedication of many \npeople. I first want to recognize Ambassador Robert Zoellick. As the \nformer U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Zoellick spearheaded our \ntrade agenda, including initiation of negotiations with Bahrain. This \nyear, Ambassador Portman took up the reigns as our U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. Ambassador Portman has proven to be an able and \neffective negotiator who faithfully works with Congress to achieve the \nbest result for America in our trade agreements. Ambassador Portman was \nassisted by Catherine Novelli, before her departure, as well as her \nreplacement, Ambassador Shaun Donnelly, both serving in their capacity \nas Assistant U.S. Trade Representatives for Europe and the \nMediterranean.\n  With the passage of this agreement, the Finance Committee continues \nits tradition of bipartisanship on trade. I appreciate the efforts of \nmy ranking member, Senator Max Baucus, in helping remove any \nimpediments to getting this done. An agreement such as this one also \nwould not have been possible without the professionalism and work ethic \nof Senator Baucus' staff. In this regard, I owe thanks to Russ \nSullivan, Democratic staff director, and Bill Dauster, deputy staff \ndirector, for their steadfast dedication to the Committee. Brian \nPomper, chief international trade counsel to Senator Baucus, also \ndeserves special thanks for his efforts as do Shara Aranoff, Demetrios \nMarantis, Anya Landau, Janis Lazda, and Chelsea Thomas.\n  I also want to recognize the work of my Finance Committee staff. At \nthe top of the list is Kolan Davis, my chief counsel and staff \ndirector. Kolan has been a valuable asset to this committee, lending \nhis counsel and expertise to moving countless bills, including the \nBahrain agreement. Everett Eissenstat, chief international trade \ncounsel to the committee, has played an important part in seeing that \nthis agreement is timely implemented. I appreciate his continued \ndedication to advancing our trade agenda.\n  Everett manages a strong team of dedicated staff who consistently \npull together to achieve our trade agenda. David Johanson, Stephen \nSchaefer, and Tiffany McCullen Atwell provide valuable support to the \nteam. Their hard work and long hours are much appreciated. I also want \nto recognize Claudia Bridgeford, international trade policy assistant, \nand Russell Ugone, who is on detail to my staff from the Bureau of \nCustoms and Border Protection in the Department of Homeland Security. \nBoth Claudia and Russ have contributed a great deal to the work of this \ncommittee.\n  I would be remiss if I did not take this time to thank Mike Smythers, \nSpecial Assistant to the President for Senate Affairs from the White \nHouse Office of Legislative Affairs. I also want to thank Matt \nNiemeyer, Counselor and Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for \nCongressional Affairs. Matt will soon be leaving the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative. Throughout his tenure, he has been a valuable \nally in passage of much of our trade agenda. I appreciate his hard work \nand service to the American people.\n  Matt was assisted by David ``Andy'' Olson, who provided critical \nsupport in moving this agreement. Jonathon Kallmer from the Office of \nGeneral Counsel at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, also \nplayed a key role in working with Congress to ensure faithful \nimplementation of the agreement. I appreciate both of their efforts. \nFinally, I want to take this opportunity to thank Polly Craghill senior \ncounsel in the Senate's Office of Legislative Counsel, for her role in \npassing this agreement. Polly never falters in her efforts to provide \ntimely technical expertise to this committee and her work is much \nappreciated.\n  This is a good day for the United States and Bahrain. I hope \nPresident Bush will soon sign this bill and that we will see quick \nimplementation of this historic agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13563-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13563-S13564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BAHRAIN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose this agreement. It is more of \nthe same flawed trade model that has undermined the standards that our \nfirms operate under and has helped ship millions of jobs overseas. From \ninadequate protections for workers, the environment, and public health \nand safety, to lax rules of origin, this trade agreement continues the \nappalling trade policies of the last decade and more.\n  We should be working to strengthen our ties with Bahrain and forge a \ntrade agreement that is sustainable and that will enhance the welfare \nof consumers, businesses, and workers in both countries. This agreement \nwill not do that. Tragically, the record of this trade model has been \njust the opposite.\n  My own State of Wisconsin has been hit especially hard by this trade \npolicy. Nor have our trading partners fared well under this flawed \ntrade model. Eleven years of NAFTA have lowered living standards in \nMexico, both for urban workers and in rural areas. As I have noted \nbefore, Professor Riordan Roett of Johns Hopkins has noted that at \nleast 1.5 million Mexican farmers have lost their livelihoods under \nNAFTA.\n  And while this agreement with Bahrain may not have the same \ndevastating impact that NAFTA has had\n\n[[Page S13564]]\n\nand that CAFTA will have, it is cut from the same cloth as those two \ntrade agreements. Certainly neither the United States nor Bahrain is \nlikely to benefit when the trade agreement's rules of origin provisions \ninvite gaming. As Robert Baugh, executive director of the AFL-CIO, \ntestified before the Senate Finance Committee, the provision permits \nmultinational corporations to manipulate production and purchasing ``to \nship goods made primarily in third countries through Bahrain for a \nminimal transformation before entering the U.S. duty free. The rule of \norigin fails to promote production and employment in the U.S. and \nBahrain, and it grants benefits to third-party countries that have \nprovided no reciprocal benefits under the agreement and that are not \nsubject to the agreement's minimal labor and environmental standards.''\n  Mr. President, Wisconsin has paid a heavy price for our trade policy \nin recent years. Since 2000, Wisconsin has lost nearly 92,000 \nmanufacturing jobs. NAFTA, the GATT, and Most Favored Nation treatment \nfor China have devastated local businesses and punished working \nfamilies, taking away family-supporting jobs, and offering lower paying \njobs, if any, in return. I regret that this trade agreement promises \nmore of the same. Instead of building on this failed model of trade, we \nshould scrap it and establish a new model of trade that is fair to \nAmerican businesses, workers, and farmers, as well as the small \nbusinesses, workers and farmers of our trading partners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13564-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATRIOT ACT IMPROVEMENT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the people of Vermont are proud of the \nimportant role that Senator Patrick Leahy is serving in trying to \nimprove the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  My colleague from Vermont rightly believes that security and civil \nliberties need not be mutually exclusive objectives. We can and we \nshould advance both goals. As the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy worked closely with Chairman Arlen Specter in \nhelping to produce a bipartisan bill to renew and improve the USA \nPATRIOT Act. That bill was unanimously approved both by the Judiciary \nCommittee and by the Senate. Now he is working with Senators of both \nparties in trying to win further improvements in the proposed \nconference report on that bill.\n  Just as he did in 2001, then as chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nand the leader of the Senate's negotiations with the administration in \ncrafting the initial USA PATRIOT Act, Senator Leahy now, once again, \nhas worked tirelessly to ensure that we do not hastily pass flawed \nlegislation. Back in the fall of 2001, the Bush administration had \ndemanded that Congress pass the PATRIOT Act in 1 week. The Senator from \nVermont knew that rushing such an expansive law through Congress was a \nmistake, and he secured more time, allowing Congress to add crucial \nchecks and balances to the law. In the best tradition of the Senate, \nSenator Patrick Leahy has championed effective law enforcement and the \nrights and freedoms that we cherish as Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two recent editorials which have \nspotlighted these issues and Senator Leahy's role be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Bennington Banner, Dec. 9, 2005]\n\n                     A Real Green Mountain Patriot\n\n       Much has been said about what makes someone a patriot. \n     Sadly much of it has come as a result of the response to the \n     terrorists attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon \n     on Sept. 11, 2001. What makes that sad is that an outside \n     attack should have--and did for a brief time--brought the \n     country closer together.\n       That has been fractured by political opportunists who \n     responded to the attacks with legislation that Americans \n     would never have accepted before their confidence was rattled \n     so vehemently.\n       One such piece of legislation is the provocatively named \n     USA Patriot Act. The Patriot legislation was drafted to give \n     the government a way to fight terrorism. No one would argue \n     that's an important and necessary goal.\n       But it contains too many provisions that we find \n     unacceptable despite the fact that we remain staunchly anti-\n     terrorist and pro-America. (We're cutting off that argument \n     at the pass . . .)\n       The scariest provision is one that allows the government to \n     get warrants that would allow them to find out what books \n     someone is reading or checking out of the library.\n       That's un-American enough in a society that prides itself \n     on the free and open exchange of ideas. What's worse is that \n     we wouldn't know what books or articles are on that list that \n     makes a reader a suspect.\n       To make it scarier, those warrants are requested and \n     granted in secret.\n       We know that there are armchair generals who are rushing to \n     point out that this is the kind of action needed to fight \n     enemies like terrorists. We remain unconvinced that such \n     secret warrants would make us much different or better than \n     nations that support terrorists.\n       Nor can we justify giving a tool like this to the federal \n     government under an administration that can't convince its \n     people or the world that it's not engaging in torture. We \n     suspect there will be more Abu Ghraibs before the War on \n     Terror is finished.\n       So what makes somebody a patriot? How about standing up \n     against faulty legislation even when a nation that's still in \n     fear may support that law? Maybe it's recognizing the lessons \n     of history and trying to protect our country from another \n     shameful incident like the imprisonment of Japanese citizens \n     during World War II?\n       That's exactly what Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking \n     Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, is doing by \n     refusing to sign a version of the Patriot Act that would \n     extend these powers for four years.\n       We're proud that a patriot like that is serving the people \n     of Vermont.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Dec. 14, 2005]\n\n         Qualms About Anti-Terror Law Unite The Left and Right\n\n       Patrick J. Leahy first made his name in politics as a \n     tough-on-crime, attention-grabbing county prosecutor in the \n     turbulent late 1960s and early '70s. His law-and-order \n     aggressiveness propelled him to election as the first--and, \n     so far, only--Democrat to represent historically Republican \n     Vermont in the U.S. Senate.\n       After the 9/11 attacks, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, Leahy helped shepherd the questionably named ``USA \n     Patriot Act'' through Congress. Reassuring a frightened \n     nation, the Patriot Act granted unprecedented powers to law \n     enforcement, some of which are set to expire at the end of \n     this year.\n       Federal investigators and prosecutors have welcomed the law \n     as providing a clutch of much-needed tools in the war on \n     terrorism. Indeed, much of the act is a good fit for \n     threatening times.\n       But it's also something else: cover for sweeping invasions \n     of citizens' privacy, secret fishing expeditions into \n     privately held records and muzzling of targets who want to \n     complain about it.\n       All are convenient for law enforcement. All have already \n     been abused.\n       This year's rewrite fails to solve these problems and, in \n     fact, would add provisions that have nothing to do with \n     terrorism (see box at right).\n       Leahy is a useful barometer of just how troubling the \n     latest legislation is.\n       Today, the former prosecutor is leading a bipartisan \n     coalition in the Senate seeking to block renewal of some of \n     the PATRIOT Act's most controversial provisions until more is \n     done to curb the potential for assaults on privacy and civil \n     liberties. ``This much unchecked power doesn't make us any \n     safer,'' Leahy told us Tuesday. ``It makes us less safe. . . \n     . Ultimately, you're secure only if you maintain basic \n     liberties.''\n       Other Senate critics of the bill range the full breadth of \n     the political spectrum, from Idaho Republican Larry Craig to \n     Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold. Their bid to hold up the \n     legislation is a worthy one.\n       Since Sept. 11, 2001, using the Patriot Act and stretching \n     authority under other laws, government investigators have \n     collected private information on thousands of people who have \n     no apparent connection to international terrorism. Secret \n     sweeps have been made into library records, hotel bookings, \n     car-rental files and other documents. That material is \n     retained, perhaps forever, in government computers. In at \n     least one case, a lawyer's home and office were searched \n     based on false information.\n       The Bush administration and its allies in Congress have \n     resisted calls for more meaningful protections against \n     invasion of privacy and abuse of civil liberties. While some \n     of the most troubling provisions have been modified in the \n     latest changes, many of the revisions are cosmetic at best.\n       The pressure is on because portions of the PATRIOT Act, \n     including several of the most troubling provisions, expire \n     Dec. 31, and lawmakers are trying to get home for Christmas.\n       Leahy and his allies are proposing to extend the law for \n     three months to allow more time to fix what's wrong. That \n     makes sense. Mistakes made in the heat of post-9/11 anxiety \n     shouldn't be compounded and extended based on an artificial \n     deadline.\n       As Leahy and others have discovered, there's more to \n     patriotism than the label on an antiterrorism law. True \n     patriotism requires not only giving law enforcement the tools \n     it needs, but also adequately protecting citizens against \n     abuse of that power.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13565-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13565]]\n\n\n                      ALITO NOMINATION FILIBUSTER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on Monday United Press International \nreported the good news that our Democratic colleagues do not plan to \nfilibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel Alito.\n  I hope that UPI report is true, because this body needs to return to \nour constitutional and commonsense tradition of fully and fairly \nevaluating and debating judicial nominations.\n  Senators may, of course, vote for or against a judicial nominee for \nany reason, or no reason at all. Our constitutional role of advice and \nconsent, however, requires that after vigorous floor debate, we must \nvote.\n  UPI quoted a spokesman for the Democratic leader saying that talk of \nan Alito filibuster is, in his words, silly and unhelpful.\n  I can only assume that he was speaking for the Democratic leader and, \nwhile I agree with his statement, I am afraid the situation is not \nquite what he would have our fellow citizens believe.\n  In fact, not 24 hours earlier, this very same spokesman was himself \nengaging in some silly and unhelpful filibuster talk of his own, \ntelling the Associated Press that all procedural options are on the \ntable for handling the Alito nomination.\n  We all know what that means.\n  The list of all procedural options includes the filibuster, by which \nthose who cannot defeat a judicial nomination on the merits try to do \nso by preventing any confirmation vote at all.\n  Before the Democratic spin machine cranks out a press release \naccusing me of silly and unhelpful filibuster talk, let me remind \neveryone of some possibly inconvenient facts.\n  I know that my friend, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nwas on the floor Monday claiming that no Democratic Senator had talked \nabout filibustering the Alito nomination.\n  With all due respect to him, that is simply not accurate and the \npublic record speaks for itself.\n  On November 1, for example, the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, \ntold The Hill newspaper that nothing is off the table.\n  That same day, the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, was more \nspecific, telling the Associated Press that, in her words, the \nfilibuster's on the table.\n  The next day, the Senator from Iowa, my friend Senator Harkin, went \neven further.\n  The Baltimore Sun quotes him saying that he believes Democrats will \nindeed filibuster the Alito nomination.\n  Other Democrats, some of them my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee, have also engaged in what their party's spokesman has \nbranded silly and unhelpful filibuster talk.\n  The distinguished assistant Democratic leader, Senator Durbin, said \nthe Democrats' decision whether to allow the nomination to go forward \nat all will be made after next month's hearing.\n  Again, we all know what that means.\n  It means the filibuster is still on the table.\n  On November 20, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, a former \nJudiciary Committee chairman, not only suggested a filibuster was \npossible, but said its prospects had actually increased.\n  Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said last month \nthat Senate Democrats should, in his words, absolutely keep the \nfilibuster option on the table.\n  And finally, the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, himself said back \non November 1 that an Alito filibuster is possible.\n  This record is public and very consistent. And this record makes the \nstatement on Monday by the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, that he does not know a single Democratic Senator who has \ntalked about an Alito filibuster absolutely baffling.\n  My Democratic colleagues have certainly done so, early and often.\n  Some Senators, well-meaning Senators, have said that the judicial \nnomination filibuster issue is really about freedom of speech. The \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia made that point on Monday here \non the Senate floor.\n  We all believe in freedom of speech. We all believe in full, fair, \nand vigorous debate. When it comes to the legislation over which this \nlegislative body has complete authority, debate can become an end in \nitself. That is, after all, the definition of a filibuster, when ending \ndebate proves impossible.\n\n  The filibuster has long been, and I believe should remain, part of \nthe legislative process.\n  Judicial appointments, however, are different than legislation. The \nConstitution assigns the power to nominate and appoint judges to the \nPresident.\n  And judicial, as opposed to executive, appointments also dramatically \naffect the third branch of government.\n  When it comes to judicial nominations, therefore, debate should be a \nmeans to an end.\n  The end of the judicial confirmation process must be an up-or-down \nvote for nominations reaching the Senate floor.\n  The Senate can vote to withhold consent to a judicial nomination, and \nwe have done so in the past.\n  But refusing to vote at all, especially when a judicial nomination \nclearly has majority support, goes beyond exercising our advice and \nconsent role and attempts to highjack the President's appointment power \naltogether.\n  When Republicans were in the minority, we respected President \nClinton's primary role in judicial appointments.\n  This body confirmed his Supreme Court nominee Judge Ruth Bader \nGinsburg in 1993 by an overwhelming vote of 96 to 3.\n  We confirmed his nominee Judge Stephen Breyer in 1994 by a margin of \n90 to 9.\n  Judicial nomination filibusters, then, are not about freedom of \nspeech.\n  When it comes to the judicial confirmation process, our freedom of \nspeech must be shaped and balanced by the separation of powers, by the \nConstitution's assignment of authority in that process.\n  Until recently, the Senate refused to transfer the powerful tool of \nthe filibuster from the legislative process to the judicial \nconfirmation process.\n  We refused to go down that road and I believe we should put up a \npermanent roadblock.\n  With all due respect to my Democratic colleagues, they cannot have it \nboth ways.\n  They cannot, as they have been doing now for more than 6 weeks, keep \nfilibuster hopes alive by suggestions and hints, and then claim their \npolitical hands are clean when Senators on this side of the aisle \nrespond.\n  I believe that UPI reported the Democratic spokesman's statement \naccurately, but I am not as confident that his statement is accurate or \noperative.\n  Does it mean that Democratic Senators have abandoned their earlier \nstatements and decided that the Senate should indeed debate and then \nvote on the Alito nomination?\n  I believe that is what the American people expect us to do, but is \nthat what Democratic Senators will do?\n  I hope they do.\n  I hope we can fully and vigorously debate the Alito nomination, and \nthen vote on it.\n  I also believe that when the Senate and American people get to know \nJudge Alito, his experience, his character, and his traditional \nmainstream views of the law and the Constitution at his confirmation \nhearing, they will like what they hear.\n  Judge Alito is a good man and a great judge.\n  My Democratic colleagues can help sort out the confusion their \nearlier statements have created.\n  If they mean what they now say, that talk of filibustering the Alito \nnomination is indeed silly and unhelpful, then let us take the divisive \nand politicizing option of a filibuster off the table.\n  Let us agree, right here and now, that this body will do its duty of \nfully debating the Alito nomination and then voting on it.\n  The Constitution, Senate tradition, and the American people demand no \nless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13565-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13565-S13566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. Sorum passed \naway at the age of 58, leaving behind an impressive legacy through his \nwork in small business, government, entrepreneurship, publishing, and \npolitical fundraising.\n  In his 4-year tenure at the Small Business Administration, Mr. Sorum \nserved as the Deputy Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, working \nclosely with State and local officials to foster open communication and \nstrong working relationships among Federal, State, and local government \nofficials. Following this, Mr. Sorum became a senior adviser in the \nagency's Office of the National Ombudsman. In that post, he served a \nnumber of roles, including the regulatory fairness board coordinator, \ntrade association coordinator, and Federal agency liaison. Most \nrecently, Mr. Sorum was the Small Business Administration's Acting \nNational Ombudsman where he worked to ensure that small business \nowners, nonprofit organizations, and small government entities were not \nfaced with unfair Federal regulatory enforcement actions.\n  Prior to his service in the Small Business Administration, Mr. Sorum, \na small business owner himself, was the founder and manager of the \nsoftware and telecommunications company, Maple Eagle International. \nAdditionally, he published The Word, a Marine Corps Reserve Officers' \nmagazine from 1985-1987 as well as Japan Now from its inception in 1992 \nuntil 1994.\n  Mr. Sorum's commitment to public service and small business lasted \nuntil his death. His career spanned several decades, including five \nPresidential administrations.

LaPORTE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nprofessional dedication, vision and military service of GEN Leon J. \nLaPorte who is retiring from the U.S. Army after 37 years of dedicated \nservice. It is a privilege for me to recognize the many outstanding \nachievements General LaPorte has provided the Army, and our great \nNation.\n  General LaPorte was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1968 upon \ngraduation from the University of Rhode Island. He was commissioned an \narmor officer and served in numerous positions of increasing \nresponsibility to include the position from which he will retire. \nGeneral LaPorte's contributions throughout his career have made an \nhistoric impact and greatly improved our Nation's security.\n  General LaPorte assumed command of the United Nations Command, \nRepublic of Korea/United States Combined Forces Command, and United \nStates Forces Korea on May 1, 2002. On October 1, 2005, General LaPorte \nbecame the longest serving U.S. commander in Korea. Earning this \ndistinction is a tribute to his performance and the excellent \nrelationships he fostered with our Korean allies. General LaPorte's \ntenure has been highlighted by several very crucial periods in the \nalliance. During his time in command, we have witnessed multiple North \nKorean maritime violations and numerous DMZ and airspace incursions. \nThese threats to the security and sovereignty of Korea led General \nLaPorte to develop deterrent options and force enhancements that \nprovided increased deterrence against aggression. Despite the \ntremendous implications involved, General LaPorte remained unflappable \nand skillfully designed military force packages that could be deployed \nagainst anticipated threat scenarios to address the uncertain \npolitical-military situations.\n  General LaPorte has been a principal participant in the fast-paced \nbilateral military and political discussions. General LaPorte earned \nthe reputation as a well-respected ambassador for the United States. He \ndeveloped and maintained close ties with the military and civilian \nleadership of the Republic of Korea in partnership with the U.S. \nAmbassador to Korea. He is credited with fusing a lasting bond between \nthe two nations.\n  General LaPorte is a soldier's soldier. Throughout his career \nforemost in his thoughts and his actions have been initiatives in the \nbest interest of the soldiers, civilians, and family members. These \npriorities are reflected in every decision he makes. He expects those \nserving below him to do the same. This was never more evident than when \nhe deployed with the 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, TX as the Chief \nof Staff in October 1990 during Operations Desert Shield and Desert \nStorm and more recently during the deployment of one of his battalions \nto Iraq in support of OIF. General LaPorte was tireless in ensuring \nthat each soldier was properly prepared, trained and equipped for the \nmission and that every family was cared for by a Family Readiness \nGroup. The reenlistment rates in his units demonstrate the love, \nloyalty and dedication of those who served under General LaPorte.\n  During his illustrious career in the Army General LaPorte has been \nnothing less than brilliant. General LaPorte is a great credit to the \nArmy and the Nation. As he now departs to share his experience and \nexpertise with the private sector, I call upon my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to recognize his service and wish him and his wife \nJudy well in their new endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13566-4", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13566-S13567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO FRANK M. ``MARK'' NEWTON\n\n Mr. VITTER.

Two years later, he accepted an offer \nfrom the Naval Investigative Service and began his service as a special \nagent assigned to NISRA Norfolk, VA. During his 4 years in the Norfolk \narea, Mr. Brant served in four different NIS offices and also completed \nan assignment as special agent afloat aboard the USS Independence. \n  For 13 years, Mr. Brant served NCIS in a number of assignments in the \nUnited States and the Philippines, and he earned an appointment to the \nSenior Executive Service as Assistant Director for Counterintelligence \nin 1994. Mr. Brant served in that capacity until he succeeded Roy D. \nNedrow as Director of the NCIS in May 1997.\n  Mr. Brant has been widely recognized within the Department of the \nNavy and the Department of Defense, as well as within the Federal law \nenforcement community, for his innovative and transformational \napproaches to enhancing law enforcement and counterintelligence \ncapabilities. He has led NCIS in developing and implementing \noperational strategies, across all of the agency's mission areas, which \nserve as models for others to follow. Additionally, Mr. Brant \nestablished the Counterterrorism Directorate and built the Multiple \nThreat Alert Center, MTAC, specifically to enhance the ability of the \nNCIS to counter threats facing the Navy and Marine Corps.\n  Other noteworthy accomplishments during Mr. Brant's tenure include \nthe creation of both the NCIS Contingency Response Field Office, CRFO, \nto improve the capacity of NCIS to deploy agents to meet naval \nrequirements in high-threat environments like Iraq and Afghanistan, and \nthe Deployment Support Office, DSO, to better support those personnel \nonce they are deployed. Mr. Brant has also led the creation of the Law \nEnforcement Information Exchange, LInX, Program, which has brought \nlocal, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies together to great \neffect in support of naval force protection and crimefighting in the \nHampton Roads area and other parts of the country. He has partnered \nNCIS with the FBI on Joint Terrorism Task Forces, and assigned agents \nto Defense Department Force Protection Detachments, FPDs, around the \nworld. Moreover, he has been an outstanding spokesman for NCIS and the \nDepartment of the Navy in senior level law enforcement, \ncounterintelligence, and counterterrorism venues around the world.\n  Most of all, Mr. Brant appreciates that what makes NCIS a truly great \nagency is the quality of its people. He routinely fought to ensure that \nagents, analysts, and support personnel alike had the equipment, \ntraining, and support required to do their jobs. Under his leadership, \nNCIS gained civilian arrest authority and built a reputation as a \nfirst-class law enforcement agency. He established the Director's \nAdvisory Board, DAB, to provide him with direct feedback for the field \non emergent issues. Mr. Brant improved upon the NCIS support \ninfrastructure by hiring specialists in the fields of communications, \ncongressional affairs, human resources, and information technology. He \nincreased the number of SES and other high-grade billets while also \nworking diligently for the additional funding that will ensure the \nsuccess of his agency for years to come.\n  During his career, Mr. Brant has been recognized as an outstanding \nleader by multiple organizations. For his distinguished service, he has \nreceived the Department of Defense Presidential Rank Award and the \nDepartment of the Navy Distinguished Service Award. Recently, he was \nhonored by the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association, \nHAPCOA, with the Aguila Award for Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice \nand by the Women in Federal Law Enforcement, WIFLE, as the 2004 \nOutstanding Advocate for Women in Federal Law Enforcement.\n  As he begins his well deserved retirement, Mr. Brant will remain in \nthe Washington, DC, area with his wife Merri Jo, and his children, \nEmily and Andrew. I salute David Brant for his dedicated service to our \ncountry, and I wish him and his family well in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13567-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13567-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13567-4", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13567-S13568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 125.

A bill to assist members of the Armed Forces in obtaining \nUnited States citizenship, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about a bill I \nwill be introducing that rights a wrong and corrects a terrible \ninjustice. I am introducing legislation called the Kendell Frederick \nCitizenship Assistance Act of 2005. This is legislation was inspired by \na young man from the State of Maryland, who was in the Army, had a \ngreen card, was serving this country, though not a citizen, and was \nkilled while serving in Iraq. He was killed by a roadside bomb on his \nway to be fingerprinted, on his way to become a U.S. citizen. He died \non his way to become a U.S. citizen because of the failed and flawed \ninformation he was given by our immigration system.\n  He was a terrific young man, who came to this country when he was \nfifteen from Trinidad. He joined his mother here in the U.S. and wanted \nso much to be part of this country. He wanted to serve this country and \nso he joined the ROTC when he was in high school. In fact, Randallstown \nHigh School has one of the best high school ROTCs programs that \nMaryland has. After graduation, he then joined the Army and off he went \nto train to serve this country.\n  He was killed by the botched bureaucracy of the U.S. Government, by \ntheir incompetence, by their indifference, by their ineptitude; and \nthis is absolutely inexcusable. Every military death in Iraq is a \ntragedy, but this one did not need to happen. I am going to tell you a \nlittle bit about him and then tell you what happened.\n  As I said, he graduated from high school and he decided to join the \nArmy with hopes that he would go back to school. In the Army he was a \ngenerator mechanic assigned to a heavy combat battalion. His job was to \nkeep that battalion running. All he wanted was to do a good job, help \nhis buddies stay alive, stay alive himself, defend what we were doing \nin Iraq and, along the way, become an American citizen and come back \nhome and resume his life. He had been trying to become an American \ncitizen for a while. He started working on it when he joined the Army.\n  Mr. President, because I know of your keen interest in national \nsecurity, I understand that you know when you join the Army you are \nfingerprinted and a background check is run. We just don't let anybody \njoin the United States Army. You can't get in if you are a drug dealer, \nif you have an extensive criminal record or if you would be a threat to \nthe security of the United States. You can't get in if there is even a \nhint that you might be connected to a terrorist organization. So \nKendell Frederick was accepted into the Army after all these security \nchecks were run and his background was vetted. Then he sent in his \ncitizenship application but, guess what, he checked the wrong box. What \ndid that mean? Here he was, training for war, packing up to go to Iraq, \nsaying goodbye to his mom, his brother and two sisters and in the \nmiddle of this he checked the wrong box saying that he was not in the \nmilitary. So his application was derailed, not once but three different \ntimes.\n  The first time was after his mother checked the correct box saying \nthat Kendell was in the military. Immigration sent the application to \nthe wrong office, not the one that handles military applications that \nis on a fast track but the general one where all the applications are \nall stacked up. Second, Immigration rejected the fingerprints that were \nsent from the military. There was no explanation. His mother did not \nknow why the fingerprints had been rejected. He had sent in the \npaperwork from Iraq. As I said, Kendell had already been fingerprinted, \nhad already had his background vetted when he joined the military. So \nhere was a guy who had been fingerprinted and cleared to join the \nmilitary. The Army had said, you are OK, Kendell. He had an FBI \nbackground check run. The FBI said you are OK, Kendell. The Army wants \nsomebody like you. But when he tried to get through Immigration, they \nsaid no, the fingerprints he had taken when he joined the military and \neven the fingerprints he sent into immigration were not enough.\n  Finally, when his mother called this 1-800 Immigration number--you \ntry to call that number--she got no help. It is like trying to make a \ncall from the Superdome in the middle of Katrina. You are not going to \nget help going to get the right answer. His mother called that number. \nThey told his mother that he had to return from Baghdad and go to \nBaltimore to get his fingerprints. His mother got on the phone again, \nbecause he can't call from Baghdad--he is being shot at, he is trying \nto defend himself and the troops of the United States of America--so he \nwas a little busy, couldn't afford to get a busy signal from \nImmigration.\n  When his mother called and said, ``My boy is in Baghdad,'' \nImmigration at the 800 number told her, there was nothing they could \ndo. They didn't even know their own rules. They didn't know their own \nsystem. They didn't know their own laws. Immigration was wrong. They \ngave his mother the wrong information.\n  So here is Kendell, still keeping in touch, still trying to do his \njob, trying to get his fingerprints taken to become a U.S. citizen. \nFinally, there was an arrangement made. His staff sergeant came to his \nrescue and made arrangements for him to be fingerprinted at a nearby \nair base so he could complete this application. On October 19, with the \nhelp of his staff sergeant, he was traveling in a convoy to get his \nfingerprints. He didn't usually go in convoys, but that day he was on \nthat convoy to get his fingerprints to become an American citizen--to \ncompensate for the botched mistakes of Immigration--and on his way a \nroadside bomb killed him.\n  They told his mother that immigration would give Kendell U.S. \ncitizenship. They granted his citizenship a week after he died. He was \nburied at Arlington, as he should have been. He was trying to do the \nright thing, yet he was given the wrong information.\n  As I said, his staff sergeant tried to help him, his mother tried to \nhelp him, but the system, the immigration system, failed him time and \ntime again.\n  When I called his mother--and I try to call all the families of our \nmilitary from Maryland who die; some I reach, some I do not--I spoke to \nhis mother. She said to me that she did not want another mother to go \nthrough what she went through, to go through what her son went through. \nService members and their moms and dads should not be worrying about \nwhat box to check, where the fingerprints are, et cetera. She said \nImmigration should know their own rules. When we explained to her the \nrules of Immigration, that he should have been fast tracked, that these \nfingerprints should have been OK, that he did not have to pay a $400 \nfee, she said, ``Nobody told me that.'' Every time I called, I got \ndifferent information.\n\n  I am introducing legislation today to prevent this from happening \nagain. His mother asked me to introduce legislation, and she asked me \nto call it the\n\n[[Page S13573]]\n\nKendell Frederick law. I am doing that today, and over in the House \nCongressman Elijah Cummings is doing the same thing. We made this \npromise when we stood in the church, a small, humble church in an \nAfrican-American community in Baltimore. We made this pledge to his \nmother that we would do this for her and we are here today to do just \nthat.\n  The legislation I am introducing today makes it easier for military \nservicemembers to become citizens. The provisions cut through the \nredtape. It requires Immigration to use the fingerprints the military \ntakes when the person enlists in the military.\n  It requires the creation of a military citizen advocate to inform the \nservicemembers about the citizenship process and help with the \napplication.\n  It also means they won't leave boot camp unless they are absolutely \napprised of all of the rules and all of the regulations about how to \napply to become a U.S. citizen.\n  The very process they have to go through to join the military, \nfingerprinting and FBI background check, should be good enough. Because \nyou see, deep down inside, we believe that if you are good enough to \nfight for this country, you are good enough to become a citizen of this \ncountry.\n  There is a pileup of 3,000 people with green cards fighting in our \nmilitary today who have applied to become American citizens. You should \nnot have to be standing in that kind of line. We are not saying let \nanyone become a U.S. citizen, but these are men and women who joined \nthe military and fighting for this country. They have a green card, \nthey have been fingerprinted, and they have passed an FBI check. Why do \nthey have to go through it all over again?\n  We are passing a law that would stop this needless bureaucracy, and \nwe are establishing a special 800 number for our military and their \nfamilies.\n  We talk a lot about standing up for our troops, and we certainly \nshould stand up for our troops. This means we should stand up for them \nand enable them to follow their dreams. They are certainly standing up \nfor us.\n  Today, we introduced the Kendell Frederick bill to make sure that \nanyone in the military who wants to be a U.S. citizen, who has a green \ncard, and who passed the fingerprint checks will be able to do so \nquickly and easily. If they are willing to fight for America and die \nfor America, they should be able to become an American citizen.\n  I will be circulating a ``Dear Colleague'' to my colleagues to join \nit. I hope we can pass this legislation on a bipartisan basis so that \nas men and women such as Kendell Frederick fight for freedom, we ensure \nthat their memory is not in vain.\n  I thank the Chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2098. A bill to amend the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act of 2000 to clarify the eligibility of certain \nemployees of the Department of Energy under that Act; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk for appropriate \nreference legislation that will clarify that citizens of the former \nTrust Territory of the Pacific Islands are eligible for coverage and \npotential compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act, EEOICPA, for workers who developed radiogenic \ncancers and other ailments after working at the Pacific Test Site in \nthe Marshall Islands.\n  An estimated up to 500 Republic of Marshall Islanders and other \nMicronesian workers may have been employed by the Department of Energy, \nor its predecessor agency, or Department subcontractors prior to 1986 \nwhen the Trusteeship was terminated for all areas except Palau. Both \nBikini and Enewetak Atolls were the sites for numerous nuclear and \nthermonuclear tests. Other atolls, such as Rongelap and Utrik, were \naffected by fallout from the Bravo hydrogen bomb test in March 1954.\n  Congress, in 2000, approved a compensation program to provide aid and \npay medical bills for those who suffered radiation-caused illnesses \nbecause of working on the nuclear weapons program. Congress \nspecifically set up a ``Special Exposure Cohort'' to provide \ncompensation to certain workers with radiogenic cancer and other \nillnesses because it was presumed that their illnesses resulted from \nworkplace exposure to radiation caused by their Government work. \nCongress, in 2004, amended the act, first approved in the 2001 Military \nConstruction Authorization Act, to speed payments of compensation, \nincluding funds for lost wages to workers or their heirs, to those who \nworked for the Department of Energy and its predecessor agency on \nnuclear weapons programs.\n  Earlier this year the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held \nan oversight hearing to review a number of issues raised by the \ngovernment of the Republic of the Marshall Islands related to the \neffects of the nuclear testing program. One of the issues was coverage \nfor residents of the then-trust territory who were employed during the \ntesting and subsequent cleanup. During that period, the United States \nwas the administering authority over the area under a United Nations \nTrusteeship Agreement and exercised all the powers of a sovereign. It \nseems somewhat incongruous for the Congress to have established a \nprogram that applied to U.S. citizens but not to those who lived and \nworked under U.S. administration.\n  That also seems reasonable, since there is little other reason for \nthe specific inclusion of the Pacific Test Site if the workers were not \nto be covered. During Senate debate, Senator Bingaman, a conferee on \nthe amendment, submitted a list of DOE facilities intended to be \ncovered by the act--a list which included the Marshall Islands, 146 \nCong. Rec. S. 4754-7.\n  While most of the issues raised by the Minister of Foreign Affairs \nfor the Marshall Islands during our oversight hearing are now being \ndiscussed with various Federal agencies under the auspices of Secretary \nof the Interior Norton, this is an issue that will require \ncongressional action, given the interpretations from Federal agencies \nthat questioned whether Congress intended the Act to apply \nextraterritorially. The act, of course, applies to individuals not \njurisdictions and the specific mention of the Pacific Test Site and \nEnewetak would seem to indicate that Congress intended to include \nworkers at the site.\n  Subsequent to the hearing, I had the privilege to meet privately with \nthe President of the Marshall Islands when he visited Washington in \nearly September. We had a good meeting and at the time I offered my \nassistance in ensuring that the proper agencies or groups would review \nthe issues they had raised. As I indicated, most of these issues are \nproperly now being discussed with representatives of the Marshalls \nthrough a multi-agency dialogue headed by Secretary Norton. This issue, \nhowever, may be one that is best handled directly through the \ncongressional process. Therefore, when I was asked by the Marshall's \nEmbassy here in Washington if I would introduce a bill to clarify \nworker eligibility so that the proper congressional committees could \nreview it, I agreed.\n  Given the paperwork, record and radiation dosage requirements for \nreceipt of compensation, it is far from clear how many Marshallese and \nMicronesian workers will actually qualify for the up to $150,000 in \ncompensation, plus medical benefits and lost wage compensation for \nailments caused by radiation stemming from the weapons tests. That is \nan issue that I hope the congressional committees will consider \nsympathetically. But it is only just that the program be opened equally \nto all Department of Energy workers or subcontract workers who labored \nto produce nuclear weapons to help this Nation's national defense at a \ncritical period of the Cold War. As an Alaskan from a State whose \nworkers have been compensated for injuries they gained resulting from \nunderground weapons testing at Amchitka Island in the Aleutian Chain \nalmost immediately after the ending of weapons testing in the \natmosphere over the Marshall Islands, it is impossible not to support \naid for the Marshallese.\n  While Congress and the administration continue to weigh additional \naid to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, passage of this measure \nwould be a sign of this Nation's continued commitment to aid the \nislanders who in February 1946 followed the advice of Bikinian leader, \nKing Juda, and agreed to leave the Bikini Atoll so America could use\n\n[[Page S13574]]\n\nit for weapons testing saying, ``We will go believing that everything \nis in the hands of God.''\n  I appreciate the understanding and the patience shown by the \nMarshall's Government and their citizens as we proceed to review the \nissues raised concerning the effects of the nuclear testing program, \nand I hope the introduction of this legislation will be seen as an \nexample of our commitment to see that those issues receive a full and \nfair review and discussion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. \n        Hatch):\n  S. 2099. A bill to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to \nrequire commercial nuclear utilities to transfer spent nuclear fuel \nfrom spent nuclear fuel pools into spent nuclear fuel dry casks and \nconvey to the Secretary of Energy title to all spent nuclear fuel thus \nsafely stored; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for Senator Ensign, Senator \nBennett and myself to introduce a bill to increase the safety and \nsecurity of our Nation's nuclear power infrastructure, The Spent \nNuclear Fuel On-Site Storage Security Act of 2005.\n  I am convinced that the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump \nwill never be built because of the myriad of scientific, safety and \ntechnical problems in which it is mired. It simply is neither safe nor \nsecure, as illustrated by several significant scientific, legal, and \nbudgetary setbacks this past year.\n  Here are some of the highlights: On July 9, 2004, the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals sided with the people of Nevada in a lawsuit to stop \nthe proposed Yucca Mountain project. The court decided that U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's radiation standard for the site was \nnot stringent enough to protect the public from the significant risks \nassociated with nuclear waste and failed to follow the recommendation \nby the National Academy of Sciences.\n  On August 31, 2004, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety \nand Licensing Board rejected Department of Energy's Yucca Mountain \ndocument database, saying it had failed to make public many of the \ndocuments that it had in its possession. The Board said, ``Given the 15 \nyears that DOE had to gather, review, and produce its documents and the \nfact that the date of production, and the incompleteness of its \nprivilege review, it is clear to us that DOE did not meet its \nobligation, in good faith, to make all reasonable efforts to make all \ndocumentary materials available.''\n  On October 4, 2004, the DOE Inspector General found that DOE has \ngiven away more than $500,000 worth of Yucca Mountain construction \nequipment in 2003. Half a million dollars is a tremendous amount of the \npeople's money to waste.\n  On November 22, 2004, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board said \nDOE does not have a plan for safely transporting nuclear waste to the \nproposed repository.\n  On February 7, 2005, Dr. Margaret Chu, most recently the Director of \nthe Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, said the project \nwould be delayed until 2012 and that DOE's license application to the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission would not be filed until December 2005, \ndelayed a year. To date, the license application still has not been \nfiled.\n  On February 8, 2005, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board have \ncalled for hearings to review concerns over the corrosion of the \ntitanium drip shields that are intended to keep water from leaking into \ncasks inside Yucca Mountain.\n  On February 28, 2005, a DOE official said the proposed Yucca Mountain \nrepository may not open until 2015.\n  On March 16, 2005, DOE revealed that documents and models about water \ninfiltration at Yucca Mountain, a key issue, had been falsified.\n  On July 18, 2005, DOE announced that it will use dedicated train \nservice for its rail transport of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \nwaste to Yucca Mountain, a shift from two decades of administration \npolicy that ignores the fact that about one-third of reactor sites are \nnot capable of shipping fuel by rail.\n  On August 22, 2005, EPA published its revised radiation standards for \nthe proposed Yucca Mountain high-level waste dump. These standards are \nwholly inadequate, do not meet the law's requirements and do not \nprotect public health and safety.\n  On October 13, 2005, DOE began a series of actions to overhaul the \nYucca Mountain project. We are going back to the drawing board, \nfrequently revisiting proposals discarded decades ago as unsafe or \nunworkable.\n  On October 25, 2005, DOE announced that it would be redesigning the \nspent fuel storage process, both the containers and facilities.\n  On November 16, 2005, the DOE Inspector General announced that DOE \nhas ignored numerous admitted instances of falsification of technical \nand scientific date on the project, showing that years of quality \nassurance problems continue.\n  On November 17, 2005, DOE sent a detailed letter to its contractor \nspecifying some of the desired changes in the site proposal.\n  At the December 7, 2005, at the NRC-DOE quarterly meeting on Yucca \nMountain, DOE announced that it expects to re-baseline the project mid-\n2006, requiring many of the technical and scientific analyses to be \nredone.\n  On November 19, 2005, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill became \nlaw, cutting the Yucca Mountain budget to $577 million, half of what \nDOE said it would need to keep the project on track.\n  In numerous media reports, DOE has confirmed that it is preparing a \nlegislative package that addresses Yucca Mountain. Clearly, DOE cannot \nmeet the current public health, safety and technical requirements.\n  It should be clear to anyone that the proposed Yucca Mountain project \nis scientifically unsound and that it cannot meet the requirements of \nlaw. It is not going anywhere. Delay after delay costs the taxpayers \nbillions and billions of dollars for a project that the courts have \nruled does not meet sufficient safety or public health standards. I do \nnot believe that Yucca Mountain will ever open, and Nevada and the \ncountry will be safer for our successful efforts to stop the project.\n  Yet, we must safely store spent nuclear fuel.\n  A 1979 study by the Sandia National Laboratory determined that, if \nall the water were to drain from a spent fuel pool, dense-packed spent \nfuel would likely heat up to the point where it would burst and then \ncatch fire, releasing massive quantities of volatile radioactive \nfission products into the air. Both the short-term and the long-term \ncontamination impacts of such an event could be significantly worse \nthan those from Chernobyl. The consequences would be so severe and \nwould affect such a large area that all precautions must be taken to \npreclude them. This is the type of serious, avoidable risk against \nwhich all the Nation's nuclear sites can and should be protected to \ncounter terrorist threats.\n  It is time to look at other nuclear waste alternatives. Fortunately, \nthe technology to realize a viable, safe and secure alternative is \nreadily available and can be fully implemented within 6 years if we act \nnow. That technology is dry cask storage.\n  The technology for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel in dry \nstorage casks has improved dramatically in the past 20 years. Seventeen \ncask designs have. been licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nwhich says that spent nuclear fuel can be safely stored using dry cask \nstorage on-site at the nuclear power plants for at least 100 years. \nAlready, dry casks safely store spent nuclear fuel at 34 sites \nthroughout the country, many of them near communities, water ways and \ntransportation routes. The Nuclear Energy Institute has projected 83 of \nthe 103 active reactors will have dry storage by 2050.\n  Compared to water-filled pools, dry storage casks are significantly \nless vulnerable to natural and human-induced disasters, including \nfloods, tornadoes, temperature extremes, sabotage, and missile attacks. \nIn addition, dry storage casks are not subject to drainage risks, \nwhether intentional or accidental.\n  On March 28, 2005, the Washington Post revealed that a classified \nNational Academy of Sciences report concluded that the government does \nnot fully understand the risks a terrorist attack\n\n[[Page S13575]]\n\ncould pose to spent nuclear fuel pools and that it ought to expedite \nthe removal of the fuel to dry storage casks that are more resilient to \nattack.\n  Our bill requires commercial nuclear utilities to safely transfer \nspent nuclear fuel from temporary storage in water-filled pools to \nsecure storage in licensed, on-site dry cask storage facilities. After \ntransferal, the Secretary of Energy will take title and full \nresponsibility for the possession, stewardship, maintenance, and \nmonitoring of all spent fuel thus safely stored. Finally, our bill \nestablishes a grant program to compensate utilities for expenses \nassociated with transferring the waste. The costs of transferring the \nwaste and providing the grants will be offset by withdrawals from the \nutility-funded Nuclear Waste Fund.\n  Nuclear facilities currently provide 20 percent of our Nation's \nelectricity, but in light of the events of September 11, they also \npresent a security risk that we simply must address. There cannot be \nany weak links in the chain of security of our Nation's nuclear power \ninfrastructure. There is absolutely no justification for endangering \nthe public by densely packing nuclear waste in vulnerable spent fuel \npools when it can be stored safely and securely in dry casks. This bill \nguarantees all Americans that our Nation's nuclear waste will be stored \nin the safest way possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2099\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nthe deduction for depreciation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, our economy has changed dramatically in \nrecent years as a result of the development of new technologies and \nindustries. However, we have not updated our tax depreciation system to \nreflect these advancements. In fact, the recovery periods used to \ncalculate depreciation allowances have not been adjusted since 1986--\nand in some cases not since 1962. For example, a personal computer has \na depreciable life of 5 years even though its economic life is only 2 \nto 3 years.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that will respond to these \nchanges by modernizing and simplifying the tax depreciation rules. \nSenator Kerry has joined me in introducing the Tax Depreciation, \nModernization and Simplification Act of 2005, which will encourage \ncapital investment and make it easier for companies to comply with the \ntax law.\n  This legislation will allow the Treasury Department, in consultation \nwith Congress, to modify and create new class lives for capital assets. \nAny new classification created by the Treasury Department must reflect \nthe anticipated useful life and decline in value over time of the \nasset. In addition, it should take into account when the asset is \ntechnologically or functionally obsolete for its original purpose. With \nthis new regulatory authority, Treasury will be able to develop class \nlives that are more in line with assets' economic lives.\n  Another provision in this legislation deals with the mid-quarter \nconvention. The mid-quarter convention is one of the placed-in-service \nconventions that directs when depreciation for an asset begins or ends. \nThe mid-quarter convention, however, creates significant complexity. \nTaxpayers must wait until after the tax year ends to determine whether \nto use the half-year or mid-quarter convention. Therefore, consistent \nwith a Joint Committee on Taxation recommendation, the bill eliminates \nthe mid-quarter convention for simplification purposes.\n  Small businesses are the heart of our economy. We, in Congress, \nshould do everything we can to ease the administrative burdens for \nsmall businesses. That is why we should make small business expensing \npermanent. These rules permit small businesses to expense immediately \nup to $100,000 of the cost of property each year. This proposal will \nmaintain this important simplification which is set to expire at the \nend of 2007.\n\n[[Page S13576]]\n\n  Finally, this legislation will allow for mass asset accounting. \nCurrently, companies must generally calculate depreciation on an item-\nby-item basis. For example, if a company has 200 desks or 200 \ncomputers, they must account for and depreciate each item separately. \nThis can be a challenge and an administrative burden for companies--\nespecially with small items, like chairs and telephones. Therefore, the \nbill will permit all companies to elect to use mass asset accounting \nfor property that costs less than $10,000.\n  The bipartisan Tax Depreciation, Modernization and Simplification Act \nof 2005 will make much needed changes to the tax depreciation system. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to enact these important \nreforms and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2100\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today Senator Smith and I are introducing \nthe Tax Depreciation, Modernization, and Simplification Act of 2005. \nLast July, the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Long-Term Growth and Debt \nReduction, on which Senator Smith is chairman and I am ranking member, \nheld a hearing on updating our depreciation system. During the hearing, \nwe heard that the current depreciation system is out of date and that \nchanges should be made.\n  Our tax system allows, as a current expense, a depreciation deduction \nthat represents a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and \ntear of property used, or of property held for the production of \nincome. Since 1981, the\n\n[[Page S13577]]\n\ndepreciation deduction for most tangible property has been under rules \nspecified in section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Modified \nAccelerated Cost Recovery System, or MACRS, specified under section 168 \napplies to most new investment in tangible property. MACRS depreciation \nallowances are computed by determining a recovery period called a class \nlife and an applicable recovery method for each asset.\n  The current depreciation system has not kept pace with technological \nadvances. Several industries were not even contemplated when class \nlives were assigned in 1981, and some class lives even date back to \n1962.\n  In the 1980s it would have been difficult to imagine what our \nreliance on computer and wireless technology would be today. At that \ntime, for example, the wireless industry was in its infancy, and there \nwas no specifically assigned life for wireless equipment. As a result, \ntoday's depreciation system is like playing ``audit roulette.'' There \nis no certainty in how these assets should be depreciated.\n  All this matters because it impacts investment, innovation, \ncompetitiveness, and ultimately the quality and quantity of jobs in \nAmerica. My home State of Massachusetts is a leader in the high tech \nindustry. Massachusetts employs hundreds of thousands of skilled \nworkers in key technology sectors, including computer hardware, life \nsciences, software, medical products, semiconductor, defense technology \nand telecommunications. We have learned in Massachusetts that a \nstrategic tax policy can have a positive effect on economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  For these reasons, we are introducing the Tax Depreciation, \nModernization, and Simplification Act of 2005. This legislation makes \nfour important changes to the current depreciation system.\n  First, the legislation creates a process that provides the Department \nof Treasury with the authority to modernize class lives. The Secretary \nof the Treasury will prescribe regulations to provide a new class life \nfor certain eligible property. Eligible property does not include \nresidential rental property, nonresidential real property, or property \nfor which Congress has specifically legislated the recovery period.\n  The purpose of this provision is to provide Treasury with a mechanism \nto modify class lives that reasonably reflect the anticipated useful \nlife and the anticipated decline in value over time of the property to \nthe industry and take into account when the property becomes \ntechnologically or functionally obsolete to perform its original \npurpose. Treasury will also have the authority to modify class lives in \norder to more accurately reflect economic depreciation. For example, a \npersonal computer has a depreciable life of 5 years, but it has an \neconomic life of only 2 to 3 years. Even though a computer can be used \nfor 5 years, it becomes economically obsolete after a couple of years \nbecause of the newer, faster, and more advanced computers on the \nmarket.\n  Our depreciation system has not been adequately updated since \nCongress revoked Treasury's rule making authority in 1988. When the \nMACRS system was enacted in 1986, Congress directed Treasury to \nestablish an office to monitor and analyze the actual experience with \nclass lives and to modify class lives if the new class life reasonably \nreflected the anticipated useful life and the anticipated decline in \nvalue over time of the property to the industry. The authority was then \nrevoked because Congress did not agree with all of the decisions made \nby Treasury.\n  The authority provided in this legislation addresses this previous \nproblem by requiring Treasury to consult with Congress 60 days prior to \npublishing any proposed regulations. In addition, the Congressional \nReview Act would apply to any regulation proposed by Treasury and each \nclass life prescribed by Treasury would be considered a separate rule.\n  Providing Treasury with the authority to modify class lives would \nallow the process to move more efficiently than allowing Congress to \nmake piecemeal changes to the current depreciation system. Congress \nwould provide guidelines, and Treasury would have the role of \nadministering the guidelines. Under the legislation, Treasury would \nmonitor and analyze the actual experience of depreciable assets and \nreport their findings to Congress. We expect Treasury to establish \nguidelines that will take into consideration the fact that some assets \nlose a significant percentage of their original value in the early part \nof their lives. This legislation specifically provides consultation \nwith Congress in order for Congress to continue to have a role in this \nimportant tax policy issue.\n  We do not expect Treasury within the first year or two to review all \nclasses of assets. Rather, we expect Treasury to begin with new assets \nthat do not fit into the system, assets that have underdone \ntechnological advances, and existing assets that do not really fit into \nthe current system. For example, the current system creates an \nirrational result for fiber optic lines. The class life of a fiber \noptic line depends upon whether if it is used for one-way or two-way \ncommunications.\n  Second, the legislation would eliminate the mid quarter convention. \nThe placed-in-service conventions determine the point in time during \nthe year that the property is considered ``placed in service'' and this \ndetermines when depreciation for an asset begins or ends. Under current \nlaw, there are the half-year, mid month, and mid quarter conventions. \nThe mid quarter convention is a source of complexity because it \nrequires an analysis of the depreciable basis of property placed in \nservice during the last 3 months of any taxable year. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation recommended the elimination of the mid-quarter \nconvention in its 2001 recommendations on simplifying the Federal tax \nsystem. The calculation of the mid-quarter convention is burdensome, \nand it requires taxpayers to wait until after the end of the taxable \nyear to determine whether the proper placed-in-service convention was \nused to calculate depreciation for assets during the taxable year.\n  Third, the legislation would allow taxpayers to elect to use mass \nasset accounting for assets with a cost of less than $10,000. \nGenerally, taxpayers calculate depreciation on an item-by-item basis. \nThe bill would allow taxpayers to elect to use mass asset accounting \nfor all assets with the same recovery period. This provision will help \nsimplify the recordkeeping associated with depreciation.\n  Fourth, the legislation would permanently extend increased expensing \nfor small businesses. In lieu of depreciation, a taxpayer with a small \namount of annual investment may elect to deduct such costs. The Jobs \nand Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 increased the amount a \ntaxpayer may deduct from $25,000 to $100,000 and increased the total \namount of investment a business can make in a year and still qualify \nfor expensing from $200,000 to $400,000. In addition, the Act allows \noff-the-shelf computer software to be eligible for the provision. These \nchanges originally were effective for 3 years. The American Jobs \nCreation Act of 2004 provided an additional 2 year extension of this \nprovision through 2007.\n  The Tax Depreciation, Modernization, and Simplification Act of 2005 \nwould make the $100,000 and $400,000 amounts permanent and index them \nfor inflation. Off-the-shelf computer software would be eligible for \nthe provision. Increased expensing for small businesses helps lower the \ncost of capital for small businesses and eliminates complicated \nrecordkeeping. In addition, it should reduce administrative costs for \nsmall businesses.\n  The provisions in this legislation will not be the only \nrecommendations made on how to improve our current depreciation system, \nbut the four components of this legislation will result in updating and \nsimplifying the current depreciation system. The Tax Depreciation, \nModernization, and Simplification Act of 2005 will provide certainty \nfor taxpayers and put an end to ``audit roulette.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Lieberman (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Carper, and Mrs. Hutchison)):\n  S. 2104. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nthe American Center for Cures to accelerate the development of public \nand private research efforts towards tools and therapies for human \ndiseases with the goal of early disease detection, prevention, and \ncure, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S13578]]\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, Senator Cochran, Senator Carper, \nSenator Hutchison, and I are introducing the American Center for CURES \nAct of 2005, which would establish the American Center for Cures, \nwithin the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The purpose of the \nCenter would be to bring promising and novel diagnostics, therapies, \ndrugs, and tools to treat disease faster to the public.\n  We continue to face significant health challenges. In the US today, \nchronic diseases account for 7 out of 10 deaths, with the major killers \nbeing heart attack, cancer and stroke. Seventy percent of the $1.7 \ntrillion dollars we spend on healthcare each year goes to chronic \ndisease care. Around the world, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria kill 4, \n3, and 2 million people a year. On the horizon are emerging manmade and \nnatural threats such as SARS, flu and bioterrorism. There are other \ndiseases that we need better treatments and cures for, but that we do \nnot devote enough attention to. Diseases of social stigma, such as \ndepression, which is the most frequent reason people visit their \nphysician, and seizure disorder, which is the primary neurological \ndisorder in children, are often neglected. We have bacteria growing and \nspreading in our hospitals that do not respond to our antibiotic \nsupply. These are the health challenges facing us in the 21st century.\n  Fortunately, the United States has no equal in the biomedical \nsciences. This is due in large part to our nation's premier biomedical \nresearch investment the--NIH, which receives $28 billion per year after \na doubling of their budget of $14 billion from 1998 to 2003. The NIH is \ncomprised of 27 major institutes and centers, leading the way for the \nworld in cancer, cardiovascular, infectious disease and allergy \nadvancements for health promotion and relief from the burdens of \ndisease. US biomedical advances are also due to our dynamic \nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors.\n  In our search for answers to our pressing health problems, the NIH \nhas grown in the number of Institutes and Centers and in funding. At \nthe same time, Congress and others have wanted to ensure that we are \nbuilding on NIH's strengths to respond to complex health problems \nrequiring interdisciplinary and collaborative work. Therefore, Congress \ncommissioned the 2003 National Academy of Sciences report, ``Enhancing \nthe Vitality of the National Institutes of Health: Organizational \nChange to Meet New Challenges'', that examined whether and how we could \noptimize the NIH's organizational structure to meet our next set of \nhealth challenges.\n  The report stated that ``no organization as important as NIH should \nremain frozen in organization space''. At the same time, the report \ncautioned that any changes in organizational structure to achieve \ngreater progress in chronic and emerging diseases were not without some \ndifficulty and risk. The NAS report made a number of recommendations \nand our CURES legislation addresses the six major points.\n  First, CURES seeks to strengthen the clinical research process by \nstreamlining the clinical trials process by creating Centralized \nInternal Review Boards (CIRB). CIRB's would focus on simplifying the \nhuman subjects review processes for multi-institutional clinical \ntrials. CURES also significantly augments current NIH investments to \ntrain the clinical research workforce of the future, and provides \nadditional funding for multidisciplinary teams of researchers examining \nissues of quality and design of clinical trials. We need to continue to \nbring safe and effective diagnostics and therapeutics, but more \nefficiently.\n  Secondly, our proposal enhances and increases trans-NIH strategic \nplanning and funding. Currently, the NIH's 27 Centers and Institutes \neach have their own directors and budgets and thus, operate \nindependently. The resulting structural and organizational stovepipes \nare limited in their ability to capitalize on the NIH's collective \nresearch capacity to address complex problems using the expertise of \nmultiple fields. For example, the problem of diabetic retinopathy could \nbe tackled by researchers in the Institutes of the Eye, Diabetes, \nDigestive and Kidney disease, Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, \nand Allergy Immunology and Infectious disease. However, there are few \nmechanisms for such trans-Institute initiatives that could lead to a \ncure or treatment. To address this problem, CURES has created multiple \nfunding mechanisms for trans-Institute research and cross-fertilization \nof ideas. Strategic planning and prioritizing disease research is also \nintegral to achieving progress more quickly. Therefore, the American \nCenter for CURES Act would establish a CURES council, comprised of key \nhealth stakeholders to produce a translational research agenda for the \nCenter based on research breakthroughs and areas of health need.\n  Thirdly, the American Center for CURES Act of 2005 strengthens the \nOffice of the NIH Director. Our legislation emphasizes the need for \ngreater budgetary support and flexibility in the area of translational \nresearch. This follows much of the NIH Director's current efforts with \nthe NIH Roadmap. Our legislation further supports the spirit of the NIH \nRoadmap with organizational and funding commitments that bring \ntranslational research investment to a necessary and appropriate scale, \nwhich has not been the case to date. The NIH Director, with the CURES \nAdvisory Council, would play a key role in these efforts by \nrecommending appointees for the Director of the American Center for \nCURES to the President. The NIH Director will also be a co-chair of the \nCenter's Council and have a leading role in setting the research and \nfunding priorities for translational research projects at the NIH. The \nNIH Director will also head other initiatives outlined in the \nlegislation, such as launching a publicly accessible electronic \ndatabase for all published NIH funded research.\n  Fourth, our legislation creates a Director's Special Projects \nProgram, called the Health Advanced Research Projects Agency (HARPA). \nThe NAS committee recommended the creation of a program to support \nhigh-risk, high-potential payoff research. The Department of Defense \nhas had significant success with its Defense Advanced Research Program \nAgency (DARPA), where a group of expert portfolio managers invest in \nand oversee innovative, multidisciplinary, collaborative projects to \nadvance specific fields or to develop needed technologies. DARPA has \nlead to the creation of stealth technology, satellite surveillance, \nlasers, internet, and e-mail. Based on this model, HARPA would be \nhoused within the Center and would help lead breakthrough advances \nusing a translational ``challenge model'' in biomedical research. \nBreakthroughs could include a vaccine or other treatment against HIV or \ngenetic probes pivotal to the elucidation of disease producing genes. \nHARPA would also be the key funding mechanism for trans-Institute \nresearch to prioritize and foster collaborative and trans-Institute \nresearch initiatives.\n\n  Fifth, the NAS report recommended that the NIH intramural research \nprogram be more unique, innovative, and risk-taking. In response, CURES \ncreates an Office of Intramural Risk Mapping, within the Office of \nTechnology Transfer, which will oversee NIH's intramural research \nprograms to help assure they are complementary to extramural and \nprivate sector research. The Office will also ensure that intramural \nresearch is also innovative and risk-taking to produce more novel and \npromising biomedical breakthroughs. The office will also make funds \navailable to trans-Institute and center initiatives that focus on \nhealth risk analysis and corresponding scientific risk opportunity.\n  Sixth, our legislation addresses the NAS report recommendation to \nstandardize data and information management systems. The report was \nclear that the NIH must increase its capacity for data gathering and \nreporting to meet its obligations ``. . . for effective management, \naccountability, and transparency.'' Cures seek to improve the sharing \nof information by providing funding to the National Library of Medicine \nto create and maintain a publicly accessible database of all \npublications resulting from NIH-funded research and by establishing a \nnational electronic registry and results database to increase \nenrollment in public and private clinical trials and to share\n\n[[Page S13579]]\n\nefficacy and safety outcomes emanating from NIH-funded clinical \nresearch endeavors. Cures focuses on the need to expand the NLM \nfacilities according to the demands of new scientific discoveries and \nfields, especially within the areas of genomics and proteinomics.\n  In addition to the NAS report recommendations, other changes in the \nbiomedical research landscape demand more targeted investments in \npromising and novel treatments. Our current response to research on \nimportant health problems is arguably dichotomous. We invest public \nmoney into the NIH or we hope the private market will produce essential \ndrugs and tools. However, there needs to be greater collaboration \nbetween the private and public sectors. Private sector investment in \nbiomedical research has grown to approximately $46 billion per year--\nfar more than our public sector investment in NIH. For new and \neffective therapies to become available, we need to build better public \nand private partnerships. Cures includes key provisions to accomplish \nthis. Cures promotes the innovative efforts of small to medium sized \nbiotechnology and bioengineering firms who require additional support \nin key traditionally under-funded stages of product development--the so \ncalled R ``Valley of Death.'' It expands the NIH's current small \nbusiness support and rapid access to interventional development \nprograms to move basic science through the product development pipeline \nfaster. These programs would facilitate NIH partnerships with private \nindustry in the preclinical stage of the R process so as to formulate \na plan for health research translation and commercialization from the \noutset. Additionally, our legislation would move the NIH's Office of \nTechnology Transfer into the American Center for Cures, where it would \nsurvey research being conducted in the private and public sectors to \navoid duplication, target promising research investments, and broker \nmore flexible and productive agreements for licensing and patents \nbetween the public and private sectors. The HARPA entity within the \ncenter is also designed to promote public-private joint R efforts.\n  Today, we are proposing the establishment of the American Center for \nCures, whose mission would be to promote more rapid translation of \npublic and private research into therapies, diagnostics and tools, \nwhich can effectively treat and possibly cure diseases of critical \nimportance to domestic and global health. With more targeted investment \nin translating our basic science research into diagnostics and \ntherapeutics, we hope to bring more tangible health benefits to \nAmericans and people all over the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that explanatory materials on the legislation \nincluding, ``Short Summary of the American Center for CURES Act of \n2005,'' ``Explanation of How the American Center for CURES Act of 2005 \nAddresses the Findings of the 2003 National Academy of Sciences Report: \n`Enhancing the Vitality of the National Institutes of Health: \nOrganizational Change to Meet New Challenges','' ``Section by Section \nSummary of the American Center for CURES Act of 2005,'' the full text \nof the legislation, and ``Quotes in Support of the American Center for \nCURES Act of 2005'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      A Short Summary of the American Center for CURES Act of 2005\n\n       A bill to facilitate more rapid development of novel \n     diagnostics, therapies, and cures\n       From 1998-2003, Congress doubled funding to the world's \n     leader in biomedical research, the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH), to $28 billion per year. In order to meet 21st \n     century health challenges and optimize the use of this public \n     investment, Senators Lieberman and Cochran have introduced \n     legislation to increase the capacity of the NIH to produce \n     effective treatments, diagnostics and cures for our nation's \n     most burdensome diseases using a novel approach to publicly \n     funded research.\n       Cures will do the following:\n       Create an American Center for Cures (ACC) in the NIH to \n     orchestrate focused research and development of solutions to \n     pressing ailments. The ACC, led by a Center Director, will \n     identify and promote translational research, which involves \n     developing basic science research for application purposes, \n     in the public and private sectors. The ACC will fund \n     innovative and collaborative research, breakdown bottlenecks \n     in clinical research, and facilitate information exchange.\n       Establish an advisory council comprised of key health \n     experts and stakeholders to advise the ACC on national \n     medical needs and novel developments in all sectors. To use \n     public funds effectively, a centralized mechanism to track \n     research on health threats is necessary. A Council will \n     inform the ACC on biomedical needs, technical feasibility \n     issues, and current research breakthroughs.\n       Create a Health Advanced Projects Agency for research \n     promotion. A research projects agency will promote strategic \n     risk-taking and follow a ``challenge model'' to support \n     innovative multidisciplinary research between NIH Institutes, \n     other federal agencies, grantees and business partners, for \n     projects with the potential for significant health impact. \n     Funding for projects will be flexible and outcomes based.\n       Promote the innovative efforts of small to medium sized \n     biotechnology and bioengineering firms. The ACC will support \n     firms requiring assistance in key traditionally underfunded \n     stages of research and development, the R ``Valley of \n     Death''. Funding will be available to assist companies with \n     promising and novel therapeutics and diagnostics in both \n     preclinical and clinical stages.\n       Strengthen the clinical research process. Clinical trials \n     are essential to ensuring the safety and efficacy of new \n     products. The ACC will streamline clinical trial protocols to \n     supply the public with new treatments in a timelier, more \n     efficient, and more economical way. It will augment NIH \n     training funds to create a clinical research workforce of the \n     future. It will establish a clinical trial registry and \n     results database to promote information sharing and to avoid \n     duplicative efforts.\n       Facilitate complete and efficient transfer of intellectual \n     property from development at the molecular level to clinical \n     trials and into production. Active participation of the \n     commercial sector in development is critical. An Office of \n     Technology Transfer in the ACC will catalog and disseminate \n     the NIH translational research portfolio and oversee NIH \n     intellectual property licensing.\n                                  ____\n\n\nExplanation of How the American Center for CURES Act of 2005 Addresses \n     the Findings of the 2003 National Academy of Sciences Report: \n    ``Enhancing the Vitality of the National Institutes of Health: \n             Organizational Change to Meet New Challenges''\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The health challenges facing the U.S. and the world today \n     are a mix of infectious diseases, such as HIV, tuberculosis \n     and malaria, long-standing chronic such as diabetes and \n     cancer, and new emerging threats, such as SARS and avian \n     influenza. In the context of these growing concerns, Congress \n     commissioned the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 2001 \n     to report on ``whether the current structure and organization \n     of NIH are optimally configured for the scientific needs of \n     the 21st century.'' Indeed, NIH is America's premier public \n     research investment and between 1998 and 2003, the NIH budget \n     of $14 billion dollars doubled to $28 billion. By \n     commissioning the NAS report, Congress asked how it might \n     optimize its burgeoning research investment. Congress \n     solidified its support for the NIH but simultaneously posed \n     questions of NIH can best address domestic and global health \n     needs:\n       Are the 27 NIH Institutes and Centers able to coordinate \n     their research goals and priorities to reflect the \n     multidisciplinary nature of today's health problems?\n       How is the NIH producing and sharing biomedical knowledge \n     from multiple disciplines to spur the development of clinical \n     tools, drugs, and other therapies to battle longstanding and \n     emerging diseases?\n       Can the NIH respond effectively to acute health threats, \n     such as to burgeoning HIV infection rates and the threat of a \n     bioterrorism attack?\n       Is the NIH cultivating the next generation of researchers \n     to build upon the great works of NIH past?\n       The end result was the 2003 NAS and Institute of Medicine \n     (IOM) report, ``Enhancing the Vitality of the National \n     Institutes of Health: Organizational Change to Meet New \n     Challenges''. The report reinforced NIH successes over the \n     last 50 years as the national and global leader in biomedical \n     research. NIH accomplished this by developing a cutting edge \n     internal research infrastructure and a democratic extramural \n     grant program that almost single-handedly supports \n     University-based research in the biological sciences. \n     However, the report also cautioned that ``no organization as \n     important as NIH should remain frozen in organizational \n     space'' and any changes in organizational structure to \n     achieve greater progress in chronic and emerging diseases, \n     however essential, would face difficulty and risk.\n\n\n                          NAS Report Findings\n\n       The NAS report made a total of 14 recommendations. In the \n     final analysis, the NAS report recommended maintaining the \n     general structure of NIH to ensure NIH's strengths would be \n     protected: conducting essential basic science, and disease, \n     behavioral, organ, and system based research in its \n     intramural program and funding peer-reviewed grants to \n     University researches in its extramural program. However, the \n     report also recognized the need for organizational changes \n     which could help institutes work across their respective \n     stovepipes, foster a culture of risk-taking and innovation, \n     and\n\n[[Page S13580]]\n\n     give the NIH director, other leadership, and the public the \n     power to prioritize NIH research to solve the Nation's most \n     burdensome health problems. Collectively, these changes would \n     enhance the capacity of the NIH to not only pursue \n     fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living \n     systems, but to apply that knowledge to extend healthy life \n     and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. This is \n     NIH's mission.\n\n\n     CURES Addresses the Six Key Recommendations of the NAS Report\n\n       1. Strengthen Clinical Research: The NAS report recommended \n     that the NIH ``pursue a new organizational strategy to better \n     integrate leadership, funding, and management of its clinical \n     research enterprise''. Senators Lieberman, Cochran, Carper, \n     and Hutchison are introducing a proposal that creates the \n     American Center for Cures (ACC), headed by a Cures Director. \n     One of the new Director's key charges will be to promote and \n     simplify the clinical research endeavor. The Director will \n     establish a national electronic registry and results database \n     for clinical trials in order to increase enrollment of \n     research subjects and improve sharing efficacy and safety \n     outcomes emanating from the clinical research endeavor. The \n     Director will fund multidisciplinary clinical research teams \n     in the academic and private sector, create Centralized \n     Internal Review Boards (CIRB) to simplify the human subjects \n     review processes for multi-institutional clinical trials, and \n     augment NIH investments in training the clinical research \n     workforce of the future.\n       2. Enhance and Increase Trans-NIH Strategic Planning and \n     Funding: The 27 NIH Centers and Institutes with their own \n     directors and budgets generally operate independently. The \n     resulting structural and organizational stovepipes are \n     limited in their ability to capitalize on the NIH's \n     collective research capacity to address complex problems from \n     different fields. For example, the problem of diabetic \n     retinopathy could be tackled by researchers in the Institutes \n     of the Eye, Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney disease, \n     Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, and Allergy Immunology \n     and Infectious disease. To address this problem, Cures funds \n     innovative multidisciplinary collaborative research across \n     NIH institutes and centers. NIH Institute and Center \n     Directors on the Cures Council will be entrusted to \n     coordinate the intramural research agenda with that of the \n     ACC.\n       3. Strengthen the Office of the NIH Director: The NAS \n     report emphasizes the need for the NIH Director to have more \n     budgetary support and flexibility. Dr. Zerhouni's office has \n     taken these steps with the NIH Roadmap. The Cures legislation \n     further supports the spirit of the NIH Roadmap with \n     organizational and funding commitments that bring the \n     translational research investment to necessary and \n     appropriate scale. The NIH Director and the Cures Advisory \n     Council will recommend appointees for the Cures Director to \n     the President. The NIH Director will be a co-chair of the ACC \n     Council that will set the research and funding priorities for \n     translational research projects at the NIH. The NIH Director \n     will head efforts to establish a publicly accessible \n     electronic database for all published NIH funded research, \n     among other initiatives.\n       4. Create a Director's Special Projects Program: The NAS \n     committee recommended the creation of a program to support \n     high-risk, high-potential payoff research. The Department of \n     Defense has had significant success with its Defense Advanced \n     Research Program Agency (DARPA), where a group of expert \n     portfolio managers invest in and oversee innovative, \n     multidisciplinary, collaborative projects to advance specific \n     fields or to develop needed technologies. DARPA has lead to \n     the creation of the stealth technology, satellite \n     surveillance, lasers, internet, and email. A Health Advanced \n     Research Program Agency (HARPA) will be established within \n     the ACC to help lead breakthrough advances, using a \n     translational ``challenge'' model in biomedical research, \n     such as a vaccine against HIV or genetic probes pivotal to \n     the elucidation of disease producing genes.\n       5. Promote Innovation and Risk-Taking in Intramural \n     Research: The NAS report recommended that the NIH intramural \n     research portfolio be distinct from that of the extramural \n     program and private sector. Cures creates an Office of \n     Intramural Risk Mapping which will oversee the intramural \n     research programs of the NIH to be certain they are \n     complementary to extramural and private programs. The office \n     will make funds available to groups of institutes and centers \n     to promote engagement in multi-institute projects that focus \n     on health risk analysis and corresponding scientific risk \n     opportunity.\n       6. Standardize Data and Information Management Systems: The \n     NAS committee recommended that the NIH must increase its \n     capacity for data gathering and reporting to meet its \n     obligations ``. . . for effective management, accountability, \n     and transparency''. Cures seeks to improve the sharing of \n     information by providing funding to the National Library of \n     Medicine to create and maintain a publicly accessible \n     database of all publications resulting from NIH-funded \n     research and by establishing a national electronic registry \n     and results database to increase enrollment in public and \n     private clinical trials and to share efficacy and safety \n     outcomes emanating from the clinical research endeavor. Cures \n     focuses on the need to grow the NLM facilities according to \n     the demands of new scientific discoveries and fields, \n     especially within the areas of genomics and proteinomics.\n\n\n                     CURES Build on the NIH Roadmap\n\n       In response to the NAS report, NIH Director Dr. Elias \n     Zerhouni launched the NIH Roadmap in FY 2004 with $128 \n     million in funding from existing NIH budget allocations. \n     Funding increases every year until FY 2009 and tops out at \n     $507 million. The NIH Roadmap consists of:\n       New Pathways to Discovery to obtain a deeper understanding \n     of biological systems based on new models.\n       Research Teams of the Future to facilitate collaboration \n     across institutes by awarding grants to support institutional \n     partnerships and cutting-edge research.\n       Re-engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise reforms the \n     clinical trial process to allow for broader participation \n     from community-level patients and providers.\n       While the NIH roadmap addresses some of the concerns of the \n     NAS report, it does not address key provisions including \n     increasing the power of the NIH Director, establishing an \n     advanced research projects agency, and establishing a new \n     leadership that can facilitate the research essential to \n     moving products faster from bench to bedside. Unlike CURES, \n     the roadmap relies on traditional academic-government \n     relationships. CURES builds on the Roadmap to cultivate new \n     relationships between NIH researchers and innovative \n     industrial partners. Unlike the roadmap, which asks the NIH \n     to focus on new priorities with old tools and funds, Cures \n     provides much higher levels of funding for a Center uniquely \n     devoted to translating research to produce new therapies and \n     even cures to the most important diseases.\n                                  ____\n\n\nSection by Section Summary of the American Center for CURES Act of 2005\n\n   A bill to facilitate more rapid development of novel diagnostics, \n       therapies and cures critical to national and global health\n\n     Background\n       When it comes to investments and advancements in biomedical \n     research, the United States has no equal. Its National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) is the world's largest public \n     source of biomedical research funding with an annual budget \n     of over $28 billion. The NIH is comprised of 27 major \n     institutes and centers, leading the way in cancer, \n     cardiovascular, infectious disease and allergy advancements \n     for health promotion and relief from the burdens of disease.\n       The private sector is also investing substantial resources \n     in increasing both longevity and quality of life. These \n     companies now invest more than the federal government in \n     biomedical research and development (R). Potent \n     pharmaceuticals and cutting edge medical devices provide \n     health care professionals with a therapeutic arsenal that has \n     increased lifespan seven years since 1960 and dropped \n     neonatal mortality four fold. Partnerships between NIH and \n     private industry are not often recognized for their key roles \n     in bringing new treatments to the public, but are of great \n     importance as they have led to life-changing therapies from \n     to Taxol to Claritin to HIV anti-retrovirals.\n       But how can biomedical R proceed even faster? How can \n     partnerships between NIH's Institutes and Centers, disease-\n     based NGO's, biotech companies and small and large \n     pharmaceuticals occur even more frequently? Towards which \n     diseases should our resources be prioritized in the first \n     place? How can NIH and the private sector be more responsive \n     to emerging public health threats such as bioterrorism, an \n     avian flu pandemic, antibiotic resistance, and a waning \n     vaccine supply?\n     Center for Cures\n       In response to these pressing questions and the capacity of \n     the NIH to address our health needs, Senators Lieberman, \n     Cochran, Carper and Hutchison are proposing a $5 billion \n     dollar annual investment to create the American Center for \n     Cures (ACC). The mission of this new NIH Center will be to \n     promote more rapid translation of public and private research \n     into therapies, diagnostics and tools, which can effectively \n     treat and possibly cure diseases of critical importance to \n     domestic and global health. The ACC will enhance NIH's \n     ability to not only pursue fundamental knowledge about the \n     nature and behavior of living systems, but to apply that \n     knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of \n     illness and disability. This is NIH's mission.\n     Specifically, the American Center for Cures will:\n       (1) Direct new resources towards the world's most \n     burdensome diseases and towards biomedical, bioengineering, \n     and biotechnological research with the greatest therapeutic \n     impact and promise.\n       (2) Create an ACC national advisory board consisting of key \n     health experts and stakeholders, who will help identify the \n     critical diseases and health threats requiring greater public \n     and private investment.\n       (3) Create a special Health Advanced Research Projects \n     Agency (HARPA) to support innovative multidisciplinary \n     collaborate research between NIH Institutes, between NIH and \n     other federal agencies and between NIH grantees and business \n     partners, for projects with the potential for significant \n     health impact.\n       (4) Create health-centered Federally Funded Research and \n     Development Centers (FFRDC) which will bring together \n     interdisciplinary teams of experts including scientists, \n     clinicians, epidemiologists, and\n\n[[Page S13581]]\n\n     pharmacists for a time limited period to focus on developing \n     therapeutic breakthroughs for important disease entities.\n       (5) Invest further in the development of an expert \n     workforce which will augment the nation's translational \n     research capacity. Such an effort will include training new \n     clinical researchers and bioinformatics professionals.\n       (6) Promote risk-taking and collaboration between NIH \n     Institutes and Centers.\n       (7) Streamline the clinical research process essential to \n     determining if new treatments are effective and safe.\n       (8) Promote the innovative efforts of small to medium sized \n     biotechnology and bioengineering firms who require additional \n     support in key traditionally under-funded stages of product \n     development--the so called R ``Valley of Death''.\n       (9) Facilitate NIH partnerships with private industry in \n     the preclinical stage of the R process so as to formulate a \n     plan for health research translation and commercialization \n     from the outset.\n       (10) Standardize NIH information management systems and \n     reporting requirements of publicly funded research to improve \n     information sharing between the applied science, \n     translational research and business communities.\n     A section by section summary of the legislation is included \n     below.\n       Section 1: Short title.\n       Section 2: Table of contents.\n       Section 3: Findings.\n       Section 4: Amends Title IV of the Public Health Services \n     Act to establish a new Center at the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH) called the American Center for Cures (ACC).\n\n\n                   Part J--American Center for Cures\n\n       Section 499A: Definitions.\n       Section 499B(a): States the mission of the proposed \n     American Center for Cures (ACC), which is to increase the \n     capacity of the NIH to promote translational research between \n     its Institutes and Centers, between the NIH and other Federal \n     agencies and between NIH grantees and business partners so as \n     to speed the development of effective diagnostics, therapies \n     and cures essential to human health and well being.\n       The ACC shall formulate and implement a strategy for the \n     nation's translational research investment based on (1) a \n     prioritization of biomedical research based on disease burden \n     and research promise, and (2) funding for innovative, multi-\n     disciplinary, and collaborative research.\n       The ACC will be guided in part by a series of ``Grand \n     Challenges'' or strategic challenges that direct the health \n     research community towards multi-staged projects with the \n     potential to transform the healthcare landscape. Examples \n     include: the creation of laboratory diagnostics that enable \n     the country to detect quickly and accurately to acute health \n     threats, such as an avian flu pandemic or a bioterrorism \n     attack; a commitment by researchers and manufacturers from \n     public and private sectors to develop vaccines for the \n     world's most deadly infectious diseases including HIV, \n     tuberculosis, and malaria. Other examples are provided in \n     this section.\n       Section 499B(b): Establishes a Director of Cures (to be \n     called in this document the ``Director'') who will administer \n     the ACC. The President of the United States will appoint the \n     Director. The NIH Director in consultation with the Cures \n     Advisory Council (Section 499B(c)) will recommend candidates \n     for the Director to the President. The NIH Director will work \n     with the Director to promote the nation's translational \n     research efforts.\n       The Director will have at his disposal an annual \n     acceleration fund of $5 billion dollars to provide support \n     for research and development of breakthrough biomedical \n     discoveries and to carry out the purposes of the ACC. No less \n     than one half of the acceleration fund will be allocated to a \n     Health Advanced Research Projects Agency described in Subpart \n     II.\n       Section 499B(c): Establishes a Cures Council to advise and \n     direct the translational research efforts of the ACC. The \n     Council will be co-chaired by the Director of Cures and the \n     Director of NIH. Membership will include NIH Institute and \n     Center Directors; leaders from at least 9 federal agencies \n     including the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research \n     and Quality (AHRQ), the Director of the Defense Advanced \n     Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the President of the \n     Institute of Medicine (IOM); no fewer than three leaders from \n     the small business community; three leaders from large \n     pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies; and three leaders \n     from academia. All Council members will be appointed by the \n     President.\n       The Council shall establish subcommittees including one of \n     NIH Institute and Center Directors to coordinate research \n     priorities in, and ensure sharing of research agendas among, \n     the Institutes and Centers. The subcommittee shall also \n     coordinate the ACC research agenda with that of the NIH \n     Institutes and Centers.\n       The Council will make recommendations that help the \n     Director set research priorities for the ACC. The Council \n     shall consider risk and burden of disease as well as lines of \n     research uniquely poised to deliver effective diagnostics and \n     therapies.\n       The Council shall be aided by the Office of Intramural Risk \n     Opportunity and Mapping of the Office of Technology Transfer \n     established in subpart V.\n       The Council shall conduct an annual assessment of ACC \n     priorities and progress and make this available to the public \n     in written and electronic forms.\n       Section 499B(d): The Director of Cures shall prepare and \n     submit, directly to the President for review and transmittal \n     to Congress, an annual budget estimate for the Center.\n       The Director will receive directly all funds appropriated \n     by Congress for obligation and expenditure by the Center.\n\n\n      Subpart 1--Federally Funded Research and Development Centers\n\n       Section 499C: Federally Funded Research and Development \n     Centers (FFRDC's) will serve as sites for multidisciplinary \n     and cross-scientific research within particular areas of \n     health. The Director may establish one or more FFRDC's to \n     carry out activities related to the mission of the ACC. These \n     Centers will establish, as appropriate, technology test beds \n     and incubators, utilize cooperative agreements with the \n     private sector, and conduct large-scale multi-disciplinary \n     translational research projects in health or disease areas \n     which are essential to medical advancement, but lack adequate \n     private sector funding.\n       The FFRDC's shall consult widely with representatives from \n     private industry, institutions of higher education, nonprofit \n     institutions, other federal governmental agencies, and other \n     federally funded research and development centers.\n       The Director shall ensure that competitive mechanisms are \n     used to select and to promote the ongoing quality and \n     performance of the FFRDC's.\n       Contracts between the ACC and FFRDC's shall be for no \n     longer than 7 years, after which time refunding shall be \n     contingent upon approval by the Director and the Cures \n     Council.\n       Each FFRDC shall biannually submit a report on the \n     activities carried out by the Centers under this section to \n     the Director and the appropriate committees of Congress.\n       For any fiscal year, the Director may use not more than 25 \n     percent of the funds available in the Director's Acceleration \n     Fund for FFRDC's.\n\n\n          Subpart 2--Health Advanced Research Projects Agency\n\n       Section 499d. Technological and scientific innovations \n     often require strategic risk taking and significant funding \n     streams that are rapid and are outcomes based. Funds must \n     also encourage expert multidisciplinary collaboration. This \n     section establishes at the ACC a Health Advanced Research \n     Projects Agency (HARPA) for these purposes.\n       HARPA will be headed by a Director of the Research Projects \n     Agency who will be appointed by the Director of Cures.\n       HARPA shall be composed of not more than 100 expert \n     portfolio managers in key health areas, as determined by the \n     Director of HARPA in conjunction with the Director and Cures \n     Council.\n       HARPA shall undertake the grand challenges formulated by \n     the Center and encourage innovative, multidisciplinary, and \n     collaborative research between NIH Institutes and Centers, \n     between the NIH and other Federal agencies, and between NIH \n     grantees and business partners.\n       Management and organizing principles include an agency \n     which is small, flexible, entrepreneurial, and non-\n     hierarchical; which empowers portfolio managers to foster \n     research opportunities free from bureaucratic impediments; \n     which seeks to employ the strongest scientific and technical \n     talent in the Nation; which rotates a significant portion of \n     the staff every 3-5 years, which leverages comparable \n     matching investment from other NIH institutes and centers, \n     federal agencies, and from the private and non profit \n     sectors; which creates a translational research model that \n     supports fundamental research breakthroughs, early and late \n     stage applied development, prototyping, knowledge diffusion, \n     and technology deployment; which establishes metrics to \n     evaluate research success; which ensures that revolutionary \n     research dominates HARPA's agenda and portfolio. Other \n     management and organizing principles are provided.\n       HARPA activities will include supporting basic and applied \n     research to promote revolutionary technology changes which \n     address health needs. It will advance the development, \n     testing, evaluation, prototyping and deployment of critical \n     health products. Multiple other activities are provided.\n       HARPA will have flexible hiring practices as described in \n     the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act, 1999.\n       HARPA will have the authority to flexibly fund projects, \n     including the prompt awarding, releasing, enhancing and \n     withdrawal of monies.\n       HARPA will be funded through the Director's acceleration \n     fund at a minimum of $2.5 billion dollars annually.\n\n\n                       Subpart 3--Clinical Trials\n\n       Clinical trials are an essential part of the research and \n     development process. This is where the effectiveness and \n     safety of products are scientifically and systematically \n     investigated. However, clinical trials are complex, \n     expensive, and time-consuming, making it difficult for \n     individuals to perform all the functions necessary to \n     successfully organize and implement clinical trials. This \n     subpart improves how clinical trials are conducted and how \n     their results are disseminated. It also promotes the \n     development of a future clinical research workforce.\n       Section 499E. Increasing Research Study Participation: The \n     Director of NIH shall create a national electronic clinical \n     trial registry with the National Library of Medicine\n\n[[Page S13582]]\n\n     (NLM) as specified in Subpart 6, Section 499H (b). The ACC \n     shall publicize the registry with special attention given to \n     minority groups, who are frequently underrepresented in \n     clinical trials.\n       Section 499E-1. Grants for Quality Clinical Trial and \n     Execution: The Director shall provide grants for clinical \n     trial design and execution to academic centers or to private \n     firms with highly promising therapeutic entities to fund \n     multidisciplinary clinical research teams, whose members may \n     include project managers, clinicians, epidemiologists, and \n     nursing staff.\n       Section 499E-2. Streamlining the Regulatory Process \n     Governing Clinical Research: This section streamlines the \n     regulatory process governing clinical research, which has \n     become increasingly unwieldy due to necessary but complex \n     patient privacy and safety rules. The ACC shall establish a \n     series of Centralized Institutional Review Boards (CIRB) to \n     ensure human subject safety and well-being for multi-\n     institutional clinical trials. CIRB's shall be established in \n     accordance with professional best practices and Good Clinical \n     Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n       A CIRB shall be housed at the Institute or Center with \n     expertise on the subject of the clinical trial or outside of \n     the NIH in a public or private institution with comparable \n     expertise and organizational capacity.\n       CIRB's will be available at the request of public or \n     private institutions and funded through user fees or Center \n     funds.\n       The CIRB shall act on behalf, in whole or in part, of the \n     bodies ordinarily responsible for the safety of research \n     subjects in a locality, on a contractual basis.\n       The CIRB will review and package research applications for \n     facilitated electronic review by local IRB's participating in \n     multi-center clinical trials. Local IRB review can be \n     performed by a subcommittee that is empowered to make \n     decisions in a timely manner. Local IRB's can either accept \n     or reject the CIRB review.\n       Local IRB's which are part of the CIRB network shall be \n     responsible for taking into consideration local \n     characteristics such as educational level of research \n     subjects to assure sound selection of research subjects and \n     to minimize risks to vulnerable populations.\n       Each CIRB shall regularly communicate important information \n     electronically to the local institutional review boards.\n       Section 499E-3. Training Clinical Researchers of the \n     Future: The ACC will augment NIH's investment into programs \n     developing the nation's clinical research workforce. These \n     programs include: the NIH's Mentored Patient-oriented \n     Research Career Development Award, NIH grants to help \n     institutions develop curricula for clinical researchers, and \n     NIH grants to fund participants in clinical science programs, \n     which shall include but not be limited to clinical science \n     certificates or clinical science Masters' Degrees.\n       Section 499E-4. Clinical Research Study and Clinical Trial: \n     The Director shall commission the Institute of Medicine (IOM) \n     to study the regulations protecting patient safety and \n     anonymity so that in a contemporary clinical research \n     context, a more realistic balance can be achieved between \n     clinical research promotion and regulatory requirements \n     governing research subject safety and privacy. The IOM will \n     issue a written report within eighteen months of the passage \n     of the Cures act which shall consider changes to the current \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) \n     to further promote the clinical research endeavor.\n       Section 499E-5. Authorization of Appropriations from the \n     Directors Acceleration Fund. $100 million dollars for \n     Sections 499E-1(1), $50 million dollars for Section 499E-2, \n     $200 million dollars for Section 499E-3, $2.5 million dollars \n     for Section 499E-4.\n\n\n                       Subpart 4--Valley of Death\n\n       Small businesses are major drivers of innovation. Facile, \n     motivated, numerous, and creative, these small businesses can \n     extend the limits of R in a way large companies with secure \n     product lines are unable to do. However, small businesses \n     often encounter difficulty securing capital in the so called, \n     ``Valley of Death''--the period between a research idea with \n     possible application to the time the safety and efficacy of a \n     product is demonstrated in human clinical trials. Common end-\n     pathways within the Valley of Death include development of \n     pharmacological assays, scale-up of production from lab-scale \n     to clinical-trials scale, development of suitable \n     formulations, evaluation of chemical stability, evaluation of \n     materials testing for durability or reactivity, undertaking \n     initial toxicology studies, and planning and implementation \n     of clinical trials.\n       Section 499F. Small Business Partnerships: The Small \n     Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business \n     Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are effective major \n     investments in promoting the R portfolios of small \n     businesses. SBIR and STTR receive 2.5% and 0.3% of the \n     budgets, respectively, of federal agencies with R budgets \n     greater than $100 million dollars. SBIR/STTR grants and \n     contracts consist of three phases. Phase I plans for product \n     development and procurement. Phase II addresses \n     implementation of the plan. Phase III involves \n     commercialization yet by law is ineligible for SBIR/STTR \n     funding. Management and orientation of SBIR/STTR programs at \n     the NIH can be improved.\n       This section moves the NIH's SBIR and STTR programs from \n     the Extramural Research Office to the new Office of \n     Bioscientific Enterprise Development (OBED) in the ACC Office \n     of Technology Transfer (OTT).\n       The NIH currently awards its SBIR and STTR grants and \n     contracts through a peer review process. Now, not less than \n     35% of SBIR and STTR grants and contracts shall be rewarded \n     on a competitive basis by an OBED program manager with \n     significant managerial, technical, and translational research \n     experience to expertly assess the quality of a SBIR or STTR \n     proposal.\n       Program managers will place special emphasis on partnering \n     grantees with potential purchasers or investors of technology \n     from the start of the research and development process with \n     potential purchasers or investors including federal agencies \n     such as the NIH.\n       ACC shall reduce the time between Phase I and Phase II \n     funding to 6 months or less. Currently, grantees can wait up \n     to 5 years to learn whether or not they are a recipient of a \n     phase II grant.\n       An SBIR/STTR project manager may petition the OTT for Phase \n     III funding from the Director's acceleration fund for \n     projects requiring a supplementary funds to finalize product \n     commercialization. The maximum funding for Phase III funding \n     of a project shall be $2,000,000 for a maximum of 2 years.\n       All recipients of SBIR/STTR funding are required to report \n     to the OTT whether there was eventual commercial success of \n     the product. OTT shall keep a publicly accessible electronic \n     record of all SBIR/STTR investments in research and \n     development. The record shall include at minimum the \n     following information: the grantee, a description of the \n     funded research, the amount of money awarded in each phase of \n     SBIR/STTR research, and if applicable, the nature of the \n     products developed.\n       For each fiscal year, the two grants program managers who \n     have had the greatest success in helping to commercialize \n     products may be awarded a bonus up to $10,000.\n       Section 499F-1. Rapid Access to Intervention Development: \n     The National Cancer Institute of the NIH has a successful \n     translational research program called RAID (Rapid Access to \n     Interventional Development). RAID lends essential expertise \n     and resources including access to laboratories and facilities \n     to researchers outside of the NIH. OTT shall expand upon this \n     program and establish other RAID programs, designed to \n     accelerate the process of bringing promising and novel \n     discoveries from the laboratory to the pre-clinical trial \n     stage.\n       RAID awardees have traditionally been selected to receive \n     access to laboratories, facilities and other NIH supports for \n     the pre-clinical development of drugs, biologics, diagnostics \n     and devices, using the peer review process. Now, not less \n     than 35% of RAID awards shall be awarded on a competitive \n     basis by a program manager with significant managerial, \n     technical, and translational research experience to \n     adequately assess the quality of a project proposal.\n       Eligible awardees include university researchers, non-\n     profit research organizations, and firms of less than 100 \n     employees in collaboration with one or more university or \n     non-profit organizations.\n       The Office may discontinue support at any point when the \n     entity fails to meet commercialization success criteria \n     established by the Office.\n       Examples of RAID support are given. These include advice \n     regarding the investigational new drug or investigational new \n     device filing with the Food and Drug Administration.\n       The Office shall not support products past proof-of-\n     principle clinical trials.\n       Section 499F-2. Toxicity Studies: Toxicity studies are \n     essential to the development of any drug therapy, but are \n     difficult to stage. The Center for Cures shall support \n     ongoing research into the most efficient methods of screening \n     for human toxicity, including using cell-based and animal \n     model technologies.\n       OTT may offer support for toxicity studies to private \n     companies licensing NIH intellectual property.\n       Section 499F-3. Additional funding sources and models: The \n     Director of the Center for Cures may provide acceleration \n     funds for flexible contracts for translational research \n     development to entities that license intellectual property \n     from NIH where such contracts support innovation and \n     commercialization.\n       Section 499F-4. Authorization of Appropriations from the \n     Directors Acceleration Fund. $400 million dollars for \n     Sections 499F for $100 million dollars for 499F-1.\n\n\n                Subpart 5--Office of Technology Transfer\n\n       The Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) should be one of \n     the NIH's most active entities. It is within the process of \n     technology transfer where basic science research informs \n     applications to health and where ideas are brought from bench \n     to bedside and back to the bench. The OTT should be a library \n     of innovation administered by experts who have experience in \n     linking the translational research community with industry. \n     This subpart improves upon the current research translation \n     authorities of NIH's OTT.\n       Section 499G. Restructuring: The NIH Office of Technology \n     Transfer in the NIH Director's Office shall be transferred to \n     a new OTT Office in the American Center for Cures.\n       Section 499G-1. Marketing Function: The OTT office shall \n     create a program for transfer management & support that \n     cultivates industry interest in NIH funded research, reaches \n     out to potential industry partners, coordinates patents from \n     different NIH Institutes and Centers, and manages Cooperative \n     Research and Development Agreements (CRADA's), biological \n     licensing agreements,\n\n[[Page S13583]]\n\n     material transfer agreements, and intellectual property \n     licensing.\n       To promote government-industry partnerships, the OTT shall \n     create an electronic database within the National Library of \n     Medicine that tabulates translational research efforts \n     occurring at the NIH. The OTT shall hold an annual \n     translational research conference the bring together public \n     and private stakeholders.\n       The OTT shall develop a program for transfer management & \n     support which will be familiar with the NIH's intramural and \n     extramural research portfolio as well as with the interests \n     of small and large biotech and pharmaceutical industries. For \n     those Institutes or Centers with their own OTT offices, the \n     new OTT program for transfer management & support will work \n     closely with those offices to coordinate industry outreach \n     efforts.\n       As appropriate, OTT shall register CRADA's within a \n     publicly accessible electronic database maintained by NLM.\n       Section 499G-2. Office of Intramural Risk Opportunity and \n     Mapping: An Office of Intramural Risk Mapping within OTT \n     shall oversee the intramural research programs of the NIH to \n     be certain they are complementary, non-duplicative, and \n     distinct from extramural and private programs.\n       The Office shall identify and map health risks and \n     scientific opportunities and update the data on these topics \n     as necessary to ensure they are current. This information is \n     to be provided to the Cures Council on a biannual basis to \n     help them prioritize the nation's translational research \n     investment.\n       The Office shall make funds available to groups of NIH \n     Institutes and Centers to promote multidisciplinary projects \n     that focus on health risk analysis and corresponding \n     scientific risk opportunity. Preference will go to projects \n     that demonstrate a high degree of collaboration and which \n     address diseases with the great burden or research promise, \n     and that are most likely to result in the development of a \n     diagnostic or therapeutic prototype.\n       $150 million dollars is authorized to be appropriated from \n     the Director's Acceleration Fund to fund the Office.\n       Section 499G-3. Patenting and Licensing Incentives: The OTT \n     shall make every effort to increase licensing to stimulate \n     the availability of products for clinical use. The OTT shall \n     recommend to the Director incentives that create private \n     sector, financial, commercial, and academic interest in the \n     NIH's IP portfolio. These incentives may include extensions \n     of NIH health patents, restoration of NIH health patents, and \n     partnering options to pursue exclusive and nonexclusive \n     licensing to one or multiple partners in the government, \n     industrial, and/or academic sectors.\n       The Director shall encourage OTT to develop flexible models \n     for contracts that fulfill the needs of industry and the \n     public.\n       Section 499G-4. Translational Researcher Development: The \n     Director shall oversee development of a curriculum for \n     internships in translational research encompassing rotations \n     through multiple NIH Institutes and Centers, the clinical \n     trial design process, the NLM, and other related disciplines \n     with an emphasis on practical experience.\n       Tuition grants for extramural translational research \n     programs shall be administered under the supervision of the \n     Director.\n       The ACC shall train interdisciplinary scientists in the \n     science of risk analysis & mapping through a program of \n     internships and fellowships.\n       Section 499G-6. Translational Research Training Program: \n     The NIH Director shall ensure that each NIH Institute or \n     Center establishes a translational research training program.\n\n\n               Subpart 6--Developing Information Systems\n\n       The NIH's National Center for Biotechnology Information \n     (NCBI) at the NLM provides essential information resources to \n     scientists worldwide and is the underpinning of much of NIH \n     conducted biomedical research. The NCBI's databases and \n     computational and linkage tools nurture information sharing \n     and are critical to identifying interconnections, developing \n     insights, and accelerating biomedical breakthroughs.\n       Section 499H. Advancing National Health Information \n     Infrastructure.\n       The NLM shall develop new computational methods to assist \n     in the processing of genomic data. There is authorized to be \n     appropriated $2.5 million dollars to support the \n     computational infrastructure and $5.5 million dollars to hire \n     expert biologists and computer scientists trained in \n     bioinformatics.\n       Secretary of Health and Human Services acting through the \n     Director of NIH will work with the NLM to construct a \n     clinical trial registry and clinical results database \n     tracking all phase III clinical trials taking place in the \n     United States. This registry and database will expand upon \n     the NLM's current information system and database.\n       The registry of clinical trials shall include at least the \n     following: clinical trial title, description of the product \n     under study, the hypothesis to be tested, brief description \n     of the intervention, the study design, methodology, duration \n     and location, participation criteria, contact information and \n     sponsoring organization.\n       The databank of clinical trial results shall consist of at \n     least the following: trial start date and completion date, \n     summary of the results of the trial, summary data tables with \n     respect to the primary and secondary outcome measures, \n     information on the statistical significance of the results, \n     links to publications in peer reviewed journals relating to \n     the trial, a description of the process used to review the \n     results of the trial, and safety data concerning the trial.\n       Public or private entities shall register a phase III \n     clinical trial not later than 3 months after submitting the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the clinical \n     trial protocol and report phase III clinical trial results \n     not later than 3 months after completing the trial. \n     Information provided to the NLM must be accurate and updated.\n       Penalties for not registering clinical trials or reporting \n     clinical trial results can be loss of future public funding \n     or in cases where an entity does not receive public funding, \n     a fine of up to $2,000,000 dollars.\n       The Secretary may waive clinical trial submission \n     requirements upon a written request from the responsible \n     person if the Secretary determines that providing the waiver \n     is in the public's interest or consistent with protection of \n     the public's health.\n       Section 499H-1. Publication Requirement for Research: The \n     Director of the NIH shall require that for any research \n     funded by the NIH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \n     (AHRQ), there will be a standardized report of this research \n     for public viewing. Department of Health and Human Services \n     (DHHS) grantees shall provide the NLM an electronic copy of \n     the final version of all peer-reviewed manuscripts accepted \n     for publication for display on their digital library archive, \n     PubMed Central, within 6 months from the date of its \n     publication.\n       Failure to submit required information to the NLM within 6 \n     months from the date of publication may result in loss of \n     public funding for investigators.\n       Section 499H-2. Informatics Training and Workforce \n     Development. 21st Century technologies for analyzing DNA, \n     RNA, proteins, and other biologically important molecules are \n     generating a ``tsunami of data'' which are far beyond the \n     understanding of unaided human cognition, but hold the key to \n     improved understanding of human health and disease. Training \n     of individuals in ``clinical bioinformatics''--translational \n     research that applies computerized analytic methods of \n     molecules, cells, tissues, and body systems to the \n     prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human disease--will be \n     pivotal to fostering this emerging and important data-\n     intensive field.\n       The NIH shall develop a multi-faceted approach to \n     increasing the number of persons trained in clinical \n     bioinformatics. This shall include but not be limited to \n     augmenting secondary school science programs, undergraduate \n     degree programs in Bioinformatics, NIH bioinformatics \n     graduate training programs, and Centers of Excellence in \n     Clinical Bioinformatics.\n       Authorization of Appropriations from the Cures Acceleration \n     Fund is $50 million dollars for this section.\n       Section 499H-3. NLM Expansion of Facilities. In 2002, \n     Congress authorized an expansion of the NLM. These facilities \n     may be essential to the NLM's capacity to fill its numerous \n     informatics functions. The Director will commission the IOM \n     to report to Congress on the impact of not funding the \n     expansion of facilities.\n\n\n                       Subpart 7--Research Tools\n\n       Innovation requires proper tools for discovery. These \n     include animal models that can be surrogates for human \n     systems and markers that illuminate otherwise invisible \n     cells, DNA, proteins and viruses. Arguably, the development \n     of research tools is subject to the same market forces as \n     more common end products--drugs, medical devices, and \n     vaccines.\n       Section 499I. NIH Research Tool Inventory: The Director of \n     NIH shall direct the head of each NIH Institute and Center to \n     perform an annual review of its research tool inventory for \n     the specific purpose of enabling each Institute and Center to \n     understand processes for research tool distribution, \n     frequency of use, IP status, and utility. Each NIH Institute \n     and Center shall also describe in its review the type and \n     quantity of research tools it desires to obtain in order to \n     better fulfill its R goals.\n       The ACC shall enter this inventory into an electronic \n     research tool database and use this database to oversee the \n     prioritization and funding of new projects to fulfill \n     pressing needs and to encourage promising technologies.\n       Section 499I-1. Exceptions to Tool Guidelines: The Director \n     of NIH may advise the OTT to provide exceptions to \n     prohibition against patenting and licensing research tools \n     under some appropriate circumstances when exclusive or non-\n     exclusive licensing provides the swiftest, and most \n     efficacious final development of an important health care \n     technology.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2104\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Institutes of Health (referred to in this \n     section as the ``NIH'') is the United States premier \n     biomedical research investment with annual appropriations \n     exceeding $28,000,000,000.\n       (2) The mission of the NIH is science in pursuit of \n     fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living \n     systems and the application of that knowledge to extend \n     healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and \n     disability.\n       (3) The pace of knowledge application to promote health and \n     reduce disease can be influenced through strategic funding \n     and reorganization of some aspects of the traditional \n     research endeavor. This process is known as translational \n     research investment.\n       (4) The United States translational research investment \n     will be key to the Nation responding effectively--\n       (A) to acute man-made or natural health threats;\n       (B) to the complexity and multi-disciplinary nature of \n     chronic diseases, which are responsible for 7 out of every 10 \n     deaths in the United States and for more than 70 percent of \n     the $1,700,000,000,000 spent in the United States on health \n     care each year; and\n       (C) to research and development vacuums in the private for-\n     profit market, such as in the fields of vaccine and \n     antibiotic production, drugs for Third World diseases, and \n     medical tools for pediatric populations.\n       (5) Key components of the translational research process \n     include research prioritization, an expert workforce, multi-\n     disciplinary collaborative work, facilitated information \n     exchange, strategic risk taking, support of small innovative \n     businesses caught along common pathways in the research and \n     development Valley of Death, simplification and promotion of \n     the clinical research endeavor, and involvement of private \n     entities early on in the translational research endeavor that \n     are skilled in the manufacturing and marketing process.\n\n     SEC. 4.

By emphasizing translational and applications \n     research as well as discovery of diagnostic markers, the ACC \n     will bring the hope of basic science discovery to the reality \n     of patient care. The mandate and goal will be to prevent, \n     early diagnose, or cure the diseases that cause such \n     suffering to humanity. This effort will promote health \n     diplomacy that will bring the genius and resources of our \n     nation to better the health of all Americans.''--Secretary \n     Tommy Thompson, Former Secretary, Department of Health and \n     Human Services, Former Governor, State of Wisconsin.\n       ``The need for a federal focus on finding cures has long \n     been a top priority for all of us who seek the rapid \n     translation of scientific advances into personal health \n     benefits. With their landmark legislative proposal, Senators \n     Cochran and Lieberman have taken a critical step along our \n     path to cures.''--S. Robert Levine MD, Chairman of the Health \n     Priorities Project of the Progressive Policy Institute.\n       ``As Governors around the country look to transform our \n     complex health care system, we must seek new cost-effective \n     solutions that continue to improve our overall health and \n     productivity,'' said Michigan Governor Jennifer M.

As an \n     example, by simply delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease \n     by five years, the health and productivity of older Americans \n     will be enhanced. Developing cures will provide American \n     families with a better quality of health care that can be \n     sustained over a longer period of time. That is why I urge \n     the establishment of the American Center for Cures.''--\n     Governor Tom Vilsack, Iowa.\n       The American Center for Cures is a timely and creative \n     proposal for tackling an urgent national challenge: the \n     skyrocketing costs of treating and preventing chronic \n     diseases. The confluence of such diseases and a graying \n     population not only threatens to make health care \n     unaffordable, but also jeopardizes prospects for healthy and \n     successful aging. The Center would focus the prodigious \n     talents of our scientific community on specific strategies to \n     cure disease, saving lives and money over the long run.--Will \n     Marshall, President, Progressive Policy Institute.\n       ``The American Center for Cures is a simple, bold, \n     breakthrough idea: A can-do country ought to have the \n     capacity to solve chronic problems, not just treat them.''--\n     Bruce Reed, President, Democratic Leadership Council.\n       ``I think this goes a long way toward improving NIH's \n     ability to do large projects across institutes and to \n     facilitate translational research.

It has been said that women and minorities are not \n     dying from the lack of research, they are dying from the lack \n     of research being applied to them. The ACC will focus the \n     talent of the greatest scientists and clinicians for one \n     singular purpose: to cure, prevent, or diagnose earlier \n     diseases that afflict so many in the world. As a mother, \n     nurse, researcher, and educator, I believe that the ACC will \n     bring better health to all of us. The time is now . . . let \n     us not waste another moment.''-- Sandra Underwood, RN, PhD, \n     University of Wisconsin School of Nursing.\n       ``The American Center for Cures is a remarkable idea that \n     will be the bridge between the promise of scientific \n     opportunities and the reality of our nation's health needs--\n     to deliver cures. Americans deserve a center that is totally \n     dedicated to finding cures for our most devastating and \n     debilitating chronic diseases. The ACC is the natural \n     extension of the doubling of the NIH budget. Now we must have \n     as a top national priority an accountable, mission-driven \n     Center for Cures to rapidly identify ``cure opportunities'' \n     already created by federal, academic and private research \n     laboratories and proactively accelerate and rapidly translate \n     these opportunities into real cures.\n       In an era of expanding needs, exploding knowledge of the \n     biomedical sciences, and demands of the public to have the \n     knowledge applied to their loved ones' ailments, the American \n     Center for Cures offers new hope and dynamic reality to \n     Americans. The American Center for Cures is the opportunity \n     to commit the American genius, resources, and ethic to a \n     greater cause in a ``moonshot'' approach to diseases.''--\n     Richard J.

In the 21st Century, our \n     challenge is to use incredible advancements in information \n     technology and biology to defeat such diseases as cancer, \n     Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's and many other afflictions \n     that take years of quality life from our loved ones. The \n     most-important benefit will be reduced human suffering. And \n     the value to our economy will be measured in trillions of \n     dollars. The American Center for Cures (ACC) legislation \n     recognizes and responds to the imperative of defeating these \n     deadly diseases in our lifetimes. I believe we can do that if \n     we summon the will to change the way we pursue new medical \n     solutions. FasterCures supports passage of the ACC \n     legislation and urges its rapid implementation. There is not \n     a moment to lose.''--M. Millken, Chairman, FasterCures/The \n     Center for Accelerating Medical Solutions.\n       ``The American Center for Cures will be extraordinarily \n     important for all Americans, and indeed all humanity. The new \n     Center will combine scientific disciplines that have \n     previously not been brought to bear upon biomedical problems. \n     This is a unique and desperately needed approach will break \n     through the impasse and finally bring the formidable power of \n     all science to focus and solve the diseases that plague the \n     world. The American Center for Cures has been designed to \n     bring accountability and responsibility for ultimate cures. \n     Its success will be measured by cures and cures alone. As a \n     father, husband, entrepreneur, and one who has seen too much \n     suffering, I believe it is incumbent upon us to take a bold \n     approach to biomedical research that will make our children \n     and future generations free of the diseases that have \n     afflicted us and our ancestors. Let our descendents look back \n     at our generation and say, `They reached for the stars, and \n     found they were capable of conquering old paradigms, fears, \n     and diseases.'

Res. 333\n\n       Whereas the peoples of the Philippine archipelago have a \n     long and proud history, and today, as the Republic of the \n     Philippines, embrace democracy, occupy a central strategic \n     position in Asia and the Pacific, and nurture a rich and \n     diverse cultural heritage;\n       Whereas the United States and the Philippines have enjoyed \n     a long and productive relationship, including the period of \n     United States governance between 1898 and 1946, and the \n     period post-independence starting in 1946, during which the \n     Philippines has taken its place among the community of \n     nations and has been one of our country's most loyal and \n     reliable allies internationally;\n       Whereas the bonds between our 2 countries have been \n     strengthened through sustained immigration from the \n     Philippines to the United States;\n       Whereas the 2000 census counted almost 2,400,000 Americans \n     of Filipino ancestry living in all parts of our country, \n     including the top 2 States, California, with almost 1,100,000 \n     Filipino Americans, and Hawaii, with some 275,000;\n       Whereas the contributions of Filipino Americans to the \n     United States include achievement in all segments of our \n     society, including, to name a few, labor, business, politics, \n     medicine, media and the arts;\n       Whereas Filipino Americans have especially served with \n     distinction in the Armed Forces of the United States \n     throughout the history of our long relationship, from World \n     Wars I and II through the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the \n     Gulf War, and today in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       Whereas within the United States, Filipino Americans \n     retained many of their country's proud cultural traditions \n     and contribute immeasurably to the diverse tapestry of \n     today's American experience;\n       Whereas Filipino Americans have also maintained close ties \n     to their friends and relatives in the Philippines and in \n     doing so play an indispensable role in maintaining the \n     strength and vitality of the United States-Philippines \n     relationship;\n       Whereas both the Filipino experience in the United States \n     and the resultant ties between our 2 great countries began in \n     earnest in 1906, when 15 Filipino contract laborers arrived \n     in the then-Territory of Hawaii to work on the islands' sugar \n     plantations, the beginnings of an emigration from the \n     Philippines to Hawaii which, during the subsequent century, \n     has sometimes exceeded 60,000 a year, making Filipinos the \n     largest immigrant group from the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas 1906 also saw the first class of 200 \n     ``pensionados'' arrive from the Philippines to obtain United \n     States educations with the intent of returning, although many \n     later became United States citizens and helped form the \n     foundation of today's Filipino-American community;\n       Whereas the story of America's Filipino-American community \n     is little known and rarely told, yet is the quintessential \n     immigrant story of early struggle, pain, sacrifice, and \n     broken dreams, leading eventually to success in overcoming \n     ethnic, social, economic, political, and legal barriers to \n     win a well-deserved place in American society;\n       Whereas our Filipino-American community will recognize a \n     century of achievement in the United States in 2006 through a \n     series of nationwide celebrations and memorials honoring the \n     centennial of sustained immigration from the Philippines; and\n       Whereas this centennial is for all Americans of whatever \n     ethnic origin to celebrate both with and in order to \n     understand and appreciate our Filipino-American community, \n     but also as a remembrance of the struggles and triumphs of \n     all of our predecessors and in honor of our common national \n     experience: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the centennial of sustained immigration from \n     the Philippines to the United States;\n       (2) acknowledges the achievements and contributions of \n     Filipino Americans over the past century;

Con. Res. 69\n\n       Whereas congenital heart defects are structural problems \n     with the heart that are present at birth;\n       Whereas such defects range in severity from simple \n     problems, such as ``holes'' between chambers of the heart, to \n     very severe malformations, such as the complete absence of \n     one or more chambers or valves of the heart;\n       Whereas more than one million Americans have some form of a \n     congenital heart defect and such defect is the number one \n     cause of death in infants;\n       Whereas out of 1000 births, eight babies will have some \n     form of a congenital heart disorder, and approximately 35,000 \n     babies are born with such defects each year;\n       Whereas twice as many children die each year from \n     congenital heart disease compared with childhood cancers, yet \n     funding for pediatric cancer research is five times higher \n     than such funding for congenital heart disease;\n       Whereas cardiovascular disease is the Nation's leading \n     killer in both men and women among all racial and ethnic \n     groups;\n       Whereas the United States has a severe shortage of cardiac \n     centers that are fully equipped to provide care for adults \n     living with complex heart defects;\n       Whereas almost one million Americans die of cardiovascular \n     disease each year, resulting in up to 42 percent of all \n     deaths in the United States;\n       Whereas the presence of a serious congenital heart defect \n     often results in an enormous emotional and financial strain \n     on young families who are already in a vulnerable stage of \n     their lives;\n       Whereas severe congenital heart disease requires that \n     families dedicate extensive financial resources for \n     assistance and care both within and outside of a hospital \n     environment;\n       Whereas congenial heart defects exceed more than $2.2 \n     million a year for inpatient surgery alone; and\n       Whereas February 14, 2006 would be an appropriate day to \n     recognize A Day for Hearts: Congenital Heart Defect Awareness \n     Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress supports the goals and ideals \n     of A Day of Hearts: Congenital Heart Defect Awareness Day \n     to--\n       (1) increase awareness about congenital heart defects;\n       (2) encourage research with respect to the disease; and\n       (3) support the millions of Americans who are affected by \n     this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13592-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AUTHORITIES FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n               committee on environment and public works\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Res. 333) recognizing the centennial of \n     sustained immigration from the Philippines to the United \n     States and acknowledging the contributions of our Filipino-\n     American community to our country over the last century.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the resolution \nsubmitted today with the senior Senator from Hawaii; Dan Inouye. This \nresolution formally recognizes the 2006 centennial of Filipino \nimmigration to Hawaii, acknowledges the contributions of the Filipino-\nAmerican community to our country, and celebrates the long and \nproductive relationship between the Philippines and the United States.\n  On December 20, 1906, the first Filipino ``sakadas,'' or farm \nworkers, arrived at Honolulu Harbor. Over the years Filipino workers \nprovided an invaluable service for Hawaiian sugarcane and pineapple \nplantations. Other Filipino immigrants who arrived on the West Coast \ncontributed to the workforce on farms in California and Washington, \nlumber operations in the North West, and salmon canneries in Alaska. \nThree years earlier, following the passage of the Pensionado Act, about \n200 Filipino ``pensionados,'' or government scholars, were brought to \nthe U.S. to receive an American education. Though many of the \n``sakadas'' and ``pensionados'' intended to return to the Philippines, \na number of them stayed to become American citizens, forming the \nfoundation of today's Filipino-American community.\n  Despite being the second-largest Asian-American group in the United \nStates, the story of the Filipino-American community is largely \nunknown. This resolution pays tribute to the sacrifice of Filipino-\nAmericans and their perseverance in the face of political, social, and \nethnic adversity.\n  Throughout our Nation, there are about 2.4 million Americans of \nFilipino ancestry. Hawaii has the second largest population of \nFilipino-Americans with 275,000 residing there today. Our country has \nbenefitted greatly from the many accomplishments of the Filipino-\nAmerican community, in all areas of society.\n  As a Nation with a rich immigrant heritage, it is only right that our \ncountry recognizes the struggles and triumphs experienced by the \nFilipino community. I would also like to commend my other colleagues in \nHawaii's Congressional delegation, Representatives Ed Case and Neil \nAbercrombie, for sponsoring this resolution in the other body. I would \nlike to thank my intern, Sylvia Wan, for her assistance in preparing \nthis statement. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to \nhonor the centennial of Filipino migration to Hawaii and their \ncontributions to our country.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 333) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n[[Page S13594]]\n\n                              S. Res. 333\n\n       Whereas the peoples of the Philippine archipelago have a \n     long and proud history, and today, as the Republic of the \n     Philippines, embrace democracy, occupy a central strategic \n     position in Asia and the Pacific, and nurture a rich and \n     diverse cultural heritage;\n       Whereas the United States and the Philippines have enjoyed \n     a long and productive relationship, including the period of \n     United States governance between 1898 and 1946, and the \n     period post-independence starting in 1946, during which the \n     Philippines has taken its place among the community of \n     nations and has been one of our country's most loyal and \n     reliable allies internationally;\n       Whereas the bonds between our 2 countries have been \n     strengthened through sustained immigration from the \n     Philippines to the United States;\n       Whereas the 2000 census counted almost 2,400,000 Americans \n     of Filipino ancestry living in all parts of our country, \n     including the top 2 States, California, with almost 1,100,000 \n     Filipino Americans, and Hawaii, with some 275,000;\n       Whereas the contributions of Filipino Americans to the \n     United States include achievement in all segments of our \n     society, including, to name a few, labor, business, politics, \n     medicine, media and the arts;\n       Whereas Filipino Americans have especially served with \n     distinction in the Armed Forces of the United States \n     throughout the history of our long relationship, from World \n     Wars I and II through the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the \n     Gulf War, and today in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       Whereas within the United States, Filipino Americans \n     retained many of their country's proud cultural traditions \n     and contribute immeasurably to the diverse tapestry of \n     today's American experience;\n       Whereas Filipino Americans have also maintained close ties \n     to their friends and relatives in the Philippines and in \n     doing so play an indispensable role in maintaining the \n     strength and vitality of the United States-Philippines \n     relationship;\n       Whereas both the Filipino experience in the United States \n     and the resultant ties between our 2 great countries began in \n     earnest in 1906, when 15 Filipino contract laborers arrived \n     in the then-Territory of Hawaii to work on the islands' sugar \n     plantations, the beginnings of an emigration from the \n     Philippines to Hawaii which, during the subsequent century, \n     has sometimes exceeded 60,000 a year, making Filipinos the \n     largest immigrant group from the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas 1906 also saw the first class of 200 \n     ``pensionados'' arrive from the Philippines to obtain United \n     States educations with the intent of returning, although many \n     later became United States citizens and helped form the \n     foundation of today's Filipino-American community;\n       Whereas the story of America's Filipino-American community \n     is little known and rarely told, yet is the quintessential \n     immigrant story of early struggle, pain, sacrifice, and \n     broken dreams, leading eventually to success in overcoming \n     ethnic, social, economic, political, and legal barriers to \n     win a well-deserved place in American society;\n       Whereas our Filipino-American community will recognize a \n     century of achievement in the United States in 2006 through a \n     series of nationwide celebrations and memorials honoring the \n     centennial of sustained immigration from the Philippines; and\n       Whereas this centennial is for all Americans of whatever \n     ethnic origin to celebrate both with and in order to \n     understand and appreciate our Filipino-American community, \n     but also as a remembrance of the struggles and triumphs of \n     all of our predecessors and in honor of our common national \n     experience: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the centennial of sustained immigration from \n     the Philippines to the United States;\n       (2) acknowledges the achievements and contributions of \n     Filipino Americans over the past century; and\n       (3) urges the people of the United States to observe this \n     milestone with appropriate celebratory and educational \n     programs, ceremonies and other activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/14/senate-section/article/S13594-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SHAREHOLDER CONSIDERATION OF PROPOSALS UNDER THE ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS \n                             SETTLEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
