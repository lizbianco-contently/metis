I now ask unanimous consent the Senate begin consideration \nof H.J. Res. 72, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am reserving the right to object, to \nspeak with the leader for a moment about a situation that is developing \nat home and one of which he is certainly aware.\n  I understand that the motion that has been put forward would allow \nthe Congress to go home for approximately 30 days and to come back in \nthe middle of December to finish our business. I wanted to ask the \nleader if it is his intention when we come back to press forward for \nthe supplemental bill that the senior Senator from Mississippi, Senator \nCochran, and others have been working on for relief for the gulf coast. \nIt is a very important piece of legislation, and many people, \nindividuals and businesses, large and small, have been waiting for some \ndirect, significant funding. I wanted to ask the leader from Tennessee \nwhat his intentions are when we get back, at least as he can press the \nSenate and press our colleagues in the House to move that piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the issues the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana comments on and mentions are something we take very seriously \nhere. As she well knows, my personal commitment, the commitment of \nleadership on both sides of the aisle, is to address the issues. We \nhave worked very hard, both in a personal sense and in an institutional \nsense. With regard to the latter, we passed 21 separate pieces of \nlegislation that have responded to many of the immediate needs. I well \nrecognize these needs are ongoing. We are going to need to stay on top \nof them, which I pledge and leadership pledges to continue to do.\n\n[[Page S13284]]\n\n  We will be coming back in December, depending on the outcome of \ntoday, in all likelihood, and we will continue to address these very \nimportant issues. Several issues we will be addressing over the course \nof the day as well.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask the leader, if I could, please, I understand, I \nwant the leader to know, we have passed 21 pieces of legislation. I \ntake him at his word. It has been very hard to follow as these things \nhave moved so quickly, in some cases, and not so quickly in others. But \nI want to make a point and ask the leader that. Because we pass \nlegislation does not necessarily mean it has been effective. Sometimes \nCongress has a way of passing legislation, but that is not any \nguarantee it is actually working.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee knows, the members of the Louisiana \ndelegation, joined at times by members of the Mississippi delegation, \nhave consistently said that money given to FEMA is not making its way \nto the hands of people in businesses. As the leader knows, the housing \nmoney has been very difficult for people to get. Shelter has been very \ndifficult to get, housing has been very difficult to get. Many of our \nbusinesses that have applied for loans that are authorized have not yet \nreceived a response from FEMA or the Small Business Administration.\n  For the record, I say it is not the quantity of legislation but the \nquality of legislation, and that is why this supplemental Senator \nCochran has been crafting is so important. We think this may be the \nfirst major piece of legislation that actually gets money into the \nhands of people who can do something with it other than having it sit \nin bank accounts while people are suffering and trying to get their \nlives back together.\n  I understand the Senator from Tennessee is aware of these great \nneeds. He himself has been down to our State, and we are appreciative \nof that. But that is the point. If I could get a comment about the \nimportance of the supplemental, that would be of some comfort to the \npeople of the gulf coast.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I obviously am committed not only to what \nis in the supplemental, but I think we need to make it very clear to \nour colleagues and to the people in Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nAlabama, where I have personally visited very early on and have visited \nafter that again and again, that in terms of responsiveness, we have \nbeen responsive in many ways. When I say 21 pieces of legislation, \npeople say, What does that mean? Let me give examples. In terms of \nthings that have been enacted or cleared for the President, we have \npassed the emergency supplemental, No. 1, which was $10.5 billion in \nPublic Law 10961. We passed another emergency supplemental for $51.8 \nbillion. We passed a Katrina short-term tax relief bill for $6.1 \nbillion; flood insurance borrowing authority, H.R. 3669, for $2 \nbillion; the TANF disaster relief bill for $.3 billion; the unemployed \ninsurance provisions for $.16 billion. We passed a bill for \nredistribution of campus student aid, another bill for Pell grant \nrelief, another bill for the Community Disaster Loan Act, for a total \nof $70.9 billion.\n  Those are the things that have passed the Senate and the House. If \nyou look at the things passed by the Senate, there are another nine \nbills for $9 billion: the Deficit Reduction Act, Sarbanes housing \namendment, the Snowe small business amendment, the Katrina education \nreimbursement bill, the Baucus economic development amendment, the Byrd \nunemployment HHS IG amendment, the Harkin legal services amendment--all \nof which have been passed by the Senate, this body.\n  I want my colleagues and the American people to understand we are \nacting and we are moving. We have a lot more to do, which I think is \nthe importance of the supplemental. The distinguished chairman, who is \nhere on the floor, knows we are focused on it and there is going to \nneed to be more assistance there in order to renew and rebuild and \nrespond. This body understands the importance. We are absolutely \ncommitted to that continued support for our appropriate renewal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator has been very patient. I realize we have to \nmove forward. But if he would grant me a few more questions--one or \ntwo.\n  I understand those pieces and those packages, because of course we \nare following them very carefully. But I want the record to reflect \nthat this morning, as we break, there was $70.9 billion appropriated \nand $30 billion is still sitting in a bank somewhere in a FEMA account. \nSo we have allocated $40 billion. I would judge from the controversies \nand reports that much of that money was squandered in many ways that we \nknow, and used in an inefficient manner. But I would call to the \nattention of the leader that we have not passed an emergency education \nbill which would cover tuition for children, 370,000 children who are \ntoday displaced from the school they were in the week before Katrina \nand Rita. Those 370,000 children have not yet received word from this \nCongress if their tuition will be covered. That is not done yet.\n  We have not passed a comprehensive health care piece that allows \npeople with no job, no home, no school, and no church to think that \nthey could show up at a hospital over the holidays and get their health \ncare covered. That has not passed yet.\n  We have not passed any loans to our governments in Louisiana that \nwould allow them to operate and pay for police and fire over the \nholidays because the loan package we passed was inoperable because they \ncannot pay the money back in 3 years.\n  So for the record, we have no real health care relief, no significant \nelementary and secondary care relief, our universities are teetering on \nbankruptcy and closure, and our medical schools are having \ndifficulty. The dean of LSU Medical School took a job out of our State. \nIt was announced this week. I don't blame him for leaving because he \ndoesn't see any help on the way. It is one of the great medical schools \nin the country.\n\n  Finally, FEMA--to pour salt on the wound, to make sure we were all \nhaving just the very best Thanksgiving we could possibly have--\nannounced that they are going to make us homeless for the holiday and \nhas announced that on December 1, everyone who is in a shelter or a \nhotel in the country--they do not have an accurate number, so they do \nnot know how many, and if they do not know how many, how are they \nplanning to help them? But believe me, there are thousands who are now \ngoing to be put on the streets and will be homeless for the holidays.\n  I just tell my colleagues as respectfully as I can that when we are \nsitting around our tables--and I will be at a different table, and many \npeople from Louisiana will not be at the table which they usually are \nto have Thanksgiving dinner. I will be at a different table, Senator \nLott will be at a different table, and perhaps Senator Cochran will be \nat a different table. But as we sit around our tables, there will be \nthousands and hundreds of thousands of families who have no table to \npull up to. They are in shelters, they are on the street, and they are \ncrowded into apartments that they can barely afford with no hope and no \nplan.\n  I will say it for the last time. We are not dealing with a regular \nhurricane. We are dealing with an unprecedented natural disaster caused \nby the collapse of a Federal levee system that was not invested in, not \nmaintained, and not funded. It is a disaster for the region and for the \nNation. I cannot say this more emphatically or more passionately. I \nhave tried to be a team player. We have tried to be cooperative. We \nhave tried every strategy. We are running out of strategies.\n  I want my colleagues to know that while I will allow this resolution \nto go forward today, if we do not come back in December and pass a \nrobust supplemental that reflects the values of this body--not what \nMary Landrieu wants in it, not what Louisiana thinks it deserves, \nalthough we think we are entitled to say what we deserve--that reflects \nthe values of the men and women who serve in this body whom I know so \nwell from having worked with them, if we don't have a supplemental and \nif we don't get some action on our levee system so people can have \nconfidence to come back, and a few other emergency items that we need, \nwe will not be going home for Christmas.\n  We are going home for Thanksgiving, but we will not be going home for \nChristmas until the people of the gulf coast understand they have a \nhome they can go to, if not this Christmas, some Christmas soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S13285]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 72) making further continuing \n     appropriations for the fiscal year 2006, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2672\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \n     Stabenow, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Carper, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Leahy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2672.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the amount appropriated to carry out under the \n                  Community Services Block Grant Act)\n\n       At the end of the resolution, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2. COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT ACT.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 101 of Public Law 109-77, for the \n     period beginning on October 1, 2005 and ending on December \n     17, 2005, the amount appropriated under that Public Law to \n     carry out the Community Services Block Grant Act shall be \n     based on a rate for operations that is not less than the rate \n     for operations for activities carried out under such Act for \n     fiscal year 2005.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand that under the order, I will \nbe recognized for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I might reserve a little bit of time. I may have other \ncolleagues who will come over to speak.\n  Just to refresh memories, when this continuing resolution was passed \nat the end of September, I came on the floor and offered an amendment \nthat would have kept whole the Community Services Block Grant program. \nThat is a program that administers the LIHEAP program, administers a \nlot of Head Start programs, Even Start programs, Older Americans Act \nprograms, elderly transportation programs, emergency shelter programs, \nweatherization assistance--you get the idea. Most of the programs \nreally help a lot of poor people in this country. Last year's level was \n$636.8 million.\n  The amendment I offered in September would have kept the funding of \nthe Community Services Block Grant program at that level. You might say \nthat was a continuing resolution. A continuing resolution keeps things \nat last year's level. Therein lies the problem.\n  The House sent us a continuing resolution that said: We will continue \nprograms at last year's level or at the level of the House budget, \nwhichever is less. The House budget cut the Community Services Block \nGrants Program down to less than $320 million. They cut it in half. \nThat is the level it was in 1986.\n  I said in September that it was unfair for poor people to have to \nhave theirs cut right away down to that level because winter was coming \nand you need the heating energy assistance and things like that.\n  At that time, at the end of September, there was a lot of talk. We \ncouldn't accept this amendment because the House had gone out. As long \nas the House was out and if we changed the continuing resolution, that \nmeant the entire House of Representatives would have to come back to \nWashington, DC, and do something about this. I said at the time on the \nfloor, big deal. They came back for a lot of other things; they could \ncome back for this, too.\n  Obviously, my arguments did not prevail. The amendment was defeated; \nwhereupon, however, the chairman of the Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee, the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, said that he was \ngoing to take my amendment that continues the community services block \ngrants at last year's level and put it on the Defense appropriations \nbill, which he did and for which I commended him. We all thought that \nthe Defense appropriations bill would zing through here right away. \nFine.\n  Here we are. It is November 18, and the Defense appropriations bill \nhas not been passed--and we don't know when; probably next month, I \nsuppose, before the end of the year.\n  We have another continuing resolution. The continuing resolution \nexpires today at midnight. We know that. The continuing resolution is \nthe same. It is at either last year's level or the House budget level, \nwhichever is less. That means the Community Services Block Grant \nprogram is still cut down to the level it was in 1986.\n  The amendment I am offering today basically says--it is the same \namendment, basically--for the purposes of this continuing resolution, \nthe community services block grant shall be based on the rate that it \nwas last year, which is $636.6 million.\n  On November 8, barely a week and a half ago, 58 Senators from both \nsides of the aisle cosigned a letter saying we want to keep the \nCommunity Services Block Grant Program at the Senate level, at last \nyear's level. That is what we did in our bill, and 58 Senators a week \nand a half ago signed this letter to keep it at the same level. Yet \ntoday we are going to pass a continuing resolution that cuts it in \nhalf. This continuing resolution is until December 18.\n  There is another unique feature about the Community Services Block \nGrant Program that I wish to bring to the Senate's attention. Unlike a \nlot of programs, such as education, for example, wherein the money goes \nout basically next summer, if we use that language--the lower of the \nHouse level--it doesn't mean a lot because the money is not going to go \nout until next summer, and we probably will fix this prior to going \nhome for Christmas. I think. I don't know. We have had CRs going into \nJanuary and into February. That is not unusual around here.\n  So we have a continuing resolution before us today that says until \nDecember 18, and we think it will be done by then. It may not be. I \ndon't know how many people around here would like to bet a dollar to a \ndime on that one. Maybe yes; maybe no; get it done by December 18. It \ncould go into next year.\n  Here we have a situation, unlike education, where the money goes out \nnext summer, and we will fix it before then, certainly. The Community \nServices Block Grant program goes out quarterly. Every quarter, the \nmoney goes out and is used. That means right now we are about 7 weeks \ninto this quarter, and the entire nationwide Community Services Block \nGrant program has been operating at the level of $320 million. That is \nbad enough. If we extend that another month, it could be disastrous, or \nanother 2 months, because it is not like they can draw down some money \nsomewhere and say: We are going to get it next year, we will make up \nfor it. They can't just go to the bank and borrow the money. They do \nnot have it. If they don't have the money for weatherization or for \nHead Start programs or for low-income energy assistance programs, they \njust do not do it.\n  We have had vote after vote here when Members supported the Low-\nIncome Energy Heating Assistance Program. It is vitally needed. But if \nyou do not have the people to administer the program and get the goods \nand hire the people to administer it, what good does it do? That is \nwhat the Community Services Block Grant program does.\n  You may hear talk that the Community Services Block Grant program is \njust one part of the picture because there are State and local \ngovernments that help. That is true. There are private charities that \nhelp. That is true. That is the good thing about this program--it \nbrings a lot of different stakeholders into play. But there is the \nanchor, there is the anchor of the money. If that is not there, they do \nnot even have the people to go out and do anything.\n  I ask Senators to think about this. Here is a program that is widely \nsupported; 58 Senators signed a letter a week and a half ago. We passed \nit in our Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee \nwhen it was on the floor at last year's level, $636.8 million. No one \ntalked against that. It just passed. We all supported it. As a matter \nof fact, if I am not mistaken, I think it was later supported by the \nHouse, even though their numbers were less. The conference report\n\n[[Page S13286]]\n\nthat was rejected by the House at least had this high figure in it.\n  So we find ourselves in an odd situation with another continuing \nresolution in the dead of winter when the homeless need a lot of help, \nwhen poor people are put to the extreme in terms of buying enough food, \nenergy to heat their homes, get clothes for their kids, finding enough \nmoney for rent, going to food banks when the food stamps run out.\n\n  Any Senator here who has been to the food banks in their State knows \nthat the food bank demand is up over what it has been in the past \nbecause food stamps are running out about the third week of the month, \nand poor families are going to the food banks to get food. I say to any \nSenator, go to your food bank--any State, I don't care which State it \nis--go to your food banks, food pantries, and ask them whether the \ndemand for food is up over what it was last year or just a few months \nago. That is the program administered by the Community Services Block \nGrant program.\n  The argument that was made in September is we could not do this \nbecause the House would have to come back, and they cannot do it, la-\nde-da, and all that stuff. Well, the House is in session today--they \nmay be in session tomorrow, I don't know. But they are in session \ntoday. We could pass this amendment; say, no, the one program we are \ngoing to exempt from the 50-percent cut of the House of Representatives \nis Community Services Block Grant program. Send it back to the House, \nlet them bring it up and pass it and send it to the President. The \nargument that we could not do it because of the time pressures does not \nhold any longer.\n  This is just a matter of simple justice. If this were a program that \ncould make up the money later on next year, it would be different. This \nis now. People need help now for housing, for rental assistance, food \nbanks, heating energy assistance, Head Start, foster grandparents, \nrental assistance.\n  One of the things the Community Services Block Grant program does for \npeople includes if they are evicted and they need someplace to stay. \nThink of the single mother with two or three children. The husband has \nleft her and gone off someplace. They have been in an apartment, maybe \nthere has been an illness in the family for which they are not \ncovered--who knows what kind of calamities could have hit--and they \nfind themselves evicted. They can go to the local community action \nagency in their area. One of the things they will do is they will find \nthem a place to live. They will give them rental assistance to get them \nestablished and a place to live. That is what this program does. What I \njust described happens 10 times a day in 1,000 cities across America--\n100,000 times a day.\n  I hope we can pass this amendment. It is very simple and \nstraightforward. Leave the Community Services Block Grant program at \nlast year's level. We have all said that is where we want it. We need \nto get that money out there. The House is in session. They can pass it \nand send it to the President.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa be advised that the time \ncontinues to run.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time total?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes sixteen seconds. The Senator was \noriginally yielded 20 minutes, and the Senator has used 14 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time on the other side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: I understand I had 20 minutes to \nspeak and there is no time on the other side to speak on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There are a couple of other points.\n  The amendment is a straight failure. Senators understand it. But I \nwill point out, because of a quirk in the law, there are some States \nthat are cut more than others.\n  Here is what that means. This gets a little complicated, but I think \nthe States that are going to be voting need to know this. If the total \nfunding for a fiscal year is less than $345 million, then no State \nshall receive less than one-fourth of 1 percent. Now, last year, since \nwe cut it back to $320.6 million, that means there are 13 States--\nAlaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, \nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Wyoming--that are not \ncut by 50 percent; they are cut by 75 percent. Because of a quirk in \nthe law, 13 of our smallest States have a 75-percent cut. That is what \nthey are operating at right now in those States.\n  I say to the Senators from those States, this may not be knowledge to \na lot of Members. I happen to know about this program because I am on \nboth the committees that administer it, but this is a program that \nhelps the poorest in our country.\n  I anticipate there may be some other reasons people do not want to \nvote for this, but as long as 58 Senators signed the letter a week and \na half ago, as long as the House is in session, it seems to me we could \nvote on this and let the House do it.\n  As I said, this is the dead of winter. We were told at the end of \nSeptember that the Defense appropriations bill would be acted upon. \nThis amendment was included. But it has not been acted on. We are now \ntold we have a continuing resolution until December 18, but will we \nreally act on it by December 18? As I said, who can bet on that around \nhere?\n  These are the poorest of our poor people. Can't we at least say we \nare going to hold them a little bit harmless in this? It is not that we \nare holding them harmless, we are holding them at last year's level, \nwhich means it is cut a little bit simply because of the cost-of-living \nincrease. But to be cut 50 percent, and in 13 States to be cut by 75 \npercent, is grossly unfair.\n  Let's do the moral thing. Let's do the right thing. This is a very \nsmall matter, a small thing to do, to pass this amendment and send it \nto the House and have them pass it on.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter I \ndiscussed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 2005.\n     Hon.

Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, Education, \n         Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Specter and Harkin: We applaud the Senate \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     Appropriations Subcommittees (Labor HHS) for restoring \n     funding to the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG). In the \n     face of budget constraints and competing priorities, we urge \n     you to uphold the Senate funding level of $637 million in \n     negotiations with the House on H.R. 3010, the Labor-HHS \n     Appropriations bill.\n       As you know, CSBG helps to strengthen communities by \n     helping low-income individuals and families to become self-\n     sufficient. Nearly one-fourth of Americans living in poverty \n     receive services from CSBG grantees located in 90 percent of \n     the nation's counties. Please enable these entities to \n     continue their vital assistance to families and communities.\n       We urge you to insist on the Senate positions in CSBG, $637 \n     million, during final negotiations on H.R. 3010. Thank you \n     for your continued efforts on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         Charles E. Grassley, Orrin G. Hatch, Olympia J. Snowe, \n           Rick Santorum, Christopher J.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, is this the continuing resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, earlier this morning we had a colloquy \nthat expressed concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be advised that all time for \ndebate has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we had a colloquy this morning with the \nleader about the need to do more for the victims of Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita. I am not going to ask for a record vote, and I am not going \nto delay the debate, but I do want to be recorded as voting ``no'' if \nwe have a voice vote. It is very important to let people in this \ncountry know that our work is not yet finished. While we are breaking \nfor the holidays, there will be many people who have no holiday table \nto go home to. Members of this body have worked very hard. I respect \nthe work that each has done. We have worked in a bipartisan way to \naddress some issues of health care, education, and housing. But just \nbecause we have done our job doesn't mean the same thing is actually \nhappening on the other side of the Capitol.\n  There are still more issues that we need to find solutions for. We \nneed to find a solution for the health care crisis along the gulf coast \ndue to the hurricanes and subsequent levee breeches. We need to find a \nsolution for the massive housing shortage throughout the States that \nKatrina and Rita whipped through. We need to find a solution for the \nsmall businesses that have been devastated and the thousands of people \nwho have been left jobless. And we need to find a solution to building \nCategory 5 levees and providing plenty of storm and flood protection \nwhich also means restoring our vital coastal wetlands, as they are our \nfirst line of defense. Without this protection, all our other efforts \nwill be for naught.\n  We need solutions, Mr. President. We need real answers, because it is \nunsettling to know that while we go home to have Thanksgiving with our \nfamilies, my constituents still have real problems and real needs. And \nso I thank you, Mr. President, for this time and for allowing me to \nnote for the record, that I am voting no to this continuing resolution \nbecause our job is not finished, and these vital concerns are not \nsettled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall it pass?\n  The joint resolution (H. J. Res. 72) was passed.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move that the managers, on the part of \nthe Senate to the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \non the Senate amendments to the bill, H. R. 3010, be instructed to \ninsist that $2,183,000,000 be available for the Low-Income Home Energy \nHeating Assistance Program and that such funds shall be designated as \nan emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95, of \nthe 109th Congress, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for fiscal \nyear 2006.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the instructions that the Senator from \nPennsylvania sent to the Chair, in my understanding, would designate \nthe full amount of LIHEAP funding that is currently in the \nappropriations bill as emergency spending.\n  I understand the motivation. This bill is underfunded. There are \nvaluable programs that need additional resources. Both the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa strove mightily to try to \nprovide those resources. They are attempting today to try to free up \nabout $2 billion to classify some money as emergency spending, LIHEAP \nmoney. I understand the motivation, but I think it is extremely poor \npolicy.\n  This LIHEAP program is composed of two components. There is a regular \nformula program which each and every year every State in this country \ndepends upon to provide heating and cooling assistance to its citizens.\n  The application process begins before the heating and cooling season. \nIt is usually conducted from community action centers. This whole \ninfrastructure suddenly now is going to be declared an emergency \nprocess. That would send a terrible signal throughout this country \nabout our commitment to low-income heating assistance. It would open a \nsituation of uncertainty and a situation that would be \ncounterproductive to helping poor people struggling with heating bills \nin the winter and cooling bills in the summer.\n  This would, again, in my view, create a terrible precedent. We have \nover the last several weeks in this Chamber supported funding of \nLIHEAP, not on an emergency basis, but on a full authorization basis of \n$5.1 billion. We did it last evening. Unfortunately, because of \nprocedural obstacles, we needed 60 votes. Last evening, a majority of \nthis Senate voted to increase LIHEAP funding to $5.1 billion, \noffsetting it by a temporary windfall profits tax. Previously, even a \nlarger majority of the Senate voted simply to appropriate $5.1 billion. \nToday we are on this floor saying not only are we not talking about \n$5.1 billion, we are talking about the regular formula money in the \nregular program suddenly is an emergency. That is not the emergency \nfunding that LIHEAP sometimes gets. This funding supports year in and \nyear out the needs of people who we know have low income. They are \nseniors, they are disabled, and they are low-income working families, \nand they will anticipate heating and cooling bills. There is no \nemergency here.\n  One of the real problems is, because we call it an emergency, no \nfunds can be disbursed until the President declares an emergency. When \nwill that declaration take place? Will it take place in August so these \ncommunity action agencies can start requesting applications, processing \napplications, or will it take place in October or November or January? \nIf it does, then this is going to cause chaos.\n  We were looking weeks ago at the chaos caused in the wake of Katrina \nbecause Federal programs were not realistically grounded in what was \nhappening. This policy is going to throw a monkey wrench into the \nnormal operations of the LIHEAP program.\n  It also sends a terrible signal, if it is adopted, because we are \nsaying that no longer do we have a regular program committed to helping \npoor people--seniors, the disabled--with their heating and cooling \nbills. What we have is something that may or may not exist every year.\n  I know people will stand up and say, Oh, come on, the reality is they \nare going to have to declare it this year as an emergency. I do not \nentirely agree. But more importantly, when next year we are looking, \nunder excruciating budget pressure, for additional resources, there \nwill be the susceptibility to taking this approach, saying we will use \nthis gimmick again. I suspect the administration--I am not the expert \nin budgets, but I expect the administration will say: This is a great \ndeal they have handed us. We can send up the programs we like in the \nregular budget and say all of this LIHEAP is just emergency.\n  I am terribly concerned about this. Again, we have spent the last \nseveral weeks in this body, on a bipartisan basis, a majority of our \ncolleagues saying not only is this not an emergency program, this is a \nprogram that should be funded even more than $2.1 billion.\n  So I must express my deep opposition to this proposal. I immensely \nrespect Senator Harkin and Senator Specter. I know they are laboring \nunder excruciating budget constraints that are squeezing out money for \nprograms that are necessary for America's families, America's children, \nAmerica's health care, America's future. But in this desperate moment, \nit is not a time to undercut a program that serves every State in this \ncountry well and serves people who need help, particularly as this \nwinter approaches. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Rhode \nIsland for pointing this out. I cannot find anything about which I \ndisagree with him. I think he is right. This is not the way to do \nbusiness, normally.\n  These are not normal times, however. We have a small space in which \nwe might be able to get something done, and we have to take advantage \nof it. I say to my friend from Rhode Island, I think it is instructive \nfor all of us that there is only one appropriations bill cut from last \nyear's level--one. Not Commerce, State, Justice, not Transportation, \nnot the Housing and Urban Development, not all of the rest--only one \nappropriations was cut. Guess what it deals with: health; human \nservices; education; labor. That has been cut. What kind of message are \nwe sending to Americans?\n  We had a vote on whether to continue the Community Services Block \nGrant program at last year's level. I pointed out a week and a half \nago, 58 Senators signed a letter--please keep it at last year's levels. \nA week and a half ago they vote to cut it, in some cases 75 percent. \nThat is why I put the letter in the Record right after the vote. I want \npeople to see the vote and read the letter and see how people signed \nthe letter and then how they voted. It is one thing to sign the letter \naround here and I guess another thing to vote.\n  I guess what I am expressing is this is a terrible appropriations \nbill that we have for the needs of the American people, for education, \nbasic structure of health care and public health, for NIH, for basic \nmedical research. This is the first time since 1970 that we have flat-\nlined funding for the National Institutes of Health--35 years. That is \nthe bill that Senator Specter and I are faced with.\n  What we are trying to do is find some way of getting some money for \nhealth,\n\n[[Page S13289]]\n\ntrauma care, rural emergencies--rural emergency medical services was \ncompletely eliminated--health community access program, community \nhealth centers--we will not be able to open one new community health \ncenter next year under the bill that we go to conference with. No Child \nLeft Behind is underfunded; Pell grants are kept at the same level for \nthe fourth year in a row. For kids with disabilities, IDEA, we are \ngoing backward. How many times have we heard, on both sides of the \naisle, Republicans and Democrats get out here and say we have to fully \nfund IDEA. This bill actually goes backward, from 18.6 percent to 18 \npercent.\n  That is why Senator Specter and I decided to take this step of having \na motion to instruct the conferees to take the slightly less than $2.1 \nbillion in LIHEAP and designate it as an emergency for this one time \nonly in order for us to get to conference, to put pressure on the House \nto come up with some more money.\n  I am not saying this will stay as an emergency in the final bill. My \nhope is we will be able to find the money and come up with something so \nit does not. But if it does, it is only for 1 year. I tell my friend \nfrom Rhode Island, I will do everything I can, everything humanly \npossible in the Senate to ensure that when it comes up next year, we do \nnot have it as an emergency, that we get a better budget allocation.\n  But again I have to say I do not want anybody around here hiding \nbehind the skirts of the Budget Committee. They say the reason we got a \nbad bill, the reason our bill, the one that funds Health and Human \nServices and Education and Labor--the reason it is cut is because the \nBudget Committee gave us a bad budget.\n  Fine. But did you vote for it? Did you vote for the budget? If you \nvoted for the budget, you own this bill. Don't hide behind the skirts \nof the Budget Committee. If you voted for the budget, you own it. You \nbought it. So anyone who voted for the budget, this is what you got.\n  I share a little frustration on this, also, as you can probably tell. \nBut I think in this one case we desperately, drastically need to meet \nthe human needs of the people of our country. We are up against almost \nan intransigent House and an administration I think, quite frankly, \nthat does not care. If they cared, they wouldn't be treating us like \nthis. To them, this is nothing. Community action agencies, LIHEAP? That \nis just poor people. They don't count because they probably don't vote \nanyway, and they certainly don't contribute any money, so therefore why \neven pay attention to them.\n  I share the frustration of my friend from Rhode Island. Normally, \nthis would not be the way to do it, but as I said, this is an abnormal \nsituation in which we find ourselves. If we have to, as a one-shot \ndeal, push this into the emergency column so we can help kids with \ndisabilities, if we can help getting more health care up for rural \nemergency medical services, if we can help with Head Start, if we can \nhelp with community health centers--then, for one time, I think we \nought to do it. That is why I support the Specter motion to instruct \nthe conferees to put LIHEAP on an emergency basis for this one time \nonly.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I think I had 7 minutes, if I am not \nmistaken?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed his time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 5 minutes 42 seconds for the \nSenator from Rhode Island. Who yields time? Time will be charged \nproportionately against all Senators controlling time.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand, under the unanimous consent agreement, \nthere are Senators who have been given time prior to the vote. I ask \nthose Senators to come over. Otherwise, under the rules of the Senate, \nthe time is running as we speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Parliamentary inquiry: Can the Chair state how much time is \nremaining on all sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will attempt to determine that \nnumber.\n  At the outset of the subtraction of the proportional time, the \nSenator from Rhode Island controlled 5 minutes 42 seconds; the Senators \nfrom Mississippi and Pennsylvania each controlled 5 minutes; \napproximately 4 minutes have been consumed, of which 2 will be charged \nagainst the Senator from Rhode Island and 1 each to the Senators from \nPennsylvania and Mississippi. And the clock continues to run.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 2 \nminutes prior to the completion of the time so I could respond to the \ncomments of the Senator from Pennsylvania and Senator Harkin. I think \nit appropriate that I be able to respond to his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the appropriations bill on Labor, Health, \nHuman Services and Education, in my judgment, as I have said \nrepeatedly, is vastly underfunded. The Senate passed a bill within the \ncontext of our allocation. Working with my colleague, Senator Harkin, \nand our very energetic and devoted staff, we did the very best we could \nwith the limited funding. But there simply wasn't enough money to do \nthe job.\n  Health is our major capital asset. Without health, we can't function. \nEducation is our major capital asset for the future, to give \nopportunity for labor and worker training.\n  We made the allocations as best we could, but the bill was \nunderfunded. I made an effort, joined by Senator Harkin and by the \nsubcommittee, to put LIHEAP in an emergency classification for $2.83 \nbillion.\n  I said in the conference that it would enable us to improve the \nbill--not where it ought to be but improve it substantially.\n  I conferred with Chairman Regula and considered the projects--or so-\ncalled earmarks--which are $1 billion, where, as a matter of \nlongstanding tradition, the Members in both the House and Senate, \nDemocrats and Republicans, are enabled with an allocation to make \ndesignations within their districts or States because we know more \nabout our States and our districts than, in many instances, do the \nofficials who run the bureaucracy of the U.S. Government.\n  I said if we could not get the $2.83 billion emergency declaration \nfor LIHEAP that it was going to be my position that we ought not to \ninclude the earmarks for the projects. When we could not get that \nemergency declaration, we struck the earmarked projects.\n  That was a very tough decision. We are paid to make tough decisions \naround here. I can't think of one in the time I have been here more \ndisappointing to a lot of people in America who are relying on these \nprojects. Although, the $1 billion spread around the country, here and \nthere, is not unsubstantial--a lot of people were disappointed. Many \nMembers were disappointed that the traditional allocations were not \nmade.\n  It is my hope that we can put the $2.83 billion into LIHEAP. We are \nfacing a drastic situation with fuel costs, as we all know, and as \nsignificantly occasioned by Hurricane Katrina, which is an emergency. \nIf there ever was a clear-cut emergency, it is what the consequences of \nHurricane Katrina are. The fuel costs are a direct result of that. This \nis a classical, quintessential emergency.\n  I think we have the 51 votes to pass it here in the Senate. The \ndifficulty is going to be in getting our House colleagues to agree to \nit.\n  But I hope we work our way out of this morass and impasse with \napproval of this resolution and ultimate approval by both bodies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I respect immensely the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa who tried to take a budget that \nis inadequate and fulfill many programs. But\n\n[[Page S13290]]\n\nI strenuously object to the classification of LIHEAP in this way as an \nemergency program.\n  There are two components of LIHEAP. This is a program that has been \nappropriated for years and years and has built up a locked-in structure \nin every State to go ahead and solicit applications and to process the \napplications. They have to have some sense that this program is going \nto be in place, not depending upon our Presidential emergency \ndeclaration at some time in the year.\n  There is another component which is emergency. That is additional \nfunds. But we are creating bad policy and bad precedent.\n  There are a number of programs in this Labor-HHS bill that could also \nbeen declared emergencies.\n  We have a children's vaccination program that provides vaccines. The \nStates have offices that have to deal with it. They have to predictably \nknow they are going to have these funds.\n  This is bad policy and bad precedent. It is being forced because the \nbudget is inaccurate. I think it is a desperate moment to do this. It \nwould send a terrible signal to people throughout this country and \nState and local community agencies that are dedicated to this program \nthat they can no longer depend upon the formula for LIHEAP funds which \nthey have been now for almost 20 years.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      motion to instruct conferees\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmotion be set aside and that I may be permitted to file a motion at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Durbin moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two \n     Houses on the bill H.R. 3010 (making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health, and Human Services, and \n     Education, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2006, and for other purposes) be instructed to \n     insist on retaining the Senate-passed provisions relating to \n     funding for the National Institutes of Health.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what I am doing with this motion is making \na statement of policy that I think most American families would \nsupport. It is this:\n  In this troubled time, when we are having difficulties with our \nbudget, the one area we absolutely must protect is medical research at \nthe National Institutes of Health.\n  Over the last 10 years or more, we have made a concerted effort in \nAmerica to invest more money in medical research, to ultimately double \nthe amount of money going into medical research. It is a heroic effort, \nand it is the right thing to do under Presidents of both political \nparties because we understand how vulnerable each and every one of us \nand every member of our family could be with one diagnosis from a \ndoctor.\n  I salute the chairman of the committee, Senator Specter, and Ranking \nMember Harkin of Iowa. I can't find any stronger advocates for medical \nresearch than these two Senators.\n  The bill that we are considering that came to us from conference is a \nbill which turns its back on all the progress we have made by putting \nmoney into medical research. Unfortunately, this bill would result in \nour funding the National Institutes of Health at a level inconsistent \nwith the pattern of growth that we have seen over the last several \nyears.\n  Let me be as specific as I can. I have heard from people across \nIllinois about how important medical research is to them and their \nfamilies. My family knows that, and the families of everyone watching \nknow it, too.\n  Eight-year-old Claire Livingston, who is living with type II \ndiabetes, came by my office. More and more children are affected by \ndiabetes. Claire checks her blood glucose level several times a day and \nadjusts her medication, her diet, her activity levels. She is bright \nand happy. Her mother wakes her up in the middle of the night to make \nsure she is going to be alive in the morning.\n  That is the reality. They only ask one thing of me. Please make sure \nthat we continue the research into diabetes at the National Institutes \nof Health.\n  Autism: Are you aware of the fact that 1 out of every 165 children in \nAmerica now suffers from autism? I don't know why. We are not certain \nwhy.\n  Do we want to stop asking the important questions? You know the \nstruggle these children go through and their families go through to \ncope with their terrible disease. Why in the world would we step away \nfrom medical research funding in this area?\n  The autism research NIH supports is looking at biological factors \nthat cause autism but also looking at interventions--what works and \nwhat doesn't work. We owe it to the NIH to allow them to continue their \nwork. The list goes on and on.\n  Members of the Senate and the House are visited on a regular basis by \nindividuals and families who are suffering from diseases and maladies. \nThey ask us to do something, please--whether it is cancer or heart \nresearch or diabetes or asthma. Please make sure the funding levels \ncontinue.\n  NIH-supported research into muscular dystrophy is promising. Children \nare living longer. We cannot back off. We cannot lose sight of the \nenormous role that NIH research plays in the discovery of treatments \nand cures for the life-threatening illnesses that afflict millions of \nAmericans each year--such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke.\n  NIH research grants have moved us to the forefront of the world's \nscientific community. We take a backseat to no one when it comes to \nmedical research. If we pass budgets such as the ones sent to us by the \nNIH, we will be weakening our commitment.\n  The bill the House rejected just yesterday includes only a $150 \nmillion increase in National Institutes of Health funding, the lowest \nincrease in 36 years. You say to yourself, well, $150 million more in \nthese times cannot hurt. Considering the rate of biomedical inflation, \nwhat it costs to do research, this increase represents a cut in \nfunding. Assuming no change in committed resources, it means there will \nbe 505 fewer research projects next year at the National Institutes of \nHealth than there were this year.\n  Could one of those important projects, projects that have been \ncarefully evaluated, be that critical project for you, your family, \nyour children, or someone you love? If it is, is this not a false \neconomy, to cut this budget at this moment in our history? Can we \nreally afford to shortchange our Nation's premier research institution \nwhen illnesses such as heart disease and stroke continue to be leading \ncauses of death? When so many people are afflicted with so many forms \nof cancer? These diseases will cost our country $394 billion in medical \nexpenses and lost productivity in this your alone.\n  In simple dollar terms, the amount of money we are alleging we will \nsave by cutting medical research just means more people afflicted with \ndisease, more medical expenses for them and for our Nation.\n  Increased investment in NIH research can yield extraordinary \nbreakthroughs. We can maintain our leadership role in the world in \nmedical research. We can further the missions we have started at the \nNational Institutes of Health. We need to significantly increase \nmedical research funding, not back off. We need to support our Nation's \nresearchers. They need to know we stand behind them. These men and \nwomen working in the laboratories, as I stand and speak in the Senate, \nneed to know this budget process is not going to move from left to \nright and up and down. They need to know there is continuity and \ncommitment from our Government so they can dedicate their lives to this \nimportant work.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in charging the conferees to retain \nthe Senate language, which increases the budget of the National \nInstitutes of Health by $1 billion. A billion could not be better spent \nin this economy. Any who have had the misfortune of learning of a \nserious illness in the family say a little prayer to God, then try to \nfind the best doctor and hospital we can find. We walk into that \ndoctor's office, frightened with what we are about to hear, hoping that \ndoctor will say there is something we can do. If the doctor says they \nare not quite there yet, this illness that we are concerned about is \none that they do not have a\n\n[[Page S13291]]\n\ngrip on yet, we pray to God that someone somewhere in a laboratory \nconnected with medical research is trying to find that cure to save \nthat person we love so much.\n  Unlike most people who can just pray for that outcome, we can do \nsomething about it in the Senate. We can say that a national priority \nwill be medical research come hell or high water. We can say that we \nare not going to back out of a 36-year commitment to increase the \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health.\n  Some will argue there are higher priorities. There are some who \nbelieve tax cuts for wealthy Americans are much more important than \ndealing with medical research. Those ranks do not include this Senator. \nI believe medical research should be the highest priority. It has no \npartisan side to it. Republican and Democrats, people who do not vote, \nwe all get sick. We all pray there will be a commitment by this Senate \nand by this Nation for premier medical research to find cures for those \nillnesses.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield back all remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending motions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to requesting the yeas and \nnays on two motions concurrently?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: Do I have 5 minutes on the Durbin \nmotion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was just yielded back.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The time was yielded back?\n  Senator Durbin did not have the authority to yield back my time.\n  I understand he did not have that authority. I am obliged it was not \nSenator Durbin. It was unnamed conspirators that I will deal with \nlater.\n  I support the amendment of the Senator from Illinois to reinstate the \nSenate mark on the National Institutes of Health because the money is \nneeded. When you take in the inflation factor, NIH will be funded at a \nlower rate this year than last year.\n  The Senate has taken the lead, initiated by Senator Harkin and myself \nand our subcommittee, the full Committee of Appropriations, to more \nthan double NIH funding from $12 billion to $28 billion. The results \nhave been remarkable. We are on the vanguard of enormous advances on \nsome classifications of cancer, on the research on many maladies which \nconfront America.\n  It is something of sharper focus this year to me than in the past, \nalthough I have steadfastly supported NIH during my entire tenure in \nthe Senate. This is a modest addition. I believe this Senate will \ninstruct the conferees, and we will have more than 50 votes. The \ndifficult part is getting it done in conjunction with the House. It is \na good amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the last several weeks, those of us who \nserve on the Subcommittee on Health and Human Services have been trying \nto find adequate resources amongst other resources to fund LIHEAP, the \nmoney necessary to help low-income families provide for their comfort \nthis winter. I thought it would be an appropriate time to talk about \nthat for a little bit because I think Americans need to understand they \nare not without power to do a few simple things over the course of the \nnext several months of this winter to help themselves as it relates to \nthe heating of their own homes.\n  Americans spend more than $160 billion--that is right, $160 billion--\na year on heat, cooling, lights, and living in their homes. That is an \nawful lot of money. If most Americans are like I am, I would like to \nknow how I can bring that number down a little bit, how I might be able \nto tighten my belt a little or my family's budget a little bit during \nthis time of extremely high-priced energy.\n  We hear about record natural gas prices and 30- and 40- and 50-\npercent increases in heating bills this winter for those who heat with \nnatural gas. We know those who heat with home heating oil in the \nNortheast are going to pay substantially more. In the West and in the \npipelines of the West on which my home is connected, where there is \nmore gas, we are still going to be paying 25 or 30 percent more.\n  What might we do about it? Let me suggest a couple of things.\n  Do you know that if you lower your home heating thermostat by 2 \ndegrees--by 2 degrees--for every degree you lower it, you save 1 \npercent on your heating bill. We were told by experts recently who were \ntestifying before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, if every \nAmerican did that this winter, by spring, we could potentially have a \nsurplus in natural gas in the lower 48, and that in itself would drive \nprices down. Americans have power to help themselves if they simply \nwould turn their thermostats down by 2 degrees.\n  I am not going to do a ``Jimmy Carter'' on you by saying put on a \nsweater, but if you did turn your home heating thermostat down by 2 \ndegrees and if you did put on a sweater and if you are a couple living \nby yourself in a large home and you turn off the radiators in some of \nyour bedrooms that you are not using and close the doors, there could \nliterally be a dramatic savings across this country.\n  If you want to change your gas price experience at the pump, instead \nof driving 70 and 75 or 80 miles per hour on the freeway, why don't you \ngo back to 60 or 65? And if you turned it down and slowed it down, oil \nconsumption could drop in a day--a day--in this country by 1 million \nbarrels of consumption. That is the power of the American consumer if \nthe American consumer wants to do something about it instead of \npointing fingers and blaming--and there is plenty of that going around, \nand we deserve to take some of it. The consumer is not without power.\n  Let me suggest this in my time remaining. Senator Bingaman and I \nwould like to help in that effort. So we are going to provide \nconservation packages, packets of information to our colleagues' \noffices that they can send out in their letters to their constituents \nadvising and assisting in this kind of conservation effort. We hope you \ndo it. If every Senator and all Senate staffs turn off their computers \nwhen they go home at night--shut them down, hit the off switch, turn \nout the lights in your office. If that were done across America today, \nheating bills and energy bills would drop precipitously.\n  But we are in this mode of everything on, all the lights on, the \nthermostat turned up because we are still living in the memory of \nsurplus and inexpensive energy. That memory is gone. The reality is \nthat the world has changed significantly, and while we scramble to \ncatch up and provide increased availability of supply in the market--\nand that is what we are doing and that is what the national energy \npolicy passed in August is attempting to do--while that is happening, \nyou know what we can do: We can help ourselves.\n  So once again I say to America, turn your thermostat down a few \ndegrees, put on a sweater, shut portions of your house down and take \nliterally tens, if not hundreds, of dollars off your heating bill in \nthe course of a winter. If we do it collectively across America, by \nspring, natural gas prices could be down dramatically, and we would not \nsee the kind of job loss that is occurring today in the chemical \nindustry as large manufacturing plants are shut down simply because \nthey cannot afford the price of natural gas, and they are moving \nelsewhere in the world to produce their product.\n  We are building pipelines, we are drilling for more natural gas out \nWest and in the overthrust belts than we ever have before, and there \nare trillions of cubic feet available out there if we can get to it. We \nare making every effort to, and this administration is doing just that. \nIn the interim, in the reality of a cold winter, America, you can help \nyourself. America, you can drive a little slower, you can turn your \nthermostats down, and if we were all to do that collectively, it would \nhave a dramatic impact on the marketplace and on consumption.\n  Does it have to be mandated by law? Need there be a law to tell you \nthat you can save a little money by those actions? I would hope not. I \nwould hope that the wisdom of the pocketbook would suggest that we be \nprudent as to a procedure to follow.\n  Senator Bingaman and I are going to supply packets to the offices of \nour colleagues. We hope our colleagues will pass those on. We hope our \ncolleagues might take the time to do a public service announcement over \nthe course of the next month, talking to their folks at home about the \nopportunity and what is available. I think it is appropriate, and I \nthink it is the right thing to do.\n  Senator Bingaman and I have coalesced with industry to see if they \ncannot collectively begin to produce a greater message of clarity about \nthe opportunity in the marketplace to conserve and to save and, in so \ndoing, to lower the overall cost of energy and its impact upon the \nAmerican economy.\n  Want to give yourself a Christmas gift? Put on a sweater and turn the \nthermostat down 2 degrees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, yesterday, as all of us know, Jack Murtha, \none of the most respected Congressmen on military affairs, one of the \nmost respected Congressmen on national security issues, a former marine \ndrill sergeant and a decorated Vietnam veteran, spoke out on our policy \nin Iraq. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Congressman Murtha is not \nthe point. He did not come to this moment lightly. Any one of us who \nknows Congressman Murtha or anybody who has\n\n[[Page S13293]]\n\nworked with him over these years, Republican or Democrat, respects this \nman, respects his personal commitment to our country, respects his \nunderstanding of these issues, and understands he did not come to that \nmoment lightly.\n  He spoke his mind and he spoke his heart out of love for his country \nand out of absolute and total unconditional support for the troops, of \nwhich he was once one.\n  I do not intend to stand for, nor should any of us in the Congress \nstand for, another Swiftboat attack on the character of Jack Murtha. It \nfrankly disgusts me that a bunch of guys who never chose to put on the \nuniform of their country now choose in the most personal way, in the \nmost venomous, to question the character of a man who did wear the \nuniform of his country and who bled doing it. It is wrong. He served \nheroically in uniform. He served heroically for our country.\n  Have we lost all civility and all common sense in this institution \nand in this city? No matter what J.D. Hayworth says, there is no \nsterner stuff than the backbone and courage that defines Jack Murtha's \ncharacter and his conscience.\n  Dennis Hastert, the Speaker of the House, who never chose to put on \nthe uniform of his country and serve, called Jack Murtha a coward and \naccused him of wanting to cut and run. On its face, looking at the \nrecord, looking at his life, Jack Murtha has never cut and run from \nanything. Jack Murtha was not a coward when he put himself in harm's \nway for his country in Vietnam and he earned two Purple Hearts. He was \na patriot then and he is a patriot today. He deserves his views to be \nrespected, not vilified.\n  Jack Murtha did not cut and run when his courage earned him a Bronze \nStar, and his voice ought to be heard today, not silenced by those who \nwould actually choose to cut and run from the truth.\n  Just a day after Vice President Dick Cheney, who himself had five \ndeferments from service to his country because, as he said, he had \nother priorities than serving his country, just 1 day after he accused \nDemocrats of being unpatriotic, the White House accused Jack Murtha of \nsurrendering.\n  Jack Murtha served 37 years in the U.S. Marine Corps. Jack Murtha \ndoes not know how to surrender, not to enemy combatants and not to \npoliticians in Washington who say speaking one's conscience is \nunpatriotic.\n  The other day we celebrated what would have been the 80th birthday of \nRobert Kennedy. When Robert Kennedy opposed the war in Vietnam, despite \nthe fact that his brother and the administration he was in had been \ninvolved in articulating that policy, he talked about how there was \nblame enough to go around. He also said the sharpest criticism often \ngoes hand in hand with the deepest idealism and love of country.\n  Chuck Hagel showed that he has not forgotten that when he said: The \nBush administration must understand that each American has a right to \nquestion our policies in Iraq and should not be demonized for \ndisagreeing with them.\n  Too many people seem to have forgotten that long ago and too many of \nour friends on the other side of the aisle somehow think that asking \ntough questions is pessimism. It is not pessimism. It is patriotism. It \nis how one lives in a democracy. We are busy trying to take to Iraq and \ntake to Afghanistan and take to the world the democracy we love and we \nare somehow unwilling to fully practice it at home.\n  We have seen the politics of fear and smear too many times. Whenever \nchallenged, there are some Republican leaders who engage in the \npolitics of personal destruction rather than debate the issues. It does \nnot matter who one is. When they did it to John McCain, we saw that it \ndoes not matter what political party one is in. When they did it to Max \nCleland, we saw that it does not matter if one's service put them in a \nwheelchair. And when they did it to Jack Murtha yesterday, perhaps the \nmost respected voice on military matters in all of the Congress, we saw \nthat some in this administration and their supporters will go to any \nlengths to crush any dissent.\n\n  Once again, some are engaged in the lowest form of smear-and-fear \npolitics because I guess they are afraid of actually debating a senior \nCongressman who has advised Presidents of both parties on how to best \ndefend our country. They are afraid to debate the substance with a \nveteran who lives and breathes the concerns of our troops, not the \nempty slogans that sent our troops to war without adequate body armor, \nwithout adequate planning, without adequate strategy.\n  Maybe they are terrified of actually leveling with the American \npeople about the way that they did, in fact, mislead the country into \nwar or of admitting that they have no clear plan to finish the job and \nget our troops home.\n  Whether one agrees with Jack Murtha's policy statement yesterday is \nirrelevant. The truth is there is a better course for our troops and a \nbetter course for America in Iraq. The Senate itself went on record \nthis week as saying exactly that. Every Senator in this body voted one \nway or the other to express their feelings about Iraq.\n  I intend to keep fighting, along with a lot of other people, to make \ncertain we take that better course for the good of our country.\n  American families who have lost or who fear the loss of their loved \nones plain deserve to know the truth about what we have asked them to \ndo, what we are doing to complete the mission, and what we are doing to \nprevent our forces from being trapped in an endless quagmire. Our \nmilitary families understand--I mean, all one has to do is visit with \nthem when they come here and they talk about their sons, their \nhusbands, and their fathers who are over there. They are concerned and \nwant an open debate about what will best support the troops and how to \nget them home the fastest with the job done the most effectively.\n  The only way to get it done right in Iraq, the only way to get our \nsons and daughters home, is for all of us to weigh in on this issue. We \nalso need to be mindful that as the White House yet again engages in a \ncharacter assassination to stop Americans from listening to the words \nof a military expert and understanding the consequences, we need to \nunderstand the consequences of the road we have already traveled \nbecause when one looks at the road we have already traveled, it makes \nit even more imperative that we have this debate and engage in this \ndialogue.\n  It is a stunning and tragic journey that on many different occasions \neven defies fundamental common sense and leaves a trail of broken \npromises. From the very start, when we were talking about what it might \ncost or not cost, when an administration official suggested it would \ncost $200 billion, he was fired, not listened to. When people wondered \nhow we would pay for the war and we were told the oil will pay for it, \nwhile others were saying the oil infrastructure was not sufficient to \npay for it, they were not listened to. When the administration could \nhave listened to General Shinseki and actually put in enough troops to \nmaintain order, they chose not to. When they could have learned from \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush and built a genuine global coalition so we \nhad the world with us, not most of the world questioning us or against \nus, they chose not to. When they could have implemented a detailed \nState Department plan for reconstructing post-Saddam Iraq, they chose \nnot to. When they could have protected American forces and prevented \nour kids from getting blown up by ammunition that was in the dumps of \nSaddam Hussein and in the various locations our military were aware of, \nthey chose not to. Instead of guarding those ammunition dumps and \narmories, they chose not to. When they could have imposed immediate \norder and structure in Baghdad after the fall of Saddam, Secretary \nRumsfeld shrugged his shoulders and said, Baghdad was safer than \nWashington, DC, and they chose not to take action.\n  When the administration could have kept an Iraqi army selectively \nintact, they chose not to. When they could have kept an entire civil \nstructure functioning in order to deliver basic services to Iraqi \ncitizens, they chose not to. When they could have accepted the offers \nof the nations and individual countries to provide on-the-ground \npeacekeepers, reconstruction assistance, they chose not to. When they \nshould have leveled with the American people that the insurgency had in \nfact grown, they chose not to. Vice President Cheney even absurdly \nclaimed\n\n[[Page S13294]]\n\nthat the insurgency was in its last throes.\n  All of these mistakes tell us something. They scream out for a \ndebate. They scream out for a dialogue. They scream out for a policy \nthat gets it right.\n  We are in trouble today precisely because of a policy of cut and run \nwhere the administration made the wrong choice to cut and run from \nestablished procedures of gathering intelligence and of how it is \nevaluated and shared with the Congress; to cut and run from the best \nmilitary advice; to cut and run from sensible wartime planning; to cut \nand run from their responsibility to properly arm and protect our \ntroops; to cut and run from history's clear lessons about the Middle \nEast and about Iraq itself; to cut and run from common sense. That is \nthe debate some people appear to want to avoid in this country.\n  Instead of letting his cronies verbally blast away, the President \nought to finally find the will to debate the real issue instead of \ndestroying anyone who speaks truth to power as they see it.\n  It is time for Americans to stand up and fight back against this kind \nof politics and make it clear that it is unacceptable to do this to any \nleader of any party anywhere in our country at any time. We can \ndisagree, but we do not have to engage in this kind of personal attack \nand personal destruction.\n  I hope my colleagues will come to the floor and engage in this \ndebate. Our country will be stronger for it. That is what we ought to \ndo instead of attacking the character of a man such as Jack Murtha. \nBelieve me, that is a fight nobody is going to win in our America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent to consume such time as I may take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to speak in a moment about the \nPATRIOT Act, but before I do, I want to respond to a couple of comments \nthat were made by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I served with Congressman Murtha when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, and there is no greater patriot in the United States \nthan Congressman Murtha. In that, the Senator from Massachusetts and I \nagree. I disagree with Congressman Murtha's opinions, but that is a \nmatter of debate and that is one of the reasons we have the kind of \nopen society that we do.\n  I do not think anyone is trying to crush debate or dissent or prevent \nquestions from being asked. But it is a fact that when the President of \nthe United States is accused of deliberate manipulation of intelligence \nto bring us into war--some have even said lied in order to bring us \ninto war--that deserves response. That is part of a healthy debate.\n  When the President spoke in response, I think he was entitled to be \nlistened to and not ridiculed and not condemned for criticizing those \nwho disagreed with him. Neither side need back away from making their \narguments and arguing that the other side is wrong. But of course no \none should be questioning anyone else's patriotism. It is assumed \nanyone who serves this Government, and certainly anyone who has put on \nthe uniform of this Government, is a patriot. In the case of \nCongressman Murtha, I would be the first to assert that fact.\n  I think there are two critical facts with respect to this dispute. \nThe first set of facts is that our intelligence, and that of virtually \nevery other nation in the world, believed that Saddam Hussein was a \nthreat to the world and had weapons of mass destruction and in some \ncases was developing capability for additional weapons of mass \ndestruction, such as nuclear weapons. Some of that intelligence turned \nout not to be correct. But it does not mean that the people who debated \nthe issues were liars or deliberately misrepresenting the facts. I \ndaresay, if you took comments I made on the floor of the Senate and \ncomments the Senator from Massachusetts made on the floor of the \nSenate, they would align pretty closely. They were pretty similar \nbecause they were based on the same intelligence. The same thing was \nsaid by other Democrats and Republicans, by people in the \nadministration, by people in the former administration. I do not think \nit is appropriate to assign deliberate motives to mislead to any of \nthose people.\n  I myself believe that the information was not correct with respect to \nthe weapons of mass destruction but that the people who were giving it \nto us honestly believed it was correct. So I don't even think the \npeople in the CIA were deliberately misleading anyone, though they \nturned out to be wrong. Can't we agree that people make mistakes, \nespecially with respect to that murky area of intelligence where \nnothing is ever black and white, where everyone is always gathering \nbits and pieces of information and trying to construct a jigsaw puzzle \nout of it when a lot of pieces are missing and where the enemy is \ndeliberately trying to deceive you? It is very difficult business. \nWhile I am somewhat critical, as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, of the people who were engaged in the activity at the time, \nI don't question their motives either.\n  The other fact that I think is true is that it would be wrong for us \nto leave Iraq now. This is where I would disagree with Congressman \nMurtha. I believe the consequences of leaving or setting up a timetable \nto leave soon, before the job is done, would not only be absolutely \ndevastating for the people in Iraq who have been trying to set up their \nown government but would also set us back in the war against these \nterrorists, these evildoers, these radical Islamists who are watching \nvery carefully what we do in Iraq. When you remember what Saddam \nHussein said about the weak horse and the strong horse, you know how \nimportant it is for the United States to maintain a firm, strong \nposition with respect to completing the job in Iraq.\n  To the extent that there is a suggestion that we will back out if \nthey keep enough pressure on us, it does play into their hands because \nthey simply play the waiting game in order to wait us out until they \ncan move in and do more evil deeds. That is where I think the debate \ncomes down. It is a legitimate debate to have, but I think the \nPresident is on the right side of that debate. We have to finish the \njob before we withdraw.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I respect the comments of the Senator and I \nappreciate the way he has approached it and I am grateful to him and \nthank him, as I am sure others do, for his comments about Congressman \nMurtha. I know he would agree with me that those who suggested what he \nis saying is cowardly or suggested that is surrender, that those are \nwords probably inappropriate in this debate. I think the Senator would \nagree with me that those characterizations have no place here. And he \nis right about the question of how everybody approached the \nintelligence. We all did have a unified belief about the existence of \nweapons--most of us.\n  But I disagree with the Senator. I would ask him if he does not agree \nthat there are legitimate areas of inquiry, which the Intelligence \nCommittee is now pursuing, with respect to what happened to certain \nintelligence that came to the Congress? For instance--about five areas. \nOne was the speech that was made by the President, where he referenced \nnuclear materials coming from Africa which, in fact, the CIA on three \ndifferent occasions, both verbally and in writing, informed the White \nHouse: Don't use this. But nevertheless it was used.\n  Whether that was intentional or inadvertent, all we know is that \nwinds up being misleading because the CIA disagreed with the evidence.\n  Likewise, telling America they could deliver biological, chemical \nweapons within the period of 45 minutes, which was disagreed with in \nthe intelligence community, was not signed off within the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Likewise, suggesting Iraq had trained al-Qaida in the creation of \nbombs, bomb making, and poison creation--not agreed by the intelligence \ncommunity; in fact, erroneous.\n  Likewise, as the Vice President said on several occasions, that there \nwas a meeting between Iraq and al-Qaida operatives, a meeting that the \nintelligence community did not substantiate, which we now know did not \ntake place.\n\n[[Page S13295]]\n\n  Those are, on their face, misleading representations made to us, \nwhich Members of the Congress operated on. I would assume the Senator \nwould agree the mere fact that there were no weapons of mass \ndestruction means we were all misled. Whether it was intentional is the \noperative question.\n  I can't tell you whether it was intentional. But I certainly know \nthat when you ignore the CIA's warnings, don't use this intelligence, \nand nevertheless it winds up in the State of the Union message, there \nis a disconnect that raises the most serious questions, that leaves a \nlot of us wondering.\n  I ask the Senator, does he not agree that those instances where the \nintelligence community is in disagreement and they don't tell us they \nare in disagreement and we don't get the same intelligence, provides \nsome serious questions?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I was very happy to have the Senator from \nMassachusetts take a long time to make a lot of points, asking an \nimportant question. Therefore, I am happy to engage in what amounts to \na debate on the issue. I would be delighted to comment on the specifics \nthat he points out.\n  I served on the Intelligence Committee for 8 years during this period \nof time and have a fair degree of information about it. I need to \nreflect a little bit carefully about what one can now say because, \nafter a while, you realize, when you are on the committee, it is better \nnot to say a lot because it might be one of the things you should not \nbe talking about. But I think I should speak to each of these items.\n  The last one first. No, I don't agree that being in error is the same \nas misleading. I don't think that the people in the intelligence \nagencies were misleading us. They were, in some instances, in error. \nFrequently, they expressed their views with caveats and degrees of \ncertainty that, frankly, are not reflected in the public debate.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me make my point here. They have a very careful way of \nexpressing their views. In the public debate, I have noted the \npolitical people are not nearly as nuanced and careful in expressing \nthese views as the member of the intelligence community is.\n  Second, with respect to that, ordinarily the way that views were \nexpressed to us, and specifically in this case, they represented the \nmajority opinion or the consensus within the intelligence community. \nWhere there were significant questions or differences of opinion within \nthe intelligence community, those were noted and sometimes with respect \nto some issues, there were divisions. Without getting into a lot of \ndetail, there has been a lot of talk about another issue that the \nSenator did not raise, the so-called aluminum tubes. Without getting \ninto a big debate about it, you had the majority of the intelligence \ncommunity believing that those were for one purpose related to \nproduction of nuclear materials. And you had a couple of other agencies \nthat had expertise in the area saying they didn't think so.\n  I am not sure that anyone has ever concluded which were actually \ncorrect, or not, but a lot of information has been thrown out that \nclearly the majority opinion was wrong. I don't know that one can say \nthat.\n  So I think we have to be careful. There are frequently, in \nintelligence estimates, little caveats: We are not sure how good this \nparticular source is; we are not sure about this particular element.\n  But usually a consensus is reached. That consensus is what was \nbriefed to us and that is what we were relying on. With respect to the \nfour specific points--with respect to the issue of yellow cake coming \nfrom Niger, it was a fact that the intelligence the United States had \nwas not nearly as conclusive as the intelligence from Great Britain, \nand therefore the President was advised--not the President himself \ndirectly but his speechwriters were advised--not to suggest that our \nintelligence confirmed the attempts of Iraq to acquire this nuclear \nmaterial from Niger but rather to refer to a different intelligence \nservice which, in fact, had concluded that the attempt had been made. \nThat was the British service and that was the reference in the speech. \nThe British service still stands by its position.\n  With respect to the bioweapons, there was very good evidence to \nsuggest, prior to the war, that Saddam Hussein not only had a viable \nbioterrorism program but that he had even mobilized--in one respect, \nmobilized that program.\n  I am not certain we can say, from the Senate floor, how we have \nfinally evaluated the intelligence with respect to that. I think it \nwould be probably difficult for any Senator to discuss the issue in \ngreat length. I would be willing to acknowledge that, certainly, \nquestions have been raised about whether it turns out that there were \nmobile units devoted to creation of bioweapons.\n\n  Third, with respect to the intelligence that Iraq agents had actually \ninstructed terrorists in bomb making and poison making, that \ninformation was very clear. It was issued by CIA Director George Tenet. \nIt was public information, so that can be discussed on the floor of the \nSenate, and I am aware of nothing that draws any question about that \nparticular evidence. I do not recall whether it specifically related to \nal-Qaida or terrorists or al-Qaida-connected terrorists. I probably \nshould not speak to that issue because I am not certain how much is \nclassified. But it is absolutely certain in public testimony, and in a \nletter George Tenet specifically sent to the Congress he discussed the \nissue of Iraq training terrorist bomb makers in the art of chemical \nweapon-making.\n  Finally, in regard to this alleged meeting that never actually \noccurred, if it is the meeting in Czechoslovakia that the Senator was \nreferring to, that is a matter of dispute. I don't think it has ever \nbeen resolved one way or the other.\n  The point of all of this is it is one thing to say the intelligence \nwas inconclusive and in some cases that there were disputes in the \nintelligence community and in some cases it was not accurate. It is \nquite another to allege that the people who used the intelligence were \nmisleading other people.\n  Certainly, I was not deliberately misleading anyone, and I am certain \nthe Senator from Massachusetts was not deliberately misleading anyone \nwhen we said roughly the same thing based upon the same intelligence \nthat suggested that Saddam Hussein was a threat and had weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The final point on this, and then I do want to turn to the PATRIOT \nAct, there is a bit of a double standard in that critics of the \nadministration are now saying: You can't just look to the consensus \nopinion, you need to look at some of those within the intelligence \ncommunity who were dissenting about certain aspects of intelligence, \nthe so-called nuggets. If you look deeply into this report, you will \nfind there was some element of it that did not quite jibe with the rest \nof the consensus or there was some entity in our Government that didn't \ntotally agree with the consensus opinion. As I said, you are going to \nsee that through any national intelligence estimate or any other \ndescription of intelligence analysis.\n  We encourage that. One of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and \nthe other commissions that have looked into this, is that there is not \nenough devil's advocacy going on. There is too much ``group think'' \nwithin the intelligence community. So it is a good thing to have that \nintelligence questioned.\n  I remember there was actually criticism of Vice President Cheney \nbecause he went down to the CIA headquarters and had the temerity to \nask these agents: Are you sure about this? Are you sure about this \nintelligence?\n  They said: What's he doing that for?\n  He is a so-called consumer of the intelligence. He has every right to \nsay: Are you absolutely sure of this?\n  People within the administration should be questioning as well. That \nis why I think it is so unfortunate that there is, literally, a cabal \nto attack the Defense Department for questioning some of the \nintelligence community's estimates--not all of which turned out to be \nright, as we know. But there is an investigation that has been actually \nformally requested. In order to get it resolved, the Defense Department \nhas agreed to conduct an inspector general's investigation into one of \nthe offices of the Department of Defense, into the question of whether \nit should have questioned the intelligence of the\n\n[[Page S13296]]\n\nCIA and taken its analysis and its questions to other people within the \nDefense Department or the national security apparatus of the \nadministration.\n  Why not? The whole point of these commission recommendations is \npeople ought to be asking questions. The CIA is not a monastery of \nmonks who get manipulated intelligence that nobody else ever looks at. \nThe whole point of gathering intelligence is so our policymakers can \nuse it and make decisions based upon it. When the policymakers have \nquestions about it, they have every right to ask those questions. And \nwhen there is some evidence that suggests the intelligence is not \nexactly accurate, they have a duty to raise that kind of issue.\n  There is a bit of a double standard going on that when one wants to \ncriticize the administration and wants to play devil's advocate, there \nwas a little bit of evidence over here that contradicted the consensus \nin the community, and we should have paid more attention to that. Maybe \nso. You can't turn around and criticize those, in this case, in the \nDepartment of Defense who saw the same infirmities, and who had \nquestions about the CIA intelligence and now are being criticized \nbecause they had the temerity to raise those questions. You can't have \nit both ways.\n  In reality, intelligence is an imperfect proposition at best, and we \nought to be playing devil's advocate and be asking tough questions \nabout it. But I daresay, unless you get very good evidence that someone \nwas deliberately lying or misleading, you shouldn't throw those kinds \nof words around.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I hope every Senator was listening to Senator Kyl's \nexplanation of the important issues that have been raised. I hope the \nAmerican people are listening. He served on the Intelligence Committee. \nHe has been through these debates from the very beginning. He is a man \nof integrity, and he will be responsible in summarizing the matters \nthat came before us.\n  He indicated that we hear allegations that things were black and \nwhite, when those of us who heard the briefings didn't hear them that \nway. They weren't black and white. The aluminum tubes--I ask the \nSenator from Arizona, regardless of the detail of it, whether he heard \nfrom those who debriefed us and got various opinions about that issue, \nand we were not misled. We were told there were various ways to \ninterpret that evidence, were we not?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say that is exactly right. In fact, the \nNational Intelligence Estimate itself specifically characterized the \ndissenting as well as the majority views with respect to what those \ntubes were for. The majority view was that they were for centrifuge, \nfor weapons material production. The minority view was they might be \nfor artillery shells, or some other kind of projectile. There were two \nagencies within our government that held that latter view. The majority \nof the intelligence community held the former view.\n  But, yes, I remember as a member of the committee being briefed on \nthat and hearing testimony on it numerous times.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That was before 78 Members of this body--a majority of \nthe Democratic Members along with a majority and maybe all of the \nRepublicans--voted to authorize hostilities in Iraq.\n  Mr. KYL. That is true.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We knew these subtleties and disagreements, and we were \ngiven the best estimate that the intelligence agency was given.\n  Let me ask the Senator this: The CIA is the Central Intelligence \nAgency. The Senator talked about the contradiction between saying at \none point you should follow one or the other, or the minority opinion. \nIs one of the responsibilities of the CIA to review all intelligence \nand help advise the President, as that central agency, what he should \ntake as reliable?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama is absolutely \ncorrect. There is an important factor the American people need to \nunderstand. There is not just one intelligence agency, the CIA; there \nare lots of different elements of our Government gathering information, \na lot of it secret information. They meet as a group to try to put this \ntogether and to reach a consensus. But when the estimates are briefed \nto us and to the President, they try to arrive at a consensus. \nFrequently, that consensus is less certain because there are some \ndissenting views that characterize the consensus. Doubts are expressed \nin certain technical ways.\n  It is one thing for the community to say it is the community's \njudgment; of course, that is stepping down from saying we know it as a \nfact. A judgment is not fact, it is an opinion. Then there are further \ngradations down. We are exposed to those same--these are all footnoted. \nWe all know who believed what. But at the end of the day, in order for \nus to get good advice, they try to put it together in a form that \nreaches a conclusion. Sometimes because there are differences within \nthe intelligence community, those conclusions are not as certain or as \ncertainly expressed as they are on other occasions because of that \nuncertainty.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is beautifully expressed. I think that is so \nimportant for us to know.\n  I want to drive home one point. The Senator from Massachusetts and \nother Senators have been complaining about these matters. I remember \nthe briefings we attended. Every Senator was invited. Every Senator had \nthe right to ask questions. People stayed late, if they chose to, and \nasked additional questions. They were given these nuanced opinions. It \nwas only after all that, was it not, that this Senate, after full \ndebate, voted to authorize military actions in Iraq.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama is correct. I would \nsay that we should not make too much of these nuance opinions and \ndisagreements. In one sense, they are important; but in another sense, \nyou have to balance that against the fact that there was a mountain of \nevidence in different areas that all add up to the same proposition. \nAnd add to that--some of that turned out not to be correct--but add to \nthat the element of judgment.\n  This can't be overemphasized. Intelligence analysts apply judgments \nand common sense to the evidence that they have. Because the evidence \nis rarely black and white, you very rarely get the bad guy to say, I \nwill tell you everything I know, and it is everything you need to know \nabout this. So you have to exercise judgment.\n  After the first gulf war, we later learned that Saddam Hussein was \nabout 6 months away from having a nuclear weapon program. That is fact \nNo. 1.\n  Fact No. 2: Throughout the ensuing decade, he hid his programs. He \ntried to deceive the inspectors. He refused to comply with U.N. \nresolutions to release information. One could, therefore, surmise--or \nat least it would not be a bad presumption to engage in--that if he had \nit at one point, or almost had it, we had evidence he was trying to get \nit. Again, he was hiding the ball at every opportunity. The \nintelligence analysts have to say, Which way am I going to presume \nthis, that he does or that he doesn't? They concluded that there is \nevery indication that we had better assume that he does.\n\n  The policymakers have to take that a step further. We say they are \nnot absolutely certain; they are pretty sure, but they are not \nabsolutely certain which way we should flop on this. Should we flop to \nthe direction of inaction? Let's wait until we have absolute proof \nbefore we do anything, or go the other way? This is pretty dangerous \nbusiness. If, in fact, he has, we had better act now before it is too \nlate.\n  We think we will take the action that is based upon the proposition \nthat he will have it. That is a judgment that we engaged in.\n  As my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, so eloquently has pointed \nout, the choice was when, not if, we would face Saddam Hussein. The \nquestion was, would we do it on his terms or on ours? We chose to do it \non ours. The result is Saddam Hussein today stands trial for mass \nmurder. The Iraqi people have an opportunity for freedom, and we have \nan opportunity to transform that region of the world into one that \nsupports peace and opposes evildoers and terrorists as opposed to one \nwhich was a hot bed when Saddam Hussein was in charge.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator for his \nthoughtful\n\n[[Page S13297]]\n\nand thorough analysis of how we came to know what we knew and how we \ncame to make the decisions about matters that came before us. We think \nthere is no doubt that Saddam Hussein used weapons of mass destruction \nagainst his own people. We know that. That is indisputable. Where it \nwent subsequently I don't know, and people are shocked that we have not \nfound them. We know that the French intelligence agency--the French \nGovernment opposed our entry into the war--believed he had weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Those matters were very important. And what I am so glad about is \npeople have heard what Senator Kyl said and discussed, which is \nrelevant to this Senate. We knew these things, fellow Senators. We \ndiscussed these things. Grown people make decisions based on the best \nevidence they have.\n  We had many hearings, top secret briefings, and every Senator could \ngo. We heard the argument. We heard the evidence. We cross-examined, \nand we heard the uncertainties and certain levels expressed by the \nauthorities that came before us. Then we came into this body and we \nvoted to send our soldiers to execute our policy in harm's way. And we \nowe those soldiers our support. We don't need to be undermining the \nPresident, or even ourselves and our system, as in this circumstance \nmaking the policy. We voted by a 78-to-22 vote to make it more \ndifficult to achieve and to place our soldiers at greater risk.\n  I thank the Senator for his wonderful comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13297-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13297-S13300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to get to the matter I came to speak \non, the PATRIOT Act.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts spoke to us about having respect for \none of our colleagues in the other body who is, in fact, a patriot and \nwho certainly should never be called a coward.\n  I also want to ask that same deference to those in the Defense \nDepartment and others who were doing their duty for our country, who \ncould have been in the private sector making a lot of money and taking \ncare of their families but chose to serve their country in another way \nin later life by acting on behalf of all of us in matters of national \nsecurity. The Secretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Doug \nFife, who headed the office I spoke of, these are patriots. And for \nanyone to suggest that someone like Doug Fife or Don Rumsfeld or Paul \nWolfowitz were misleading anyone is, frankly, about as low as you can \nget. And even loose words such as ``unlawful'' have been thrown about.\n  This is a very bad state of affairs that we have come to when that is \nthe kind of discourse we have in talking about people who have served \nour country honorably. I hope my colleagues will join me in trying to \nelevate the rhetoric rather than taking it down further. And that \napplies to everybody--Democrat and Republican Members of Congress, or \nthe administration.\n  I came to talk about the PATRIOT Act. I would like to make some \ncomments because we are in the middle of a big debate in the Senate and \nHouse about the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. If we don't \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act, all of the tools that we have given to our \nlaw enforcement and intelligence community to help us win the war on \nterror are going to--not quite, but most of those tools will cease to \nexist. They will expire. That is why we have to reauthorize it.\n  Just as it is important for us to give the men and women in the \nmilitary the tools they need in the missions we send them on, the war \non terror, so, too, it is for us to ensure our law enforcement and our \nintelligence people have the tools they need to carry out the mission \nthat we ask of them.\n  In the war on terror, intelligence and the ability to use it in the \nlaw enforcement community are critical to our success.\n  One of the greatest things we accomplished after 9/11 in passing the \nPATRIOT Act was to tear down the wall that had been created between our \nintelligence-gathering organizations and law enforcement. They couldn't \ntalk to each other. One could gather information, but they couldn't \ngive it to the other, and vice versa.\n  As a result, neither were able to do their job in getting information \nabout terrorists and putting out that information to proper and good \nuse.\n  There is virtually no disagreement that I know of that this part of \nthe PATRIOT Act has been critical to our success since 9/11. Yet there \nare those on both sides of the aisle in this body who are threatening \nto hold up the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act because they haven't \ngotten their way on every little thing that they want, and some of them \ndon't even know what the conference committee has been negotiating. I \nam on that conference committee and I know what we have discussed, and \nI know what is still a matter of issue out there.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the PATRIOT Act because there is a \ngreat deal of ignorance about what this important tool does for our war \non terror. And we cannot be ignorant, even though it is a matter of law \nand a little bit complicated. We don't have the luxury of being \nignorant about this. We have to understand it to appreciate it.\n  I will speak to that for a little bit.\n  I believe, like some great controversies of the time, history books \nwill record that the controversy over the PATRIOT Act was actually \nsomething we will look back on and say, What was all the fuss about? It \nis a little bit like when President Reagan talked about tearing down \nthe wall and calling the Soviets the ``Evil Empire.'' There was great \nhandwringing. This was not going to be good for our foreign policy. We \nlook back on it now and say, What was all the fuss about? He was right. \nIt was a good thing.\n  Those who are threatening to hold up the reauthorization of the \nPATRIOT Act should have pretty much the same words spoken to them about \nthe wall. This time we are talking about the wall between intelligence \nand law enforcement. I say to them, ``Tear down this wall.'' We did it \nin the PATRIOT Act. They are about to let the PATRIOT Act expire \nbecause they have some view that every little thing they want has not \ngotten accomplished in the PATRIOT Act.\n  This is important business. For those who are threatening to prevent \nthe reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, I challenge them to come to the \nSenate today, tomorrow. I will be here. Let's have the debate.\n  What are the big deals in the PATRIOT Act? The biggest is the wall \ncoming down, as I said. There is no disagreement about that. Yet, it is \ngoing to go right back up if we do not act.\n  The second provision in the PATRIOT Act that people have focused on \nis the so-called section 215 which allows a FISC, Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, to issue subpoenas to produce business records. \nThat authority has been in the law for a long time. But we added it to \nthe PATRIOT Act in order to allow the FBI to seek an order from this \nspecial court that was created for:\n\n       . . . the production of tangible things (including books, \n     records, papers, documents, and other items) for an \n     investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information.\n\n  Not to obtain foreign intelligence information. And FISC defines \n``foreign intelligence'' as information relating to foreign espionage, \nforeign sabotage, or international terrorism.\n  Section 215 is basically a form of subpoena authority, such as that \nallowed for numerous other types of investigation. A subpoena is merely \na request for particular information. Unlike a warrant--and this is \nimportant--a subpoena does not allow a government agent to enter \nsomebody's property and take things. It is only a request. If the \nrecipient objects, the Government must go to court and defend the \nsubpoena and seek an order for its enforcement. Most Federal agencies \nhave the authority to issue subpoenas, and many agencies have multiple \nsubpoena authorities.\n  The Justice Department has identified over 335 different subpoena \nauthorities in the United States Code. One can hardly contend that \nalthough the Federal Government can use subpoenas to investigate \nMohammed Atta if it suspects he is committing Medicare fraud that it \nshould not be allowed to use the same powers if it suspects he is \nplanning to fly airplanes into buildings. What sense would that make?\n  Some critics argue that most of the existing authorities are \ndifferent because section 215 subpoenas do not relate to heavily \nregulated industries\n\n[[Page S13298]]\n\nlike some of the other subpoenas. But even subpoenas issued to \ninvestigate the industries are used to request information from persons \noutside the industry. For example, the Small Business Administration is \nauthorized to use subpoenas to aid its fraud investigations. When it \nuses that subpoena, it can and often does request information from \nothers doing business--from anyone doing business--with the recipient \nof the SBA loan.\n  In one important way, the authority in section 215 of the PATRIOT Act \nis even narrower than the authority given by most subpoena statutes. \nThis is critical. Unlike these other authorities, a section 215 order \nmust be preapproved by a judge. Many people who debate the PATRIOT Act \nignore this or do not know it. They say, you do not even have to get a \ncourt order. It must be preapproved by a judge. Even grand jury \nsubpoenas, despite their name, are simply issued by a prosecutor \nconducting a grand jury investigation with no judicial review prior to \ntheir issuance.\n  Chief among the complaints made by critics of this section is that it \ncould be used to obtain records from bookstores or libraries. Some of \nthese critics have even alleged that section 215 would allow the FBI to \ninvestigate someone simply because of the book he borrows from the \nlibrary. Section 215 could, in fact, be used to obtain library records, \nthough neither it nor any other provision of the PATRIOT Act \nspecifically mentioned libraries or in any way is directed at \nlibraries. Section 215 does authorize court orders to produce tangible \nrecords and that could theoretically include library records.\n  Where the critics are wrong is in suggesting a section 215 order \ncould be obtained because of the books that someone reads or Web sites \nhe visits. Section 215 allows no such thing. Instead, it allows an \norder to obtain tangible things as part of an investigation to obtain \nforeign intelligence information, information relating to foreign \nespionage or terrorism or relating to a foreign government or group and \nnational security.\n  By requiring a judge to approve such an order, section 215 assures \nthese orders will not be used for an improper purpose. And as an added \nprotection against abuse, the PATRIOT Act also requires that the FBI \nfully inform the House of Representatives and the Senate every 6 \nmonths. These checks and safeguards leave FBI agents little room for \nthe types of witch hunts the PATRIOT Act critics conjure up. Any use of \nthe subpoenas, in other words, must be reported to us.\n  Further, and I ask Members to think about this for a moment, \nespecially in view of some of the criticism that has been leveled at \nthe act, I would like to emphasize there are very good and legitimate \nreasons why an intelligence or criminal investigation might extend to a \nbookstore or a library. One example former Deputy Attorney General \nComey has cited is the investigation of the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. \nRemember that the Unabomber's brother had relayed to Federal agents his \nsuspicion that Ted Kaczynski was behind this decades-long string of \nmail bomb attacks. At the time, the Unabomber had recently published \nthis manifesto which cited several obscure and ancient texts. In order \nto confirm the brother's suspicions, Federal agents subpoenaed Ted \nKaczynski's library records and discovered that, in fact, he had \nchecked out these same obscure texts cited in the manifesto.\n  Section 215 also could have been used directly to investigate the \nperpetrators of the September 11 attacks. How so? We now know that in \nAugust of 2001 individuals using Internet accounts registered to Nawaf \nal Hazmi and Khalid al Midhar used public access to computers in the \nlibrary of a State college in New Jersey. The computers in the library \nwere used to shop for and review airline tickets on an Internet travel \nreservation site. Al Hazmi and Al Midhar were hijackers aboard American \nAirlines flight 77 which took off from Dulles Airport and crashed into \nthe Pentagon.\n\n  The last documented visit to the library occurred on August 20, 2001. \nOn that occasion, records indicate that a person using Al Hazmi's \naccount used the library's computer to review September 11 reservations \nhe had previously booked.\n  In August of 2001, Federal agents knew that al Midhar and al Hazmi \nhad entered the United States. They initiated a search for these \nindividuals because they knew they were associated with al-Qaida. Had \nthe investigators caught the trail of these individuals--and by the \nway, one of the criticisms in the 9/11 Commission Report was that our \nGovernment did not adequately pursue these two individuals; that there \nwas a lot of evidence they could have pieced together. They didn't \nfollow it. They let them out of their sights, at which point they were \ngone. They knew they were here, but they could not find them. Had they \nfollowed the trail of the individual and had the PATRIOT Act already \nbeen law, the investigators would have likely used a section 215 to use \nthe library records to see the Internet trail, and history might well \nbe different.\n  Finally, over half a dozen reports submitted by the Inspector General \nof the Department of Justice have uncovered no instances of abuse \ninvolving section 215. The latest public report indicates this \nauthority has been used approximately three dozen times--not all \nrelated to libraries, of course. Section 215 is not used very often. \nBut we know that when Federal agents do use it, it is for an important \npurpose. I cannot imagine that any one of us would want to stop Federal \nagents from using section 215 in the way it has been used.\n  There were those who said we should have some additional restrictions \non section 215; even though it is an important tool, we need it further \nrestricted. So the conference committee said, all right, let's first \nmake sure we have a new statutory relevance standard so there is no \nquestion the information obtained has got to be relevant to the foreign \nintelligence investigation.\n  Another concession made was that there would be a three-part \nadditional test which would be put in place to presume relevancy if you \ncan satisfy this three-part test. It is going to further complicate \nthings, further delay things. It is not going to be easy for the \nJustice Department to prove.\n  Moreover, another layer of bureaucracy was imposed with so-called \nminimization standards. The Department of Justice would be required to \nput into regulation limits on how long the material could be kept, who \nit could be given to, and so on and so on.\n  Those who had concerns about section 215 brought those concerns \nforward and those have been negotiated. I know of no further issue \nrelating to section 215 in the conference that Members of either side \nof the aisle have brought forward. So those of my colleagues who have \nsaid we are going to filibuster the conference report on the PATRIOT \nAct because, among other things, it has this section about library \nrecords. They ought to get informed about the section, and they also \nought to appreciate the fact that the people who have negotiated this \non both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Capitol, have \nconcluded they are now done with this section. We have put everything \nin there we need to to further ensure it can never be abused, but we \nwant to retain it as an important part of our tools in fighting \nterrorism.\n  The second of the three sections I discuss is section 213, the \ndelayed notice searches. This is the so-called ``sneak and peek'' \nsearch. It is an unfortunate name. Section 213 of the act merely \ncodifies judicial common law, allowing investigators to delay giving \nnotice to the target of a search that a search warrant has been \nexecuted against him. Section 213 allows delayed notice of a search for \nevidence of any Federal criminal offense if a Federal court finds \nreasonable cause to believe that immediate notice may result in \nendangering the life or physical safety of an individual, flight from \nprosecution, destruction, or tampering with evidence, intimidation of \npotential witnesses, or would otherwise seriously jeopardize the \ninvestigation. Notice still must be provided within a reasonable period \nof the warrant's execution, though this period may be extended for good \ncause.\n  The ACLU, in particular, has been critical of section 213. One might \nthink an organization seeking to find fault with this section that \ndeals with the war on terrorism might focus on something other than \nthis particular PATRIOT provision because all it does is codify \nauthority that has been allowed\n\n[[Page S13299]]\n\nby the Federal courts for several decades. This is not new. The ACLU \nalleges that section 213 expands the Government's ability to search \nprivate property without notice to the owner. It also states that \nsection 213:\n\n       . . . mark[s] a sea of change in the way search warrants \n     are executed in the United States.\n\n  And it finally has charged that as a result of the section 213 \nauthorization of delayed notice, ``you may never know what the \ngovernment has done.''\n  None of these allegations is true. First, the target of a delayed \nnotice search will always eventually ``know what the government has \ndone'' because section 213 expressly requires that the Government give \nthe target notice of the execution of the warrant ``within a reasonable \nperiod of its execution.'' Section 213 clearly and explicitly \nauthorized only delayed notice, not no notice.\n  Further, section 213 neither ``expands the government's ability'' to \ndelay notice nor can it even remotely be described as a ``sea change'' \nin the law. Twenty-five years ago the U.S. Supreme Court established \nthat ``covert entries are constitutional in some circumstances, at \nleast if they are made pursuant to a warrant.'' That citation is Dalia \nv. U.S. Congress first authorized delayed notice searches 35 years ago \nin the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control Act. These searches repeatedly have \nbeen upheld as constitutional.\n  In 1990, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held:\n\n       Certain times of searching or surveillance depend for their \n     success on the absence of premature disclosure. The use of a \n     wiretap, or a ``bug,'' or a pen register, or a video camera \n     would likely produce little evidence of wrongdoing if the \n     wrongdoers knew in advance that their conversation or actions \n     would be monitored. When nondisclosure of the authorized \n     search is essential to its success, neither Rule 41 nor the \n     Fourth Amendment prohibits covert entry.\n\n  You can see why this is so. There are certain circumstances where you \ncannot let the ``bad guy'' know you are listening in on his \nconversations.\n  To the extent the ACLU intends to suggest that delayed notice \nsearches are unconstitutional, it bears mention that the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has already addressed that view. I mentioned the 1979 Dalia case \nin which the Supreme Court described that argument as ``frivolous.''\n  If anyone would still wish to argue that section 213 is \ncontroversial, I would note that on this point, too, the conference \ncommittee has resolved the only issue that was in contention. The \nSenate passed a bill that substantially reenacted section 213 with no \nrestrictions on authority. The bill was, by the way, reported out of \nthe Judiciary Committee on a unanimous rollcall vote, which means even \nthe most vocal critics agreed to it, and it later passed the full \nSenate by unanimous consent. The only debate in the conference over \nsection 213 is what the presumptive time limit should be for \ninvestigators to return to court to renew the delay-in-notice \nprovision.\n  The Senate bill included a presumptive delay of 7 days, the House \nbill a presumptive delay of 180 days, with no provision for longer \ndelay in particular cases. The conference committee has agreed to 30 \ndays. I suggest that is an eminently reasonable compromise. And for all \nthe huffing and puffing about so-called ``sneak and peek,'' this is \nwhat the real debate has come down to.\n  I have one more matter, and I will conclude very quickly, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The other section, the third section, is this one on roving wiretaps. \nIt simply allows terrorism investigators to obtain a wiretap for any \nphone that a suspect uses rather than limiting the wiretap to a \nparticular phone. Criminal investigations already have this authority. \nThe PATRIOT Act simply updates the law to give terror investigators the \nsame authority. As I said, this particular section is no longer in \ncontroversy. To my knowledge, all questions have been resolved in the \nconference committee on this.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by noting that the conferees have made a \nvery good-faith effort to iron out differences, to add additional \nprotections, preventions of abuse. What it boils down to is we have a \nlaw that finally gives law enforcement and the intelligence community \nthe tools they need to fight terrorism. It brings down the wall that \nprevented them from cooperating in the past. It provides adequate \nsafeguards to ensure that no liberties are being diminished. It applies \nonly to the investigation of terrorism and crimes by terrorists against \nthe citizens of the United States. It would be a pity if we did not \nmove forward to reauthorize this important piece of legislation before \nit expires.\n  I renew my challenge to my colleagues. If anyone wants to discuss \nthis, or debate it, I will be here today. I will be here tomorrow. For \nthat matter, I will be here Monday if they want to do it. It is \nimportant we get this done and not leave here until we have given our \nlaw enforcement officials the tools they need to protect us.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the current consideration by the Congress \nof a rewrite of the USA PATRIOT Act is a significant event. These are \nimportant issues, and they have become increasingly important to the \nAmerican people.\n  This bill, more than any other, must have the confidence of the \nAmerican people. I understand that and Chairman Specter understands \nthat. I commend the chairman for his commitment to work in a bipartisan \nmanner, both during the committee process and throughout the House-\nSenate conference. He and I agree with the vast majority of Americans \nthat a reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act's expiring provisions must be \naccomplished in a bipartisan process, not in a bitter, partisan battle.\n  The PATRIOT Act suffers from an image problem. This perception \nproblem stems in large measure because of the rhetoric, practices and \nsecrecy of the Bush administration and the Ashcroft Justice Department. \nThe antidote is clear and it is simple--less secrecy, more \ncongressional oversight, more judicial review and an adjusted balance \nthat better protects the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n  That is what we produced here in the Senate when first the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and then the Senate unanimously adopted our PATRIOT \nAct reauthorization bill. We worked together and we did so in a timely \nmanner, completing our work in July. The Senate appointed conferees \nimmediately. Regrettably, the House did not follow suit. They delayed \nmore than 3 months until November 9, just last week and just a week \nbefore Congress was scheduled to recess. We lost 3 months that we could \nhave used to find common ground and create a better bill. \nUnfortunately, the House Republican leadership played games with the \nPATRIOT Act while the clock was ticking.\n  Even last week, with conferees newly appointed by the House, I was \nhopeful that in our limited time, we could negotiate in good faith and \nreach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement. We made some progress over the \nweekend on important issues, reaching a tentative agreement on improved \nreporting requirements that would shine some light on the use of \ncertain surveillance techniques. I believed that we were close to \nstriking a reasonable balance on the core civil liberties issues raised \nby the PATRIOT Act.\n  But on Sunday, the Bush administration stepped in and, with the \nacquiescence of congressional Republicans, the bipartisan negotiations \nwere abruptly ended. The curtain came down. Democratic participation \nwas excluded from the process. As a result the tentative agreements \nwere scuttled based on Bush administration demands.\n  Further impeding bipartisan progress, the conference report was being \nloaded up with controversial provisions that had nothing to do with the \nPATRIOT Act, terrorism, or anything in either the House or Senate-\npassed bills. The PATRIOT Act suddenly was being used as a vehicle of \nconvenience to pass laws that could not be passed on their own merit. \nThis overreaching by the House Republican conferees caused more time to \nbe lost, and because of the ill-advised choices that were made late in \nthis process, the conference report is not what it should be.\n  The needless and divisive chapter in the late stages of what should \nhave been--can what could have been--an open and bipartisan conference \nthreatens to undermine national consensus on this bill. Sadly, it also \nthreatens national confidence in how we as a Congress can best address \nthese important issues. Before the Bush administration butted in and \ngrabbed the reins, we were close to a compromise that could have been \nacceptable to almost all members of Congress and to the American \npublic. This is not that conference\n\n[[Page S13300]]\n\nreport. I am not sure that this conference report can win the \nconfidence of the American people. Rather than seek common ground with \nthe Congress and with the American people that we represent, the Bush \nadministration and Republican conferees have taken and abused their \npower and taken terrible advantage.\n  Just 2 months ago, we observed the fourth anniversary of the horrific \nattacks of September 11, 2001. In the aftermath of the attacks, \nCongress moved quickly to pass anti-terrorism legislation. The fires \nwere still smoldering at Ground Zero when the USA PATRIOT Act became \nlaw on October 30, 2001, just 6 weeks after the attacks.\n  Many of us here today worked together in a spirit of bipartisan unity \nand resolve to craft a bill that we had hoped would make us safer as a \nnation. Freedom and security are always in tension in our society, and \nespecially so in those somber weeks after the attacks, but we tried our \nbest to strike the right balance. One of the fruits of that \nbipartisanship was the sunset provisions contained in the PATRIOT Act. \nThese sunsets have allowed us some opportunity to obtain key \ninformation Americans have a right to know, and to revisit these \nmatters to add more sunshine and oversight. Those sunsets were \nsupported by Dick Armey, the Republican House majority leader and by me \nin the Senate an unlikely duo I concede, but in this case, a successful \nand productive alliance that proved to benefit the American people. We \nprevailed, thank goodness.\n  Sadly, the Bush administration and Republican congressional \nleadership has largely squandered this opportunity to refine the \nPATRIOT Act. Instead, they are insisting on a continuing assault on \nhabeas corpus rights and adding other extraneous matters. Working with \nChairman Specter, we are insisting on modifications to the conference \nreport that will make it more protective of civil liberties and \nincrease opportunities for oversight, including a 4-year sunset.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy, Rockefeller and Levin for their efforts to \nimprove the draft circulated to us this week. I know that some Senate \nRepublican conferees were not satisfied that the draft fully protected \nAmericans' civil liberties and thank them for working to improve this \nimportant measure. I hope that the other conferees will work with us to \narrive at a conference report that we all can support and that we can \ntake to the American people together.\n  If the Bush administration would cooperate with us--the people's \nrepresentatives--we will be better able to refine the authorities and \nuses of national security letters and the other tools provided in the \nlaw. Without that cooperation, with the veil of secrecy cloaking so \nmuch activity, neither Congress nor the American people will know or \ntrust what the government is doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nthe passion and commitment he has to the protection of our law \nenforcement officers, who are doing a great job for us. I appreciate \nwhat he is saying and doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13300-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13300-S13302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 2528\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \n1 hour of debate equally divided between the two managers in relation \nto the conference report to accompany H.R. 2528, the Military Quality \nof Life and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. I further ask consent \nthat following the use or yielding back of time, and when the Senate \nthen receives the conference report, it be immediately considered, and \nthe conference report be adopted, with the motion to reconsider laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe what we bring before the \nSenate today is a product worthy of our support. The conference report \nhas been crafted under two different approaches. What I believe has \nemerged is not only a good compromise but also makes strides in both \noversight and policy. What has emerged is a solid recommendation.\n  I thank my chairman, Senator Cochran, for his leadership. This \nsubcommittee faced some extreme budgetary shortfalls, and without his \nleadership, and basically allocating more resources to this committee, \nwe would not be able to bring this conference report to the Senate \ntoday.\n  I also especially thank my ranking member, Senator Feinstein, for her \nconstant support and willingness to work together. I thank her staff as \nwell: Christian Evans, B.G. Wright, and Chad Schulken for their hard \nwork and professionalism, along with my great staff, Tammy Cameron, \nDennis Balkham, and Sean Knowles. It has been a team effort and I \nappreciate that so much.\n  The military construction portion of our bill provides $6.2 billion \nfor military construction, $5.1 billion of which is for Active \nComponent construction, and $1.1 billion for Reserve Component \nconstruction. It also includes $4 billion for family housing. There is \n$1.75 billion for BRAC implementation and cleanup for both 2005 and \nprior rounds. The conference agreement also provides necessary services \nfor our service men and women and their families, not only enabling \nthem to effectively do their jobs, but also providing an improved \nquality of life in our military communities. This is important for many \nreasons. Of course, it is the right thing to do for our military. It is \nalso the smart thing to do with our tax dollars. In this time of war \nand frequent deployments, recruiting and retention, maintaining a ready \nand available workforce is very much on the minds of our military \nleaders. We often say, in this era of an All Volunteer Force: You \nrecruit individuals, but you retain families. The quality-of-life \nimprovements that make our military communities great places to live \nare crucial in the retention of military families. Within this \nconference report before you, we fund projects that will improve the \nlives of those families. We fund 11 family housing privatization \nprojects, which will provide high-quality, market-standard housing for \nnearly 15,000 military families; 39 barracks projects that will get our \nsingle soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines out of substandard living \nconditions, or, in some cases, off ships and into first-rate \nfacilities; and schools, child development centers, and family support \ncenters that will ensure our servicemembers' children and spouses are \ncared for, are included in this bill.\n  These improvements make it easier for troops to deploy, to focus on \ntheir day-to-day jobs, while giving them the peace of mind that comes \nwith knowing their families and homes are taken care of, so they can \ngive their attention to the job we are asking them to do--protecting \nAmerica. The conference report provides the first piece to the most \nrecent BRAC round. With the funds provided, it places priority on those \nfunds which are critical to carrying out BRAC, while providing the \nnecessary financial oversight of the resources provided.\n  For our veterans, we have fully funded the President's request for \nveterans benefits and health care. This has not been easy. House and \nSenate conferees have provided $22.547 billion for medical services, \nwhich includes $1.225 billion in emergency funding to fully meet the \nPresident's amended request for medical care for the country's \nveterans. This conference has strongly responded to the VA's recent \nbudgetary shortfall by putting in place stringent financial reporting \nrequirements in an effort to avoid the repeat of budget crises \nwitnessed this summer in VA health care.\n  We have fully funded the request for medical facilities and \ninfrastructure, totaling $3.3 billion for fiscal year 2006. We have \ncreated three Centers of Excellence for mental health care, while at \nthe same time fully funding health care for post traumatic stress \ndisorder and other mental health care throughout the VA.\n  The conference has funded medical and prosthetic research at $412 \nmillion, which is $19 million more than the President's request. This \nis important because we know many of our troops coming home from Iraq \nand Afghanistan are suffering from loss of limbs, to a greater extent \nthan we have seen before. So we want the research to make sure the \nprostheses they have make\n\n[[Page S13301]]\n\nthem fully ambulatory and able to function in the rest of their lives.\n  The conference takes the unprecedented step of providing $15 million \nspecifically dedicated to Gulf War Illness research for this year and \nthe next 4 fiscal years, fulfilling the Research Advisory Commission's \nrecommendations on Gulf War Illness. This is a disease for which we \nmust determine the cause so we can treat the one in six who returned \nfrom the Gulf War with these symptoms and protect future service men \nand women from contracting this disorder.\n  The conference report before you today establishes a new account \nwithin the VA dedicated to information technology systems. Not only \ndoes this new account provide for increased oversight and consolidated \ninformation technology efforts within the VA, it codifies the new \nposition of a VA Chief Information Officer and subsequent \nreorganization. I believe this is a critical step toward helping the VA \nachieve success in medical recordkeeping and medical record \navailability. Its HealtheVet-electronic patient records project paid \ngreat dividends during the recent hurricanes.\n  In fact, the conference report has also responded to the recent \nhurricanes by providing the VA authority to establish an Assistant \nSecretary for Disaster Preparedness, something which will enable the VA \nto better respond to future disaster situations.\n  Finally, we have provided $1 million over the President's request for \nthe American Battle Monuments Commission for an environmental study to \nsave the eroding monument at Normandy Cemetery.\n  All in all, I believe the conference report before the Senate \nprovides much-needed resources and does so while maximizing our limited \nresources in meeting the greatest needs of our military, their \nfamilies, and our veterans.\n  On a personal note, I want to say I have worked very closely with \nSecretary Jim Nicholson of the VA, and I know of his dedication to \ndoing what is right for our veterans, something we all wish to do. I \nappreciate his leadership. We owe our active-duty military, our Guard \nand Reserves, who stand ready to serve, and our veterans, who have \nserved, the care of our country. We have achieved these goals in the \nconference report today.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this conference \nreport.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my ranking member, Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my chairman, \nSenator Hutchison, in recommending this 2006 Military Construction, \nVeterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations conference report \nto the Senate. This is the first year that MILCON has added \ndramatically to its portfolio, and I want to compliment the chairman of \nour committee, and I want to compliment her staff for what has been, I \nthink--on what could have been a very difficult bill--a very \nbipartisan, constructive, team-like, problem-solving effort. I only \nwish we had more of it in the Senate. But I want the chairman to know \nhow much I am grateful to her for her leadership, and I want her staff \nto know that as well.\n  I also thank Chairman Cochran--what Senator Hutchison said was right \nabout the amount of money--and also Senator Byrd for their leadership \nand diligence in getting this bill through conference and to the Senate \nfloor.\n  As the chairman said, the conference report before us today is a \nfirst. It provides for the infrastructure needs of our military and the \nhealth care and other needs of our veterans.\n  The bill is a big one. It is an $82.57 billion bill. It includes \n$12.167 billion for MILCON, family housing, environmental cleanup; \n$70.25 billion for veterans' benefits and health care--that is the big \naddition--and $157.6 million for several related agencies.\n  Of the many vital programs the Senator elucidated as funded in this \nconference report, none is more important than the funding we provide \nto meet the medical needs of our Nation's veterans. As a Senator from a \nState with the largest population of veterans in the Nation, I cannot \noverstate the importance of this issue. We have to support our veterans \nto the fullest extent possible.\n  The conference report before us today provides $22.547 billion for \nveterans medical services. Included in that level is $1.225 billion in \ncontingent emergency funding to make up the projected shortfall in the \nPresident's original budget request. The Senate had sought a higher \nlevel of funding, and it was my sincere hope that the House, which had \nzero emergency funding for veterans in its version of the bill, would \nhave agreed to our position and accepted the full amount provided in \nthe Senate bill. That did not happen. But given the huge disparity \nbetween the House and Senate funding proposals, the level of funding \nprovided in the conference report is a good start. I commend, again, \nthe chairman for her hard work--for the cooperation of Senator Cochran, \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee--in bridging the enormous gap \nbetween the two bills and ensuring that the conference report did not \nshortchange our veterans. I do not believe it does shortchange our \nveterans.\n  The proposed funding for VA medical services is equal to the level of \nfunding the administration has said it needs for fiscal year 2006. That \nis clearly a good start. But it offers--and it has to be pointed out--\nno safety net to our veterans, should the VA's budget once again prove \nto be wrong. This is a worrisome prospect. Hopefully, the \nadministration got it right this time and the funding will be \nsufficient, but everyone should know that we will be watching. \nAdditionally, there is much talk floating around the Capitol of an \nacross-the-board cut to discretionary programs. I would like to be \nclear to everyone, any across-the-board cut to VA medical services will \nmean cuts in health care for veterans. There is no other way around it. \nWe can't allow it to happen.\n  As I noted earlier, the medical services proposal includes the $1.225 \nbillion in contingent emergency funding. This means the administration \nwill have to designate the funding as an emergency before it is \napportioned to the VA. I want to send this message loud and clear to \nthe administration: Do not sit on this funding and force the VA to have \nto begin rationing health care. We will not stand for that.\n  The MILCON portion of the report provides $12.17 billion to fund \nstate-of-the-art facilities. The Senator has mentioned some of them--\nbarracks, housing for military families, and other vital infrastructure \nfor servicemembers around the world.\n  Army projects were increased by 19 percent; Air Force, by 18 percent; \nand the Navy, by nearly 8 percent. When enacted, this bill will fund \nActive-component MILCON at $5.1 billion. We were also able to provide \nsignificant increases in funding for Reserve-component MILCON. This is \nimportant at a time when our Reserve Forces are being asked to do more \nthan ever before and, in many cases, are being deployed to combat zones \noverseas multiple times. Ensuring that these troops have adequate \nfacilities in which to train and maintain their equipment is crucial to \nthe success of their mission. To that end, the conferees agreed to \nincrease funding for Army Guard projects by 60 percent, a substantial \namount; for Air Guard projects by 83 percent over the President's \nbudget request. In fact, overall funding for Reserve components was \nincreased by 52 percent over the President's budget request, dedicating \n$1.1 billion for new facilities for our Reserve bases. That is \nimportant, and it means that this committee has done an excellent job \nin recognizing the need.\n\n  In summary, I once again thank my chairman, Senator Hutchison. I not \nonly enjoy her collegiality but her friendship as well. I want her to \nknow that that means a great deal to me. I thank Chairman Cochran and \nSenator Byrd for their leadership. And I would like to thank our staffs \nwho really worked in what I like to believe is a hallmark, sometimes, \nof this great body, which is bipartisanship. They have shown an \nunfailing spirit of cooperation. So thank you, Tammy Cameron, Sean \nKnowles, and Dennis Balkham for Senator Hutchison, and Christine Evans, \nB. G. Wright, Chad Schulken, and Chris Thompson of my staff.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, collegiality and bipartisanship is a\n\n[[Page S13302]]\n\ntwo-way street. You can't do it if only one person wants to do the \nright thing. I have worked with Senator Feinstein. She has been \nchairman of our committee, and I have been ranking member. I have been \nchairman, and she has been ranking member. We have always come together \nto do what is right for the military personnel who are defending our \ncountry as we speak today. We both believe in quality of life, good \nhousing, good health care facilities, good childcare facilities, and \nall the things that we can provide in the purview of our bill. And now \nwe have the veterans, which has been added to our bill this year, which \nis a great opportunity for us to continue to say thank you to those who \nhave preserved the freedom for our generation.\n  We have come together on the goals, and I could not ask for a better \npartner.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I so appreciate that we can do this in the Senate, \nwhich is what we ought to be doing in every committee. I hope by our \nability to do this--frankly, the Appropriations Committee, in general, \ndoes so--we will be able to create a better America for all of our \nconstituents.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back all of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do, as well, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have already passed the resolution. \nWhen it comes from the House, we have deemed that it would be passed \nhere.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13302-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13302-S13304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts on \nthe PATRIOT Act which, unfortunately, seems to have reached an impasse. \nThat is distressing to me. I can't imagine that we have allowed this to \nhappen. It is very disappointing. The American people need to \nunderstand how important the act is and how little it impacts the \nliberties which we cherish and how carefully it was crafted so as to \nnot impact our liberties. I would like to share a few thoughts about \nthat.\n  Many of the key provisions of the act are scheduled to sunset at the \nend of this year. We will now presumably have to try to come back, in \nthe few days we have in December, to complete the work. That is a very \nrisky thing. We should complete this work today. Remember, those who do \nnot sign up for this legislation, this conference report, or support it \nand do it today, giving us time to vote on it before we leave for the \nyear, are risking letting the PATRIOT Act expire. And with its \nexpiration, the walls that prohibited our governmental agencies from \nsharing critical intelligence information will go back up. Those are \nthe very walls that were structured between the FBI and the CIA and \nother agencies that blocked the sharing of intelligence information \nthat, in retrospect, we believe could possibly have allowed us to find \nout about and stop the 9/11 attacks. Perhaps not, but those walls, \nthose failures to be able to share intelligence between those agencies \nwere a critical factor in our lack of cooperation prior to 9/11.\n  We passed the PATRIOT Act to fix that. It has worked extremely well. \nWe should not go back to that time of the great walls.\n  The PATRIOT Act has, without doubt, made us immeasurably safer. I \nfully support the act's provisions as originally passed. The main goal \nof the act was then, and remains today, very simple: to give Federal \nlaw enforcement officers, the FBI, and other agencies the same tools to \nfight terrorists and agents of foreign powers as the tools they have--\nand virtually every law enforcement officer at the county, city and \nState level have--to fight other type criminals, drug lords, murderers, \nand even white collar tax evaders.\n  I do not believe we acted too hastily in passing the PATRIOT Act. We \nwere focused on this act. We made a commitment not to alter any of the \ngreat protections that we had. We negotiated it intentionally. People \nmade the most outrageous allegations and had the most incredible \nmisinformation about what was in it. By the time we completed the \nintense negotiations and debate for weeks, it was voted for in the \nSenate by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 98 to 1. The House \nvoted it with a huge majority also, 357 to 66. This year we passed the \nbill unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a contentious \ncommittee, a committee which has civil libertarians on the right and \nthe left. We voted it unanimously out of that committee, and the Senate \npassed it by unanimous consent. As originally drafted, the PATRIOT Act \ndoes nothing to harm the civil rights and liberties of Americans.\n\n  I want to talk about that just a little. The Department of Justice \ninspector general, Glenn Fine, an appointee of President Clinton, has \ninvestigated all of the claims of civil rights and civil liberties \nviolations received by the Department of Justice under the act. The \nindependent inspector general found no incident in which the PATRIOT \nAct was used to abuse the civil rights or civil liberties of American \ncitizens or anyone else.\n  I do not believe portions of this act must be significantly revised, \nor have additional so-called protections added. And, I do not believe \nthat sections of this act should be sunsetted. I will share with my \ncolleagues the words of Attorney General Gonzales which he gave in a \nletter to our conferees as we tried to work out the final words for \nthis act. He wrote to us and said--and no truer words have been spoken:\n\n       The terrorist threat against this country will not sunset, \n     and neither should the tools we use to combat terrorism.\n\n  Let me mention a few of the provisions of the act that give us the \ntools that are so important. One is the roving wiretap provision. \nRoving or multipoint wiretaps have been available to criminal \ninvestigators for many years. But section 206 of the PATRIOT Act made \nsure that this tool was also available for fighting terrorism. It \nallows the FISA court, the special foreign intelligence court, to \nauthorize a wiretap to move from device to device as the target of the \nwiretap, the target of the foreign intelligence investigation, changes \nmodes of communication.\n  So let me tell you, though this has been approved as a legitimate law \nenforcement tool, and should continue to be a law enforcement tool, it \nis not that easy to obtain, you really have to prove you need a roving \nwiretap. I was a Federal prosecutor for over 15 years, a U.S. attorney, \nand I personally supervised and prosecuted a lot of cases. Let me just \ntell you how it works.\n  In my 12 years as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, \nI think maybe we had two wiretaps. These are very difficult to obtain. \nYou have to have probable cause to believe that a person is involved in \ncriminal activity. You have to identify how he is using communication \ndevices and then submit to the court a memorandum--and the ones that I \nhave seen were 60 to 100 pages of facts--to prove to the judge's \nsatisfaction that we are not snooping on somebody who is innocent, but \nwe are actually attempting to understand the scope of major criminal \nactivity.\n  The way it is monitored and managed is incredibly important because \nyou have to listen to it constantly. If they talk about their family, \nyou are supposed to turn it off. You have to have people listening all \nthe time so that you can catch the evidence you are seeking. It is very \nexpensive. You don't do it unless it is very important.\n  So I have to say, Mr. President, it is so important in a terrorism \ninvestigation that agents have this tool when they are on to a group or \nentity that is not just selling drugs, as bad as that is, but are \nintent on blowing up and killing thousands of American citizens. And \nwhen you are on to them and they start using this phone and that phone \nand that phone and you have run back to court with your 60-page \nmemorandum and find a judge and set up a hearing date and all that, by \nthat time he has maybe gone to another phone, a cell phone, a pay \nphone, a phone in a motel, wherever he moves.\n  So it is perfectly appropriate to have a wiretap if it is approved by \na court\n\n[[Page S13303]]\n\nupon sufficient showing of probable cause. That is no doubt. All this \ndoes is to say that you can get the ability to intercept communications \non that individual and then can use whatever phone he is using. \nPreviously, the tradition was that you would have the wiretap on a \nsingle telephone number. This makes it clear that the court decisions \nallowing roving wiretaps are the law of the land, and it also creates a \nstandard as to how they should be approved and utilized.\n  So I think that is an important tool for investigators. Can you \nimagine how important that is to an investigative team that may be \nworking on a dangerous terrorist cell? It could be the difference of \nlife and death for thousands of American citizens.\n  Let me mention another provision of the act. The objections to this \none are so amazing to me. It just breaks my heart that people seem to \nhave as much confusion about it as they do. This is the delayed notice \nsearch warrant. Under section 213, the PATRIOT Act created a nationally \nuniform process and standard for obtaining delayed notice search \nwarrants. The act's standard applies to delayed notice warrants sought \nin any type of investigation, not just terrorism investigations. \nDelayed notice warrants are explained by the August 29, 2005 letter \nfrom the Department of Justice. They said:\n\n       A delayed-notice warrant differs from an ordinary warrant \n     only in that the judge authorizes the officer executing the \n     warrant to wait for a limited period of time before notifying \n     the subject of the warrant because immediate notice would \n     have an adverse result as defined by statute.\n\n  We must remember that delayed notice search warrants have been around \nfor decades. As a matter of fact, I was reading a book not long ago \nabout an organized crime matter that occurred years ago and they \nreferred to a delayed notice search warrant. They didn't have any \nstatutory standards for it at that time, but they asked the judge to \nallow them to delay notice, and the judge allowed it, and that process \nhas been approved constitutionally.\n  The PATRIOT Act did not create any new authority or close any gap in \ndelayed notice law because there was really no gap to close. It simply \nset a uniform statutory standard for getting permission to delay \nnotice.\n\n  It is absolutely false to imply, as many have done, that these \nwarrants are a way for the Government to ``sneak and peak'' into a \ncivilian's home, papers, or effects without ever telling them. The \ntruth is that they have to be told, but there is a delay between the \nsearch and when they are told. The critics have continued to suggest \nthat these warrants are done without approval of a court, they want you \nto believe that because of the PATRIOT Act, the government can go into \nyour house without a warrant and see what you have and never tell \nanybody that they have been there.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. That is why this bill passed \n98 to 1. We didn't write those kinds of broad provisions in this bill. \nWe maintained the classic standard of approval of a search warrant, the \nprobable cause standard and all that goes with it. The PATRIOT Act \nsimply set an objective uniform standard for delayed notice.\n  Why is this important? Well, I could go into detail, but I would just \nask you to imagine that one is surveiling a group that you have \nprobable cause to believe is going to try to blow up an area of the \nUnited States and that you have probable cause to believe that they \nhave planned to make a bomb. You could go in this residence while \nnobody is there pursuant to a search warrant on probable cause issued \nby a Federal judge and conduct a search. Normally, the only difference \nin these warrants is that you would normally tell the person whose \nhouse is searched immediately, and immediately report back to the \nCourt. Here you have make a report but you don't have to tell the \nperson you have searched their house until a later date set by the \njudge.\n  You may find in their house bombmaking materials papers on how to \nmake a bomb, explosive devices, triggers, and those kinds of things. \nAnd it may be that from that you could obtain information from their \nhouse on who else was involved in the cell, to identify the entire \nring, the entire cell, and arrest them all at once at an appropriate \ntime. If you have to tell the person immediately, in some cases you \nrisk tipping the whole group off and having them spread out like a \ncovey of quail. That is what too often happens if you don't have this \nkind of tool. It is critically important to investigators trying to \nprotect the United States of America that we preserve this section of \nthe PATRIOT Act.\n  Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act allows the FBI to seek an order for \nthe production of tangible things--books, records, papers, documents, \nand other items for an investigation to obtain foreign intelligence \ninformation. Basically, they are a form of subpoena authority. Section \n215 orders must be preapproved by a judge and cannot be used to \ninvestigate ordinary crimes or even domestic terrorism. Opponents of \nsection 215 have tried to create the impression that the FBI is using \n215 to visit libraries nationwide in some sort of dragnet to check the \nreading records of everyday American citizens.\n  That is just not so. They have no interest in that whatsoever. Why \nwould they? They are not doing that. I did get a letter from Rebecca \nMitchell, director of the Alabama Public Library Service, who was \ncritical of some of her colleagues who have been objecting to these \nprovisions in the act. Her August 15 letter to me stated:\n\n       I want to personally thank up for your strong leadership \n     stand on the PATRIOT Act. Our libraries should not be a tool \n     for terrorism. I know you have received negative comments \n     from the American library association on your stand but this \n     is not the opinion of most librarians in our State. Please \n     continue to fight to keep our Nation safe.\n\n  Please understand that no provision of the PATRIOT Act, including \nsection 215, even mentions libraries or is directed at libraries. \nNevertheless, as Director Mitchell points out, it is important that \nlibrary records remain obtainable as one of the tangible records that \nsection 215 can reach. Intelligence or criminal investigators may have \nvery good and legitimate reasons for extending to library or bookstore \nrecords. For example, investigators may need to show that a suspect has \npurchased a book giving instructions on how to build a bomb.\n  I prosecuted a guy who had already had one book written about him, \nand after the prosecution, they made a second movie about him. We \nconducted a search warrant, a lawful search warrant that was upheld. We \nfound a book called ``Death Dealers Manual,'' describing how to kill \npeople; and a book called ``Deadly Poison,'' describing how to make \ndeadly poison. That was great evidence to use to show that he was more \nthan casually interested in murdering people.\n  Andrew McCarthy, a former Federal prosecutor who led the 1995 \nterrorism case against Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, recently elaborated on \nthis point in an article in National Review Online. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       Hard experience--won in the course of a string of terrorism \n     trials since 1993 [that he had personally been involved in] \n     instructs us that it would be folly to preclude the \n     Government a priori from access to any broad categories of \n     business records. Reading material, we now know, can be \n     highly relevant in terrorism cases. People who build bombs \n     tend to have booklets and pamphlets on bomb making.\n\n  For heavens' sake, I would add, of course they do.\n\n       Terrorist leaders often possess literature announcing the \n     animating principles of their organizations in a tone \n     tailored to potential recruits. This type of evidence is a \n     staple of virtually every terrorism investigation--both for \n     what it suggests on its face and for the forensic \n     significance of whose fingerprints that may be on it. . . . \n     If he [a defendant] claims unfamiliarity with the tenets of \n     violent jihad, should a jury be barred from learning that his \n     paws have yellowed numerous publications on the subject? Such \n     evidence was standard fare throughout Janet Reno's tenure--\n     and rightly so.\n  Of course, she was Attorney General under President Clinton.\n  So this occurs in every courtroom in America. Documents are obtained \nthrough subpoena. It is stunningly dangerous that we would not \nunderstand this concept and why it is needed in the context of \nterrorism investigations.\n  I will add just a few additional thoughts on obtaining records and \ndocuments. An American citizen has an expectation of privacy and it is \nthe right of an American under the Constitution to be free from \nunreasonable--unreasonable--search and seizures is guaranteed by our \nConstitution.\n  Where do you have privacy rights? If you give someone your personal \npapers,\n\n[[Page S13304]]\n\nyou turn them over to them, do you still have privacy rights if they \nwere to read them? Certainly not. So the law has developed many years \nin this fashion. You have an expectation of privacy in those areas of \nyour life where you have control--the inside of your automobile, the \ntrunk of your car, the glove compartment of your car, your desk at your \noffice, any part of your house, your garage, an outbuilding around your \nhouse that you have exclusive control over. Those are areas over which \nyou have exclusive control, and you have an expectation of privacy. \nPeople cannot go into those places and seize anything you have there \nwithout probable cause or else it would be an unreasonable search and \nseizure.\n  But if you go to a motel and fill out a motel receipt and give it to \nthe motel operator, it is not yours. It is the motel's document, it is \na business record. If you go to a bank and you open an account and they \nkeep all kinds of records of that account, they are the bank's records, \nnot yours. Every person in that bank has access to those documents and \nrecords. If you make a telephone call, the words you use are yours, and \nyou have an expectation of privacy between you and the person who \nreceives the call. But the fact that you make a telephone call and the \ntelephone company prints out a billing statement that has telephone \nnumbers on it, that is available to anybody who works in the telephone \ncompany. That is not your record, it is their record. So you do not \nhave the same privacy expectations, that is all.\n  The court has always understood that. This has never been in dispute. \nEvery district attorney in America, all kinds of law enforcement \nofficers, State and Federal, through subpoenas, without court approval, \nhave been able to obtain those kinds of documents if the documents are \nrelevant to an investigation they are undertaking.\n  I received telephone toll records in drug cases I prosecuted. These \nkinds of records could be relevant in a terrorist case, make no mistake \nabout it. You check the telephone numbers they call, and they are \ncalling a certain number in New York City. Maybe you have records from \nanother person, and they are calling that same number at various times \nof the day, and maybe right before a terrorist attack occurred or right \nafter an attack occurred, phone calls are going back and forth. That is \nreal evidence of who may be involved in a terrorist cell or criminal \ndrug enterprise. That is how investigators work every day. That is what \njuries expect to see when cases are prosecuted. To have this great fear \nthat there is something in this act that in a significant way alters \nthose classical powers of investigators to find out those who may be \ntrying to kill us--it is just not true. It is an exaggeration. It is a \nconcern that is not real.\n  This PATRIOT Act is about to expire. It would be an abdication of our \nresponsibility as the Senate not to move this bill forward before the \nend of the year. Let's move it now. If we need to stay over the \nweekend, I am willing to do so. We can stay next week; I am willing to \ndo so. It is important that we not allow this legislation to fail. I \nencourage the leaders on both sides to work toward achieving that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13304-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13304-S13306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM SMITH\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to take a personal minute to \nshare some thoughts and to bid farewell to my chief counsel on the \nJudiciary Committee, William Smith, who is sitting beside me. I know \nthe Presiding Officer, the Senator from Georgia, knows Mr. Smith and \nadmires him. He has been a great friend and a tremendous asset to this \nSenate. He will be returning to Alabama to practice at one of our \nState's most outstanding and prestigious law firms, Starnes & Atchison. \nEven more importantly, he will return to Alabama, accompanied by his \nsoon-to-be bride, Diamond, to whom he will be married in early January.\n  But I am going to feel a great loss. The things he has done for me \nare innumerable, including helping us to prepare and pass this great \nact, the PATRIOT Act. Each day we have worked together, William has \nshown an unwavering dedication to his State, to his country, to me, and \nto the values we share. His passion for the law is unmatched, and his \ncommitment to the rule of law is unwavering. I trust his judgment, and \nI have relied on him to manage our staff and our issues, confident that \nhis work ethic and his ideals are beyond reproach.\n  Before joining the Senate, William had a distinguished legal career, \nhaving served as staff attorney on the Alabama Supreme Court and having \ntaught at both Duke University School of Law and the University of \nSouthern California School of Law.\n  In 2001, he moved to Washington, DC, to be my deputy chief counsel on \nthe Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. He became \nmy chief counsel the following year.\n  When William leaves the Senate at the end of this session, he will \nbegin a practice focusing primarily on medical malpractice defense and \ncommercial litigation. I have no doubt he will do well in this next \nventure of his life, and I have no doubt his principled approach, work \nethic, and dedication are going to be difficult for this Senate to \nreplace.\n  It is obvious my loss will be the State's gain. His presence in \nWashington was all our gain. William's work on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee is almost legendary. The Judiciary Committee takes an \nenormous number and wide variety of complex and sometimes controversial \nissues. It is one of the most demanding committees in the Senate.\n  To be successful as an attorney on that committee, you must not only \nbe hard working and intelligent, but a public servant who routinely \nworks long hours. You must also be a tough negotiator, able to frame \nyour arguments in a strong but respectful and intellectually honest \nway. William does all of this with seemingly effortless skill.\n  Evidence of William's dedication to and influence on the committee \nand its staff can most clearly be seen by simply looking at what his \ncolleagues say about him.\n  Ed Haden, my former chief counsel of the Courts Subcommittee and \ncurrently a lawyer with Balch & Bingham in Birmingham, says:\n\n       William Smith is an example of a man who walks his \n     principles. He is a Christian who lives it. He is a \n     conservative who means it. He is a friend who is there for \n     you. In a legislative body that fosters compromise, he will \n     compromise on details, but not on his principle. How \n     fortunate the United States Senate, the Judiciary Committee, \n     and all of us who have worked for Senator Sessions have been \n     to know and love this man.\n\n  Rita Lari Jochum, chief counsel for Senator Grassley, says this:\n\n       William Smith is a smart lawyer, a shrewd strategist, a \n     dedicated public servant, and an all around great guy. He \n     sticks to his principles and values, and has been a rock \n     solid role model for many of us. The Senate will miss a much \n     respected colleague, and I will miss a true friend. Even \n     though he will no longer be walking the halls of the Capitol, \n     he will not be forgotten.\n\n  Stephen Higgins, chief counsel of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nTerrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, chaired by Senator Jon \nKyl, says this:\n\n       William Smith has an incredible love for this country and a \n     great passion for his job. He is a devoted public servant and \n     a forceful advocate for Senator Sessions.\n\n  Mary Chesser, chief counsel of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nCorrections and Rehabilitation, chaired by Senator Tom Coburn, says \nthis:\n\n       William is a great American, leader, mentor, and friend. \n     His diligent work on the committee constantly inspires his \n     colleagues. I feel honored to have worked with him. He has \n     always represented Senator Sessions and the people of Alabama \n     with impeccable character, wisdom, and insight. He will be \n     missed.\n\n  Chip Roy, senior counsel for the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nImmigration, Border Security and Citizenship, chaired by Senator John \nCornyn, says this:\n\n       William Smith has served the U.S. Senate admirably and with \n     conviction. He personifies conservativism and the simple idea \n     that there ought to be a limit to what we do here in \n     Washington. While many staffers and members alike, Democrat \n     and Republican, seem to succumb to the misguided notion that \n     more government is better, William stands solidly on his \n     strongly held belief that this simply is not the case. I will \n     miss his strong sense of patriotism and his strong Christian \n     faith, each of which serve as an example for all.\n\n  James Galyean, chief counsel on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime \nand Drugs, chaired by Senator Lindsey Graham, says this:\n\n\n[[Page S13305]]\n\n\n       William Smith is a man of sterling character, devout faith, \n     and unwavering integrity. Senator Sessions, Alabama, and the \n     Nation have been well served during his time on the \n     Committee. And while his presence and influence will be \n     missed, we look forward to great things from him in the \n     future.\n\n  And indeed we do.\n  Ajit Pai, chief counsel on the Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution and Civil Rights, chaired by Senator Sam Brownback, says \nthis:\n\n       William Smith is a tenacious advocate, a firm defender of \n     principle, and an expert on the many rules of this \n     institution. To me and others fortunate to know him well, he \n     is also known as a good man and a great friend. He leaves the \n     Judiciary Committee with a solid professional and personal \n     record, and I wish him all the best as he makes a well-\n     deserved return home.\n\n  Amy Blankenship, legislative counsel to Senator Sam Brownback, says \nthis:\n\n       Perhaps William's greatest gift is teaching. He exemplifies \n     the kind of staffer we all want to be--thorough, prepared, \n     and committed. Though some may disagree with his views, no \n     one can question his commitment to uphold the principles he \n     believes in.\n\n  The respect, loyalty, and friendship William has won from his \ncolleagues extend well beyond the Senate Judiciary Committee and its \nstaff.\n  Alan Hanson, my legislative director, says this:\n\n       Exceeding his commitment to the United States and its \n     Constitution, which is indeed great, William Smith is a \n     committed Christian and friend--both of which are in far too \n     short supply in this day and age. His happy departure is the \n     United States Senate's unfortunate loss.\n\n  Steven Duffield of the Senate Republican Policy Committee says this:\n\n       William is a real American who loves his country and \n     cherishes the Constitution. He never hesitates to stick his \n     neck out to defend both.\n\n  Allen Hicks, chief counsel for Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, \nsays:\n\n       William is an anchor for conservative principles in the \n     midst of shifting political winds. In leadership, we could \n     count on him to represent views on issues clearly and \n     articulately, without hesitation or equivocation. The Senate \n     will miss his candor and his passion, and we wish him and \n     his future bride all the best.\n\n  Ed Corrigan, executive director of the Senate Steering Committee, \nsays this:\n\n       William Smith is known on Capitol Hill for his wisdom, \n     cheerful banter, and an unflinching commitment to principle. \n     Even his political adversaries have come to respect and \n     admire him. The Senate will miss William, as will the \n     countless number of us who are fortunate to call him friend.\n\n  John Abegg, legal counsel for Majority Whip Mitch McConnell, whom I \nsee on the floor, said:\n\n       I have enjoyed working with William very much. William is a \n     man of high principle. He is devoted to the Constitution and \n     to his country. He is an excellent lawyer, a straight \n     shooter, and a real leader. He will be missed.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alabama yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to make an observation rather than ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, William has many friends in the Senate, \nboth Senate staffers and Members of the Senate. I was listening to my \nfriend from Alabama discuss William's distinguished career on my \ntelevision monitor, and I decided to come over and make an observation, \nif it is appropriate.\n  I remember running into William one time. I said:\n\n       What is your principal duty with Senator Sessions?\n\n  He said:\n\n       Well, it's to keep him from drifting off to the left.\n\n  I say to our friend William: You have done a good job of keeping \nSenator Sessions from drifting off to the left. You have had a \ndistinguished run here in the U.S. Senate, and I am sure I am not the \nonly Member of the Senate who hopes we will see you again in public \nservice some day. I wish you well in your new endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his remarks. So \nmany of the Senators whom I have talked to feel the same way. Many have \ncome by, Chairman Specter, Senator Domenici, and others to speak to \nWilliam.\n  He will be here a few more weeks, but we will be out most of that \ntime so this is probably our last time to get together.\n  Let me keep reading what William's colleagues have told me about him.\n  Wendy Fleming, legislative counsel to Senator David Vitter, says \nthis:\n\n       William Smith is truly a great American. He has a \n     tremendous respect for the Constitution and the courage to \n     stand-up for his core values. It was an honor to work for \n     him.\n\n  William Henderson, counsel for Senator Jim Bunning, says this:\n\n       Three of the things Americans cherish the most are God, \n     country, and family. That is as true for William as anyone. \n     Every day he lives his Christian faith. He works with a love \n     of this country and defends the Constitution. Now he is \n     leaving to start a family. William has been a great friend \n     and teacher to me, and I am better for knowing him.\n\n  Chris Jaarda, legislative assistant for Senator John Ensign, says \nthis:\n\n       Every American should know the name William Smith and the \n     character that he possesses while working on their behalf. \n     His commitment to principle and respect for the rule of law, \n     is unquestioned. Were William your lawyer, you would be \n     served by a skilled advocate, committed to the highest \n     standard of ethics and professionalism. Were William your \n     judge, you would observe someone with the utmost respect for \n     the Constitution and our laws. Were William your friend, as \n     he is mine and countless others who serve in the Senate, you \n     would be blessed; better for knowing him.\n\n  Chad Groover, counsel to Senator Chuck Grassley, says this:\n\n       William and I came to the Senate Judiciary Committee the \n     same day, April 16, 2001. From that day on, William has been \n     a close friend, mentor, and encourager. His strong Christian \n     faith and unwavering commitment to conservative principles \n     have been an example to me. The American people are truly \n     better off because of William's service. He took to heart the \n     adage that ``the government is best that governs least'' and, \n     consequently, never let a bad bill go unchallenged. William \n     represents the best there is in public service. I'll miss \n     working with him on the Judiciary Committee, but I know that \n     in Alabama he will continue to serve his Country and his \n     Savior with the utmost distinction and fervor.\n\n  Drew Ryan, director of Government Affairs for The American Center for \nLaw and Justice, says this;\n\n       William Smith is a man of character, a man of vision, and \n     best of all, a man strong in his faith.\n\n  Tim Chapman, senior congressional liaison and national political \nwriter for Townhall.com, says this:\n\n       William Smith's steadfast adherence to conservative \n     principle has been an inspiration to me both personally and \n     professionally. He is a man of character who our organization \n     could always count on to put principle ahead of politics. His \n     absence from the United States Senate and from the Judiciary \n     Committee in particular, will not to without notice.\n\n  It is clear that William has influenced a great number of his \ncolleagues and leaves behind a committed group of friends dedicated to \nadvancing this great Republic's founding principles of federalism, \nliberty, and democracy. He will undoubtedly be missed by them, as he \nwill be missed by me. He has served me and our State faithfully and \ntirelessly and in doing so has served our great Nation immeasurably.\n  Let me say I am already looking forward to working with him again \nafter he goes back to the great State of Alabama. I have no doubt that \nhe will continue to work toward the greater cause of service to his \nfellow man.\n  William, we appreciate you. No one has given more to this country. \nFrom the time you get up in the morning until the time you go to bed at \nnight, you are committed to doing the right thing for this country. I \nlove you for it. Your friends love you for it. God bless you in your \nfuture endeavors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been recognized. I notice that \nSenator Harkin is in the Chamber. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. HARKIN. About 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, am I recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, does the Senator from Alaska have a \nquestion? I understand it is her time to take the chair and preside. I \nask the Senator if there is something this Senator from New Mexico \ncould do for her? What is going on?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Through the Chair, to the Senator from New Mexico, I \nhave about a 3-minute statement.\n\n[[Page S13306]]\n\nIf I could have the indulgence of doing that before I serve as the \nPresiding Officer, I would appreciate that from the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Obviously, we have to get consent because I am next.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murkowski be given 3 minutes at \nthis point and then the Senator from New Mexico be recognized for up to \n10 minutes, followed by Senator Harkin. Is that correct, the Senator \nwants to be next after the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of my \ncolleagues this afternoon.\n  I rise today to talk about a bill that I introduced last week that \nwill have a profound effect on the retention of teachers, \nadministrators, and other school staff in remote and rural areas of \nAlaska. This bill is the Rural Teacher Housing Act of 2005.\n  In rural areas of Alaska, we have school districts that face enormous \nchallenges of recruiting and retaining teachers, administrators, and \nother school staff. The challenges lie primarily in the lack of \nhousing. In one particular year, in the Lower Kuskokwim School District \nin western Alaska, they hired one teacher for every six who decided not \nto accept job offers. Half of those applicants who did not accept a \nteaching position in that district indicated that their decision was \nrelated to the lack of housing. When we talk about lack of housing, it \nis not they cannot find an apartment that is to their suiting or to \ntheir liking, the fact of the matter is there is no housing available.\n  In 2003, I had the opportunity to travel through rural Alaska with \nthen-Secretary of Education Rod Paige. I took him there because I \nwanted him to see the challenges of educating children in such a remote \nand rural environment. We went to the village school in Savoonga. We \nmet the principal there. Secretary Paige was overwhelmed when the \nprincipal showed him the broom closet in the school, not to show him \nthe school supplies but to let him know that this is where the \nprincipal of the school lived, in the broom closet in the school. This \nwas because there was no housing in Savoonga for the teachers.\n  We met the special education teacher at the school, and she brought \nout the mattress that she sleeps on in her classroom every night. She \ndoes not have a home to go to. She does not have a space to call her \nown. Her classroom is her room, her house, her bed. The other teachers \nat the school shared housing in a single home.\n  When one thinks about that in terms of what the teachers do, needless \nto say there is no place for their spouse, so these teachers who are \nmarried--the teachers might be married, but the spouse might be living \nin another part of the State or, in the principal's case, his wife \nlived out of State.\n  Unfortunately, Savoonga is not an isolated example of the teacher \nhousing situation in rural Alaska. Rural Alaska school districts \nexperience a high rate of teacher turnover due primarily to the lack of \nhousing. Turnover is as high as 30 percent each year in some of the \nrural areas with housing issues being a major factor.\n  So the question is, How can we expect our kids to receive a quality \neducation when we cannot get good teachers to stay? How can we meet the \nmandates of No Child Left Behind in such an educational environment?\n  Clearly, the lack of teacher housing in rural Alaska is an issue that \nmust be addressed in order to ensure that children in the rural parts \nof the State receive the same level of education as their peers in more \nurban settings.\n  My bill authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nprovide teacher housing funds to the Alaska Housing Finance \nCorporation, which is the State of Alaska's public housing agency. In \nturn, the corporation is authorized to provide grant and loan funds to \nrural school districts in Alaska for teaching housing projects. This \nlegislation will allow the school districts in rural Alaska to address \nthe housing shortage in the following ways: They can construct housing \nunits, purchase housing units, lease housing units, rehabilitate, \npurchase or lease property on which the units can be constructed. They \ncan repay loans secured for teacher housing projects and conduct other \nactivities normally related to the construction, purchase, and \nrehabilitation of the teacher housing projects.\n\n  This also includes transporting construction equipment and materials \nto and from the communities in which these projects occur, which in the \nState is a particular concern because most of these communities are \naccessible only by air or water. Eligible school districts that accept \nfunds under this legislation will be required to provide the housing to \nteachers, administrators, other school staffs, and members of their \nhouseholds. It is imperative that we address this important issue and \nallow the disbursement of funds to be handled at the State level. The \nquality of the education of our rural students is at stake.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13306-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13306-S13307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the majority \nleader of the Senate, Bill Frist. I do not do this because he is my \ngood friend but because I want to make sure that we all understand that \nwe have had an exceptionally productive legislative year. I thank him \nespecially for his critical help in passing legislation in areas where \nI have been primarily responsible. In addition to that, I want to \nsummarize the things that have been done this year under his \nleadership.\n  The reason I came to talk about this is because there is such an \noverwhelming, high-octane negativism in the air that one would hardly \nknow the Senate was at work. There is so much politics going on that \none would wonder whether the Senate is even functioning. Even on the \nfloor there is an awful lot of polarization that has occurred. I do not \nsay this in any real accusatory sense. It is true.\n  In spite of that, in his own way, the majority leader has very \nquietly and with very mature feelings and inordinate ability grasped \ndetails of legislation and has contributed immensely to a success \nstory.\n  I would like to start by talking about matters that this Senator has \nparticularly been involved in. We were able to pass in this body an \nEnergy Policy Act. We have been working at that for almost a decade, \nbut for the last 3 years we have tried each year and failed. This year, \nwe got it done.\n  Obviously, something was done differently. That is, we attempted to \ncreate a bipartisan bill in the committee under my chairmanship, with \nthe help of Senator Bingaman, and the majority leader, as leader in the \nSenate, should take great pride in that accomplishment, and we should \nas a Senate.\n  In addition, as it pertains to things the Senator from New Mexico \nworks on, we sent to the President for his signature an appropriations \nbill that is called Energy and Water appropriations. That bill \ncontained hundreds of millions of dollars that go to the storm-ravaged \ngulf coast. It is there to continue critical projects that are already \nstarted and moving along. They are projects that are needed. They are \nnot part of the great concern about how much may be spent or should not \nbe spent. These are public works projects in that four-State area that \nare important. I think that is very good.\n  In that bill, the nuclear armament programs of the United States went \nthrough to the President of the United States and also some very \nimportant nuclear nonproliferation activities.\n  In addition, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee was part of a \nreconciliation bill--let us call that the deficit reduction bill--that \npassed. The occupant of the chair in the committee that we served on \ncontributed a piece of that. For the first time, we sent in such a bill \nfor the start-up of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge activity\n\n[[Page S13307]]\n\nwhere we will be starting to find out what is up there in terms of \nproducing oil for the United States. That bill was a big achievement, \n$36 billion in deficit reduction. I guarantee that could not have been \ndone without the help of the majority leader. So we got that done also \nwith his very exceptional attention, his enlightened approach to \ngetting people together. We barely did that, and without his help it \nwould not have happened.\n  Finally, literally scores of small bills that are part of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee have passed the Senate within the last \n2 days, for various things around the country. We thank him for getting \nthat done. Yesterday, we passed big legislation and who would have \nthought 6 weeks ago we could pass it. It is the tax provisions of the \nBudget Act. We all know that that was hard. That extended the \nalternative minimum tax so it affects far less Americans in a negative \nway on the amount they owe to the Government. It extended research and \ndevelopment tax credits for American business so they can continue to \ninvest in research. That whole bill had many items in it that are good \nfor America's future. We got it passed. There are some things in it, \nobviously, that I do not like, and I hope some of those are not \ncontinued, because I think some of them are negative to the production \nof oil in the future, but overall, by an overwhelming vote, we passed a \ntax measure that moves us ahead. That was the strategy, for all of that \nwas worked out with the help of our leader and the help of other \ndistinguished Senators, including the chairman and ranking member of \nthat committee.\n\n  I mentioned the Energy Policy Act, but let me back up to some other \nthings people take for granted. They say, ``So what?'' We know our \nFounding Fathers said, with reference to bankruptcy in our country, the \nU.S. Government would have exclusive authority. For years we know the \nbankruptcy law of the Nation needed reform. How many times have we had \nbankruptcy reform on the floor only to see it fail? This year it \nfinally passed. It will make those who file for bankruptcy slightly \nmore responsible. That is, after they are finished, if they can by way \nof their job pay a small portion of what they owed, they will. That is \nall subject to criteria which the judges will administer so we are sure \nwe are asking only those who can afford it to pay some. Finally, it was \npassed.\n  I say to the Senate that was a great credit to all of the Senate, but \nalso to the distinguished majority leader for pushing, for exercising \nthe dedication, and most of all, there is a certain steadfastness about \nthis leader. He doesn't give up. He says what he is going to do. He \nstays right on it, and this is another example.\n  In addition, we have had the issue of excessive litigation. It still \nhangs over us like something we cannot quite fathom, but it is rampant. \nWe were told the other day that American companies spend more on \nlitigation than they do on research when you add it all up. That is a \nrather startling thing. This bill we passed will not fix that. \nHopefully, sometime we will address it even more broadly. But we did \npass a class action reform piece of legislation. We had only one part \nof that pass about 8 years ago. But this one makes it more difficult to \nabuse the class action litigation part of the Federal jurisdiction, \nwhere we use our Federal courts to accomplish class action suits. That \nis a great feather in the hat of the Senate because it has taken so \nlong to get there. For that, we have to say to our majority leader: \nThank you for your leadership. It is terrific.\n  The highway bill--let's leave aside the pieces of the highway bill. \nLet's talk about the overall funding of the highway system of America \nby the gasoline tax imposed on our citizens. That was tied up. It was \nsupposed to have been passed 3 years ago. It got passed after that \nperiod of time. I think the absolute commitment it would get done, and \nthe power of a majority leader's office, got us there. That is very \nimportant.\n  The Senate has passed all of its appropriation bills. It looks as \nthough we may have been able to avoid an omnibus appropriation bill--or \nwe are going to. Let's hope so. If we do, that will be a very big \ncredit. But at least we are on the way. We have not gotten them all \npassed in both Houses, but they have all cleared this institution, \nwhich is a credit at this time of year. We don't do that very often. So \nthat is another thing we can say that demonstrates we have had good \nleadership, good direction, and good pressure, the kind of positive \npressure the Republican leader brings.\n  I am going to wrap up by talking about judicial appointments. I would \nbe remiss if I did not mention that the United States of America has a \nnew Chief Justice. It is pretty fair to say that the extraordinary \npatience and persistence of the majority leader got us to this place. \nThe country is pleased with it. That is obvious. While they do not know \neverything about these nominees, they learn about our Supreme Court \nnominees because there is much openness. This man is ultimately a \ncredit to the President for nominating him, the Senate for finally \ndoing what they should, and to our majority leader for pushing it as he \ndid.\n  Everybody has to acknowledge there are three or four things we must \nget done. They, too, are being looked at with the precision and the \ndedication and stick-to-it-iveness of our leader. They are right there \non the horizon for next year.\n  I understand the asbestos quagmire is something people wouldn't think \nis big enough to be listed among the most important pieces of pending \nlegislation. Let me say there is no question it is. Asbestos liability, \nfor better or for worse, the reality of it, brings to the American \neconomic system a chance, an opportunity, a probability of real job \nloss, fantastic economic degradation, and it must be resolved.\n  The leader has played a big role. Two Senators have been working on \nit on the majority side for years. Senator Specter is very close, with \nthe help of our majority leader, to getting a package that can be \nbipartisan. That is next.\n  We know broad immigration reform is right up on the screen. That is \nvery difficult. I say, and predict, since the majority leader says it \nis going to get done this coming year, I believe those who have been \nwaiting are going to be able to say it will be done. I believe so.\n  Obviously, much more must be done. Other things we have passed are \nnot very publicly known yet, and should be. I can't do much about it. \nBut essentially, a bill on health technology passed last night without \nmuch ado. I say it is a giant step.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is a giant step in the modernization of the delivery \nsystem, which will save money. I won't take much time, except to say \nthe majority leader had a lot to do with that.\n  I failed to mention that while all of this was going on, that I \nmentioned the Senate passed an important bill, the free trade \nagreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Who would have \nthought 6 months ago that this, too, would be in this litany of \nsuccesses? But it is.\n  All in all, in spite of all the noise, in spite of all the bickering, \nin spite of everything that seems to be moving toward polarization and \npoliticization in the Senate, we did get a lot done. I particularly \nthink much of that is attributable to the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Bill Frist. I want to again indicate to him, from this \nSenator, my great appreciation for his work and my admiration for how \nhe does that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13307-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13307-S13308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PROVIDING FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, it has been nearly 6 weeks since \nPakistan was devastated by one of the most powerful and deadly \nearthquakes in modern times. More than 140,000 people were killed or \ninjured in the disaster. The earthquake left 3 million people homeless; \nhundreds of thousands of children were left without schools. More than \na million jobs were wiped out.\n  I have come to the floor this afternoon to remind my colleagues that \nas we are prepared to leave town to spend the holidays with our \nfamilies, to enjoy a wonderful Thanksgiving meal with turkey and all \nthe trimmings, as we sit around our dining tables and warm houses with \nfamily and friends close by, and we give thanks for all our blessings, \nlet's also pause and remember those halfway around the world who will \nnot even have enough to eat that day, will not have a warm house, and \nwho are facing a winter ahead of cold and deprivation. These are the \npeople of Pakistan, one of our most important strategic allies in Asia, \nespecially in the war against terrorism.\n  There are many difficult months and years ahead for the Pakistani \npeople and the immediate danger is that the winter snows will now soon \nmake relief efforts in Kashmir difficult and in some places all but \nimpossible, even by helicopter. Americans can be very proud of the role \nour Armed Forces have played in relief operations in the earthquake \nzone. Immediately after the disaster struck, the United States offered \nPakistan $156 million in aid. We deployed 950 soldiers as well as 24 \nhelicopters. As I speak, a U.S. Army mobile surgical hospital is \noperating in Muzzafarabad, providing medical care to thousands of quake \nvictims.\n  To give our colleagues and viewers watching on C-SPAN a better idea \nof the devastation in Pakistan, I share several photographs taken by a \nformer member of my staff, Mr. Sam Afridi, who now works for the \nInternational Labor Organization in Geneva. Earlier this month he \nvisited some of the most hard-hit areas, including Muzzafarabad, and \nBalakot. These pictures speak for themselves.\n  Here is Balakot police station with hardly a stone standing on top of \nanother stone.\n  Here is another--devastation in the local neighborhood. As you can \nsee, the resilience of the people--they are already setting up their \nfruit and vegetable stands to help out one another.\n  This is another indication of the devastation. Here you can see the \nU.S. Army Chinooks flying overhead in this picture.\n  Here is a picture of the Hizwan public high school. The earthquake \nkilled 50 students, including the principal's son. You see all the \nclothes and the backpacks still left there.\n  Here is a project Mr. Afridi was involved in, the International Labor \nOrganization Emergency Employment. They are hiring people to clean up \nthe debris and move the debris out of the roads. They are working to \nclean up the devastation.\n  Here is a young child caught in the rubble in a full body cast. We \nhope he is going to be all right, but the child may be disabled for the \nrest of his life.\n  Here is a young boy, showing the crutches and the fact that, while we \nhope he can walk again, we don't know if he will ever walk again.\n  These are some of the images from a country that has been a great \nfriend of ours and a great ally of ours for a long time. Even back \nduring all of the years of the Cold War, Pakistan we could always reply \non--always. They have fought beside us, side by side, in every war we \nhave had, from the Korean war on.\n  We have done some things, as I mentioned, but we must do more. The \nWashington Post editorial pointed out this morning that, after the \nIndian Ocean tsunami that killed 200,000 people, the United States sent \nnearly $1 billion in government aid, 16,000 soldiers, 57 helicopters, \n42 aircraft, and 25 ships--$1 billion. Thus far we have offered \nPakistan $156 million.\n  We sent 16,000 soldiers after the tsunami. In Pakistan we deployed \n950. After the tsunami, 57 helicopters, Pakistan 24.\n  While I am sure that aid is welcomed, what I am trying to point out \nis the devastation here was every bit as devastating; there were \n140,000 Pakistanis killed in the earthquake.\n  Half that many are now homeless and facing a desperate winter without \neven as much as a tent.\n  The assistance we have offered Pakistan--one of our best friends and \nlong-time allies, a crucial ally in our war on terror has been way too \nmodest.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial from this morning's \nWashington Post printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 18, 2005]\n\n                           Winter in Kashmir\n\n       It takes advanced seismographs to anticipate earthquakes \n     and computerized weather models to predict hurricanes. It \n     doesn't take sophisticated technology to predict that leaving \n     thousands without shelter in the freezing Himalayas will be \n     disastrous. Unfortunately, however, predictability is not a \n     predictor of action. With perhaps two weeks to go before \n     snows close down the relief efforts that followed the Kashmir \n     earthquake, it's not clear that enough has been done to avert \n     a horrific secondary disaster.\n       Last month's earthquake caused an initial death toll of at \n     least 74,000 and left perhaps 3 million people homeless. But \n     so far only about 340,000 tents have been distributed. \n     Doctors are trying to immunize 1.2 million children put at \n     risk by bad shelter, diet and sanitation. But the \n     immunization drive has only half the $8 million that it \n     needs. Relief teams are trying to position stocks of food in \n     remote villages before the snows come. But the food lift got \n     underway belatedly, although donors led by the United States \n     have provided helicopters.\n       As The Post's John Lancaster described it Sunday, the \n     contrast with the Indian Ocean tsunami is distressing. After \n     the tsunami, the United States sent nearly $1 billion in \n     government aid, 16,000 soldiers, 57 helicopters, 42 other \n     aircraft and 25 ships. After the Kashmir quake, the United \n     States has offered Pakistan $156 million in aid, including \n     military equipment; deployed 950 soldiers; and sent 24 \n     helicopters. Aid that's available for immediate relief needs \n     has been especially slow in coming. The United Nations has \n     appealed for $550 million in emergency aid, but donors have \n     pledged only $159 million.\n       The tsunami triggered a tsunami of generosity because it \n     hit during the holiday season and because Western tourists \n     were affected. But the logistics of getting relief into the \n     Himalayas are more daunting; the weather is more punishing. \n     While no deaths were linked to disease and hunger following \n     the tsunami, the risk of an after-disaster in Kashmir is \n     real. Add in Pakistan's two-headed role as an ally in the war \n     on terrorism and an incubator of terrorists, and the case for \n     scoring a combined humanitarian-foreign policy success by \n     delivering more relief faster should be obvious. President \n     Bush has sent Karen Hughes, his chief of public diplomacy, to \n     Pakistan. But sending another fleet of helicopters would be \n     even more helpful.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as the editorial points out, we have a \nbig stake in delivering much more generous relief to Pakistan. Largely \nbecause of the war in Iraq, America's standing in the Muslim world has \nfallen dramatically in recent years.\n  According to a recent Pew Center poll, only 22 percent of Pakistanis \nexpressed a favorable view of the American people.\n  So clearly the aftermath of the earthquake is a chance for us to put \nour best foot forward, demonstrating our compassion, generosity, our \nfriendship for the Pakistani people.\n  By reaching out to them in their hour of need, we can show the people \nof Pakistan that we see their country as more than a base for \noperations against terrorists.\n\n[[Page S13309]]\n\n  To that end, I urge President Bush, Secretary of State Rice, and the \nGovernment to take a more assertive leadership role in rallying the \ninternational community to assist Pakistan. We can begin tomorrow at \nthe International Donors' Conference in Islamabad. To date, the \ninternational community has only provided a quarter of the emergency \nrelief that the United Nations requested for earthquake assistance in \nPakistan.\n  Let me repeat that. The United Nations has appealed for $550 million \nin assistance for Pakistan, but donor nations have pledged only one-\nfourth of that amount.\n  In contrast, 1 month after the Indian Ocean tsunami, the U.N.'s \nemergency appeal was 99 percent filled. Now it is only a quarter \nfilled.\n  Some good things are happening. For example, as I pointed out, the \nInternational Labor Organization has set up an emergency cash-for-work \nprogram in the earthquake region. People are being put to work making \ninfrastructure repairs, removing debris, improving sanitation.\n  This is a picture of the International Labor Organization and their \nemergency employment and what they are doing.\n  The aim of this program is to inject cash back into the local \neconomy, while helping people get back to work to support themselves.\n  According to my former staff member, Mr. Afribi, one of the \nparticipants in this program said to him, ``For every rupee we get for \nthis work, it feels like 10 because we have earned it.''\n  So clearly these are people of pride and dignity and they are willing \nto work hard. They are looking for a handup, not a handout. It behooves \nus to be more generous and forthcoming than we have been to date. We \nneed to continue to provide immediate emergency humanitarian relief. \nBut we also need to tend to the longer term needs of the survivors.\n  Many children, as I have shown, have had amputations. They need to be \ncared for. Safeguards need to be put in place to ensure that their \ndisabilities do not get in the way of their education. Past experience \ntells us that such children are vulnerable to being exploited in the \nworkplace. In closing, we have an important mission here--to come to \nthe aid of the Pakistani people in their moment of maximum need.\n  I have many good friends in the Pakistani-American communities. I \nhave many good friends in Pakistan. I was privileged to visit there \nthis September, the third time I have been to Pakistan. I traveled \nquite extensively in the country. The Pakistani people are wonderful. \nThey are highly educated and skilled. The Pakistanis in America, who \nhave come to make a better life for themselves, are doctors, surgeons, \nengineers, and so on. Many of them have called me, eager to get \ninvolved in the relief in Pakistan.\n  We ought to be looking for ways for the USAID to provide a way for \nthese people to go to Pakistan, under the American flag, for a period \nof weeks or months so they can put their talents to use in assisting \nthe earthquake victims.\n  This would send a powerful message of friendship and good will of the \nAmerican people to the Pakistani people.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember the pictures I have shown and to \nremember, this Thanksgiving week coming up, the millions of poor people \nin Pakistan whose lives were shattered in only a few minutes, one of \nthe most devastating earthquakes to ever hit our planet. They are \nstruggling to put their lives back together. We need to do more--again, \nboth in terms of short-term relief and long-term reconstruction. Time \nand again, Pakistan has been there for us. Time and time again, from \nthe beginning of the Cold War, when they allowed our U-2 flights to fly \nfrom Peshawar over the Soviet Union, all through the Cold War, the \nKorean war, the Vietnam war, Haiti, everywhere we have been, the \nPakistanis have been by our side. Now it is our turn to be there for \nthe people of Pakistan in their hour of need. During this Thanksgiving \nweek, let us resolve to do better than we have done in the past.\n  I urge the President and the Secretary of State at the Donors' \nConference tomorrow in Islamabad to step forward to lead the \ninternational community to do better than they have done in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COLEMAN). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13309-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13309-S13311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we look out the window in most of our \ngreat country, we can witness the season change, the change in the \nseason, and we can feel it. The air has become crisp with autumnal \nchill. The leaves on the trees change their color; from the exuberant, \ngreen lushness of the summer months to the tired, brown, yellow, and \nred of the autumn, much like the graying hair of a man advancing in \nage.\n  Nature can sometimes mimic human events with a subtlety that no words \ncan quite convey. As our country heads into the season that is \ncelebrated with the love of family and the love of home, Americans \nshould also look across the landscape of America and reflect upon the \nloss of so many young Americans in the 12 months since autumn last fell \nupon us.\n  Think about it. In the past year, more than 820 servicemembers have \nlost their lives in Iraq.\n  The evening news features pictures of American troops who have \nperished in service to our flag, in service to our country. I am struck \nby these colorful mosaics of these troops, amen; the green and blue of \ntheir uniforms set against the background of the bold colors of our \nflag, Old Glory, Old Glory. Each of these proud troops holds an \nexpression of pride and courage, even though many of them appear to be \nso young. Note their ages--18, 19, 20, 21--just starting out in life, \nhaving one full glance of what is around them.\n  I can only imagine the grief of their loving families during this \ntime of the year, as the somber tones of fall contrast with the joy of \nbeing with family during the upcoming holidays. I pray that God, \nAlmighty God, will comfort those who have suffered losses, that He will \nbless the fallen in their everlasting life, and that His hand will \nprotect those who still serve in harm's way.\n  That so many have sacrificed during this war in Iraq is reason enough \nto ask questions about our Government and about our Government's policy \nin that faraway land. Our troops continue to shed their blood, and our \nNation continues to devote enormous sums of our national wealth to \ncontinue that war.\n  The Constitution protects the American people from unjust laws that \nseek to stifle the patriotic duty to question those who are in power. \nBut it is the courage of the American people that compels them to \nactually speak out when those in power call for silence. If anything, \nattacks on patriotism of freedom-loving Americans may result in even \nmore Americans fighting against attempts to squelch the constitutional \nprotections of freedom.\n  Since our country was sent to war on March 19, 2003, 2,073 American \nmen and women have been killed. Yes, 2,073 Americans have died. Nearly \n16,000 troops have been wounded.\n\n  Our military is straining under the repeated deployment of our \ntroops, including the members of the National Guard. They come from all \nwalks of life. They are lawyers. They are teachers. They are preachers. \nThey are coal miners. They are farmers. More than $214 billion has been \nspent in Iraq and the end is not in sight. More than $214 billion spent \nin Iraq and the end is not in sight. Urban combat takes place each day, \nevery day, in Baghdad, all day long. Every day and night.\n  Veterans hospitals in our own country are threatened by budget \nshortfalls, and yet Americans are still left to wonder, when will our \nbrave troops be coming home? When?\n  I opposed this war in Iraq from the outset. From the beginning I \nspoke out against our entry into this war. I pleaded with my \ncolleagues. I pleaded with the White House. I asked questions that have \nnot been answered. I spoke out against the invasion of a country which \ndid not pose an imminent threat to our national security. I said so \nthen--and I was right. I opposed the war in Iraq from the outset. From \nthe word go, I opposed it. But our troops were ordered to go to Iraq \nand they went.\n\n[[Page S13310]]\n\n  The question is, now, when will they come home? The administration \nhas so far laid out only a vague policy, saying our troops will come \nhome when the Iraqi Government is ready to take responsibility for its \ncountry. When our troops are no longer needed, when the job is done, \nthey will come home. We will not stay a day longer than we are needed.\n  That sort of political doublespeak is small comfort to the mothers \nand the fathers of our fighting men and women, the mothers and fathers \nwho turn and toss upon their pillows, whose tears wet the pillows, \nwhose prayers break the silence of night. Oh, when will they come home? \nBring my boy home. Oh, God, this awful war.\n  Wednesday evening the Vice President of the United States, even \nclaimed that criticism of the administration's war in Iraq was \ndishonest and reprehensible. Did you hear that? Hear me, now; let me \nsay that again: On Wednesday evening the Vice President of the United \nStates, the man who is within a heartbeat of being the President of the \nUnited States, the Vice President of the United States even claimed \nthat criticism of the administration's war in Iraq was ``dishonest and \nreprehensible.''\n  Since when are we not to lift our voices? Are the American people not \nto lift their voices in criticism of the administration's war in Iraq? \nIs it dishonest on the part of the American people to do that? Is it \nreprehensible on the part of mothers and fathers of sons and daughters \nwho were sent to that most dangerous country in the world? Is it \nreprehensible? Did the Vice President measure his words? The Vice \nPresident's comments come on the heels of comments from President Bush, \nwho said:\n\n       What bothers me is when people are irresponsibly using \n     their positions and playing politics. That's exactly what is \n     taking place in America.\n\n  Listen to that. The President and the Vice President need to reread \nthe Constitution, take another look at that inimitable document. Asking \nquestions, seeking honesty and truth, and pressing for accountability \nis exactly what the Framers had in mind. What would George Washington \nsay? What would Alexander Hamilton say? What would James Madison say? \nWhat would Gouverneur Morris say? What would James Wilson say?\n  Questioning policies and practices, especially ones that have cost \nthis Nation more than 2,000 of her bravest sons and daughters, is the \nresponsibility of every American and is also a central role of Congress \nas our duty as the elected representatives of a free people. We--you, \nyou, you and I--we are the elected representatives of the American \npeople, the people all over this vast land, its plains, its prairies, \nits mountains, it valleys, its lakes, its rivers, its seas. Yes, we are \nthe men and women who are tasked with seeking the truth. Is that \nirresponsible to seek the truth?\n  But instead of working with the Congress, instead of clearing the \nair, the White House falls back to the irksome practice of attack, \nattack, attack; obscure, obscure, obscure; attack. The American people \nare tired of these reprehensible tactics. If anything is reprehensible, \nit is these tactics.\n  Circling the wagons will not serve this administration well. What the \npeople demand are the facts. They want the truth. They want their \nelected leaders to level with them. And when it comes to the war in \nIraq, this administration seems willing to do anything it can do to \navoid the truth, a truth I believe will reveal that the Bush \nadministration did, indeed, manipulate the facts in order to lead this \nNation down the road to war. War. War.\n  The administration claims that the Congress had the same intelligence \nas the President before the war and that independent commissions have \ndetermined there was no misrepresentation of the intelligence. But \nneither claim is true. The intelligence agencies are under the control \nof the White House. All information given to the Congress was cleared \nthrough the White House. And the President had access to an enormous \namount of data never shared with the Congress. There was a filter over \nthe intelligence information the Congress received. That filter was the \nadministration, which is actively engaged in hyping the danger and \nlusting after this war, this terrible war in Iraq.\n  Remember the talk of weapons of mass destruction? Remember the talk \nof mushroom clouds? Remember? Remember the talk of unmanned drones? The \nso-called proof for war was massaged before it was sent to Congress, to \nscare Members, and leaked to reporters to scare people.\n  No independent commission has stated that the case for war was \nindisputable. Commissions have looked at how the intelligence fell \nshort, but none have yet examined possible political manipulation.\n  Even the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence slowed its \nexamination, stalled its examination of possible White House \nmanipulation. My colleague from West Virginia, the ranking member of \nthe Intelligence Committee, Senator Jay Rockefeller, is rightly \npressing for answers.\n  Right now we are engaged in a mission with no definition. That is \ntroubling because without a clearly defined mission, it is impossible \nto determine when our effort is truly accomplished.\n  This week, the Senate had the opportunity to establish some very \nbasic benchmarks for progress in Iraq, benchmarks that would have \nclearly outlined goals and provided accountability in meeting those \ngoals. The proposal, offered by the senior Senator from Michigan, \nSenator Carl Levin, was a modest, flexible approach that would have \ngiven our troops, their families, the American people, and the Iraqi \npeople some basic guidepost. Unfortunately, the Senate turned its back. \nIt could not see the wisdom of this approach. It could not bring itself \nto see the wisdom of the approach.\n  So, my fellow Senators, it is vital that we have benchmarks against \nwhich to gauge our progress. That is how we can measure effectiveness \nand, most importantly, how we know when the job is done. The \nadministration's strategy of keeping our troops in Iraq for as long as \nit takes--have you heard that before? Keeping our troops in Iraq for as \nlong as it takes?--that is the wrong strategy. Who knows how long it \nwill take for the Iraqi Government to institute order in that \nfractured, unhappy, miserable country?\n  Unfortunately, the questions that the American people are asking \nabout the missteps and the mistakes in the war in Iraq are not being \nanswered by this White House, not being answered by the administration. \nVice President Cheney has dismissed these important questions as \n``making a play for political advantage in the middle of a war.''\n  Now, listen to that. The Vice President of the United States has \ndismissed these important questions as ``making a play for political \nadvantage in the middle of a war.'' How about that?\n  Perhaps the Vice President should question White House aides about \nusing war for political advantage. For example, on January 19, 2002, \nthe Washington Post reported that Karl Rove--get this--advised \nRepublicans to ``make the president's handling of the war on terrorism \nthe centerpiece of their strategy to win back the Senate and keep \ncontrol of the House in this year's midterm elections.'' Does the Vice \nPresident have anything to say about that?\n  Let me say that again. On January 19, 2002--I read about it at the \ntime; I did not miss it--the Washington Post reported that Karl Rove \nadvised Republicans to ``make the president's handling of the war on \nterrorism the centerpiece of their strategy to win back the Senate and \nkeep control of the House in this year's midterm elections.'' That was \nsaid on January 19, 2002. That was quoted in the Post on that date. \nYes, does the Vice President have anything to say about that?\n  The Vice President also lashed out at those who might deceive our \ntroops:\n\n       The saddest part is that our people in uniform have been \n     subjected to these cynical and pernicious falsehoods day in \n     and day out.\n\n  Now, listen to that. Was the Vice President trying to clarify some of \nhis past statements on Iraq? Was he?\n  On March 24, 2002, the Vice President said that Iraq ``is actively \npursuing nuclear weapons at this time.'' There was no doubt about it, \nto listen to the Vice President--no doubt.\n  On August 26, 2002, the Vice President said:\n\n       Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now \n     has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt that he is \n     amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, \n     and against us.\n\n\n[[Page S13311]]\n\n\n  Let me go back and read the quote. Let me repeat it.\n  On August 26, 2002, here is what the Vice President said:\n\n       Simply stated, there is no doubt--\n\n  Get that--\n\n       Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now \n     has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt that he is \n     amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, \n     and against us.\n\n  That is the end of the quotation.\n  On March 16, 2003, the Vice President said:\n\n       We will, in fact, be greeted as liberators.\n\n  Do you remember that?\n  On March 16, 2003, there it is, the Vice President said:\n\n       We will, in fact, be greeted as liberators.\n\n  Are these the ``pernicious falsehoods'' that the Vice President \nbelieves our troops have been subjected to? That is, of course, a \nrhetorical question. Far from questioning his own statements about the \nwar in Iraq, the Vice President's comments are a ham-handed attempt to \nsquelch the questions that the American people out there are asking \nabout the administration's policies in Iraq. The American people should \nnot be cowed. They should not be intimidated. And Senators should not \nbe intimidated by these attempts to intimidate. The American people \nshould not allow the subject to be changed from the war in Iraq to \npartisan sniping in Washington.\n  Instead, the American people must raise their voices--hear us--the \nAmerican people should raise their voices--hear us, listen to us--the \nAmerican people must raise their voices even louder to ask the \nadministration the same simple questions: What is your policy for Iraq? \nAnswer that. What is your policy? Is it stay the course? When will the \nwar be over? How many more lives will this war cost? When will our \ntroops return home?\n  Mr. President, the holiday season is almost upon us. Americans will \nsoon sit down at their Thanksgiving tables. They will gather together \nto give thanks to Almighty God, give thanks to Him for the blessings \nthat have been bestowed upon America's families. As we gather, there \nwill be an empty seat at many tables. Some chairs will be empty because \na service member is serving his or her country in a faraway land. Other \nseats will be empty as a silent tribute to those who will never, never \nreturn.\n  Each of these troops has fought to protect our freedoms, including \nthe freedom of Americans to ask questions--yes, the freedom to ask \nquestions. Our troops have fought for that freedom--people back home, \ntheir families, might ask questions, their friends might ask \nquestions--the freedom to ask questions of their Government, the \npeople's Government.\n  The whole picture, the truth is that the continued occupation of Iraq \nonly serves to drive that country closer to civil war. They do not want \nus there. They do not want us there.\n  How would you feel, Senators, how would you feel if our country were \ninvaded by another country? You would want them out. You would do \nanything you could to get them out. American troops are now perceived \nas occupiers, not as liberators. The longer we stay, the more dangerous \nIraq becomes, and the more likely it is we will drive the future \ngovernment further from a democratic republic and closer to religious \nfundamentalism and, not insignificantly, the more American and Iraqi \nlives will be lost--forever.\n  I, for one, believe that it is time to say ``well done''--``well \ndone''--to our brave fighting men and women. May God bless them one and \nall. Let us say, job well done, and start to bring the troops home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BURNS). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13311-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13311-S13315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LILY STEVENS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last night, as the Senate was working into \nthe late hours of the night and tensions were running high, our \nesteemed and beloved colleague, the former chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, took me by the arm and pulled me aside. There \nwas something he wanted to show me. There was something that my \nesteemed and beloved colleague, Ted Stevens, wanted to say to me and \nwanted to show me. There was something he wanted to show me. It was an \narticle that his daughter Lily Stevens had written about the U.S. \nCapitol, and he wanted to share it with me.\n  I was touched by this. I know Lily. What a prodigious memory she has. \nAh, what a rose in full bloom, what a lovely woman, Lily. She adores \nher father. He adores her.\n  With everything that was going on in the Senate at the time, Senator \nStevens was showing a father's pride in his daughter's accomplishment.\n  I have literally watched Lily grow up. In her article, she points out \nthat her father was already a Senator when she was born, and while she \nwas a baby, her father would bring her to the Capitol--I have seen him \nmany times--and carry her around in a basket. I remember that, just as \nI remember how she attended a number of my parties, and I attended a \nnumber of hers.\n  I watched her grow into the remarkably--talented person she is today. \nShe is a graduate of Stanford University and is currently a law student \nat the University of California at Berkeley. Lily is not only \nprodigious and intelligent, but she also is a polite, courteous, \ngracious, and charming young lady. Senator Stevens is so proud of her, \nand he has a right to be.\n  The article his daughter wrote is an outgrowth of her senior thesis \nat Stanford University, and as I read it, I understood why Senator \nStevens was so excited about it and why he wanted to share it with me. \nTitled, ``The Message of the Dome: The United States Capitol in the \nPopular Media,'' the article explores the ways in which the Capitol has \nserved and communicated with the general American public over the \nyears. It discusses the Capitol as a symbol to the American people and \nhow the meaning of that symbol has changed over time.\n  This beautifully written article skillfully conveys the sense of \nwonder that awaits every first-time visitor to Capitol Hill. With a \ntrip to the Capitol, Lily points out, a visit to Washington goes well \nbeyond ``a vacation in the leisure sense.'' It becomes ``an education \njourney, one in which the visitor can learn more about the government \nand the history of the United States.''\n  And Lily's article makes fascinating and intriguing points about this \nbuilding in which her father, Senator Ted Stevens, and I work. Visitors \nto the Capitol, Lily Stevens writes, while sharing certain common \nexperiences, still find their own individual interests. As she quotes \none author: ``The Capitol means many things to many people.''\n  Lily Stevens makes the point about how the Capitol functions as a \n``national shrine,'' a place for appreciating our democratic form of \ngovernment and for praising our Nation, our history, and our national \nleaders. And she explains how, over the years, the Capitol has \nfunctioned as a church. Indeed, religious services were once held in \nthis building. And the Capitol still performs many functions that are \nreligious in nature, like funeral services for certain national \nleaders. Statuary Hall, she points out, can be seen and interpreted as \n``an American Westminster Abbey.'' How about that?\n  There is so much fascinating reading in this article, I could speak \nlong about it. I am asking that it be printed in the Congressional \nRecord, and I urge all my colleagues to read it. I promise you, you \nwill enjoy it.\n  Senator Ted Stevens is also entitled today to his own personal \ncongratulations. Why? Today, November 18, is Senator Stevens' birthday. \nHow about that? Senator Stevens' birthday, today. A wonderful man, a \ngreat legislator. Today Senator Stevens is 82 years young. Oh, to be 82 \nagain. Just to be 82 again, oh, my. I said to Ted: ``The next 5 years \nare going to be the heaviest, Ted.'' I know. Five years ago I didn't \nneed those canes, no. My feet and legs were still good.\n  Senator Stevens and I have worked together in the Senate since 1968, \nand we have been on the Senate Appropriations Committee together since \n1972. In all this time together, I have always known Senator Ted \nStevens to be an\n\n[[Page S13312]]\n\noutstanding Senator, a great colleague, and a trusted friend. Oh, I \nrealize he may grumble every now and then. He is getting a little bit \ngrumbly. But you can forgive him for that.\n  You never have to be concerned about turning your back on him. He is \nhonest. He is straightforward. And his word is his bond. Over the years \nwe have had our spats, but never once did I doubt our friendship, our \nadmiration for this country, its flag, each other, and our ability to \nwork together.\n  So today, Ted, I say in the words of the poet:\n\n     Count your garden by the flowers,\n     Never by the leaves that fall.\n     Count your days by the sunny hours,\n     And not remembering clouds at all.\n     Count your nights by stars, not shadows,\n     Count your life by smiles, not tears.\n     And on this beautiful November afternoon,\n     Senator Stevens, count your age by friends, not years.\n\n  I conclude my remarks by again congratulating Senator Stevens on his \n82nd birthday and on his beautiful daughter's marvelous work. I thank \nTed Stevens for being a superb colleague and a great friend, a great \nservant of his people in Alaska, and for sharing Lily's article with \nme.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n ``The Message of the Dome:'' the United States Capitol in the Popular \n                            Media, 1865-1946\n\n                           (By Lily Stevens)\n\n       Anyone who has spent a considerable amount of time in the \n     nation's capital has a particular experience with the white \n     building on the Hill. Growing up in Washington D.C., I never \n     lost the wonder and excitement of visiting the Capitol. I \n     cannot remember the first time I entered the building, as it \n     was in a small basket carried by my father. He was elected to \n     represent the state of Alaska in the Senate before I was \n     born. As a little girl, I loved walking up the marble stairs \n     within the building, feeling the grooves worn into the center \n     of each step. I would run my hand up the shiny round \n     banisters attached to the wall and shuffle my feet along step \n     after step. The Capitol was a wondrous place that always \n     seemed to be changing. I could have run for hours around the \n     big tile circles on the floor, following one pattern until it \n     made me so dizzy that I lay on the ground laughing, staring \n     at the tall ceiling, until I got up to start my game again.\n       There were just so many things to look at: the marble heads \n     on stands that towered above me, the paintings on the walls \n     and ceilings, the many people who crowded the halls. Every \n     time I walked into the Rotunda, I would lay my head down on \n     the white circle that represents the center of Washington so \n     that I could see all of the figures on the ceiling. My next \n     stop in the Rotunda would be my favorite painting so that I \n     could count the eleven toes on one barefooted man. In \n     Statuary Hall, I would look for King Kamehameha, with his \n     brilliant gold clothes. When I left the room, my neck would \n     hurt from looking up at his enormous face, looming over six \n     feet above mine. As I grew older, I knew every ghost story, \n     and loved to tell the tales of Lincoln being spotted in his \n     tall hat before stepping through walls, of the large cat that \n     would appear in the Rotunda and continually grow larger until \n     it would finally disappear. I knew where alcohol was hidden \n     during Prohibition, where the bomb had gone off in the early \n     1980s, and where to stand to hear the whispering secrets of \n     Statuary Hall.\n       My fascination with the Capitol led me to this project for \n     my undergraduate honors thesis at Stanford University. I \n     wanted to explore the ways in which the Capitol has served \n     and communicated with the general American public. I wondered \n     why so many visitors had entered the Capitol, and what they \n     were looking to find. In my thesis, I explored what the \n     Capitol had symbolized to Americans and whether its meaning \n     had changed over time. I thought of the many images and \n     references to the Capitol that I had seen in the popular \n     media and wondered how the building had been shown and \n     described since its construction. In this excerpt, which \n     include the first chapter, ``All Roads Lead to Washington,'' \n     we will look at Washington as a figurative center of the \n     country, as the destination for anyone interested in learning \n     more about the government and the nation.\n       Authors throughout the early part of the twentieth century \n     described Washington as a natural destination for any \n     traveler. In 1940, Marion Burt Sanford offered advice for a \n     trip to the nation's capital to readers of Woman's Home \n     Companion. She declared the city to be the country's focal \n     point: ``In front of the White House is the zero milestone \n     from which all distances in the country are measured, so all \n     roads lead to Washington.'' Her article rested on a puzzling \n     premise. She claimed that Washington was a ``zero \n     milestone,'' and yet the nations's capital was certainly not \n     at the geographical center of the country. Some capitals sit \n     at a central location, convenient to every part of the \n     country: Paris, France and Madrid, Spain for example. \n     Washington, D.C., however, is on the eastern seaboard, and \n     certainly not accessible for the western portion of the \n     country. Yet taken in a figurative sense, Washington D.C. is \n     a location that draws many visitors. As the federal capital, \n     it is a destination for politicians, lobbyists, tourists, \n     school groups, and others. Every person in the United States \n     has a tie to the city, as the place where the laws are made \n     and enforced and where the country is governed. Therefore, \n     though Sanford's claim that ``all roads lead to Washington'' \n     is, in the literal sense, a misstatement, it does offer an \n     interesting way of looking a the nation's capital as a \n     magnet for many types of people.\n       While the White House was the ``zero milestone,'' Sanford \n     suggested that the first stop for any traveler must be the \n     Capitol. Even before any organized visits, the Capitol was a \n     starting point for a memorable walk in the city: ``If you \n     arrive at night and are not too weary take the taxi to the \n     Grant Statue below the Capitol and walk a mile down the wide \n     silent Mall to the illuminated Washington Monument and the \n     Lincoln Memorial. You will never forget it.'' Making a memory \n     of visiting the monuments at night was the first on her list \n     for a woman to do when coming to the city. The reader she \n     addressed was a casual visitor, one who would be interested \n     in seeing the major monuments as well as in experiencing the \n     social side of the city. Sanford advised her readers: ``The \n     first day in Washington should be given to the Capitol and \n     the surrounding buildings.'' She warned that in order to have \n     a successful trip to the nation's capital, the visit must not \n     be too hasty: ``You can't see the House and Senate in action, \n     or the rare private collections in the vast Library of \n     Congress, or saunter past the embassies on Massachusetts \n     Avenue on a hurried bus tour.'' Her proposed tour was a \n     casual one in which women, their husbands, and perphaps their \n     families could enjoy as much time as possible at different \n     points of interest.\n       Sanford's article reflected a common practice of any \n     Americans, that of a short journey to Washington to visit and \n     experience the monuments and nation's government. Central to \n     this journey was a trip to the U.S. Capitol, for the visitor \n     to wander the halls, see the building, and watch Congress in \n     action. Many articles such as Sanford's described in detail \n     the functions of the Capitol, the sculptures of Statutory \n     Hall and the paintings of the Rotunda. All offered a virtual \n     paper tour of the pubic monuments. These articles suggested \n     that the Capitol and Washington D.C. were a major point of \n     interest to Americans. Authors like Sanford encouraged a trip \n     Washington. But what did the travelers hope to learn or find \n     in the Capitol, and what types of visitors came? Why, in \n     particular, was the Capitol such a popular destination for \n     the traveler?\n       A trip to Washington was not usually a vacation in the \n     leisure sense; rather, it was an educational journey, one in \n     which the visitor could learn more about the government and \n     the history of the United States. Some articles focusing on \n     the Capitol or Washington referred to travelers as \n     ``pilgrims.'' This term for visitors to the Capitol evoked \n     both a religious tone and a reminder of the country's \n     history. In one definition of the word, pilgrims are \n     religious devotees, often covering large distances to reach a \n     particular sacred spot. In his essay on ``Geography and \n     Pilgrimage,'' Surinder Bhardwaj defined the religious pilgrim \n     in terms of three characteristics: ``. . . the religiously \n     motivated individual, the intended sacred goal or place, and \n     the act of making the spatial effort to bring about their \n     conjunction.'' Pilgrims can also be travelers in search of a \n     spiritual revelation or enlightenment, wanderers without a \n     concrete destination. One dictionary entry for ``pilgrim'' \n     declares that the word is applicable to any traveler, whether \n     on a religious mission or not. A pilgrim can be anyone who \n     leaves home behind to make a journey. In another definition, \n     the term ``pilgrim'' labels the early European settlers of \n     the United States who fled their countries, suffering \n     hardships on their trip across the ocean to be able to \n     practice religious freedom and develop their own communities. \n     This definition is perhaps not as relevant to the idea of \n     visitors to the Capitol, but the reference to the founding of \n     the United States is poignant and instructive--and would not \n     have been lost on American readers.\n       What constituted a ``pilgrimage'' to the Capitol, and who \n     were these ``pilgrims''? They all came to the nation's \n     capital to see the workings of the government and the history \n     of the buildings, but pilgrims were may different types of \n     people. They were schoolchildren brought to the building by \n     their teachers to learn a civics lesson. They were \n     historians on a pilgrimage to see the sites where certain \n     senators sat and certain documents were signed. They were \n     mourners who came to pay last respects to assassinated \n     presidents and unknown soldiers. They were also women like \n     Clara Bird Kopp, who wrote an article for the National \n     Republic describing her daylong journey around the \n     Capitol. Entitle ``A Pilgrimage to the Capitol,'' her \n     article showed ways in which an everyday person could make \n     a casual pilgrimage to the Capitol, see their senator or \n     congressman and make a connection with the building. \n     Pilgrims, therefore, could come with a specific interest, \n     could be on a trip to learn something new about the \n     government, or could just come to experience the Capitol.\n       What did these pilgrims hope to find? Certainly not on a \n     religious mission, they went to Washington in search of \n     knowledge about\n\n[[Page S13313]]\n\n     the government. The idea behind many of these trips was that \n     the complex structure of the United States Government and its \n     three branches could somehow be slightly decoded, slightly \n     more understood if one traveled to Washington. Seeing parts \n     of the government in action, whether Justices presiding in \n     the Supreme Court or Senators arguing on the floor, would \n     lead to a deeper understanding of the functions of the \n     government. Along with the live experience of viewing the \n     Congress within the Capitol came the opportunity to peruse \n     the architectural, artistic, and historic elements of the \n     building. Not only did the Capitol present highlights of the \n     country's history through artwork, it also held memories of \n     great events that took place within its walls, whether joyful \n     or sorrowful. While some who entered the Capitol and wrote \n     about their experience saw themselves as pilgrims of \n     democracy, others were casual visitors. Still others were \n     professionals in search of a certain statute or room. Some \n     were visitors on a mission, at the Capitol to lobby, protest, \n     or otherwise participate in the process of democracy.\n       One of the most visible and common groups of ``pilgrims'' \n     in the Capitol was schoolchildren. Every American education \n     included an exploration of the federal government, and often \n     a trip to Washington accompanied this lesson. In an article \n     for National Geographic Magazine, Gilbert Grosvenor included \n     a picture of group of young Americans, with a caption that \n     read: ``A group of proud pilgrims on the steps of the \n     Capitol.'' The paragraph of explanation below the image spoke \n     of the phenomenon of pilgrims, of visitors to the Capitol:\n       Tens of thousands of Americans take a short course in \n     patriotism and government annually by making a pilgrimage to \n     Washington; but none of them get more of happiness and \n     inspiration out of it than the members of the boys' and \n     girls' clubs of the rural high schools. The boys and girls in \n     this picture hail from the parishes of Louisiana and won a \n     national poultry judging contest. They are seeing Washington \n     under the guidance of one of their Senators and the Secretary \n     of Agriculture.''\n       For the students and their companions, presumably their \n     teachers or guardians, the trip to Washington was a special \n     honor. Grosvenor used them as models for his idea of the \n     pilgrimage, which he described as ``a short course in \n     patriotism and government.'' These pilgrims were becoming \n     better, more faithful citizens through their trip to the \n     Capitol and Washington. Grosvenor equated enhanced patriotism \n     with a first-hand experience in Washington, as though \n     visiting national buildings like the Capitol would naturally \n     inspire feelings of pride in the government and in the \n     country. While most visitors did, in effect, take ``a short \n     course in . . . government,'' not all necessarily left the \n     Capitol with patriotic feelings, as we will later discuss.\n       Several articles in education periodicals complemented \n     Grosvenor's positive view of the school-age child's reaction \n     to a pilgrimage to Washington by suggesting knowledge of the \n     Capitol should be basic like reading, writing, and \n     arithmetic. In the National Education Association Journal as \n     well as in School Life, articles highlighted the Capitol and \n     suggested reasons why a visitor might be interested in the \n     building. One unidentified author of such an article spoke of \n     the general visitor to Washington: ``Next to himself and his \n     home town or city, the average citizen is interested in his \n     country, its laws and lawmakers, its seat of government. In \n     April and May . . . Washington's parks and drives reflect the \n     lavish mood of nature and countless visitors climb the steps \n     leading to the Capitol.'' The author boldly stated that any \n     ``average citizen'' has a natural interest in the government \n     and that the trip to Washington, DC was a trend of \n     ``countless visitors.'' Most of the articles in education \n     magazines took this interest of the ``average citizen'' as a \n     given, and described aspects of the Capitol or Washington for \n     the pilgrim. Behind all of these articles was the idea that \n     children and adults alike would become better, more \n     knowledgeable citizens by being pilgrims, thus partaking in a \n     common experience with many other Americans.\n       Although many shared in the common experience of visiting \n     the Capitol, each individual might have found a different \n     interest. Writing in the National Education Association \n     Journal, Mildred Sandison Fenner suggested: ``The Capitol \n     means many things to many people.'' Her article appeared \n     during World War II, at a time when Washington had become a \n     center of focus for the world. She used the Capitol, as a \n     house of government and a national monument, to reach out to \n     many types of Americans and world citizens. She divided \n     people into seven categories and addressed a section to each, \n     explaining what aspects of the U.S. Capitol would be of \n     interest to those people. Her categories: travelers, \n     architects, artists, historians, teachers, ``all American \n     citizens,'' and ``all Citizens of the world who believe in \n     the four freedoms.'' By commenting on all of these specific \n     interests, she was able to describe almost every intrigue \n     about the Capitol, as well as explain her ideas about what it \n     meant to all people. Travelers, she said, would remember the \n     Capitol as their first sight if they arrived at Union \n     Station. Speaking of the architects' interests, she was \n     able to describe the basic appearance and dimensions of \n     the Capitol, as well as speak of the architects who \n     contributed to the building. Artists, she said, would be \n     interested in the ``paintings and sculptures of great \n     historic and patriotic interest.'' Her passage ``to \n     Historians'' was the longest, mentioning several moments \n     in the Capitol's history. She wrote of the laying of the \n     cornerstone, the move of the national capital to \n     Washington, the burning of the Capitol in 1814 by the \n     British, the completion of the dome during the Civil War, \n     and more.\n       According to Fenner, the Capitol embodied a variety of \n     meanings for the various visitors. For those who led the \n     school trips to Washington, the Capitol could be seen as a \n     key to a broad history. ``To teachers,'' she wrote, ``the \n     story of the capitol is an even broader one, embracing the \n     history of the country itself.'' Of course, she also admitted \n     that ``[t]o all American citizens,'' the Capitol represented \n     the basic actions of government, the legislative body and the \n     basic process of democracy. She expanded this idea in her \n     last section, addressing ``all citizens of the world who \n     believe in the four freedoms.'' To these people, Fenner \n     claimed, ``the Capitol of the United States is the `arsenal \n     of democracy.' To these millions it is a symbol of hope and a \n     prophecy of the future.''\n       As a symbol of hope and prophecy, the Capitol became a \n     ``national shrine,'' a term that appeared in a 1947 article \n     in the Saturday Evening Post. Author Beverly Smith remarked \n     upon the ways in which the building served as a center for \n     praising the government, for remembering the past: ``The \n     Capitol is part shrine, part hangout. It has been called `the \n     Caaba (holy of holies) of Liberty,' . . . Rufus Choate said, \n     `We have built no temple but the Capitol.' '' The Capitol \n     served as a national shrine, or civic temple, in a variety of \n     ways. As a mostly secular shrine, the Capitol assumed a role \n     of a place for worshipping democracy, for praising the \n     nation, its history, and its leaders. In addition to the \n     artistic remembrances of great moments past, it embodied a \n     certain history of its own, from the burning of the Capitol \n     during the War of 1812, to the memories of documents signed, \n     deals arranged, and people who visited. It was a shrine that \n     celebrated the past, present, and future of the country.\n       Like the idea of a ``pilgrim,'' the use of the word \n     ``shrine'' to describe the Capitol conveyed religious \n     connotations. Though it did not function as a religious \n     shrine, and though the United States on principle supported a \n     separation of church and state, the Capitol did have some \n     involvement with religion. Gilbert Grosvenor described one \n     way in which the Capitol functioned almost like a church: \n     ``For some years religious services were held in the old Hall \n     of Representatives on Sunday afternoons; Lincoln attended \n     them during the war period, when the hall was crowded because \n     many churches had been converted into barracks.'' The \n     national shrine also held funeral services for leaders, in \n     addition to the national tradition of leaders laying in state \n     within the rotunda. Grosvenor also commented that the placing \n     of statues in that ``old Hall of Representatives,'' \n     transformed the room into more than just Statuary Hall: ``The \n     floor of this room was raised to its present level when the \n     hall was converted into an American Westminster Abbey.'' \n     Relating the room to an American Westminster Abbey certainly \n     had religious overtones, but he was most likely referring to \n     the memorializing of leaders and notables that took place in \n     the room through sculpture.\n       Aside from memorializing American history through art, the \n     history of events within the Capitol itself reflected \n     important moments in the development of the United States. As \n     the National Education Association Journal declared, ``The \n     history of the Capitol is the history of our country.'' \n     Memories of the great and disappointing moments of the past \n     that occurred in the building illustrated various times in \n     the country's history. ``If you study this building long \n     enough,'' Beverly Smith wrote for the Saturday Evening \n     Post,\n\n     ``. . . you can learn America's history since Washington's \n     day. In the very first Congress which sat here, Jefferson was \n     elected over the devious Burr on the thirty-sixth ballot, \n     saving the young republic from who knows what oblique \n     destiny. Here Andrew Jackson escaped assassination when two \n     pistols missed fire. Here Representative--formerly \n     President--John Quincy Adams died, on that couch now in South \n     Trimble's office. In this building were voted all our wars \n     since 1800. Lincoln worked here as a congressman. Here \n     Woodrow Wilson pleaded, and Franklin Roosevelt spoke, tired \n     and tense in his chair, after his return from Yalta.''\n       Her readers received a crash course in some highlights and \n     low points of American history and pride. Notable events \n     include the deaths of officials within the building, the \n     actions of the Congress, and the presence of great leaders. \n     These events were not readily apparent to the tourist. In \n     order for a visitor to appreciate what history the building \n     held, they had to have a tour guide, or a literary tour guide \n     such as Smith, explain these moments.\n       Many of these articles gave an insider's account of the \n     past, including both popular and little-known stories of the \n     Capitol's history, for it was not through the casual \n     pilgrimage that a person could notice these spots and \n     instinctively know what happened in the past. Gilbert \n     Grosvenor also included some stories of moments past in ``The \n     Wonder Building of the World.'' He wrote of Statuary Hall, \n     the former chamber of the House of Representatives: ``Here \n     Lincoln, John Quincy Adams, Horace Greeley and Andrew Johnson \n     served in the same Congress. Here Henry\n\n[[Page S13314]]\n\n     Clay welcomed Lafayette, who replied in a speech said to have \n     been written by Clay. Here John Marshall administered the \n     oath of office to Madison and Monroe.'' The preservation of \n     the country's history through memories such as those Smith, \n     Grosvenor, and Fenner described was an essential element to \n     the appreciation of the shrine.\n       In addition to holding stories, the national shrine \n     preserved key moments in American history through art. For \n     the artistic ``pilgrim,'' the halls of the Capitol were \n     filled with visual history. Visitors could peruse the art \n     within the Capitol and learn something about the past \n     entirely on their own. Fenner mentioned her own preference \n     for some of the works: ``Among the better oil paintings are \n     those of Stuart, Peale, and Trumbull.'' Congress had \n     commissioned Trumbull's paintings in the early nineteenth \n     century to commemorate scenes of the American Revolution. \n     Throughout the Capitol, frescoes offered allegories of great \n     leaders or of basic principles of the republic. Works of art \n     hung on walls in offices and hallways, all portraying \n     different moments in America's past. However, the paintings \n     that hung in the Rotunda were not of particular interest to \n     authors, perhaps because any visitor to the Capitol could \n     observe them. More important to these literary pilgrimages \n     were little known stories and facts about the national \n     ``shrine.''\n       Both preserving a memory of the past and praising great \n     leaders through sculpture, Statuary Hall was the center \n     of much debate on the early twentieth century, and a \n     common destination for the ``pilgrim'' especially \n     interested in the arts. Dedicated by the House and Senate \n     to be a place where each State could send sculptures of \n     two people of accomplishment, the Hall became a source of \n     many extreme opinions. While some people enjoyed the \n     sculptures and admired the idea of placing leaders from \n     each State within the Capitol, many others described it as \n     a `` chamber of horrors,'' due to the poor quality of the \n     sculptures and the bad arrangement of figures. Gilbert \n     Grosvenor was of the former opinion, and gave a positive \n     view of Statuary Hall. ``An unwarranted phrase,'' he \n     wrote, ``has made it popular to call Statuary Hall a \n     chamber of artistic horrors. Such designation does \n     injustice to the art and the history of the room where the \n     House of Representatives met for 40 years and which now \n     exemplifies a really fine memorial idea. Setting clear his \n     feelings about the hall in the beginning, he continued on \n     to explain how it came to be. A law was passed in 1864 to \n     create Statuary Hall, which he said was so that: ``the \n     States could use it as a place to do national honor to the \n     memory of their sons and daughters renowned for civil and \n     military service, each State being entitled to place two \n     statues here.'' At the time that most of these articles \n     were being written, there was but one woman among the \n     collection of statues, Frances E. Willard. Statuary Hall \n     attracted many visitors who came to gaze at the statues as \n     well as to experience the ``whispering'' phenomenon of the \n     elliptical room; a person standing at one focus of the \n     room could hear a person whispering at the other.\n       Many authors, artists, and other citizens did not view \n     Statuary Hall in so pleasing a light as Gorsvenor. Lambert \n     St. Clair wrote an article for Collier's, ``The Nation's \n     Mirth-Provoking Pantheon,'' in which he described the Hall in \n     detail, attacking it artistically. Not only were the \n     sculptures themselves terrible, but their placement around \n     the room also left much desired: ``The arrangement obviously \n     is bad. Forty-one statues are crowded into a space which \n     might accommodate ten artistically . . . Guides expect to \n     grow wealthy rescuing lost tourists when the entire ninety-\n     six are placed.'' He did not merely dislike the positioning \n     of the statues, but also the statues themselves. He explained \n     that they had no artistic continuity, as a wide variety of \n     artists had completed them, and that State Legislatures had \n     often favored cheaper statues over ones that were more \n     aesthetically pleasing:\n       ``Zachariah Chandler, the latest addition to the hall, \n     wears neatly creased trousers and a new white topcoat with \n     fashionable roll lapels. Lewis Cass, who stands beside him, \n     is clothed in a suit so badly wrinkled that one look will \n     make a tailor's hands twitch. General Lew Wallace's right \n     coat sleeve is laid open halfway to his elbow and rolled back \n     while his left sleeve is drawn tightly about the wrist. \n     Daniel Webster's coat is woefully in need of pressing. The \n     dress worn by Miss Frances E. Willard, the only woman in the \n     group, appears to have been slept in.''\n       St. Clair maintained that he was not alone in his opinion, \n     and related the story of a ``merry war'' that was ensuing at \n     the time. The conflict arose between the lieutenant governor \n     of Kansas, Sheffield Ingalls, and an artist who had completed \n     one of the statues. St. Clair explained that Ingalls was \n     attempting to have the statue of his late father, Senator \n     John J. Ingalls, removed from Statuary Hall. Ingalls' \n     motivations reflected his worry about the sensation \n     surrounding the room: ``Reverence for his parent made such \n     action imperative, the son said, inasmuch as the entire \n     collection of statues had, due to their poor arrangement and, \n     in many cases, inartistic execution, become ridiculous and \n     mirth-provoking curiosities to tourists.'' Ingalls' concern \n     that his father would become the source of ridicule and \n     mocking shows the impact that the phrase ``chamber of \n     artistic horrors'' had on how Americans thought about \n     Statuary Hall. Though it originally was intended to honor \n     great leaders, the artistic failings made it a controversial \n     room.\n       Former leaders were also honored in the ``national shrine'' \n     through the tradition of laying-in-state. On these occasions, \n     the Rotunda was turned almost into a funeral home or church \n     as Americans came to pay last respects to the deceased. Many \n     presidents have lain in the center of the Rotunda, mostly \n     those who died in office. The ceremony had a strong impact on \n     the participants, as Catherine Cavanagh described in an \n     article for Bookman:\n       ``The solemn Rotunda of the Capitol has been made almost \n     unbearably solemn by funeral services which have been held \n     there--notably those of the three presidents who died by the \n     hands of assassins--Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley. And one \n     who has looked upon the silent form of one of our rulers \n     lying under the lofty canopy of the dome can never forget the \n     awe of the occasion. The long black line in front, and the \n     long black line behind, in the procession of reviewers are \n     forgotten--one seemed alone with the august dead in the vast \n     grandeur of the chamber typifying the core of the Nation.''\n       To Cavanagh, visiting a leader lying in state not only was \n     a solemn occasion, but also was an opportunity to have \n     solitary time within what she sees as the Nation's figurative \n     heart. As one waited in line to visit the coffin, it was an \n     occasion to ponder all of those who have passed. Authors \n     strongly associated the Rotunda with these services: to the \n     National Education Association Journal, mentioning the \n     tradition of laying in state was a natural part of a \n     description of the rotunda. A general explanation of the size \n     and shape of the Rotunda was accompanied by a reminder of \n     several services that had taken place within the room: ``Here \n     Lincoln's body lay in state; here multitudes passed before \n     the flower-laden catafalque of the unknown soldier prior \n     to interment at Arlington.'' The ritual of paying respects \n     to the unknown soldier began after World War I, and has \n     continued to be a part of the post-war tradition for all \n     major conflicts. By placing the coffin of the Unknown \n     Soldier in the Rotunda before it is interred at Arlington \n     Cemetery, the country has been able to symbolically mourn \n     for all those who died in war. At the same time, this \n     tradition makes the statement that deceased presidents as \n     well as those who die fighting for the United States \n     deserve the same respect and honors.\n       The national shrine did not only praise those leaders and \n     notables of the past. As a way of honoring the nation and \n     democracy, some revered the leaders who worked within the \n     Capitol at the time. Grosvenor concluded his long article on \n     the Capitol by saying that the present deserved as much \n     attention and commendation as the past. He included members \n     of the House, Senate, and Supreme Court in his praise. He \n     began by stating a common practice of people to overlook the \n     present: ``Amid the glamour of history, some are prone to \n     discount the achievement of the present and the abilities of \n     those to whom have been entrusted the duties of lawmaking and \n     law-administering. But the student of the past knows that the \n     wail of the `decadence of the times' is one which has gone \n     forth in every age.'' Grosvenor concluded his article by \n     reminding the reader that those current leaders could some \n     day be given great honor: ``The men of to-day who are making \n     the history of America will, in turn, have their meed [sic] \n     of recognition, and in some future time their effigies in \n     bronze and marble will be placed in Statuary Hall as comrades \n     in glory with the Founders and Preservers of the Republic.'' \n     In some ways, Americans paid tribute to the actions of \n     their leaders every day by listening to debates on the \n     floor of the House and Senate and by visiting their \n     delegations' offices.\n       However, not all who came to the ``national shrine'' found \n     people, or actions, worth praising. In one book, Historic \n     Buildings of America, ``famous authors'' took a critical look \n     at American institutions and traditions that were generally \n     accepted and praised. A chapter by Charles Dickens, ``Within \n     the Capitol,'' attacked the motivations of all politicians \n     within the chambers. Though Dickens' excerpt was likely \n     written during the early 19th century, its inclusion in this \n     early 20th century book suggests its message resounded with \n     readers years later. Dickens wrote:\n       ``I saw in them the wheels that move the meanest perversion \n     of virtuous Political Machinery that the worst tools ever \n     wrought. Despicable trickery at elections; underhanded \n     tamperings with public officers; cowardly attacks upon \n     opponents, with scurrilous newspapers for shields, and hired \n     pens for daggers; shameful trucklings to mercenary knaves \n     whose claim to be considered, is, that every day and week \n     they sow new crops of ruin with their venal types, which are \n     the dragon's teeth of yore, in everything but sharpness; \n     aidings and abettings of every bad inclination in the popular \n     mind, and artful suppressions of all its good influences: \n     such things as these, and in a word, Dishonest Faction in its \n     most depraved and most unblushing form, stare out from every \n     corner of the crowded hall.''\n       Dickens would have been one of the critics who Grosvenor \n     attacked in the conclusion to this article. Writing an \n     impassioned account of the characters of leaders within the \n     building, Dickens was far from praising those who made or \n     enforced the laws. Though Dickens was not praising the \n     actions of those politicians within the shrine, he was \n     exercising the right of free speech, a basic principle on\n\n[[Page S13315]]\n\n     which the democracy was founded. As a British citizen, he \n     brought a slightly different perspective to his view of the \n     Congress, but his attack reflects the basic right to offer \n     criticism. Therefore, though he did not admire the actions of \n     these particular leaders, he was valuing an ideal that the \n     ``national shrine'' was intended to represent.\n       Just as Dickens criticized the government openly and \n     thereby enjoyed one of the privileges of democracy, so have \n     millions of Americans come to the Capitol in order to express \n     their grievances. Their roads led to Washington for a \n     different purpose: for a pilgrimage of protest. These \n     protests could easily be the subject of an entire paper, and \n     so I will just take a look at one of the protests as an \n     example of the many that have occurred. In an article for New \n     Republic in 1931, John Dos Passos described a ``hunger \n     march'' that took place at the Capitol. The situation was \n     tense as a group of men proceeded up Constitution Avenue to \n     the expanse between the Capitol and the Library of Congress. \n     Dos Passos gave a picture of the scene to the reader:\n       ``The marchers fill the broad semicircle in front of the \n     Capitol, each group taking up its position in perfect order, \n     as if the show had been rehearsed . . . Above the heads of \n     the marchers are banners with slogans printed out: `in the \n     last war we fought for the bosses: in the next war we'll \n     fight for the workers . . . $150 cash . . . full pay for \n     unemployed insurance.''\n       These men had come to the Capitol to seek government aid \n     during the Great Depression, and though the banners may have \n     changed for each different group that came to protest, the \n     general process of a protest pilgrimage was familiar. This \n     group had come to Washington, like many, to raise awareness \n     about their plight and to get the attention of lawmakers \n     within the Capitol. In his article, Dos Passos took a highly \n     cynical tone, describing the dome of the Capitol that \n     ``bulges smugly'' and the Senate Chamber as a ``termite nest \n     under glass.'' He also suggested that the Capitol building \n     itself played an active role in the protest, for as the men \n     shouted their demands, Dos Passos claimed that ``a deep-\n     throated echo comes back from the Capitol facade a few beats \n     later than each shout. It's as if the status and the \n     classical-revival republican ornaments in the pediment were \n     shouting too.'' For Dos Passos, the Capitol took on a human \n     quality, with the status seeming to participate in the march \n     as well. The pilgrimage of protest such as this ``hunger \n     march'' was but another way that the ideals embodied in the \n     Capitol, the ``national shrine,'' could be expressed.\n       Underlying many of the articles that discussed the Capitol \n     as a pilgrim's destination was the idea that the building \n     belonged to the American public. These articles attempted to \n     relate a more human side to the Capitol, one that could \n     describe the formal white building as a familiar place. The \n     American public should think of the building as theirs. \n     Beverly Smith suggested throughout her article that though \n     the Capitol was a shrine, it should also be thought of as \n     accessible, even as ``a friend.'' She quoted a fellow \n     journalist: `` `I am not one of those who can sneer at the \n     Capitol,' wrote Mary Clemmer Ames, a lady correspondent in \n     Washington 70 years ago. `Its faults, like the faults of a \n     friend, are sacred.' '' Her entire article contrasted the \n     Capitol as shrine with the Capitol as a hangout, which \n     created a picture of the building as a national space that \n     should be a comfortable place for pilgrims. She declared that \n     the building was a friendlier place than its image suggested, \n     an idea that appeared in other representations of Washington \n     from the time. Similarly, in an article entitled ``Nerve \n     Center of the World,'' Albert Parry wrote that Washington \n     could still be thought of as a small town, even though its \n     importance was growing on the national and international \n     scene, ``If anything,'' he wrote, ``Washington is a \n     charming Southern town which has grown large and \n     cosmopolitan without losing its drawl.'' In these and \n     other articles on the Capitol and Washington, journalists \n     were demystifying the formal ideal of the Capitol, making \n     it a more accessible place.\n       Smith in particular wanted Americans to see ways in which \n     the Capitol belonged to them. In one story she related a \n     physical way in which everyday Americans left their mark on \n     the building:\n\n     By day in the sunshine or at night under its floodlights, the \n     great dome looms white and pure. But, if you climb the long \n     spiral stairs to the little galleries around the dome, you \n     see that every inch of the surface within human reach is \n     covered with writing, in pencil, ink, crayon and lipstick--\n     all the small familiar chirography of the American people: \n     Jimmy loves Marge . . . Kilroy was here . . . Mr. and Mrs. G. \n     Wallace Shiffbaur, of Minesota . . . Hubba, hubba. Hearts and \n     arrows. Periodically the writing is painted out, but a new \n     swarm of tourists and honeymooners covers it up again, quick \n     as magic. ``What can you do?'' says a guard. ``It's their \n     Capitol, ain't it?'\n       Though the dome appeared to be completely ``white and \n     pure,'' she informed her readers that upon closer look, it \n     was filled with graffiti, the kind that normally covered \n     bathrooms and college hangouts. It was quite an image that \n     she presented; as a whole, the Capitol seemed formal, pure, \n     and stately, and yet on close inspection, it was partially \n     made up of the marks of everyday Americans. The guard who \n     watched people daily write upon the dome merely shrugged his \n     shoulders at the practice. he saw no problem with the \n     signatures, as he believed the building upon which they were \n     writing was their property as citizens of the country.\n       The Capitol as a destination and a place for pilgrimage \n     drew countless number of Americans to its step. The roads and \n     paths of many different types of pilgrims led to Washington \n     and to the United States Capitol. Pilgrims to the Capitol \n     were sometimes eager, sometimes critical. They came to see \n     their leaders in action, to wander the halls, to view the \n     places where certain events occurred, and to participate in \n     the democratic process. They encountered or red about a space \n     that could become as familiar to them as an ``old comfortable \n     home.'' By appealing to different interest, these journalists \n     made the building understandable and intriguing to all types \n     of readers and visitors. The Woman's Home Companion offered \n     advice on how to organize a trip to Washington and the best \n     times to visit the Capitol; the Saturday Evening Post wrote \n     stores full of human interest, including both formal \n     descriptions and little-known facts. Besides the stories of \n     contemporary life, articles focused on the Capitol's \n     interior: paintings and sculptures that celebrated great \n     moments in the history of the United States and great leaders \n     past. Mentor published articles specific to its readers, \n     focusing on the art within the Capitol. Through these \n     articles, authors reached out to readers to make the Capitol \n     more accessible to all. The civic space, the ``shrine,'' \n     offered visitors and readers alike a glimpse of the past, the \n     present, and the future. Authors invited readers to consider \n     the building as belonging to all Americans, and not as an \n     untouchable place. While Americans no longer participate in \n     the ritual of signing their name on the dome, they still come \n     to experience the Capitol as countless have done before them. \n     The Capitol remains a central destination for all who find \n     themselves on a road that leads to Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13315-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13315-S13316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            IN THANKSGIVING\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the City of New Orleans and countless \nother communities along the U.S. gulf coast continue to clean up from \nthe twin disasters that were Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as Florida \nreels from yet another major hurricane there, as U.S. casualties in the \nIraq and Afghanistan conflicts soar above 2,000, and as scandal engulfs \nthe White House itself, it might seem difficult to find anything to be \nthankful for on this Thanksgiving.\n  For many families in the United States this holiday season, the \ntables, if tables they can find to set, will be set with fewer plates \nthan usual, and the fare might be somewhat skimpier than in years past. \nTheir homes are in ruins, their jobs lost, their friends and family \nmembers scattered, and their prospects for rebuilding the lives they \nonce knew are uncertain. It can be difficult to take the long view in \nthe face of such circumstances, or to reflect on history with any \nequanimity, even though history is replete with examples of recoveries \nfrom terrible disasters. One has only to think of Hurricane Camille, or \nthe Great Depression, or World War II, or the San Francisco earthquake, \nthe great Chicago fire, to find evidence that out of the ashes of war \nand devastation can come the rebirth of cities, communities, and \neconomies. There is hope.\n  There is also much worth celebrating as families sit down to their \nThanksgiving tables. We may be grateful that the loss of life to the \nhurricanes was not greater. We can all celebrate the tremendous \noutpouring of support that spontaneously erupted from the hearts, \nhands, and wallets of Americans outside the gulf coast disaster zone \nand from friends around the world who were glad to come in their turn \nto our assistance as the United States has in the past come to theirs. \nCommunities all along the periphery opened their doors to welcome \nrefugees from the storms, and volunteers flooded into the area in such \nforce that relief organizations were overwhelmed. The public response \nto the gulf coast disasters was truly inspiring and heartwarming. It \nproved that a core value of this Nation, its sense of community, \nremains strong and vital.\n  We can also celebrate the ability of our Nation's first responders to \nlearn from their mistakes. While the planning and response to Hurricane \nKatrina was in most people's estimates pretty abysmal, the preparation \nfor and response to Hurricane Rita was a little better. And, \nunfortunately for the people of Florida, they have gotten a lot of \npractice in the last couple of years, and their preparations for and \nresponse to hurricanes is well rehearsed. There is much we can learn \nfrom these terrible\n\n[[Page S13316]]\n\nevents, and hope that we take those lessons to heart.\n  The brightest spot in the war in Iraq is the performance of our \ntroops. Day after dangerous day, they do their duty. They patrol, they \nseek out insurgents, they struggle to provide a secure environment for \nthe rebuilding of that nation. Day after day, they face down their own \nfears and travel those lethal roads to take the battle to the enemy. \nHowever one may feel about the path that led us to Iraq, we can feel \nnothing but love, pride, and respect for our men and women in uniform. \nWhatever the circumstances under which we sent them there, through \nmisread intelligence or misleading rhetoric, the U.S. military has \ngone, and gone again and again, and performed their duties with courage \nand dedication.\n  Even the scandal that now haunts the White House, and which is \nbeginning to wash over the President's closest advisors, may give us \ncause for celebration, and not for any partisan reasons. As Americans, \nwe may be thankful for living in a nation in which no man is king, to \nrule at his own whim and to undermine his detractors at will and \nwithout consequence. We may be thankful for our system of government, \nwith its checks and balances between the three branches of government \nfirmly established in our Constitution. And we may celebrate the wisdom \nof guaranteeing freedom of expression and the existence of a free \npress.\n  Though the wheels of government may sometimes grind exceedingly \nslowly, we can be grateful that they still can be pushed and cajoled \ninto conducting their oversight functions and asserting those checks \nand balances. That is what keeps this country strong. President Abraham \nLincoln said ``Let the people know the truth and the country is safe.'' \nWhatever may be the final outcome of the investigation into possible \nretribution by the White House against Ambassador Wilson and his wife \nfor Wilson's role in unmasking a fraud in the government's case for \ngoing to war in Iraq, the Nation is safer and better off for having the \nmeans for citizens, acting through their elected officials and their \nlegal system, to challenge possible abuses of power.\n  So even in these dark days, there is cause for thanksgiving. I hope \nthat the recent dip in gasoline prices will allow families to come \ntogether, pull out the good china and set a beautiful table overflowing \nwith all the dishes that make this feast so memorable and so \nmouthwatering: turkey, roasted, grilled, smoked, barbequed or deep \nfried; stuffing in all its regional variations with herbs or oysters or \nsausage or cornbread; hams coated in pineapples and cloves or cured \nwith smoke or sugar; cranberries served jellied or chopped, with \noranges or not; green bean casserole with a crown of fried onions; \nyeast rolls or biscuits dripping with butter or gravy; sweet potatoes \nin casseroles or with marshmallows and brown sugar; and pies--glorious \npies with spicy pumpkin topped with whipped cream, and fruit pies in \nflaky shells, topped with cheese or ice cream. Americans know how to \ncook, and all the variations on our traditional Thanksgiving meal \nsurely mean that this feast will never settle into routine.\n  Thanksgiving. Can there be a better day? It starts with parades to \nwatch for the youngsters. Then the action in the kitchen heats up, \ncompeting with football games and the happy arrival of guests for our \nattention with a whole array of enticing aromas and clattering noises. \nThe meal itself is wonderful, with family and friends around the table \ngiving thanks and meaning it. And after the meal, in the warm glow of a \nfull stomach, there is time for companionship as the leftovers are put \naway and the dishes are washed. The evenings are primed for walks in \nthe cool weather, or short naps, or other sports, before the leftovers \nmake their first reappearance. There are few days like this, devoted \nentirely to family without the distraction of, say presents at \nChristmas or Easter egg hunts. Thanksgiving is the one time we can \nreally focus on all that we have to be thankful for just by looking \naround that table. My wife Erma and I have so much to be thankful for, \nand I know that she joins me in wishing a very happy thanksgiving to \nall Americans. May each of you, no matter how desperate your present \ncircumstances may be, be blessed and see all that you have to be \nthankful for.\n  Mr. President, I wish you a happy Thanksgiving. I would like to close \nwith a poem by Charles Frederick White, written in November 1895. His \nwords serve to remind us that Thanksgivings past were not very \ndifferent than today.\n\n                        Thoughts of Thanksgiving\n\n     Thanksgiving Day is coming soon,\n     That long remembered day\n     When nature gives her blessed boon\n     To all America.\n\n     On that glad day, in all our land,\n     The people, in their wake,\n     Give thanks to God, whose mighty hand\n     Deals blessings good and great.\n\n     The roast goose, steaming on the plate,\n     The sweet potato cobbler,\n     The cranberry sauce, the pudding baked,\n     The seasoned turkey gobbler,\n\n     All these delights and many more,\n     From north, south, west and east,\n     Do all the nation keep in store\n     For this Thanksgiving feast.\n\n     Alas, for those who are denied\n     This blessed boon of God!\n     May all the needy be supplied\n     Like Israel by the rod.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to \none of the most effective and outstanding Members of the Senate, \nSenator Susan Collins of Maine. Today, Senator Collins cast her 2,942nd \nconsecutive vote as a Senator, breaking the record of the former \nSenator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith. In doing this, Senator \nCollins has maintained a perfect voting record since she was sworn in \nto the Senate in January 1997.\n  Senator Collins recently honored Margaret Chase Smith just a few \nweeks ago during a ceremony to unveil an official portrait of Senator \nSmith, a portrait entitled ``The Great Lady From Maine'' which now \nhangs proudly in the U.S. Capitol. As Senator Collins said in a tribute \nto Senator Smith at that unveiling:\n\n       For every woman serving in the Senate, Margaret Chase Smith \n     blazed the path, but she was a special inspiration to me.\n\n  Senator Collins met Margaret Chase Smith as a senior in high school, \nparticipating in a Senate youth conference here in Washington. She \nremembers Senator Smith telling her to ``stand tall for what I \nbelieved.'' Senator Collins continues to use this advice today as she \nchairs the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and \nworking for the people of Maine.\n  I know I speak for all of my colleagues in the Senate when I \ncongratulate her on this truly remarkable accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13316-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13316-S13317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, freedom continues to advance in \nAfghanistan. Of course, they are a great ally in the war on terror. In \nfact, I recall visiting Afghanistan just a little over 2 years ago with \nthe current occupant of the Chair, and we had an opportunity to see \nfirsthand the progress they had made at that time, not to mention how \nfar they have come since.\n  A few days ago the results of that country's historic parliamentary \nelections, held in mid-September, were officially certified. At the \ntime that Senator Burns and I were there, they had not yet had the \nelection of the President, not officially. They have since had that \nelection. Now they have had a parliamentary election. Those results are \nnow certified. A joint Afghan and United Nations election commission \nhas declared the winners in races for 249 seats in the lower \nparliamentary house, as well as members of 34 provincial councils \naround the country.\n  Afghanistan's continued progress toward democracy is obviously a \nvictory in the war on terror. Four years ago, the ruthless Taliban \nregime ruled Afghanistan with an unyielding, murderous intolerance, and \nthey laid down that country's welcome mat to all the terrorists to \n``come on in.'' I would like to remind my colleagues that 4 short years \nago Afghanistan was ruled by a regime so intolerant that as part of an \neffort to erase any trace of Afghanistan's history before the rise of \nIslam in the seventh century, the Taliban destroyed two priceless \nBuddhist statues. These statues had been carved into the\n\n[[Page S13317]]\n\nface of a cliff outside the Afghan city of Bamiyan. These ancient \nwonders that had endured for centuries were instantly turned into dust. \nThe Taliban was literally trying to erase history. But now the Taliban \nitself is history.\n  America's quick defeat of the Taliban, the rescue of the Afghan \npeople out from under their wicked thumb and the quick transformation \nof Afghanistan into a burgeoning democracy in just 4 years is nothing \nshort of amazing.\n  Today, a democratically elected parliament and a democratically \nelected, President Hamid Karzai, are charting a new course for their \ncountry. I am proud to say that a new day has dawned in Afghanistan. \nWhere there was repression, now there is liberty.\n  For instance, reports indicate that 68 of the new legislators are \nwomen. Four years ago little girls weren't allowed to go to school, and \nwomen had no rights whatsoever. Four years ago women were second-class \ncitizens, blocked from jobs and educational opportunities by the \nTaliban. These 68 women legislators make up over a quarter of their \nchamber. That is significantly higher than the proportion of women in \nour Congress in the United States.\n  Afghanistan will continue to make progress toward freedom and \ndemocracy. The provincial councils are now in the process of selecting \n68 members of the House of Elders, which is the upper parliamentary \nhouse. Those selections will be completed soon. Then with President \nKarzai's selection of an additional 34 members to the upper house, the \nfull Afghan Parliament is scheduled to convene for the first time in \nthe third week of December.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the people of Afghanistan \nas they move forward toward freedom and democracy. I ask all of us to \njoin in pledging the full support of the United States as the people of \nAfghanistan continue to fight the last vestiges of an extreme terrorist \nelement, and as they continue to stand with the grand coalition of free \nnations who are waging the war on terror.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13317-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13317-S13326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORTATION, TREASURY, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, THE JUDICIARY, \nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        2006--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to 1 hour of debate in relation to the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 3058, the Transportation-Treasury-HUD bill; provided \nfurther that Senator Coburn be in control of up to 30 minutes of \ndebate; I further ask consent that the two managers have up to 15 \nminutes each and that following the use or yielding back of the time, \nand when the Senate has received the conference report, it then be \nagreed to, with the motion to reconsider laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of today, November 18, 2005.)\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank all or our colleagues. This has been \na long and interesting path that we have trod.\n  Today I stand in support of the Transportation, Treasury, HUD, \nJudiciary, and Independent Agencies fiscal year 2006 appropriations \nbill. This bill also includes the District of Columbia fiscal year 2006 \nappropriations act. Before getting into the details of the bill, I \nthank Chairman Knollenberg and his ranking member, Mr. Olver, on the \nHouse side. Particularly, I express my sincere appreciation to my \nranking member, Senator Murray, for her hard work, thoughtful and \nbipartisan approach to crafting a good bill, and her unwavering \ncommitment to getting the bill done on an expedited schedule as \nmandated by the leadership. As all who follow this place know, we have \nhad some bumps on the road over the last several days which forced both \nHouse and Senate staff to work throughout a number of nights this week \nwhile completing a blitzkrieg schedule in order for us to be able to \nvote on this measure today. Despite these bumps, we have completed our \nwork, and I compliment Congressman Knollenberg on his commitment and \nperseverance to work with me to overcome these problems.\n\n  I do express my sincerest gratitude and thanks to our excellent \nstaffs; on the Senate side, on the subcommittee, on my side, Jon \nKamarck, Paul Doerrer, Cheh Kim, Lula Edwards, Josh Manley, and Matt \nMcCardle; on Senator Murray's side, Peter Rogoff, Kate Hallahan, \nWilliam Simpson, Diana Hamilton, and Meaghan McCarthy.\n  Obviously, we extend our thanks as well to the House side staffers.\n  Now, Mr. President, the staff had to work extremely hard, in a \nbipartisan manner, to make our recommendations and instructions a \nreality. This is not a simple bill. Yet it is likely a Rube Goldberg \nmachine with many complex moving parts.\n  This bill is the first real appropriations product of a new \nsubcommittee that grew out of the reorganization of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee earlier this year. It is a substantial and \ncomplex bill that will have a significant and positive impact on every \nState and community in the Nation as it covers, among other things, \nevery mode of transportation, financial services, and IRS requirements \nas guided by the Department of Treasury; it funds the Federal \nGovernment's role in housing and economic role under HUD; it funds the \nExecutive Office of the President, Federal judicial system, and funds \nother related agencies such as the General Services Administration, \nOffice of Personnel Management, and the Postal Service.\n  I believe that given the circumstances and our budget allocation, \nthis is a good bill. We started with a budget that was severely \nunderfunded in many of the important programs in the bill. These are \nprograms which historically have been strongly supported by Members of \nthis body. Thankfully, in most cases we have been able to restore many \nof the cuts and shortfalls, perhaps not as much as some Members would \nwant and certainly some areas not as much as I want. But I think all \nMembers will understand and appreciate our efforts to fund the programs \nand activities that enjoy the greatest support.\n  I wish to express a very special thanks to our chairman, Senator \nCochran, who demonstrated his understanding and sensitivity to the \nneeds of the Transportation-Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  While we received significantly less budget authority for the \nconference, without Chairman Cochran's help the House would have \ndemanded a much harsher and unrealistic reduction in our allocation, \nwith the results we saw that happened in regard to the Labor-HHS fiscal \nyear 2006 funding bill yesterday in the House.\n  In particular, despite our fiscal limitations, we have worked \ndiligently to ensure the transportation programs in this bill are \nadequately funded. One of my highest priorities in fashioning this bill \nwas to provide the needed funding for the safety, construction, and \nmaintenance of our highways, transit systems, and airports. Funding for \nour Nation's transportation infrastructure, and especially for our \nhighways and road network, creates jobs and promotes economic growth. \nMore importantly, it continues the continued maintenance and growth of \nour economic infrastructure by which we serve markets throughout the \nNation and ultimately the world. The transportation system is the heart \nand arteries by which we pump our goods and products which guarantee \nour current and future prosperity in the national and international \nmarketplace, and we cannot afford to shortchange this system.\n  We also removed the designation on the Alaskan bridges. The funds \nremain with Alaska to meet their priority needs. These bridges were \ngrabbing unreasonable and unwarranted attention which was beginning, in \nmany ways, to undermine the very good work and the very necessary \nprojects in this highway bill.\n  In addition, this bill provides $14.4 billion for the Federal \nAviation Administration, which is approximately $400 million more than \nthe request. This recommendation includes $14.3 million to hire safety \ninspectors and restore inspector staffing levels on an accelerated \nbasis. It also adds $4 million to restore engineering and inspector \nstaffing at the Office of Certification so that new equipment and \ntechnologies\n\n[[Page S13318]]\n\ncan be approved for use in aviation and our Nation can retain its \nleadership in aviation. I am pleased also to announce that the bill \ndoes not cut the Airport Improvement Program, as proposed in the budget \nrequest.\n  I am also happy to report we have been able to fund Amtrak at $1.315 \nbillion, while making some incremental steps to reforming how Amtrak \nconducts its business. These reforms are critical, and it is my hope \nthat these improvements will move to jump-start the efforts of Senator \nLott, Senator Stevens, and others to pass a truly comprehensive reform \npackage.\n  Mr. President, I was troubled by the administration's demand of \nAmtrak reform with a budget request of $360 million. A $360 million-a-\nyear appropriation would likely jolt Amtrak directly into bankruptcy, a \ncostly financial and emotional blow to the Nation and send Amtrak into \nchaos. Many Members, including the occupant of the chair, our \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, and Members throughout the \nSenate asked us to take strong action to avoid that problem. \nThankfully, we were able to scrape enough funds together to ensure the \ncontinued existence of Amtrak, although it meant a number of other \nprograms were underfunded, and when we received finally the recommended \nreforms at Amtrak from the administration, we were able to include \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I also should touch on another issue in the conference \nreport, and that is the ongoing efforts to improve protection consumers \nhave from being preyed upon by rogue household movers. I think we all \nknow they are a small group of fly-by-night companies that purport to \npack and transport family household possessions and then stealing them \nand holding them hostage for exorbitant fees or make unreasonable \ndemands. This could be a devastating blow.\n  In this past year's highway bill, additional requirements on movers \nwere included, along with new provisions granting State officials, \nparticularly attorneys general, new authority to help police the \nFederal law. Part of the problem has been the lack of the Federal \nenforcement. The Federal agency, the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration, has not had sufficient resources, and the U.S. \nattorneys, with the notable exceptions of the Miami and New York-New \nJersey agencies, have also not made these crimes a priority; thus, the \nideas of expanding cops on the beat by giving authority to State \nagencies and, thus, my work to make sure that while we expanded \nresponsibilities, we did so in a reasonable and consistent way.\n\n  First, we provided additional resources to the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration to help them do their job better. We restored $1 \nmillion to the Education and Outreach Program in order to help them \ntrain State officials as to how to look and find the risky carriers. We \nalso reiterated our support for the strong State-Federal partnership \nwhich had been included in the highway bill to ensure effective \nFederal-State cooperation.\n  Where we and some of our colleagues part company is on the scope and \nthe venue. I strongly believe that Federal law should be enforced in \nFederal court, and thus the key provisions in the conference report \nwill ensure that that will occur. There will be Federal enforcement on \nthe major interstate activities. State law violations will continue to \nbe enforced in State court. Federal law violations will continue to be \nenforced in Federal court.\n  In order to ensure that the States target those typical rogue movers \nwho seem to be too small for U.S. attorneys and thus are slipping \nthrough the cracks, the language makes clear that the responsibilities \nof the State agencies are focused on what carriers they have \njurisdiction over. Namely, these are the highest risk, fly-by-night \ncarriers or carriers who meet one or more of the following: The carrier \nis unregistered; or the license of the carrier or broker has been \nrevoked for safety or lack of insurance; three, the carrier is unrated \nor received a conditional or unsatisfactory safety rating by DOT; or \nthe carrier has been licensed for less than 5 years.\n  This then accomplishes all the goals we have been discussing--tougher \nFederal law, additional consumer protections, State attorneys general \nand other State agencies have been granted the authority to be a cop on \nthe beat to help enforce the Federal law. Their targets are the fly-by-\nnight rogues and their venue is the Federal court and they are being \nasked to help enforce Federal law.\n  Now, Mr. President, moving on to some of the other areas in the bill, \nfor the Department of the Treasury, this bill provides $11.7 billion \nfor 2006. This amount is about $50 million above the budget request and \nsome $475 million above the fiscal year 2005 enacted level. We think it \nis very important to provide resources for Treasury's efforts to fight \nthe war on terrorism, and we provided full funding for the Treasury's \nOffice of Terrorism and Financial intelligence. I know how important \nthe Treasury's Antiterrorism efforts are, and I strongly believe they \nplay a vital and unique role in cutting off financial assistance to \nterrorist organizations.\n  Next, to help close the so-called tax gap, where those people who pay \ntaxes as they should voluntarily have to carry a heavy burden for the \nsmall percentage who do not, we have provided $10.7 billion for the \nIRS, including $6.9 billion for tax enforcement. This amount is $443 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2005 enacted level. These additional \nfunds will help ensure there will be less fraud and that honest \ntaxpayers will have a greater level of confidence in our tax system.\n  We also have provided full funding for IRS's modernization efforts \nthrough their Business Systems Modernization Program. This program is \ncorrectly IRS's highest management and administrative priority.\n  For the Federal judiciary, the bill includes a total appropriation of \n$5.7 billion, a 6-percent increase over the previous year, and this \nrepresents the funding necessary to meet the judiciary fiscal year 2006 \nfunding needs.\n  For HUD, the bill provides some $38.2 billion for fiscal year 2006, \nan increase of $2.1 billion over the request. These additional funds \ninclude almost $4.22 billion for the Community Development Fund and \nCDBG, which was slated for elimination through a reduction of over 30 \npercent of its funding and a consolidation of its activities along with \nother programs into a new grant program within the Department of \nCommerce.\n  The bill also increased the Senate-proposed rescission of ``excess'' \nsection 8 funds from $1.5 billion to $2.05 billion. After further \nreview of the account, we firmly believe we have identified a one-time \nsavings from section 8 that allowed us to increase the rescission to \n$2.05 billion.\n  In addition, I am happy to report we have adequately funded HUD \nprograms at a minimum of last year's level which is generally higher \nthan the request.\n  The bill basically funds the Executive Office of the President at the \nrequested level. We have fully funded the High Intensity Drug Program \nat $127 million; whereas, the budget would have funded it at 100 \nmillion in the Department of Justice. This is a critically important \nprogram that has been successful throughout the Nation at helping to \nroot out and eradicate methamphetamine production, marijuana, and \necstasy use, as well as heroin and cocaine importation. This program \nhas been especially important in Missouri, where methamphetamine \nproduction and use have reached almost epidemic proportions.\n  Mr. President, as I prepare to close, I wish to express my sincerest \nthanks to the ranking member of the full committee who has been a great \nfriend and mentor of mine and who has helped Senator Murray and me as \nwe have worked through this by gaining the necessary funds.\n  I also thank--I feel his presence immediately behind me--the chairman \nemeritus of the Appropriations Committee whose birthday we celebrate, \nwith very best wishes and, fortunately, no songs on the Senate floor. \nHe has been of great assistance to us.\n  I must say, one of my last thank yous is to my chief of staff, Julie \nDammann, who has served me since I arrived in this body. I was going to \nsay in 1897 but it was 1987. She has been with me for these years and \nhas become very well known and respected. This will be her last bill \nand, as on all the other bills, not only was the appropriations staff \nworking day and night, but we were communicating by BlackBerry in the \nmiddle of the night. She\n\n[[Page S13319]]\n\nwas working on the details with the appropriations staff and others. \nShe was communicating with Senators' offices. We only came to the floor \ntoday because she had worked with other Senate offices, as Senator \nMurray and her staff had, to clear away objections which might be \nraised.\n  So it is with great thanks that I note the contributions to this, her \nlast appropriations bill, of Julie Dammann and wish her all the best.\n  I also note that my partner, the Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray, has been working extremely hard on this. She helped clear the \nway of the remaining problems. I cannot think of how she could have \nbeen more helpful or more productive in this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Bond, in supporting the conference report on the \nTransportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary \nand Independent Agencies Appropriations for fiscal year 2006.\n  This bill is the product of many hours of hard work since the Senate \npassed the bill on October 20. First, I want to express my sincere \ngratitude for the cooperative spirit that my colleague, Chairman Bond, \nalong with our House colleagues, Chairman Knollenberg and Congressman \nOlver, brought to bear during our conference negotiations.\n  I am pleased to say that the conference agreement, like the Senate-\npassed bill, restores many of the more punitive cuts that were included \nin the President's budget for transportation, housing and drug law \nenforcement.\n  We have funded airport grants at $3.55 billion rather than accept the \nPresident's proposal to cut this program by half a billion dollars.\n  While the President sought to move the Community Development Block \nGrant program to another department and cut it by more than a third, \nthis bill restores most, but not all of the annual funding for CDBG.\n  While the President's budget effectively zeroed out Amtrak and \nproposed to eliminate rail service in our country, this conference \nagreement provides Amtrak with a $100 million increase and includes \nmany of the reforms that were agreed to and included the bill reported \nby the Senate committee.\n  This is a good bill that addresses many of the urgent needs facing \nour country. It includes critical investments in our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure and provides much needed housing \nassistance to our most vulnerable.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I recently announced a major railroad \ninitiative in three different cities in my home State of South Dakota--\nSioux Falls, Huron, and Rapid City. This particular project is the \nresult of legislation I authored as part of the recently enacted \nTransportation reauthorization bill. My amendment was improved and \nincorporated in large part through work with Senator Lott, who chairs \nthe Senate Commerce Committee's Surface Transportation and Merchant \nMarine Subcommittee. I believe the changes that Senator Lott and I \nmade, both during Senate consideration as well as conference \ndeliberations, will have a major positive impact on my State's rail \ninfrastructure needs and I think significantly alleviate some of our \nNation's rail infrastructure problems.\n  Much of the language that ended up in the final Railroad \nRehabilitation Improvement Financing--or RRIF--program originated from \npast legislation that Representative Don Young introduced. Building on \nRepresentative Young's bill language, Senator Lott and I made a number \nof changes to that legislation, but it provided a very solid foundation \nupon which to build.\n  The South Dakota project itself actually involves a major national \ninitiative to build a second rail line into the capacity-strapped \nPowder River Basin, PRB, of Wyoming. The Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern \nRailroad DM, announced this project in 1997 and filed an application \nwith the Surface Transportation Board, STB, in February 1998 to obtain \nregulatory approval. That process will be concluded in the near future, \nwhich I hope will allow the DM railroad to apply for a RRIF loan to \nfinance construction of the project.\n  This project is strongly supported by virtually all of South Dakota's \nexisting rail shippers and by the agriculture and economic development \norganizations throughout the State. It is also supported by the vast \nmajority of communities served. And at the press events I participated \nin earlier this month--as noted in the Rapid City Journal article that \nI will later ask to be made part of the Record--even many of the \nlandowners directly affected by the construction support it. I have \nsupported this project since it was first announced in 1997, when I was \nserving in the House of Representatives, and have supported the project \never since in both the public and private sectors. It is incredibly \nimportant to the future of my State.\n  But on a national scale, it is also extremely important to our \ncountry's entire capacity-constrained rail system and to our national \nenergy policy in particular.\n  Our national energy policy specifically states that:\n\n     [d]emand for clean coal from Wyoming's Powder River Basin is \n     expected to increase because of its environmental benefits. \n     However, rail capacity problems in the Powder River Basin \n     have created a bottleneck in the coal transportation system . \n     . . There is a need to eliminate bottlenecks in the coal \n     transportation system.\n\n  The new RRIF legislation requires the Secretary to prioritize \nprojects that:\n\n       (8) would materially alleviate rail capacity problems which \n     degrade provision of service to shippers and fulfill a need \n     in the national rail system.\n\n  The national ``need'' criteria of the legislation was written \nspecifically with this nationally articulated energy policy ``need'' in \nmind.\n  The new RRIF legislation also requires the Secretary to prioritize \nprojects that:\n\n       (7) enhance service and capacity in the national rail \n     system.\n\n  Mr. President, as the National Energy Policy clearly notes, there is \nan overwhelming rail capacity problem in Wyoming's PRB. The Powder \nRiver Basin corridor is one of the most heavily traveled rail corridors \nin the world. Over 400 million tons of coal per year are shipped out, \nvirtually all of it by rail. That number is expected to exceed 500 \nmillion tons soon, and to grow beyond that if capacity allows. It is \ntherefore clear that, if completed, this 1,300-mile project in the West \nand Midwest would have a material impact on rail capacity in this \nregion and throughout the country.\n  We also have a critical rail capacity problem throughout the entire \nUnited States. What happens in the PRB profoundly affects capacity \nelsewhere. It also affects the movement of grain and industrial \ncommodities and general merchandise intermodal traffic. When this \nincredible flow of coal traffic increasingly merges with all this other \nrail traffic as it continues its flow eastward, it has a big impact. \nFirst and foremost, immediate and obvious traffic congestion occurs the \nfurther ``downstream'' into the traffic flow you go. The train of \nmerchandise goods making its way from the west coast to Chicago has to \npull off to the siding to allow another train to pass. Or less obvious, \nperhaps because of a crew or locomotive power shortage, the railroad \nwill have to dedicate limited and locally available resources to one \ntrain over the other. This has a cascading effect because it makes it \nhard to recover when too many of your sidings are being used to park \ntrains instead of being used for a quick meeting point so they can pass \nin the opposite direction.\n  A less obvious problem is the drain on resources from other regions \nto accommodate spot problems. Right now, for example, we are seeing a \nrail capacity shortage across the board. In addition to the long haul \ntraffic that is mixed into these heavy haul coal lines, areas of the \ncountry that never come into direct physical contact with these lines \nare affected by their congestion problems. When those lines ``bottle \nup'' as they are doing now, it takes more locomotive power and more \npeople to move trains. So resources are shifted. For example, we have \ndozens of loaded grain trains standing today with no power to move \nthem. Grain orders are a month or more behind in my State and \nthroughout the Midwest today. Locomotive power and other resources are \nbeing diverted to the PRB and elsewhere to address problems there, and\n\n[[Page S13320]]\n\nour farmers are suffering as a result. The same can be said for \nvirtually every traffic commodity out there today--including coal and \ngeneral merchandise traffic.\n\n  With the completion of this new rail line to serve a heavy traffic \narea, it will relieve pressure on one of the biggest problem spots, \nwhich in turn relieves pressure on the system throughout the country. \nThis project will not only add more physical track to our system and \ngreatly improve existing track, it will also result in more locomotives \nand equipment and people. Across the board, this project will relieve \npressure on the rail system from northeast corridor to the southwest \nreaches of the United States.\n  In a very basic sense, the national railroad system is well beyond \nits capacity today. There is not a railroad in this country that is not \nbacked up on its orders. We have more traffic to move than the system \ncan handle. And, adding to that, the U.S. Department of Transportation \nprojects that railroad freight traffic demand generally will rise 55 \npercent by the year 2020. We need to add capacity. That requires major \ninvestments of the kind envisioned in our new RRIF legislation.\n  The changes made to that program did more than authorize the amount \nthat can be loaned. The improvements were specifically tailored to \nencourage large-scale investment of the type envisioned by the DM \nproject. After all, a large-scale investment is needed if we want to \nhave a material impact on the national capacity problem. For that \nreason, I think this project is critically important to the country. I \nhope others will follow suit and develop projects that are national in \nscope. Nothing is more important to our national rail system in my view \nthan this basic need for capacity.\n  On a related issue, the rail industry has gone through a massive \nconsolidation on a national scale. Thousands of miles have been torn up \nin recent decades and are never to be recovered. This has certainly \nincreased efficiency on single line segments up to this point. But in \nthe process, at least from a national rail system perspective, we have \nlost important redundancy in the system. If we have a problem in one \narea, it quickly ripples through the rest of the country because of \ntraffic backups that have nowhere else to go. We need more pressure \nrelief valves, and more alternatives that allow the national system a \nlittle more flexibility to recover from spot problems. We have seen \nmelt down after melt down in the national rail system. That problem is \nnever going to get better unless we have some alternative emergency \nroutings developed. The DM project will also be of great help in \nproviding a fairly dramatic pressure relief valve for this critical \npart of the national rail system. So on many levels, from a national \nrail system perspective, this project reaches well beyond its immediate \ntrack geography.\n  Going on to other aspects of the new RRIF program, perhaps the most \nsignificant change we made was in regard to the valuation and treatment \nof collateral. This legislation requires the Secretary to use the more \nrealistic ``going concern'' valuation instead of ``net liquidation'' \nvalue the Secretary has used in the past in relation to collateral. \nThis is important because collateral value is a critical component of \nthe credit risk premium calculation. This language is intended to \nensure that the Secretary applies a ``going concern,'' or market value, \nto the collateral when determining whether and to what extent a credit \nrisk premium is required. In short, the question becomes, what could \nthe government reasonably expect to get for the value of the collateral \nif it were sold as a `going concern' business? In the past, the \nSecretary has used a ``net liquidation'' or ``scrap'' valuation \napproach. But in the real world if we are facing a default situation \nunder the RRIF Program, the Secretary is not going to ``scrap'' the \ncollateral. He is going to sell it for its highest and best use value. \nSo that is the way it should be valued when considering collateral \nduring the application process. This is consistent with private sector \nlending practices. It provides protection for the Government, and also \nencourages greater rail infrastructure investment by avoiding \nartificial credit risk premium payments when they are not necessary. It \nalso requires the Secretary to take into consideration what the value \nwill be after giving effect to the improvements that will be made with \nthe loan. That of course will be discounted based on the overall cost \nof capital for the project.\n\n  Along those same lines, another feature that was added to the \noriginal Young RRIF language was to provide for the loan repayment \nschedule ``to commence not later than the sixth anniversary date of the \noriginal loan disbursement.'' The intent was that this discretion \nshould be used for those large-scale projects that require several \nyears of construction before revenues are generated and where the \nrevenue ``ramp up'' may be gradual. This is a pretty standard feature \nin large private sector loans, but under the former law the Secretary \ndid not have any flexibility to do that. Under the new law, interest \nwould accrue and compound during this period. It was primarily my \nintent to provide a reasonable breathing period so that a solid revenue \nflow would be established before payments would be required.\n  Senator Lott and I also added a provision to the RRIF improvements to \nallow the Secretary to charge, and for the FRA to collect and retain, a \nfee to evaluate loans. This provision was included because we want the \nprocess to be efficient, and not be a drain on the government. The best \nsolution was to allow the Secretary to hire help and charge the cost to \nthe applicant. It is hoped that this will make it easier to expedite \nthese loans, and the expectation is that FRA will undertake best \nefforts to keep these fees to a minimum. The point here is to help \nexpedite the process and give FRA a little more flexibility to get the \njob done quicker. The former RRIF Program was notorious for the amount \nof time it took to process. There was a particularly bad history there, \nwhich I think the FRA has already improved substantially. This, \nhopefully, will give them the tools they need to take the next step.\n  The $35 billion authorization level was in Representative Young's \noriginal legislation, as was the provision that prohibited the \nSecretary from limiting the size of a single loan, and the 90-day \nreview period. Those were important provisions that we wanted to retain \nbecause they all go to this concept of encouraging major new rail \ninfrastructure investment in this country, and I appreciate the efforts \nby the Senator from Mississippi and his staff to retain them and add my \nlanguage to them.\n  In closing, the original RRIF Program got off to a very slow start, \nowing in large part I think to a certain degree of resistance from OMB. \nI am very hopeful that everyone recognizes this effort as a good faith \nattempt by Congress to send a clear message that we are trying to \nencourage major rail infrastructure investment in the United States \nrather than think up reasons to not do it. This is a program that is \nvery much in the national interest. As former director of the South \nDakota Rail Division, I believe strongly in the importance of and \nurgent need for major rail infrastructure investment in this country. I \nthink most Members of Congress feel the same way, and I hope our \ncolleagues in the administration receive this message and will support \nour recent action to strengthen the RRIF Program. I hope they will now \njoin in the effort to make RRIF a strong engine for rail infrastructure \ninvestment as was originally intended and as we directed in the \nrecently enacted legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that articles describing the \nproposed rail project--which appeared in the November 6, 2005 editions \nof the Sioux Falls Argus Leader, and the Huron Daily Plainsman, and the \nRapid City Journal--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Argus Leader, Nov. 6, 2005]\n\n                 In DM, Backers See Jobs, Prosperity\n\n                          (By Peter Harriman)\n\n       Rail boss Kevin Schieffer and Sen. John Thune toured South \n     Dakota on Saturday announcing a plan to seek a $2.5 billion \n     federal loan to reconstruct 1,300 miles of line in three \n     states and reach Wyoming's Powder River Basin coal fields.\n       The reaction in their wake ranged from the dogged \n     determination of opponents to continue fighting the scheme to \n     the ecstatic embrace of shippers and communities that foresee \n     an economic development bonanza.\n\n[[Page S13321]]\n\n       ``This is huge for us, huge for us,'' said Lisa Richardson, \n     executive director of the South Dakota Corn Utilization \n     Council and South Dakota Corn Growers Association.\n       Having clearance to seek the loan is a quantum leap for the \n     Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad and Schieffer, its \n     chief executive officer. Yet it's seen as a smaller piece of \n     a bigger puzzle. At a Sioux Falls news conference Saturday, \n     Schieffer developed that theme.\n       ``The end game is not building a railroad,'' he said. ``The \n     railroad is the means to an end.''\n       The project would create 3,000 construction jobs over three \n     years and permanently employ 2,000 new DM workers and \n     create as many new jobs for contractors working for the \n     railroad.\n       But Schieffer said: ``The direct jobs here are the tip of \n     the iceberg. The real action is in the economic \n     development.''\n       Schieffer said the railroad's presence already has \n     attracted new businesses. The DM's presence in Brookings \n     brought Rainbow Play Stations and 500 jobs to that community. \n     If the railroad can transform itself into the nation's \n     newest, most technologically advanced Class I carrier, ``I \n     see dozens and dozens if not hundreds of Rainbow Play \n     Stations springing up along the line,'' he said.\n\n\n                $286.4M projected in revenue first year\n\n       With a $2.5 billion capital investment, the DM will \n     create for itself a railroad with metaphors at both ends of \n     the line. In recounting the railroad's history, Schieffer \n     said the DM's acquisition of a sister line several years \n     ago gave it an eastern terminus at railroading's Rome. ``For \n     railroads, Chicago is Rome. All roads lead there,'' he said.\n       He also called the Powder River Basin coal fields ``the \n     Holy Grail'' of railroading.\n       Pursuit of the Holy Grail has kept the DM project wrapped \n     in controversy. The goal of expanding to Wyoming is to let \n     the DM grow beyond its status as the country's largest \n     Class II regional carrier and join the Union Pacific and BNSF \n     railroads in hauling vast quantities of low sulfur coal to \n     power plants in the Midwest and East. North America has \n     seven Class I railroads, based on annual revenue of $200 \n     million. When the project is complete ``absolutely and \n     immediately we will become the first Class I that has \n     built itself into a Class I since the classes were \n     established,'' Schieffer said. In asking the federal \n     Surface Transportation Board for a permit to become the \n     third carrier into the Wyoming fields, the DM projects \n     coal hauling revenue of $286.4 million in the first year \n     alone.\n\n\n             Critics observe absence of private investment\n\n       But spirited opposition has formed in places such as \n     Brookings and Pierre, along with Rochester in southeastern \n     Minnesota. Critics there don't want to see mile-long coal \n     trains traveling through their towns. Some landowners in West \n     River South Dakota and in Wyoming don't want 280 miles of new \n     rail bisecting their ranches. Other criticism rises from the \n     Oglala Sioux Tribe that worries rail construction will \n     threaten culturally sensitive sites.\n       Environmentalists fear noise and air pollution from the \n     coal trains and additional air pollution in the East from the \n     increased use of coal to generate electricity.\n       The announcement that the DM is seeking the huge federal \n     loan that it thinks it is uniquely qualified to get didn't \n     weaken the resolve of prominent longtime opponents nor prompt \n     them to view the project more kindly.\n       ``It doesn't change the fact that's not a viable coal \n     line,'' said Nancy Darnell of Newcastle, Wyo. She is a member \n     of the Mid States Coalition for Progress that sued the \n     Surface Transportation Board over its decision to allow the \n     DM expansion. The DM applied for the permit in 1998.\n       ``Schieffer had seven years to get financing in a vibrant \n     economy from an industry with a lot of money floating around, \n     and basically nobody was willing to invest in it,'' Darnell \n     said.\n       ``Private industry was not willing to put any money into \n     it. Nothing but stupid money would put money into the DM, \n     and the federal government tends to be incredibly stupid. \n     That's why it's the financing of last resort,'' she said. \n     ``Rebuilding the railroad in South Dakota for hauling grain, \n     that might have been something different. But to build the \n     PRB project and expect to haul coal is totally stupid.''\n       On Saturday, Thune and Schieffer said the Powder River \n     Basin project would address a transportation bottleneck \n     identified in the 2001 U.S. energy plan. The plan states \n     there is not enough rail capacity to move Wyoming coal to \n     power plants farther east at the rate it is needed. Because \n     it deals with that need, the DM's $2.5 billion loan request \n     to the Federal Railroad Administration's Railroad \n     Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program would be \n     given high priority, Thune and Schieffer said.\n       This will not stop the Mid State's Coalition from trying to \n     block the loan, Darnell promised.\n       ``We'll certainly look into it. That will be a stone that \n     will not be left unturned,'' she said.\n\n\n               Lawsuits, other barriers could delay start\n\n       The news the DM might have broken the longstanding logjam \n     on project funding left some opponents scrambling. Raymond \n     Schmitz is the attorney for Minnesota's Olmstead County. The \n     county, city of Rochester and the Mayo Clinic there all have \n     opposed the DM's effort to haul coal through Rochester.\n       ``It is my understanding the city and Mayo Clinic will be \n     taking whatever steps they can to continue their \n     opposition,'' Schmitz said Saturday. ``Whether the county \n     board elects to do anything actively at this point is a \n     decision they have to make. The county's position to this all \n     along has been the impact of this on the county was way out \n     of proportion to any benefit the county might realize.''\n       Schieffer praised Thune for including in the 2005 federal \n     transportation bill provisions that make it possible for the \n     DM to get a federal loan for its reconstruction and \n     expansion.\n       ``Obviously, at this point, we don't know what that \n     legislation says,'' Schmitz acknowledged. ``It was carefully \n     buried in the transportation bill. Whether there is a vehicle \n     to raise the issue is something that is going to have to be \n     explored.''\n       When the Surface Transportation Board approved the DM \n     project in 2002, the Mid States Coalition sued the STB, \n     claiming its decision was flawed. The U.S. 8th Circuit Court \n     ruled the STB decision was essentially sound. The court did, \n     however, require the board to further analyze the \n     environmental effects of rail vibration and horn noise, and \n     of potential increased coal consumption, before drafting a \n     final environmental impact statement and issuing a final \n     decision of approval. That review is ongoing. It might allow \n     opponents to at least slow the railroad's progress toward \n     securing a loan, since regulatory issues must be resolved \n     before the Federal Railroad Administration can consider a \n     DM loan application.\n       ``I don't see where they can do anything until they finish \n     that EIS process,'' said Sam Clauson, a South Dakota Sierra \n     Club delegate in Rapid City. ``The final EIS is due out this \n     fall. There's an appeal period on that We're going to \n     probably appeal it.''\n       Schieffer said he hoped to complete the loan application \n     this year or early next and have a decision from the rail \n     administration on the loan by next spring. That would let \n     construction begin next year.\n       Even as they laid out a future for South Dakota as an El \n     Dorado of economic development spinning off the DM's \n     ambitious project, Thune and Schieffer acknowledged the \n     ongoing controversies and promised to resolve them.\n       ``Those are legitimate concerns. This is a small state. \n     We're neighbors,'' Schieffer said. 'We need to work these \n     things out, and we will.''\n       Thune said of the project: ``Yes, it's great for South \n     Dakota. But it is not unanimously supported. There is some \n     work to do, there are some issues to address.''\n       Issues indeed. Fred Seymour lives on Derdall Drive near the \n     DM tracks in Brookings.\n       ``Nobody has a keener idea of the situation than me. I \n     expect if the railroad comes through town you will see \n     property values drop by 40 percent,'' he said. Seymour was \n     one of the earliest to call for the railroad to bypass \n     Brookings with its coal trains. But as the project has \n     dragged on, the momentum of opposition has slowed, he said.\n       ``In my view, the people who opposed the railroad have \n     gotten older and gotten crankier and have perhaps not \n     promoted their own interests too well,'' he said. He \n     anticipates within a month Brookings will resolve its \n     differences with the DM, and from his vantage near the \n     tracks he predicts with what sounds like cynical satisfaction \n     ``I would expect the DM is coming right through here.''\n       Opponents did not rule the day as Schieffer and Thune made \n     their way to news conferences in Sioux Falls, Huron and Rapid \n     City.\n\n\n               Potential windfall for ethanol and farmers\n\n       News that the DM project has taken a long step toward \n     becoming real also was widely praised Saturday. Schieffer \n     said the railroad will build an operations center in Huron, \n     which has struggled to attract new business. Huron lawyer Ron \n     Volesky said Friday he is seeking the Democratic nomination \n     for governor, and he hailed the DM announcement that it has \n     potential financing for the Powder River Basin project.\n       ``That is terrific news for Huron,'' he said. ``I have \n     always been a big supporter of the expansion project, and I \n     am very pleased to see these positive developments come \n     about.''\n       At the same time, Volesky said, as governor he would try to \n     broker compromise between the DM and its opponents. ``The \n     governor has responsibility as the political leader of the \n     state to help where he can to bring about as much consensus \n     as possible,'' he said.\n       Gov. Mike Rounds could not be reached for comment Saturday. \n     But he endorsed the DM project Friday and said: ``I will \n     continue to work with the DM to help make this proposal a \n     reality and address outstanding concerns at the state \n     level.''\n       The state's burgeoning ethanol industry has almost swamped \n     its existing rail facilities, which lends urgency to a DM \n     expansion, according to Ron Lamberty, vice president for \n     market development for the American Coalition for Ethanol.\n       ``What we had was not built for this,'' he said. A project \n     such as the DM's ``is probably something that's a necessity \n     in the long term,'' he said.\n\n[[Page S13322]]\n\n       Richardson of the corn growers association peers toward the \n     horizon Lamberty identified and sees an even brighter future. \n     A rebuilt DM will aggressively compete with the state's \n     dominant commodity carrier, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, \n     and will result in lower shipping rates for farmers, she \n     said.\n       And there is this: ``I was visiting with some people in the \n     ethanol industry who said we will see coal-fired plants in \n     the next 18 months,'' Richardson said. At some point, Wyoming \n     coal hauled by the DM could provide the energy to distill \n     ethanol from South Dakota corn at new ethanol plants built \n     here, she suggested.\n       ``It's huge.

John \n     Thune, R-S.D., spoke to a group of several dozen people about \n     the financing that only recently became an option--in a \n     transportation bill that expands railroad rehabilitation \n     funding.\n       The plan would allow DM to build or rehabilitate more \n     than 1,300 miles of rail, the majority of which would be in \n     South Dakota.\n       ``The impact it could have on the whole state is huge,'' \n     Thune said Saturday, calling the railroad infrastructure ``an \n     economic development magnet.''\n       ``Who even knows the kinds of industry we could bring in? \n     Literally, the sky is the limit in terms of what this could \n     mean,'' Thune said.\n       He said that it would not only provide thousands of jobs in \n     South Dakota, but would also address a pressing national \n     need--affordable and abundant energy.\n       ``Forty percent of the country's electricity is fueled by \n     coal,'' Thune said.\n       Schieffer added: ``And it's not just about coal. This is \n     about wheat, cement, clay out of Belle Fourche, timber and a \n     lot of other things.''\n       Although most who spoke Saturday were in support of the \n     railroad, property owner Veronica Edoff said she doesn't see \n     where the proposal is going to be fair to people who, she \n     said, are giving up everything to put money in DM pockets.\n       Other landowners, including Leonard Benson and Richard \n     Papousek said the company has been more than willing to \n     negotiate and work with the ranchers.\n       Wall Mayor Dave Hahn thanked Thune and Schieffer for what \n     the railroad could do for the state and its people, drawing \n     the only applause of the evening.\n       Thune said it would enable South Dakota to diversify and \n     grow the economy in a way no single industry can. After the \n     recent battle to save Ellsworth Air Force Base, he said, that \n     need is more obvious than ever.\n       ``There's a lot of work ahead of us yet, but I can tell \n     you, it's a lot further along that it was yesterday,'' \n     Schieffer said.\n       Schieffer emphasized that the funding is a loan--not a \n     grant or taxpayer-funded program.\n       ``We would have to pay it back, but the key thing is that \n     it would be stretched over a longer period of time.''\n       Thune called the project ``hands-down the biggest single \n     investment ever made in South Dakota. ``\n       The Federal Railroad Administration has 90 days to decide \n     whether to approve the loan after the application is filed. \n     The project would likely take about three years to build, \n     Schieffer said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Huron Daily Plainsman, Nov. 6, 2005]\n\n                           Committed to Huron\n\n                           (By Roger Larsen)\n\n       They came to hear when seven long years of waiting for the \n     start of a project unprecedented in state history in terms of \n     scope and jobcreating significance would be over.\n       Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad President Kevin \n     Schieffer couldn't specifically say when the first spike in \n     the $2.5 billion expansion and reconstruction project will be \n     driven into the ground.\n       But he could tell them something nearly as promising.\n       ``We feel very good about where things are right now,'' \n     Schieffer told a Huron crowd estimated at 250 on Saturday.\n       And for the first time since the project to access the \n     Powder River Basin coal fields in eastern Wyoming was \n     proposed in 1998 there is also this:\n       Thanks to a change in the law that now allows the DM to \n     seek the $2.5 billion in federal loans, Schieffer is in a \n     position to say that if the application is approved some \n     construction would start in 2006.\n       Until now, there has been no specific timetable. As each \n     year has passed, there has been hope the next one would bring \n     construction crews to the region. But the largest hurdle has \n     been a lack of private financing, and that is no longer the \n     problem.\n       Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., authored a provision in the \n     recently passed highway bill that expands the Railroad \n     Rehabilitation Infrastructure Financing program from $3.5 \n     billion to $35 billion.\n       Of that, $7 billion is set aside for Class II and Class III \n     railroads.\n       Based on the traffic load, DM is one of 50 Class II \n     railroads in the country.\n       Project completion would make it the sixth Class I \n     railroad.\n       While financing can now be sought in terms of a loan, ``it \n     doesn't mean it's going to get done, doesn't mean it's \n     approved, doesn't mean it's a done deal,'' Thune cautioned.\n       ``But it does provide a financing option that was not \n     available prior to the passage of that legislation which \n     works for this project,'' he said. A federal funding source \n     means the project has expanded from a $1.4 billion pricetag \n     to $2.5 billion, with new west and east branches, Schieffer \n     said.\n       Huron would be home to an operations center, where cars and \n     locomotives are fueled and serviced. The area would see 300 \n     to 500 new railroad jobs, based on traffic loads, and there \n     would be 3,000 to 5,000 construction jobs over three years in \n     three states.\n       Other servicing facilities would likely be near Wall, the \n     Wyoming border and New Ulm, Minn.\n       ``There's a lot of moving parts to this thing,'' Schieffer \n     said.\n       ``Facilities will change and move as time goes forward so \n     its hard to pin anything down with any certainty but one \n     thing isn't going to change.\n       ``Huron, South Dakota is going to be the operational \n     heartbeat of this enterprise when it's done and that is \n     something that's not going to change.''\n       He said that decision is based on personal and political \n     commitments.\n       An enthusiastic crowd of 250 at Saturday's presentation one \n     of three Thune and Schieffer hosted in the state will keep \n     the project on track.\n       ``There's a lot of incentive to keep this thing going, but \n     just remembering pictures like this provides more incentive \n     than I can ever convey to you,'' Schieffer said.\n       Throughout seven years of ups and downs, ``Huron has been a \n     steady rock of support,'' he said.\n       Thune's background and knowledge of railroad issues put him \n     in a unique position to understand DM's needs. He served as \n     South Dakota Railroad Authority director and worked on \n     railroad issues while on former Sen. Jim Abdnor's staff.\n       Thune has also been on board since the early days, \n     Schieffer said. ``It's easy for him and it's easy for me to \n     stand in front of this crowd today because there's such \n     enthusiastic support for it,'' he said. ``Seven years ago, \n     that man stood in front of a crowd about this big, but most \n     of them were angry landowners who were opposed to the \n     project,'' Schieffer said.\n       He said Thune listened to them, empathized with them and \n     pledged to make sure the DM acted responsibly. But he also \n     told them they must understand the project is too important \n     to the state not to be built.\n       ``That took courage and some leadership. That's the kind of \n     thing that's always been there, just like Huron,'' Schieffer \n     said.\n       There are still hurdles to overcome. Opposition still \n     exists west of the Missouri River, as well as in Pierre and \n     Brookings.\n       ``We've got issues still to address up and down the line,'' \n     Schieffer said. ``I think some of them will be successful and \n     we'll still be able to do things and some we won't.''\n       The regulatory issues are pretty much over and don't have \n     to be revisited with the new application for funding.\n       Schieffer said he doesn't want to raise false expectations, \n     ``but this legislation is very potent stuff.''\n       Railroads like the Union Pacific and Burlington Northern \n     had made use of federal funds in the past, but the law had \n     expired and when it was renewed the rules were changed so \n     DM&041E didn't qualify.\n       Not only does the Thune provision set the clock back so the \n     railroad qualifies, if it meets the criteria the secretary of \n     transportation must give it priority and preference to make \n     the project happen.\n       Instead of an open-ended time frame, the government must \n     make a decision on the loan application within 90 days of its \n     filing, which is expected in a couple months. Sometime in the \n     second quarter of next year, the fate of the project should \n     be known.\n       Schieffer said he thinks the DM project is the only one \n     in the country that fits the criteria. Applicants must be \n     able to prove their projects will have a material impact on \n     rail capacity in the country and will serve a compelling \n     national need.\n       ``This is the only rail project I know about out there that \n     will have a material impact on the rail capacity in this \n     country and there is a very clear national need in the \n     federal energy policy.\n       ``We have a very strong case to make,'' Schieffer said. \n     ``We still have to make it, we still have to get it \n     through.'' But the legislation gives the railroad a great \n     advantage.\n       ``It is absolutely everything we have hoped for,'' he said.\n       Debate in the country has been raging about not having \n     enough energy, generation and transmission, Thune said.\n       ``We would be prime positioned to benefit from some utility \n     plants and additional power generation that could result if \n     this railroad project is built,'' he said.\n       The project would create a synergy between transportation \n     and energy, he said.\n\n[[Page S13323]]\n\n     Low sulfur coal is in great demand because of the \n     environmental benefits.\n       ``We get 40 percent of our electricity from coal,'' Thune \n     said. ``The Powder River Basin has literally unlimited \n     reserves of coal resources.'' Competition in the basin would \n     also relieve bottlenecks, he said. By 2020, it's estimated \n     there will be a 55 percent increase in rail traffic in the \n     country.\n       In answer to a question, Schieffer said without the need \n     for private investors ``this gives us control of our destiny \n     much more.''\n       He said greater independence would mean the DM could \n     become a publicly traded company.\n       There has also been concern that the DM will forget its \n     ag producers and shippers. But the project has strong support \n     from commodity groups, and service will not only improve, but \n     will expand.\n       ``They know what it means to them,'' Schieffer said. ``It's \n     going to be a huge benefit.''\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, Congress has a moral obligation to make \ndifficult decisions about spending priorities as we fight the war on \nterror, recover from natural disasters, and struggle to shore up \nMedicare and Social Security. Last year in fiscal year 2005 our \nnational debt increased by $538 billion, or $1,738 per man, woman and \nchild in this country.\n  The American people, therefore, are justifiably outraged when \nCongress engages in an earmark spending free-for-all. Pork projects \ntend to be allocated outside of the regular priority-setting debate \nthat governs the rest of the budget process. This is wrong. Members of \nthis body should not be asking what right one Senator might have to \nquestion another Senator's projects. Instead, we should be listening to \nthe American people who are asking what right we have to force them to \nfinance questionable projects in all 50 States. Every pork project \nshould be balanced against other national priorities. Pork is not a \ncivil right for politicians.\n  This bill contains more than 1,100 earmarks.

Mr. President, I want to congratulate subcommittee \nChairman Bond and Ranking Member Murray for successfully concluding \nthis conference report. I would like to note that this is the first \ntime this subcommittee, as currently constituted, has brought a \nconference report to the Senate and, in my view, this report is a \nworthy achievement and I intend to support it.\n  I note, in particular, the strong title on Transportation funding in \nthe report. We all worked very hard to pass a Transportation \nauthorization bill earlier this year that maintains a balanced \ntransportation program, ensuring adequate funding for both our Nation's \nhighways and transit programs. In my view, both of these components are \nextremely important to the future economic growth of our country, and I \nam happy to note that the conference report being brought to us this \nafternoon is largely faithful to the provisions included in SAFETEA-LU.\n  The report's provisions regarding Federal employees are also to be \ncommended. The report includes language that will help Federal \nemployees to compete on a more level playing field with contractors in \ncases where Federal agencies decide to consider contracting out jobs. \nThe report ensures pay parity for all Federal employees--military and \ncivilian alike. It also provides over $125 million to consolidate the \nFDA at White Oak, and ensures that 68 Taxpayer Assistance Centers, \nincluding 4 in Maryland, will remain open until after the inspector \ngeneral completes a report to determine the impact proposed closures \nwould have\n\n[[Page S13324]]\n\non both employees and clients. I thank the managers of the bill for \ntheir hard work on these important issues.\n  I also want to talk about the appropriation for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, HUD. At the outset, I want to express my \nappreciation to Senator Bond for his commitment over many years to \nmaintaining strong and effective housing programs. Senator Murray, who \nhas not served as Ranking Member on the Subcommittee dealing with HUD \nissues until this year, has proven to be a very valuable addition to \nthis effort and has shown a deep understanding of, and commitment to, \nthese important programs.\n  The key problem that the Conferees faced in putting together this \nreport is that they were not given enough money to fund the housing \nprograms at a fully adequate level. For example, the HOME and CDBG \nprogram, both very flexible programs, used to build and rehabilitate \nhousing, create new homeowners, and create new jobs, suffer modest cuts \nin the report.\n  Public Housing, the Nation's basic housing program for the poor, is \ninadequately funded as to both its day-to-day operations, and its long-\nterm capital needs. The funding figures are very close to last year's \nappropriations--and I recognize that this was no easy task for the \nconferees--but we need more to maintain our basic investment in this \nfundamental program. HOPE VI is cut by nearly one-third, though I \ncommend the managers for getting this much, given the administration's \nrepeated efforts to kill the program altogether.\n  Finally, I want to express my deep disappointment that the \nconference report adopts the funding formula for renewal of section 8 \nvouchers put forward by the House instead of the far more effective \nformula adopted by the Senate in the bill we passed earlier this year.\n\n  Section 8 is the largest housing program funded the Federal \nGovernment, serving over 2 million low-income people. On the positive \nside, the conference report we are considering today does provide an \nincrease in funds over last year that will help to restore at least \nsome of the vouchers that were lost.\n  On the other hand, by adopting the House formula voucher renewals, we \nare likely to see the loss of thousands of valuable housing vouchers in \nfiscal year 2006. For several years, voucher funding for each housing \nauthority has been allocated based on the prior year's cost and \nutilization of vouchers at each housing authority around the country. \nThe Senate would have used as a base for this calculation the most \nrecent 12-month period. By contrast, the House formula, which has been \nadopted by this report, uses only a 3-month snapshot. As you might \nexpect, the Senate provision gives a much more accurate picture of both \nthe housing authority's voucher utilization and costs by taking a \nbroader picture of the data. In addition, the data that would be used \nunder the Senate provision would be more up to date, ensuring a more \naccurate outcome.\n  Projections based on data from HUD confirm this view. Under the House \nformula, some housing authorities will get millions of dollars of \nvoucher funds beyond what they can legally use, while others will not \nget enough to fund even vouchers that are currently in use. At a time \nof such tight resources, this kind of planned waste is simply \ninexcusable.\n  I want to emphasize that the Senate managers fought for the more \nsensible Senate language. It is unfortunate that the House, with the \nstrong support of HUD, prevailed in this case. Earlier this week, a \nsenior official at HUD said in the New York Times. ``Lack of Section 8 \nVouchers for Storm Evacuees Highlights Rift Over Housing Program,'' \nNovember 8, 2005, ``The housing voucher program is something we believe \nin. But we have to make sure the money's well spent.''\n  I regret to say that HUD objected to the Senate provision which would \nhave produced a demonstrably more effective and efficient allocation of \nsection 8 funds. In the end, despite the efforts of the chairman and \nranking member, HUD and the House prevailed. This concerns me greatly. \nI certainly hope that HUD does not come back next year and use the \nwasteful results of this ineffective system for which they advocated, \nas a rationale to provide less funding for fiscal year 2007.\n  Despite this significant disappointment, I want to, again, indicate \nmy support for the overall package.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will hear plenty of self-congratulatory \nstatements on this floor today about this conference report. And I am \nsure that there are probably many provisions that in fact have merit.\n  I cannot let the Senate consider this conference report, however, \nwithout highlighting some particularly egregious provisions which were \nliterally inserted at midnight. These specific provisions were not \nincluded in either the House or Senate appropriations bills, they were \nnever discussed during any of the meetings of the Conference Committee, \nnor were they subject to hearings by either the authorizing committees \nwith jurisdiction, nor by appropriations committees.\n  I think we should call these provisions the ``Leave the Victims of \nUnscrupulous Moving Companies Behind Act.''\n  Consumers have fewer rights in trying to seek recourse when they are \nvictims of fraud or outright theft than when they deal with a dishonest \ninterstate moving company. The consumer has no ability to use State or \nlocal laws or consumer protection regulations. That is because Federal \nlaw preempts State and local action in this area. The only recourse a \ndefrauded consumer has is to try to enforce the Federal regulations by \ngoing to Federal or State court. This is expensive and in most cases \nextremely impractical. Let me explain.\n  One of the most common forms of abuse is what is commonly called \n``hostage goods.'' This abuse was described by the Department of \nTransportation's Inspector General at a hearing I held in the Commerce \nCommittee to look at this problem. Let me quote from his testimony:\n\n     . . . household goods moving fraud is a serious problem, with \n     thousand of victims who have fallen prey to these scams \n     across the county. Typically, an unscrupulous operator will \n     offer a low-ball estimate and then refuse to deliver or \n     release the household goods unless the consumer pays an \n     exorbitant sum, often several times the original estimate. In \n     one case, for example, a New York husband and wife in their \n     seventies were quoted a price of $2,800 to move their \n     household goods to Florida. Once the movers had loaded about \n     half of the goods, the foreman advised the couple that unless \n     they paid the new price of $9,800 they would never see their \n     property again. Fearing that the moving crew might physically \n     hurt them, the couple paid the vastly inflated fee.\n\n  In such a case, trying to find an attorney and then proceed to courts \nwhile all your worldly possessions are on a truck heading to Florida is \nnot especially practical.\n  This is not an isolated incident. Since 2001, consumers have filed \nover 10,000 official complaints with the Department of Transportation. \nSince 2000, the Inspector General has investigated allegations of fraud \nassociated with approximately 8,000 victims.\n  In the recently completed highway bill, Congress included provisions \nto try to tip the scale back a little bit to the side of the consumer. \nThe provisions that were included in the highway bill conference report \nwere almost identical to the provisions in the Senate passed bill and \nto the provisions that were included in the highway bill that passed \nthe Senate in the last Congress. The basic point of these provisions \nwas to allow State attorneys general and State consumer protection \nofficials to intercede on behalf of consumers and enforce Federal law \nand regulations dealing with moving companies.\n  The appropriations conference report we are considering today \nbasically puts these proconsumer provisions on a hold for a year, and \nallows State officials to intervene in only the most limited of \ncircumstances.\n  Finally, let me be clear. Most of the companies and individuals \nengaged in the moving industry are hard-working and honest. It is a \nsmall minority of companies that engages in unscrupulous behavior and \nit is these companies that need to be reined in.\n  Unfortunately, this conference report allows unscrupulous movers to \ncontinue to defraud consumers with little practical recourse for our \nconstituents that have been mistreated.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my disappointment and \nfrustration with provisions included in this conference report that \nseverely weaken critical consumer protection law for those that ship \nhousehold goods using commercial movers.\n\n[[Page S13325]]\n\n  As the ranking member of the Commerce Committee's Consumer Affairs, \nProduct Safety, and Insurance Subcommittee, as a former State attorney \ngeneral, and as a leading member of the Committee's Surface \nTransportation Subcommittee for motor carrier issues, I must express my \noutrage that this conference report undermines the consumer protections \nfor victims of unscrupulous movers that were part of the transportation \nbill, known as SAFETEA-LU, signed into law less than 4 months ago.\n  These provisions were inserted despite commitments I received to the \ncontrary. We had an agreement that we would not seek to modify the \nhousehold goods consumer protection language within the Commerce \nCommittee's jurisdiction beyond an amendment that was offered as part \nof the floor consideration of this appropriations bill in the Senate.\n  Instead, over the objections of myself, Senator Inouye, Senator \nStevens, Senator Lott, and the leadership of the House Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee, this new language was forced into the \nconference report in order to protect a few big moving companies from \nincreased public accountability.\n  Adding insult to injury, provisions that were specifically rejected \nduring the conference on the transportation bill this summer were \nincluded in addition to language that goes well beyond those items and \nfurther undercuts the work Congress did to aid consumers who face \nfraud, extortion, and abuse at the hands of unregulated moving \ncompanies.\n  As a former State attorney general, I know the public benefits from \nlocal and State officials who are dedicated to protecting consumers. \nOver the past year, picking up on work begun by Senator McCain, and \nworking with Senators Lott, Inouye, and Stevens, I have tried to find \nways to assist the many citizens from all across this country who have \nbeen victimized by moving companies and have nowhere to turn.\n  The most outrageous situation is when a moving company holds all of a \nconsumer's possessions until they pay thousands of dollars in excess of \nthe original estimate for the move. This practice, known as ``hostage \ngoods,'' is extortion, plain and simple. And it leaves consumers \nhelpless in a strange city, with none of their possessions and no \nrecourse.\n  I say helpless because, although there are some Federal laws to \nprotect consumers when shipping their goods in interstate commerce--\nprotections we enhanced with the passage of SAFETEA-LU--the Department \nof Transportation, DOT, is simply not suited to police the 1.5 million \ninterstate moves that occur each year.\n  In 1995, the predecessor of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration, FMCSA, assumed the regulatory duties of the household \ngoods moving industry previously carried out by the Interstate Commerce \nCommission. Until recently, FMCSA had a total of 3 personnel assigned \nto handle all of the consumer complaints for the entire Nation and \ncould do little about them. I understand that FMCSA has received nearly \n20,000 consumer complaints since January 2001. They have taken little \naction in this area because FMCSA contends that its limited resources \nmust be focused on truck safety, the agency's primary mission.\n  States, which want to get involved and already oversee consumer \nprotections for the intrastate movement of household goods with little \ncontroversy, have been told by the courts that they have no \njurisdiction in this area, since it involves interstate commerce. The \nnet result is that moving companies operating in interstate commerce \nface no regulation of their commercial behavior, and therefore, \ncontinue to take advantage of consumers.\n  To address this glaring problem, SAFETEA-LU created a partnership \nwith the states by allowing them to enforce certain Federal consumer \nprotections rules as determined by the Secretary of Transportation--a \nmodel that works well in other areas.\n  It is so disheartening that only a few months after these new \nauthorities were put in place--before they could even take effect and \nbe put to use to protect consumers--these provisions have been reopened \nand basically gutted on behalf of a few big moving companies that want \nto keep operating without real oversight.\n  The household goods provisions added to this conference report will: \nlimit a State attorneys general's ability to initiate an action to \nenforce Federal household goods consumer protection law to only cases \ninvolving new moving companies or those who egregiously violate Federal \nmotor carrier safety regulations. The effect of this provision is to \ntotally insulate most movers, particularly larger and more-established \nmoving companies, from even the threat of action by a State, regardless \nof how outrageous their violation of Federal consumer protection law \nmay be.\n  Further, the provisions will: apply these same enforcement \nlimitations to State authorities that already regulate intrastate \nmovers and require that the State consumer agencies enforcing Federal \nhousehold goods consumer laws bring their cases in Federal courts only, \nwhere they would languish on average for 3 more years. What are \nconsumers supposed to do while everything they own is being held \nhostage by a mover during those 3 years?\n  I believe these provisions go well beyond anything the Commerce \nCommittee would ever have agreed to, had we the opportunity to consider \nthese directly. The only thing positive I can say about them is that \nthey are set to end after Fiscal Year 2006.\n  This language is an affront to all authorizing committees that--after \nyears of discussion--agreed upon these provisions. It is wrong that \nthose who did not get what they wanted--were rejected both in the \nSenate and in conference--can then hijack the consumer protection \nprovisions that this Congress approved in July.\n  The passage of the SAFETEA-LU household goods language signaled \nCongress's willingness to stand up for the consumer and correct an \ninjustice that occurs far too often. It is sad that this conference \nreport seeks to undo this achievement and make it significantly more \ndifficult for our citizens to get the recourse they deserve.\n  State attorneys general and State consumer protection agencies are \nmuch more likely than the Federal Government to doggedly pursue justice \nfor their citizens in these cases. A letter from the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General on January 21, 2004, proves this \npoint, by indicating the association's full support for State \nenforcement of Federal household goods consumer protections. The \nletter, signed 48 State attorneys general, specifically rejects \ncomplaints from the moving industry against this new authority.\n  In conclusion, let me say that I appreciate the work of the other \nHouse and Senate appropriations conferees and my colleagues on the \nSenate Commerce Committee for trying to keep these provisions out of \ntheir bill. It is unfortunate that they ended up being included, and I \nplan to work to see that they are overturned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that I be recognized for a few \nminutes and that the time not come out of the time that is currently \nallotted on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Thanking the Senator from West Virginia\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret seriously that I was not here at \nthe beginning of the statement made by the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, Senator Byrd. I was in an interview, as a matter of \nfact. My staff came to tell me the Senator was speaking about the \narticle I gave to him that my daughter Lily wrote. I have come to the \nfloor to thank him for his courtesy and generosity in speaking about \nthat article.\n  Lily is one of my six children, the last of my children. As the \nSenator from West Virginia indicated, she is in law school at Boalt \nHall. She wrote her thesis at Stanford about the history of this \nCapitol. I gave a copy of that thesis to the Librarian of Congress, \nJames Billington, and he passed it on to the National Capitol \nHistorical Society. They determined they would print part of it in \ntheir current bulletin, which pleased me very much.\n  I shared that with the Senator from West Virginia, as any proud \nfather would, particularly with the Senator from West Virginia because \nof our\n\n[[Page S13326]]\n\ngreat friendship and the time we have been here together. He is the \nsenior Senator on his side of the aisle, and I am now the senior \nSenator on this side of the aisle. I will forever be his junior in \nterms of not only age but service and the admiration I have for him.\n  I knew Senator Byrd would be interested in the way Lily described \nthis Capitol, its history, and its importance to this country. It is a \nbeautiful article, I think, and I am doubly proud of her and extremely \npleased that he would take the time and do us both the honor of putting \nthat article in the Record.\n  I invite my friends and colleagues to read that article. Lily had a \ndifferent life than most of my other five children. She literally grew \nup here from the time she was a very small baby, and came to the Senate \nquite often and sat on my shoulder when we were in conference meetings.\n  Senator Byrd has always been very gracious about coming to her \nbirthday parties which we held here during the 8 years I was the whip \non this side of the aisle. All of our family has such a great \nadmiration for the Senator and for his great history.\n  I think many people do not realize that he is not only the most \nsenior Senator, but he is the only Senator who went through both the \nuniversity level and law school level while serving in the Congress. He \nhas a prodigious memory. I think of times when, for instance, we were \nat the U.S.-British Parliamentary Conference when I encouraged the \nSenator to tell us some of his memories of serving in the Capitol when \nwe were with our fellow legislators from the Parliament of Britain. We \nhave great memories of that.\n  I also have a memory of the time when we were in West Virginia when \none member of the Parliament made the mistake of saying that Americans \ndidn't know much about the history of our mother country and those who \nhave served Britain and their monarchy. Senator Byrd proceeded to tell \nus in detail about every single person who ever served in that \nposition, including the husbands and wives of the monarchs of Britain.\n  I have so many great memories of service with Senator Byrd. I have \nalready ordered a copy of the transcript and the tape of this \npresentation to send to Lily. I can think of no nicer birthday present \nto me than that the Senator from West Virginia would honor my daughter \nand the article she has written about the place we both love, the \nCapitol of the United States.\n  I thank the Senator very much for his courtesy.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield \nbriefly--and I am not going to keep my friend from Texas waiting. He \nhas been standing and waiting to be recognized.\n  It was a pleasure, may I say to my friend, to call to the attention \nof Senators this beautiful article written by Senator Stevens' daughter \nLily. She is a really precocious child. I have watched her from almost \nday one. I admire her. She is a well-bred woman. She is the flower of \nwomanhood. She is seeking always to enlarge her mind and doing a great \njob of it.\n  I am pleased the Senator feels that he rejoices that her article has \nbeen mentioned by me. I want to assure him that he is entitled to every \nplaudit I can bring to bear on this subject. I hope he conveys my love \nand my admiration to his daughter Lily.\n  And may I say to the Senator, ``Thou art my guide, philosopher, and \nfriend,'' as the Pope once said. I mean every word of that. I treasure \nour friendship, I say to Senator Stevens, and may his beautiful \ndaughter continue to do her work and complete her studies and go on to \nhigher things. She is a fine model, and many of us can learn from her \nefforts to improve herself. I will certainly do that myself. I thank \nthe Senator. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator twice honors me. I do thank \nthe Senator very much. Those of us who have had the privilege of \nserving here more than a short time develop relationships that I think \nthe rest of the body and perhaps the country don't understand. Very \nclearly my commitment in terms of friendship and devotion to my friend \nfrom West Virginia is equal to his for me. I am very pleased and proud \nto have that relationship with him.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that after I \nam recognized, Senator Coburn and Senator DeWine be recognized for up \nto 30 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13326-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13326-S13329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I talk about two subjects that are very \nnear and dear to my heart. The first is the matter of child support \nenforcement. My colleagues might wonder how does that issue arise. The \nfact is, last night, the House of Representatives passed their version \nof the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. As each of us knows, the purpose \nof that Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 is to actually bring down the \nFederal deficit by finding cuts in the Federal budget, the Federal \nbudget that currently comprises something in excess of $2.5 trillion a \nyear.\n  This is a very important exercise. This represents the first time, I \nbelieve, since 1997 when we have seen real and meaningful cuts in \nFederal spending. The challenge, of course, is that about a third of \nthe money the Congress spends is discretionary spending. Half of that \nthird is defense spending, and the rest of it is homeland security and \nother discretionary programs. But some of that you can tell by the mere \ndescription is hardly discretionary because it is important to our \nnational security.\n  My point is that two-thirds of the Federal budget is not, even under \nany conception or definition, discretionary spending. It is Medicaid, \nMedicare, and Social Security, and we simply have to come to grips with \nthat so-called entitlement or nondiscretionary spending in order to \ndraw the reins in on a Federal Government that continues to grow day by \nday in its scope and size and expense.\n  I am here to say I think there are some cuts that make more sense \nthan others and some cuts make no sense whatsoever. I consider child \nsupport money that goes to assist the States in collecting child \nsupport to fall into that last category--cuts that make no sense \nwhatsoever. Let me explain.\n  The House bill will cut $5 billion in Federal funds from the child \nsupport program over 5 years--$5 billion over 5 years. It will cut \n$15.8 billion, almost $16 billion, over 10 years. This translates into \na 40-percent reduction in Federal spending for the child support \nprogram. My State of Texas would lose $258 million over 5 years and \n$824 million over 10 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a chart prepared by the Center for Law \nand Social Policy which lays out the proposed cut to Federal child \nsupport funding State by State be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        TABLE 2.--PROPOSED CUTS TO FEDERAL CHILD SUPPORT FUNDING\n                              [$ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               10-Year\n                     State                       5-year Cut   Cut, 2006-\n                                                 2006-2010       2015\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama                                                -187          -59\nArizona                                                -188          -59\nCalifornia                                           -1,006       -3,211\nConnecticut                                             -71         -228\nDist.

Mr. President, those are the cuts, $5 billion over 5 \nyears, $16 billion roughly over 10 years.\n  What is the impact of these cuts on child support collected?

For a $16 billion cut, it eliminates $24.1 \nbillion in collections over 10 years. In my State of Texas these cuts \nwill reduce child support collections by $411 million over 5 years and \n$1.25 billion over 10 years.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that a chart also prepared by \nthe Center for Law and Social Policy, which states the projected impact \non child support collections State by State, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n         TABLE 3.--PROJECTED IMPACT ON CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTIONS\n                              [$ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               10-Year\n                     State                       5-year Cut  Cut,  2006-\n                                                 2006-2010       2015\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama                                                 -93         -285\nAlaska                                                  -31          -95\nArizona                                                 -94         -286\nArkansas                                                -61         -185\nCalifornia                                           -1,601       -4,884\nColorado                                               -104         -316\nConnecticut                                            -113         -346\nDelaware                                                -35         -108\nDist.

The total cut was distributed by state based on\n  each state's share of total child support distributed collections in\n  2004, as reported by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement\n  Preliminary Report FY 2004, table 7.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in the year 2004, the child support \nprogram collected $ 21.9 billion, while the program costs were $5.3 \nbillion. Let me make this clear for my colleagues. In other words, for \nevery $1 spent by the Federal taxpayer $4.38 in child support was \ncollected for the children who need it. This is not the typical Federal \nprogram. This is not money that once spent we see no real benefit from. \nRather, this is one that for every dollar that is invested $4.38 in \nchild support is collected for the children who need it and who are \nlegally entitled to it.\n  The President's 2006 budget cites the child support program as ``one \nof the highest rated block formula grants of all reviewed programs \nGovernmentwide.'' This high rating is due to its strong mission, \neffective management, and demonstration of measurable progress toward \nmeeting annual and long-term performance measures.\n  Even there, the numbers and these sort of accolades about this \nprogram do not tell the whole story. The story is completed by the fact \nthat many children who receive child support are thereby prevented from \ndrawing down other Government programs. For example, child support \nenforcement reduces reliance on Medicaid, temporary assistance to needy \nfamilies, and other social service programs. It is estimated that more \nthan 1 million Americans were lifted out of poverty through child \nsupport programs in the year 2002 alone.\n  So in addition to money that is a good return on investment, $4.38 \nfor every dollar, this money actually avoids additional expenditures of \ntax dollars by creating individuals who are qualified for other \nGovernment programs at a lot more expense to the Federal taxpayer.\n  The problem with these cuts is that they are likely to reverse \ndramatic improvements in the child support program's performance over \nthe past decade, and they may well force many families back on the \nwelfare caseload. This means former welfare families and working \nfamilies of modest income will lose an important source of income that \nnow enables them to maintain financial self-sufficiency and thereby \nhaving to draw on Government resources through public assistance \nprograms.\n  The reason I feel so passionately about these particular cuts and the \neffectiveness of the child support enforcement program is that for 4 \nyears before I came to the Senate I served as attorney general of \nTexas. It was my job, on behalf of approximately 1.2 million children, \nto see that they got the child support that they deserved, that they \nneeded, and that they were legally entitled to.\n  I am proud to say that my State ranks second in the Nation in terms \nof total collections, collections of about $1.8 billion in fiscal year \n2005, and an increase of 83 percent of collections since fiscal year \n2000.\n  Now, that did not happen by accident. The reason it did happen is \nbecause of the great work being done by the men and women in the child \nsupport enforcement division of the State of Texas. It also happened \nbecause of the money that is provided by the Federal Government to help \nfund this necessary function. Due to the good work of these hard \nworking men and women in the child support division, obligations, that \nis court orders, establishing support have risen from 55 to 82 percent \nof the qualifying population, and the cost-effectiveness in Texas has \ngone from $4.96 to $6.81.\n  I mentioned the national average of $4.38 for every dollar spent. In \nTexas, we now collect $6.81 for every dollar spent.\n  If the financial benefits, if the cost-effectiveness of this program, \nand if the avoidance of other costs to the Federal taxpayer were not \nenough, there are other intangible benefits to a strong and effective \nchild support enforcement program. I have seen with my own eyes that \ntoo many families, when they divorce, reach a tacit agreement with \nregard to their children. Moms who frequently are the ones who have \ncustody of the children sometimes\n\n[[Page S13328]]\n\nreach a tacit agreement with their ex-spouse, typically the father, \nthat if they do not exercise their visitation rights that the mother \nwill not press the father for the financial support to which their \nchildren are legally entitled.\n  What happens is that these children become two-time losers. Not only \nare they denied the financial benefits that the law says they are \nentitled to, they are denied contact with both parents that every child \nneeds in order to have the best chance of success.\n  Indeed, one of the intangible benefits of an effective child support \nprogram is not just the money collected, it is not just lifting \nchildren who would otherwise be in poverty out of poverty, it is not \njust avoiding the additional expenses of Government programs that would \notherwise be invoked if that support was not there, it is literally the \nbenefit of having a mother and a father both engaged, involved, and \ncommitted to the welfare of their children.\n  I can think of no more important purpose that our efforts could serve \nthan to reunite mothers, fathers, and children in a collective effort \nto improve the status of our children and their prospects for a bright \nfuture.\n\n  So I hope in the conference on the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 our \ncolleagues in the House will reconsider, and I hope our colleagues in \nthe Senate will persuade them that of all the cuts they might have \nchosen these were the least deserving and that the money should be \nreinstated. I am confident throughout the $2.5 trillion Federal budget \nthat there are other programs, other waste, other fat, other \nineffective programs that could be more effectively cut and with far \nless damage to the most vulnerable among us.\n\n\n                              PATRIOT Act\n\n  Finally, just for a couple of minutes, maybe 5, I want to speak about \nanother subject, and that is the USA PATRIOT Act. It has been more than \n4 years since our country was hit on September 11 by terrorists who \ncare nothing for our way of life and nothing for the laws of war. They \nhave attacked, because they could, innocent civilians in their jihad \nagainst those who have different ways of life and different views.\n  We know the PATRIOT Act has been largely responsible for making \nAmerica safer by bringing down the wall that prevented the sharing of \ninformation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, by \nmaking available to our FBI and other intelligence-gathering bodies the \nsame sort of techniques that are currently used against organized crime \nmembers and other criminals. Simply, what this body did in the PATRIOT \nAct was make sure that we used every legal and reasonable means to root \nout terrorism, to investigate it, and to stop it before it killed other \ninnocent Americans.\n  The PATRIOT Act was passed shortly after September 11 by a strong \nbipartisan vote of 98 to 1 in the Senate and 357 to 66 in the House. As \nI said, the PATRIOT Act enhanced law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies' ability to gather and analyze intelligence information and to \nuse the most modern communications technologies, such as e-mail, \ncellular telephones, and the Internet, and it strengthened criminal \nlaws and penalties against terrorists.\n  As always, we must be concerned with the right balance between the \nneed to protect innocent American lives and the need to preserve our \ncivil liberties. Despite the dire predictions of some groups, the \nPATRIOT Act has not eroded any of our rights that we hold near and dear \nas Americans. To the contrary, the PATRIOT Act has enabled the Justice \nDepartment, the FBI, and the CIA and other Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement agencies to cooperate and to share information and \nthereby save American lives and protect what is perhaps the most \nimportant civil liberty of all, and that is freedom from future \nterrorist attacks.\n  I serve on the Judiciary Committee, and we have held 25 oversight \nhearings to date within the Judiciary Committee to ensure that we have \nboth the tools we need and that we struck the right balance between \ncivil liberties and our need to be secure. As all of our colleagues \nknow, several sections of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire, sections \n203 and 218, on December 31, 2005. These are the very provisions that \nhave been instrumental in bringing down this wall that has previously \nseparated different agencies of the Federal Government in getting \ninformation that is needed in order to save American lives and to stop \nterrorist attacks.\n  I would just read briefly from recent testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee by Peter Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney for the \nNorthern District of Illinois, who has recently been in the news. He \nhas recounted from personal experience how this wall between law \nenforcement and intelligence personnel have operated in practice. He \nsaid:\n\n       I was on a prosecution team in New York that began a \n     criminal investigation of Usama Bin Laden in early 1996. The \n     team--prosecutors and FBI agents assigned to the criminal \n     case--had access to a number of sources. We could talk to \n     citizens. We could talk to local police officers. We could \n     talk to other U.S. Government agencies. We could talk to \n     foreign police officers. Even foreign intelligence personnel. \n     And foreign citizens. And we did all those things as often as \n     we could. We could even talk to al Qaeda members--and we did. \n     We actually called several members and associates of al Qaeda \n     to testify before a grand jury in New York. And we even \n     debriefed al Qaeda members overseas who agreed to become \n     cooperating witnesses. But there was one group of people we \n     were not permitted to talk to. Who? The FBI agents across the \n     street from us in lower Manhattan assigned to a parallel \n     intelligence investigation of Usama Bin Laden and al Qaeda. \n     We could not learn what information they had gathered. That \n     was ``the wall.''\n\n  Well, people who remember the hearings before the 9/11 Commission \nwill remember that there were a number of high-profile witnesses from \nJanet Reno, the former Attorney General of the United States, to former \nAttorney General John Ashcroft, who served during the first term of the \nBush administration, and FBI Director Mueller. Witness after witness \ntestified that that wall between criminal investigators and our \nintelligence-gathering communication prevented the sharing of \ninformation that has been absolutely critical in protecting innocent \nAmerican lives and preventing future terrorist attacks.\n  It is that same wall that will be resurrected on December 31, 2005, \nunless the U.S. Congress acts. It is absolutely critical that we look \nat this with cold-eyed clarity and not be swayed by scare tactics or \nemotional appeals.\n  I am astonished, when I look at the reality of how the PATRIOT Act \nhas made our Nation safer, that there are those who would use scare \ntactics to try to convince them that America's civil liberties are \nsomehow imperiled. In fact, the American Civil Liberties Union, time \nand time again, through fundraising appeals and elsewhere, has \nmisrepresented the PATRIOT Act in a way that I believe has frightened \nthe American people. They happen to use it to raise money in their \ndirect mail campaign, but it has had the disservice of breaking \nAmerican resolve and confusing the American people about exactly what \nis at stake and what the benefits of the PATRIOT Act are.\n  Perhaps the most telling manifestation of the effectiveness of their \nscare tactics and their misinformation campaign is that approximately \n300 different municipalities across America have passed resolutions \ncalling for the repeal of the PATRIOT Act. I think we have to mark that \noff to a lack of good information, or perhaps the gullibility on the \npart of some of these city councils and others. Because, as the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has found out, when you ask the American Civil \nLiberties Union to detail a single violation of American civil \nliberties as a result of the passage and implementation of the PATRIOT \nAct, they have been able to come up with none, zero, zilch, nada.\n  Senator Dianne Feinstein, with whom I am honored to serve on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, who always does a very diligent job on \nbehalf of her constituents and on behalf of the Senate, asked the ACLU \nto search the records and come up with a single instance that they \nbelieve demonstrated or proved that the PATRIOT Act imperiled the civil \nliberties of the American people, and they did not come up with a \nsingle example.\n  I hope, as we continue to work on a conference report to reauthorize \nthe PATRIOT Act, that the Members of the Senate will do our jobs with a \nclarity of mind based upon evidence and not yield to the scare tactics \nby those who want to create a disinformation campaign and perhaps \nconfuse the American people about the importance of the PATRIOT Act. It \nis absolutely critical that we reauthorize this act, that\n\n[[Page S13329]]\n\nwe not allow that wall to be resurrected because the truth is, we owe \nit to the American people and we owe it to those whose lives will \nliterally be lost unless we do our job and reauthorize the PATRIOT Act \nbefore provisions of that act expire on December 31, 2005.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13329-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT).

It's the way we've kept the spirit of our revolutions \n     alive--a spirit that drives us to dream and dare, and take \n     risks for the greater good.\n\n  Harrison Meyer was always taking risks for the greater good--always \nputting others first and selflessly giving of himself for his fellow \nman. According to Medical Platoon Sergeant Randolph L. Nutt:\n\n       [Private First Class Meyer] fully knew what the dangers \n     were and willingly accepted them as a risk to save others' \n     lives. He made the ultimate sacrifice so that others may \n     live. Six other soldiers are still alive directly due to his \n     actions.\n\n  Indeed, Mr. President, Harrison Meyer--Harry to his friends and \nfamily--embodied the true American spirit that President Reagan \ndescribed.\n\n       Harry grew up in Worthington and attended Thomas \n     Worthington High School. He graduated in 2003. While in high \n     school, Harry belonged to the track team for 3 years. He \n     competed as a pole-vaulter. Andy Cox, a U.S. history teacher \n     and track coach at Thomas Worthington, remembers Harry as a \n     ``teddy bear who made everybody laugh. He was a real team \n     player--always wanting to help people.'' Coach Cox went on to \n     say that ``Harry was the kid who was trying to make all the \n     other kids relax, feel good about competing.''\n\n  Harry often brought homemade treats to the track meets for the entire \nteam. Coach Cox emphasized the popularity of his cheesecake. As he \naffectionately recalls, ``[Harry] was a great cook!''\n  Hary did not join the track team during his senior year because he \nwanted to focus his attention on his upcoming military career. Still, \nhowever, he attended all of the school's track meets, and, according to \nCoach Cox ``he'd always bring something homemade for the team.''\n  Harry was also a member of the school's choir, and for four summers, \nHarry worked at the Worthington municipal pool doing various jobs, \nincluding serving as a lifeguard.\n  According to his mother, Harry was deeply affected by the September \n11th terrorist attacks. He enlisted in the Army's pre-graduation \nprogram, and shortly after his high school graduation, he was inducted. \nHe was stationed in Korea and assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters \nCompany, 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, \nCamp Howze, before leaving in August 2004, for Iraq. His mom said that \nHarry's selflessness was one of the reasons he decided to become a \nmedic after joining the Army.\n  In fact, according to Chris Begin, a good friend of Harry's, Harry \nwanted to go on to medical school after returning from Iraq.\n  While in Iraq, Harry and his comrades faced danger daily. Harry's mom \nrecalls that before he was killed, Harry had treated a dozen seriously \nwounded soldiers. She said that ``he knew (insurgents) were targeting \nmedics. He indicated it was a very dangerous place. ``But, he always \ntold me--`Don't worry, Mom.' ''\n  The dangers became too grave on November 26, 2004 near Ar Ramadi. \nHarry was killed the day after Thanksgiving, while trying to pull a \nwounded comrade to safety during an insurgent attack on his unit.\n  At the services held in Harry's honor after his death, friends and \nfamily recalled Harry's heroism and generosity, saying that the cause \nof his death reflected how he had lived. According to his mom, ``Harry \nhad always wanted to help people. He didn't think about his own \nwelfare. He'd give you anything he had.''\n  I recently came across a touching reminder of Harry's lasting impact \non others. It is a posting on an Internet tribute for service members \nwho have been killed in either Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation \nEnduring Freedom. A friend of Harry's--Pamela Moorehead from \nWorthington--posted the following email message:\n\n       Harry, I was thinking about you today. I'm not sure what \n     made me think of you. I think I was just reminded by \n     something someone said. It's September 26, 2005, so in one \n     month you will have been gone for a year. Everyone still \n     misses you. The memories from pole vaulting with you and \n     hanging out with you and Brandon make me both happy and sad. \n     To your family--Harry is one of my heroes, and we all still \n     think about him. We miss him and continue to keep him and all \n     of you in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n  Harrison Meyer was a kind soul, with a warmth that touched many \npeople. My wife Fran and I keep Harry's family--his parents Deborah and \nWilliam; and his three sisters--Lynn, Bronwyn, and Kelley, in our \nprayers.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks with an excerpt from a poem \ntitled ``American Hero, written by Harry's cousin Jordan Michael Meyer. \nThe poem is in remembrance of Harry:\n\n     He is out there on the front lines.\n     He knows the risk.\n     He knows the sacrifice.\n     He is going to put it all on the line and role the dice.\n     The man is fighting for a better life.\n\n     The American soldier found his home after this brutal fight.\n     Now looking down upon us he sets flight.\n     Always keeping us in sight.\n     He won't stop protecting us, day and night.\n\n     He is an American soldier, brought up on love, alone, feeling \n           so far from home.\n     He hides his fear, doing anything to protect those who are \n           dear, knowing death is near.\n     He is a young man taking upon the sacrifice of a nation he \n           holds dear.\n\n  Harrison Meyer held his Nation dear, and we hold dear his memory. We \nwill never forget him.\n\n\n                   MARINE CORPORAL NATHAN R. ANDERSON\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, while deployed in Iraq, Marine Corporal \nNathan ``Nate'' Anderson made sure to write his family back home in \nHoward, OH, as often as he could. After witnessing the death of a good \nfriend, Nate wrote that ``the service of freedom demands sacrifice.'' \nHe tried to calm his family's fears as he continued, ``No worries. I \nwill be fine wherever I end up. I have the Lord on my side and guardian \nangels on both shoulders. I am good to go.''\n  I rise today on the floor of the United States Senate to pay tribute \nto this brave Marine. With the Lord on his side, Nate left this Earth \non November\n\n[[Page S13330]]\n\n12, 2004, as he was killed while fighting insurgents in Al Anbar \nprovince in Iraq. He was 22 years-old.\n  Nate gave his life the day after Veterans Day, just over a year ago \nnow. It is fitting in a sense, given his deep devotion to protection \nour Nation. When I think about Nate and the dedication of all our men \nand women in uniform, I am reminded of something President Ronald \nReagan once said about freedom. He said that ``the task that has fallen \nto us as Americans is . . . to keep alive the hope and dream of \nfreedom.''\n  Nate Anderson accepted this task wholeheartedly. He believed in \nfreedom. And he believed that he had a mission to protect it and \npromote it around the world.\n  Nathan Anderson was born in Zanesville, OH on May 22, 1982. Growing \nup in Apple Valley, Nate enjoyed hunting, fishing, snowboarding, and \nbull riding. Older sister, Meg, remembers her brother as a ``happy and \ngood spirited'' kid who liked swimming, making mud pies, and riding \nroller coasters at Cedar Point amusement park. She said that Nate was \n``the life of the party.'' He had a real zest for life. He loved \ncountry music, rodeos, and the military. Even at the young age of 10, \nNate dreamed of someday becoming a Marine.\n  Nate attended East Knox High School, where he was both a dedicated \nstudent and gifted athlete. Karen Smith, a guidance counselor and \nteacher, described him as ``a very likable, well-rounded young man'' \nwho had a lot of friends. Nate's football coach, Chet Looney, said that \nNate's ``contribution to the team was outstanding. He was one of those \nguys you need because he was a great team player. He was kind of fiery \nat times and then other times he was a jokester.'' Kathy Frere, an \nEnglish teacher at East Knox High, fondly remembers Nate. ``He was just \na special student,'' she said. ``He was so enduring. To know him is to \nlove him--it's an old saying, but it's true.''\n  Following his high school graduation in June 2001, Nate's dream of \njoining the Marines became a reality. He was assigned to the 1st \nBattalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, 2nd Marine \nExpeditionary Force, based in Camp Lejeune, NC. In 3 short years, \nNate's service took him to over ten countries, including his final \ndeployment in 2004 to Iraq in 2004.\n  Nate's family recalled the pride that Nate displayed as a result of \nserving his country and his desire to be the best Marine and the best \nson, brother, and friend he could be.\n  April Buckingham, Nate's close friend and former high school \nclassmate, described his outgoing and compassionate personality as \nalways uplifting others. She recalls gathering around the campfires \nthat Nate often built, with the help of friends, in his parent's \nbackyard. She said that ``Nate was an honest guy--the heart and soul of \nall our friends. He was the one who tried to keep us all together after \ngraduation. He was an amazing person. We all loved him, and will miss \nhim very much.''\n  Nate's sisters remember him with great love, affection, and respect. \nHis sister Traci describes her brother as ``soaring on wings like \neagles. I salute you, my brother. I salute the way you lived. I salute \nyour sacrifice. I will always be in your debt.''\n  Nate's sister Meg said that he was her best friend. She last spoke to \nhim on the phone 2 weeks before his death, when he told her that they \nwould be on a special mission. Meg said that Nate told here ``it'd be \ntwo weeks and not to worry. He said he loves me. He said he'll be home \nsoon.''\n  At Nate's funeral service, held at North Bend Church of the Brethren, \n400 mourners gathered to say goodbye. As the Reverend Patrick Bailey \nsaid, ``They had come to honor a great son, an awesome brother, a great \nfriend, a fellow [marine] and hero.''\n  Nate was all of those things and more. He loved his family. He loved \nhis country. He fought for freedom. And, we will never forget him. His \nparents, Mary and Neil Shaw and Richard Anderson; sisters Meg, Traci, \nand Kelly; and his brother Adam all remain in our thoughts and in our \nprayers.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks by reciting an e-mail message \nthat was posted on an Internet tribute to Nate. Someone who just signed \nher e-mail as ``Amy of Ohio'' wrote the following:\n\n       Thank you Nate for your sacrifice--for protecting me and my \n     children and for being our hero. We hope and pray that your \n     reward will be great in Heaven. To Nate's family-- we pray \n     for you and will never forget your son's courage or the price \n     he paid for our great country. May you find peace in God's \n     love and know your son will always be with you, and you will \n     one day be reunited. I hope and pray that all Americans are \n     grateful of our men and women, sons, daughters, moms, dads, \n     brothers, sisters, husbands, wives, and grandchildren who are \n     fighting for our freedom while we enjoy our lives in the \n     comfort of our own homes. Nate, you will never be forgotten \n     and will be our hero forever and always. God bless you and \n     your family and God bless America.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VITTER). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the situation in Iraq.\n  Critics of the Bush administration have recently gone out of their \nway to try to convince the American people that the President misled \nour nation about Iraq. Some are arguing most vociferously that \nPresident Bush purposely withheld intelligence information from \nCongress. Others accuse the President of deliberately fashioning U.S. \nintelligence to fit his own agenda. A few even suggest that the \nPresident had some kind of personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and \nwas willing to do whatever it took to remove him from power.\n  I can accept criticism leveled at our intelligence agencies for \nproviding inaccurate intelligence. I can accept criticism lodged \nagainst the Department of Defense for not sufficiently preparing for an \nIraqi insurgency.\n  I can even accept criticism that the Bush administration did not \nappropriately prepare the American people for the cost of the war in \nIraq.\n  What I cannot accept, what I feel is so irresponsible, and what is so \ndamaging to our nation are accusations that suggest that President Bush \ndeliberately lied to the American people about either the intelligence \nor about his reasons for going to war.\n  I was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee when the \nPresident requested Congressional authorization for the use of force \nagainst Iraq in 2002. I participated in numerous open and classified, \nbipartisan hearings and briefings on our intelligence regarding Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction. The conclusions that I reached, that \nPresident Bush reached, and that many Democrats reached, were the same.\n  We all agreed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We \nall agreed that he had used such weapons in the past against Iran and \nIraq's Kurdish populations. And, we all agreed that he would not \nhesitate to use them against the United States in the future.\n  The U.S. Congress and President Bush were not alone in this \nassessment. The intelligence agencies of Britain, Germany, Russia, \nChina, and even France all believed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass \ndestruction. The entire international community watched as Saddam used \nthese weapons to murder thousands of his own people. Even the Chief \nUnited Nations weapons inspector, Han Blix, thought the chemical \nweapons he discovered prior to the war in Iraq were the ``tip of a \nsubmerged iceberg''.\n  The fact is that the debate in Congress over whether to authorize the \nuse of force was never about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. \nEveryone thought Saddam Hussein had them. In fact, even those who voted \nagainst the use of force in Congress never questioned the veracity of \nour intelligence information.\n  That is not because the Bush administration manipulated the \nintelligence that was presented to Congress, as some have alleged. \nIndeed, a number of independent commissions since the war began have \ninvestigated this issue and found the Bush administration did not \ndistort intelligence information. The best known investigation was the \nbipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which stated \nunequivocally in its report that, ``the Committee did not find any \nevidence that Administration officials attempted to coerce, influence \nor pressure analysts\n\n[[Page S13331]]\n\nto change their judgments related to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction \ncapabilities.''\n  Therefore, if we agree that the President did not lie about our \nintelligence on Iraq's WMD programs, then the critics can only argue \nthat the President Bush's rationale for going to war at the time of the \nCongressional debate was somehow flawed and unjustifiable. Here I would \nagain disagree.\n  During the debate, I joined with a large majority of the Members of \nCongress on both sides of the aisle who voted to authorize force. We \ndid so because of two important facts--the same two facts offered by \nthe President.\n  First, Saddam Hussein was in breach of more than a dozen United \nNations Security Council resolutions. He continued to refuse to \ncooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors even after a decade of \nsanctions. He rejected proposal after proposal to conduct fair and \ntransparent inspections.\n  When he finally allowed inspections, Saddam did everything he could \nto undermine, cajole, and otherwise manipulate the inspections process. \nHe gave every appearance of hiding large stockpiles of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Second, a large bipartisan majority of Members of Congress, including \nnearly 30 Senate Democrats and 81 House Democrats, voted to authorize \nthe use of force against Iraq because, after September 11, it was clear \nthat America could no longer afford to allow imminent threats to our \nnation go unhindered and unopposed. In most minds, Iraq represented a \nhighly dangerous nexus between terrorism and weapons of mass \ndestruction. In the context of Saddam's decade-long defiance, it was a \nnexus that Members of both sides of the aisle in both the Senate and \nthe House was no longer willing to ignore.\n  When critics try to cover up their vote in support of the use of \nforce against Iraq, they damage the credibility of our government \noverseas and send a disheartening message to our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines who are bravely defending freedom in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  When they falsely accuse the President of misleading the American \npeople, they encourage the enemy who believes America will throw in the \ntowel and give up when the fighting gets tough.\n  It is time for the President's critics in Congress to remember why \nthey voted to authorize force against Iraq in 2002. It is time for them \nto acknowledge the progress our soldiers are making now in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It is time for them to recognize the success we have had \nagainst global networks of terror.\n  And most of all, it is time for these critics to lay aside their own \npolitical ambitions and do what is right for America. It is time for \nthem join our Commander-in-Chief in the fight against those who wish to \ndestroy our Nation.\n  An agenda of disunity and surrender will never lead to victory. We \nneed to unite behind our Commander-in-Chief if we are to defeat this \nenemy. It is my hope that the President's critics will see this \nimperative and finally do what is best for our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13331-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13331-S13333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DEFENSE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I decided to come to the Senate for a few \nminutes this evening to speak to the Senate because of growing concern \nover the defense budget and, in particular, the growing likelihood that \nwe are going to see cuts in the defense budget so that next year's \nbudget is lower than what the President had proposed for fiscal year \n2007.\n  I am moved especially by a recent ``Inside Defense'' column which \nreports that because of pressure from the Office of Management and \nBudget, the Deputy Secretary of Defense may well require that the \nservice chiefs take $7.5 billion out of next year's budget and $32 \nbillion in cuts over the next 5 years--this at the end of the budget \ncycle, not as a result of an assessment of military need or necessity. \nAs I will show in a minute, one could hardly in any dispassionate view \nof our military needs believe we could absorb $7.5 billion in cuts next \nyear because of procedure that is budget driven. When I see that, it \nreminds me of other things I have been hearing lately. I felt it was \ndeja vu all over again, as Yogi Berra might have said.\n  I remember the days in the 1990s when military needs were determined \nby the budget rather than the budget being determined by military \nneeds. When the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War ended, our country \nwas justifiably pleased. We believed there was a peace dividend \navailable. The Clinton Administration took a lot of money out of the \ndefense budget. I will go into that in a minute. They took too much out \nof the defense budget, and left a force that by the end of the 1990s \nwas hollowing out. Our military was not as prepared as it should have \nbeen. We have been doing the best we can in the last few years to \nreconstitute that force, but now we may be headed in the wrong \ndirection.\n  I emphasize, this pressure is not from within the Department of \nDefense. It is not what the Department wants to do. It is what the \nDepartment may be forced into as a matter of false economy. There is no \neconomy more false than depriving our military and our men and women of \nwhat they need to defend us.\n  Let me go over a little bit more of a history lesson in some depth. \nDefense spending actually decreased in real terms every year from 1990 \nthrough 1999. In fact, during 3 years in that period, it decreased in \nnominal terms by almost $50 billion.\n  Actual dollars, or nominal dollars, went down in the defense budget \nover 3 years during that period by $50 billion, and in every year \nduring that period military spending decreased in real terms.\n  The reason was, some people thought with the fall of the Soviet Union \nwe would need the military less. That was true for the nuclear arsenal, \nbut not true for the people in the military. It turned out we needed \nconventional forces actually more than we needed them before the fall \nof the Soviet Union because deployments went up. We found, in the post-\nCold War era, that regional conflicts around the world, the ethnic and \nreligious and regional conflicts that had been suppressed by the \nbipolar nature of world competition, rose to the surface.\n  I remember reading what former CIA Director Gates said about it. He \nsaid: History had not ended with the fall of the Soviet Union. It had \njust been frozen before that. And he said: ``Now it is thawing out with \na vengeance.''\n  Well, when you spend less and less overall, at least as against \ninflation, and you have to spend more and more on operations and \nmaintenance, on readiness, because you are actually using the troops \nmore and more, something has to give. You cannot take more and more of \na percentage for operations and maintenance out of a budget which is \nless and less, at least as adjusted against inflation, without \nsomething giving. And what gave was procurement.\n  We took basically a decade-long ``procurement holiday.'' By the last \nfew years of the 1990s most people realized what was happening and we \nwere able to push more money back into the defense budget, but it was \nnot enough to make up for what had happened before.\n  From 1975 through 1990, we purchased, on average every year, 78 scout \nand attack helicopters. From 1991 through the year 2000, we purchased 7 \nper year on average. For battle force ships from 1975 through 1990, it \nwas 19 a year; 7 a year from 1991 to the year 2000. For fighter \naircraft for the Navy, we purchased 111 per year from 1975 through \n1990. We purchased 42 per year on average in the decade of the 1990s. I \ncould go on and on.\n  For tankers, we purchased 5 per year on average during the 15-year \nperiod from the mid-1970s to 1990. In the mid 1990s, we purchased one \nper year. For tanks, artillery, and other armored vehicles listen to \nthis, the basic platforms the Army uses; tanks, artillery and other \narmored vehicles--we purchased 2,083 on average every year from 1975 to \n1990. But we purchased 145 on average every year from 1991 through the \nyear 2000.\n  What happened is what you would have expected. The average age of the \nforce and the equipment in the force\n\n[[Page S13332]]\n\ngrew. Look at legacy aircraft, the A-10, the ``Warthog,'' 24 year old; \nthe B-52 bomber, 44 years old; the C-130 transport, 33 years old; the \nKC-135 tanker, 43 years old. The procurement holiday left us with \nequipment that was too old.\n  Well, what happened? Beginning at the end of the 1990s, Congress and \nthe President at the end of the Clinton administration, and especially \nwith the beginning of the Bush administration--began to respond. The \nChiefs complained to the point where people who didn't get it earlier \nfinally saw what we were talking about. The decision was made to \nincrease spending enough to sustain the volunteer force, to \nrecapitalize the basic equipment that we had not bought in the 1990s, \nand to begin designing and producing the new generation of systems that \nthe men and women in our military would use for decades to come.\n  The plan was to increase defense spending by a modest amount above \ninflation, beginning around the year 2001, so that these needs could be \nmet. There were many of us who were concerned that was not enough \nmoney. The Department of Defense has traditionally been rather \noptimistic in its estimation of costs. The CBO traditionally has \nclaimed we needed between $20 billion and $30 billion more than even \nwas estimated at that time. But at least we had a plan. It was a \nbeginning. It was based on an actual if perhaps optimistic estimate of \nneed.\n  Unfortunately, the plan has not been as effective as we hoped in \nachieving its goals, and particularly in recapitalizing the force. \nThere are a lot of reasons for that. One is that op tempo, operational \ntempo, has been even higher than we expected after what we experienced \nin the 1990s. It is what the military calls ``mission creep,'' a \nsignificantly expanded number and variety of missions that drive up \ndefense costs because they stress the force. Operations and maintenance \ncosts go up, readiness costs go up. Just staying in place, just keeping \nthe force you have and the equipment you have maintained and ready \nbecomes more difficult.\n  But what was the mission creep? The September 11th attacks had \nsomething to do with that, and then Afghanistan and Iraq. Our Armed \nForces have become global first responders. We have homeland security \nmissions now that we never anticipated. Contingency peace enforcement \nmissions around the world, special ops, and ongoing training \noperations. Operational tempo is at a historic high. It is likely to \nremain so.\n  This means not only that we are sucking up more money in operations \nand maintenance, it means the equipment we have is being used up even \nfaster. Even if you maintain it properly, if you are using it at a \ngreater rate than you anticipated, it is not going to last as long. We \nface a situation where we are going to have to reset or reconstitute \nthe basic equipment in the force.\n  In addition, personnel costs have been higher than we anticipated \nbecause we wanted to do right by the men and women in America's \nmilitary. We voted for pay raises. And we should have. We have \nincreased housing allotments. We have met the obligations we promised \nour retirees regarding health care. Those were good things. I supported \nthem. But adjusted for inflation, personnel costs have increased from \n1999 to 2006 from $92 billion to $109 billion annually. That alone \nwould eat up any of the real increases we had planned and have been \nable to give the military in the last 5 years.\n\n  In addition, we are facing a threat, at least sooner, and certainly \nmore seriously--or a potential threat--than we thought we would have to \nface; and that is, the rising military power of China. China is engaged \nin a comprehensive effort to profoundly improve its ability to project \nnaval power and to develop a comprehensive anti-access capability in \norder to prevent the American military from having access into the \nwestern Pacific.\n  I am not saying that China is going to become, or need become, an \nenemy of the United States. I am saying that China is rising as a world \npower. It is very deliberately, according to plan, increasing in \nparticular its naval strength. If we are to deter some kind of \naggression or conflict, we need to be strong--not provocative, but we \nneed to be strong in response. We did not anticipate, 5 or 6 years ago, \nthat they would grow so strong so quickly.\n  Their most significant advances are in submarines. China will take \ndelivery of 11 submarines in 2005. We are going to buy one. Its fleet \nincludes an increasing number of the following vessels: the Type 93 \nnuclear-powered attack submarine; Type 94 nuclear-powered ballistic \nmissile submarine, which carries an ICBM with a range of more than \n5,000 miles; and Russian-built ``Kilo\"-class diesel electric attack \nsubmarines.\n  By the year 2010, they may be able to deploy a fleet of up to 50 \nmodern submarines to confront us, should they choose to do so. \nRemember, they can concentrate that power in the Western Pacific.\n  Among China's surface combat vessels, the most notable is the growing \nnumber of Russian-built missile destroyers which carry the SS-22 \n``Sunburn'' anti-ship missile, and the Type 72 large amphibious assault \nship. In addition, China is developing and producing its own advanced \nfighter aircraft. It is procuring hundreds of advanced Russian-built \nSukhoi fighters. China has deployed over 700 land-attack ballistic \nmissiles opposite Taiwan. It is adding over 100 new missiles each year.\n  I could go on for a considerable period of time. The upshot of that \nis, by the end of the decade, China may be able to field, as I said \nbefore, 50 submarines, all concentrated in the Western Pacific. They \nare closing the technology gap and working steadily to develop an area \ndenial capability which is aimed directly at American strength.\n  I am not saying they are going to use it. I do believe strongly that \nthe more they believe we are going to be prepared and ready, the more \nlikely they will be to seek peaceful redress of whatever concerns they \nmay have, the more likely it is we are going to be able to avoid \ndeveloping a confrontational relationship with them.\n  For all these reasons, we have not completed the task of redressing \nprocurement shortfalls from the 1990s. We need 160 aircraft per year to \nkeep the average age in the inventory stable. Instead, we are \npurchasing 80 aircraft. The current plan is to purchase less than one-\nhalf the number of new F/A-22s the Air Force says it needs. This is the \nsuperior air-to-air fighter. The Navy is at 283 ships, and that number \nis going down. We purchased an average of 5.6 ships per year over the \npast 10 years. You assume a 30-year service life. At that rate, it is \neventually going to give us a fleet of 170 ships.\n  The last time the Department of Defense estimated the number of ships \nwe needed to be secure, it was 375. I expect that a reasonable \nQuadrennial Defense Review, looking at this, will produce a number no \nlower than 300. We are not purchasing ships at anywhere near the rate \nwe have to in order to sustain the Navy at that level. At that rate, \nour submarine force will drop below 40 in the next decade. Every recent \nstudy identifies the need for 55 to 76 submarines at a minimum. We need \nto get the shipbuilding budget up, and estimates range from $14 billion \nto $18 billion a year to maintain a Navy at approximately 300 ships. We \nare not there yet.\n  Now, additional reductions are being proposed. Those reductions, if \nimplemented, will mean the defense budget again will not grow, at least \nin real terms. Most of the Department's budget is basically committed. \nYou cannot short operations and maintenance. You cannot short \nreadiness. You must pay your people. You must provide the benefits you \nhave committed to provide. That means any budget cuts must come almost \nentirely out of exactly the platforms, the ships and planes and tanks \nand vehicles that we have been designing and developing to provide the \nnew generation of capabilities that our men and women need to be able \nto defend us.\n  So proposals are afoot and rumors are out that the Army is going to \ncancel the Future Combat System. That is the Army's system to replace \nthe older tanks, the Bradley fighting vehicles, to make sure the \ntechnology is adequate, the information technology is networked \ntogether. FCS is the system designed to give us the most modern ground \ncombat capabilities. All of this\n\n[[Page S13333]]\n\nis potentially on the chopping block. The next generation destroyer, \nthe DD(X), may not get built. That is the ship that is going to provide \nnaval surface fire to support troops going ashore. The Joint Strike \nFighter, our stealthy air-to-ground strike fighter, which we have been \ndeveloping for years, is on the chopping block. The new tanker is \nimperiled. The need for additional airlift is imperiled. This situation \nis serious.\n\n       What do we need to do? The Department is engaged right now \n     in a Quadrennial Defense Review. Every 4 years the Department \n     looks at its needs and is supposed to analyze what it needs \n     to defend us and analyze that in terms of military needs, not \n     fiscal constraints. In other words, the way the law reads, \n     they look at what structure of forces, what package of \n     capabilities they need to defend the United States, and then \n     we try to come up with the money to pay for that.\n\n  Well, I am concerned that the analysis may be the other way around. \nThey may be given a figure, a budget number, and told to come up with a \nforce structure and a package of capabilities that meet that budget \nnumber. They must be allowed to assume reasonable inflation-adjusted \nincreases in the defense budget for the future and then be allowed to \nbuild the package of capabilities and force structure needed to defend \nthe United States.\n  That Quadrennial Defense Review needs to be military driven, not \nbudget driven. Then, in the meantime, while we wait for that review, we \nshould stick with the planned figure for fiscal 2007. Every year, the \nDepartment sends its budget here. And, of course, the key number is the \nnumber for the upcoming fiscal year, but it is always a 5-year defense \nplan. In the first few years of the Bush administration, to the credit \nof the Department and the administration, they have basically stuck to \ntheir projections year by year, with fairly minor deviations.\n  The figure for fiscal 2007 that we were given last year is $443 \nbillion, and that is the figure that should come over. We should not \nsacrifice our defense requirements for deficit concerns. Whatever your \nfeelings about the deficit and about how we ought to resolve the \ndeficit, it is not caused by the defense budget.\n  The defense budget is 48 percent of discretionary spending. It was \njust about the same in the Carter era. The defense budget as a \npercentage of the total budget is 17 percent, which is 6 percent less \nthan it was in the Carter era. As a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct, it is 3.6 percent which, again, is less than it was in the \nCarter era. The military budget has not caused the deficit that we are \ndealing with today. In fact, if we could just sustain defense spending \nat 4 percent of the gross domestic product, which would be an historic \nlow, that would be more than adequate for us to build the kind of force \nstructure that we need to defend our country. That is not too big a \nsacrifice to pay for this Nation's security.\n  I said at the beginning of my remarks that reducing the defense \nbudget in the name of reducing the deficit is a false economy. I ask \nSenators to consider the world situation today. The stability of the \ninternational order in the world depends on the reality and the \nperception of American military power. The more stable the world is, \nthe more hospitable it is to freedom and to our interests, the faster \nour economy will grow, and the more money we will have available, not \njust for defense spending but, indeed, for all other obligations of the \nGovernment. That is something President Reagan understood. When he \nbecame President in 1981, he began building up America's defenses. He \nhad double-digit spending increases in the military budget. He knew \nthat was a key aspect of winning the Cold War. He got the attention of \nthe Soviets. After a few years, they decided it was not worth it to try \nto compete with the United States in that arena. That was one of the \nkey factors that led to the fall of the Soviet Union. And the freedom \nthat resulted from that, the end of the isolation of Eastern Europe, \nthe opportunities that were unleashed on the world are one of the \nreasons that we had unparalleled economic growth all throughout the \n1990s, which then enabled us to balance the budget and eventually get \nto a surplus.\n  If, as a result of budget-driven decisions, we reduce the defense \nbudget beneath what is minimally adequate, we create a sense of \ninstability in the world, a doubt about our resolution to maintain our \nobligations and to protect our freedom. If that even minimally \nincreases the possibility of a confrontation somewhere in the world, it \nwill affect our economic opportunities and our economic growth far more \nthan anything we could possibly save by reducing the defense budget, to \nput it on just as low and cold a level as possible. A strong defense, \nthe perception of American will and resolution is good for the economy. \nIt is necessary if we are going to grow as a country, create jobs, and \ngenerate the kind of revenue that will allow us to address the deficit.\n  I offer a personal note on behalf of this issue. The men and women \nwho defend us in our military are the finest people who have ever \nserved in any military service at any time in the Nation's history. \nThey know the obligation that they are undertaking. They undertake it \nwillingly. Over Veterans Day, I attended a few rallies around Missouri. \nI like to do that in commemoration of the men and women who have \nserved. I was in Lebanon, MO, and met a number of our service personnel \nwho were there. One of them was a recent enlistee in the National \nGuard, a young man who was proud to wear his country's uniform, proud \nat the prospect that he might be actively involved, as I am sure he \nwill be, in helping our Nation win the war against terror.\n  We had an opportunity to visit. He understood that in doing that, he \nwas doing something very important, very large. He was sacrificing, and \nhis sacrifice was a measure of the value he placed on the freedom of \nhis country and the security of his family.\n  Those young men and women in America's military will keep faith with \nus. They are going to do what we ask and expect them to do to protect \nus. We owe it to them, particularly in the Congress. We owe it to them, \nto keep faith with them. They protect us. They count on us to protect \nthem, to do what we know is necessary to provide them with what they \nneed to do their jobs.\n  Let's live up to that. Let's have confidence that doing the right \nthing, meeting our obligations with regard to the national defense, is \nthe best way to approach the future, both economically and as a matter \nof foreign policy and as a matter of the Nation's security.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13333-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13333-S13334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Thursday night, on the eve of Veterans Day, \nwe passed the Foreign Operations appropriations bill with near \nunanimous, bipartisan support. I commend my colleagues for their \ncooperation on this bill which is so critical to America's security.\n  I especially recognize Senator Mitch McConnell for his steady \nleadership.\n  Diplomacy and foreign policy are essential pillars of our national \nsecurity. They reflect America's values, principles, and vital \ninterests.\n  This $21 billion appropriations bill promises to promote democracy, \nstability, and prosperity, and strengthen America's security here at \nhome and around the world.\n  It also promotes America's leadership in the arena of international \naid. Targeted foreign assistance is an invaluable instrument for \nspreading democratic values, and improving the health and welfare of \nour neighbors close to home and around the world. It can promote \neconomic growth and opportunity in even the poorest of nations.\n  The Foreign Operations appropriations bill includes several \nprovisions that advance these efforts. I would like to take a moment to \nshare some of them.\n  The defeat of Global HIV/AIDS is one of the world's greatest \nhumanitarian challenges. In many countries, an entire generation of \nproductive adults has been wiped out by this one, tiny, malicious \nvirus. The funds set aside to battle the HIV/AIDS virus target relief \nwhere it can do the most good and make the biggest difference.\n  Under this legislation, America is committed to providing $2.82 \nbillion for Global HIV/AIDS relief. That includes: $2 billion for the \nGlobal HIV/AIDS Initiative; $250 million for HIV/AIDS from the Child \nSurvival and Health Programs Fund; and a $450 million contribution to \nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.\n\n[[Page S13334]]\n\n  By providing this desperately needed help, we save lies, strengthen \nalliances, and promote peace and stability.\n  I have often talked about humanitarian aid as a currency for peace. \nThe Foreign Operations appropriations bill wisely sets aside targeted \nfunding for global health programs to advance that cause.\n  A1ong with tackling the Global HIV/Aids crisis, the Foreign \nOperations appropriations bill supports the Child Survival and Health \nPrograms Fund. These funds help reduce child mortality and morbidity, \nand combat other, serious public health problems.\n  One of the most important public health crises this bill addresses is \nthe lack of clean, drinkable water in many regions of the world.\n  Every 15 seconds a child dies because of a disease contracted from \nunclean water. Fully, 90 percent of infant deaths can be attributed to \nthis one, basic cause.\n  1n total, water-related disease kills 14,000 people a day. That is \nover 5 million people a year, not counting the millions who are \ndebilitated and prevented from leading healthy lives.\n  Cholera, typhoid, dysentery, dengue fever, trachoma, intestinal \nhelminth infection, and schistosomiasis can all be prevented by simply \nproviding clean, drinkable water and proper sanitation.\n  Funding for the Safe Water: Currency for Peace Act, which I \ncosponsored earlier this year, will go a long way to providing this \nsimple, but profound necessity.\n  In addition to providing Foreign Operations needed and targeted \nhumanitarian aid, the Foreign Operations appropriations bill advances \nthe critical work of stopping the spread of WMD.\n  We are working closely with our friends and allies to secure \nstockpiles of WMD-related materials and technology and to make sure our \nallies have the ability to protect these sensitive materials.\n  The Foreign Operations appropriations bill provides over $410 million \ntoward our nonproliferation, antiterrorism, and demining efforts.\n  One of the gravest threats we face is the threat of WMD falling into \nour enemy's hands.\n  We cannot, we must not, let this happen.\n  Ultimately, the goal of each and every one of our foreign operations \nprograms must be to promote America's security and America's values. \nAnd as the last century taught us, our security and our values must go \nhand in hand.\n  Whether for humanitarian, diplomatic or security purposes, effective \nforeign assistance advances our vital interests and protects the \nhomeland.\n  The United States remains committed to eliminating poverty, expanding \nprosperity, and strengthening domestic institutions abroad.\n  And by doing so, we advance our security and prosperity right here at \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13334-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR. BEN WORTHINGTON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndedicated steward of our national forests, Mr. Ben Worthington. Last \nmonth, Ben retired from the National Forest Service after 32 years of \nservice. For the last 10 of these years, my home State of Kentucky was \nfortunate to have him serve as forest supervisor of the Daniel Boone \nNational Forest.\n  Ben began his forestry career at Washington State University, where \nhe earned a degree in forest management. After graduating, he joined \nthe Peace Corps and was relocated to Costa Rica for 2 years. Upon his \nreturn, he worked for the Forest Service in his home State of Oregon \nand eventually in Washington State and California. Before moving to \nKentucky, he was the deputy forest supervisor at Bridger Teton National \nForest in Wyoming.\n  As forest supervisor of the Daniel Boone National Forest, Ben oversaw \nthe day-to-day operation and preservation of Kentucky's only national \nforest. The Daniel Boone National Forest covers over 700,000 acres of \nland from the northeastern part of the Commonwealth of Kentucky all the \nway to the Tennessee State line, and also includes some noncontiguous \ncounties in eastern Kentucky. This Kentucky treasure has something for \nevery outdoor enthusiast. With over 600 miles of trails, it can be \nhiked, biked, and explored on horseback. Visitors may also fish, hunt, \nand camp in the forest, making it a popular weekend getaway or vacation \ndestination.\n  I had the privilege to team up with Ben by securing funds over the \nyears to help with the marijuana eradication operations on or near the \nnational forest land. Ben and his staff have worked in lockstep with \nthe local sheriff's departments, the Kentucky State Police, and the \nKentucky National Guard to identify and destroy marijuana plants. They \nhave done a terrific job, and I know that Ben's success will be carried \non by his successor.\n  After working for 32 years in the Forest Service, Ben plans to remain \nin Kentucky. His wife is active in their local community of Winchester, \nhis mother now calls Kentucky home, and his two children attend Western \nKentucky University. Ben's work ethic, dedication, and love of the land \nwill be greatly missed, but it is time for him to start a new chapter, \nand I wish Ben the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13334-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13334-S13335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING SGT. JOHN BASILONE, ``A PLAIN SOLDIER'' AND THREE OTHER MARINE \n                                LEGENDS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, on the 230th anniversary of the \nU.S. Marine corps, the U.S. Postal Service unveiled a long-awaited set \nof postage stamps honoring four of the corps' greatest heroes.\n  Today, a new generation of Americans are risking their lives to serve \nthis Nation. Nearly 2,100 Americans have died in Iraq, and more than \n15,000 others have been injured. It is important that we honor their \nsacrifices and the sacrifices of those who came before them. I would \nlike to take a few moments to talk about the four legendary marines \ncommemorated on the new stamps.\n  LTG John A. Lejeune is probably the best known of this fabled four. \nRegarded as ``the greatest of all leathernecks,'' Lieutenant General \nLejeune made history in World War I as the first marine to lead what \nwas predominantly an Army division. He was awarded the Distinguished \nService Medal from both the Army and the Navy, as well as the French \nLegion of Honor and the Croix de Guerre with Palm for his service \nduring World War I. He is best known, however, for his foresight and \ndetermination to enhance the Marine Corps by introducing specialized \namphibious assault capabilities into Marine Corps training. Marines \ntoday annually read his 1921 Birthday Message Order that summarizes the \nhistory, mission, and traditions of the Marine Corps.\n  LTG Lewis B. ``Chesty'' Puller rose through the ranks from private to \nbecome one of the Marine Corps' most celebrated leathernecks. His \ndistinguished service and leadership during critical battles in the `` \nBanana Wars,'' World War II, and the Korean War earned him five Navy \nCrosses and made him one of the most decorated marines ever. He led \nmarines in two of the Corps' most daring assaults: at Guadalcanal in \nWorld War II; and at Inchon in the Korean Conflict. He died in 1971 and \nis still revered in the Corps today for his courage in combat and his \nability to inspire confidence and loyalty and for the attention and \nrespect he showed to those under his command.\n  SGM Daniel J. Daly is one of only two marines to be awarded two \nMedals of Honor for separate acts of heroism. According to the \n``Historical Dictionary of the United States Marine Corps'', his \n``record as a fighting man remains unequalled in the annals of Marine \nCorps history'' nearly 70 years after his death. In 1900, Sergeant \nMajor Daly was sent to China, where he earned his first Medal of Honor \nduring the Boxer Rebellion. In 1915, he was sent to Haiti, where he \nearned his second Medal of Honor fighting off nearly 400 bandits. He \nsaw combat as a gunnery sergeant in France during World War I and was \nawarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the French Government's \nCroix de Guerre with Palm. He retired in 1929 and died in 1937, and \nremains a legend to all marines.\n  The fourth of the legendary marines honored on the new postage stamps \nis the only one the four killed in combat. One writer described him as \na ``big, handsome Marine with jug ears and a smile like a neon sign.'' \nGEN Douglas MacArthur called him ``a one-man Army.''\n\n[[Page S13335]]\n\n  Marine GySgt John Basilone was 1 of 10 children of an Italian-born \ntailor, Salvatore Basilone, and his wife Dora. He was born in Buffalo, \nNY and raised in Raritan, NJ.\n  He enlisted in the Army when he was 18 and served in the Philippines, \nwhere he picked up the nickname ``Manila John.'' He fought as a light \nheavyweight prizefighter in the Army, going undefeated in 19 fights. He \nreceived an honorable discharge after completing his 3-year enlistment, \nreturned home, and worked briefly as a truckdriver.\n  In July 1940, sensing war clouds on the horizon, John Basilone \nenlisted in the Marine Corps. In October 1942, he was serving with the \n1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division, on Guadalcanal. For 6 \nmonths, the Army and Marines had fought a bloody battle to hold a \ncritical airfield on that island. On October 24, GySgt John Basilone \nand 14 other marines were ordered to hold back many times that number \nof elite Japanese troops.\n  A private first class serving under him would later recall that, \n``Basilone had a machine gun on the go for three days and three nights \nwithout sleep.'' He fired machine guns, fixed guns, and crawled \nrepeatedly through Japanese lines to get more ammunition. When the sun \nrose the next morning, the marines still held the airfield, and John \nBasilone was credited by his men with giving them the will to fight on \nthe most terrifying night of their lives.\n  For his heroism at Guadalcanal, John Basilone was awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor and ordered home to take part in a war \nbonds tour. The tour brought in $1.4 million in pledges. He \ncrisscrossed the country, met Hollywood startlets, and even met his \nwife, another marine, at Camp Pendleton. He could have remained \nstateside for the remainder of the war but, he turned down the bars of \na second lieutenant because, he said, he didn't want to become ``a \nmuseum piece.'' In his words, ``I'm a plain soldier, and I want to stay \none.'' So just before Christmas 1944, he kissed his new wife goodbye \nand rejoined his ``boys'' in the Pacific.\n  On February 19, 1945, SGT John Basilone was serving with the 1st \nBattalion, 7th Marines, 5th Marine Division during the first day of the \ninvasion of Iwo Jima. He was on the island less than 2 hours when an \nenemy artillery round exploded, killing Basilone and four members of \nhis platoon. He had just destroyed an enemy blockhouse, enabling the \nmarines to capture another critical airfield. On his left arm were \ntattooed the words ``Death before Dishonor.'' John Basilone was 27 \nyears old.\n  He was awarded the Navy Cross and Purple Heart posthumously, making \nhim the only enlisted marine in World War II to be awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor, the Navy Cross, and the Purple Heart. He \nwas also awarded the American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign \nMedal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, \nPresidential Unit Citation with Star, and Presidential Unit Citation \nwith Bar.\n  After the war, John Basilone was reburied at Arlington National \nCemetery. In 1949, the USS Basilone, a destroyer, was commissioned in \nhis honor. Today, a life-sized bronze statue of him watches over his \nhometown of Raritan, NJ, and in 1981, Raritan began a parade in his \nhonor. It remains the only parade in the Nation dedicated to the memory \nof one veteran.\n  The National Italian American Foundation, the Order of the Sons of \nItaly of America, the Sergeant John Basilone Foundation, and veterans \nand marines organizations worked long and hard to see this ``plain \nsoldier,'' as John Basilone called himself, included among the marine \nheroes honored on the new stamps. We thank them for helping to make a \nnew generation of Americans aware of the service and sacrifices of this \nson of an Italian immigrant, a true American hero.\n  When he died, The New York Times noted in an editorial that there \nalways had been Americans like John Basilone, willing to fight for \ntheir country even when they knew their luck wouldn't last. ``The \nfinest monument they could have,'' the newspaper said, ``would be an \nenduring resolve by all of us to this time fashion an enduring peace.''\n  Let us never forget how much we owe John Basilone and all those who \nhave given so much, over so many generations, so that we can live free.\n  .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13335-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   PRIVATE FIRST CLASS DUSTIN YANCEY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I address the Senate in tribute to \nPFC Dustin Yancey, originally from Cedar Rapids, IA and more recently \nfrom Goose Creek, SC. Private First Class Yancey was tragically killed \non November 7, 2005 during Operation Iraqi Freedom. His Humvee was \nstruck by an improvised explosive device and both Private First Class \nDustin Yancey and Captain James M. Gurbisz were killed. Private First \nClass Yancey served with the 26th Forward Support Battalion, 2nd \nBrigade, 3rd Infantry Division based in Fort Stewart, GA. He was only \n22 years old.\n  I ask that the Senate, the people of Iowa, and all Americans stand \ntoday and recognize the sacrifice that Private First Class Yancey made \nyearlier this month. Our country has survived throughout the centuries \ndue to the brave men and women who have composed our Armed Forces, and \nI am saddened to announce to the Senate that another of our bravest \nwill be buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  We could all learn from the patriotism and spirit of Private First \nClass Yancey. His cousin, Brian Yancey of Cedar Rapids, IA, remembered \nthat Private First Class Yancey ``was very much a patriot, very much a \nmilitary man. He was a person who wanted to do what he could for his \ncountry.''\n  We must remember Private First Class Yancey's family, in both Georgia \nand Iowa, and stand with them during this time of loss and grief. The \nthoughts and prayers of countless Americans go out to Private First \nClass Yancey's family and friends. He did not die in vain, but rather \ngave his life for the promotion of freedom and security around the \nworld. He will be sorely missed, but will also be an inspiration for \nfuture brave Americans for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13335-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13335-S13336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL SERVING IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues \nanother positive story from a member of the U.S. Armed Forces currently \nserving in Iraq. His story, once again, depicts the frustration that so \nmany of our servicemembers have with the lack of public attention in \nthe U.S. to the humanitarian and military successes of their work in \nIraq.\n  I recently received a letter in the mail from Ms. Ann Sensenich of \nBoiling Springs, PA. Ms. Sensenich wrote to me:\n\n       Dear Mr. Santorum: Enclosed is a copy of a letter I \n     received from one of our soldiers serving our country in \n     Iraq. I am forwarding this to you as I feel this is a letter \n     that should not be viewed by only my eyes.\n       I have been sending packages to my employer's son in Iraq \n     and he forwards them on to his soldiers and this is one of \n     the responses I received.\n       Please share this letter with anyone you feel would \n     appreciate the service of this and all our U.S. soldiers \n     defending our country and keep in mind he indicated he would \n     go back seven times before he would let terrorists on our \n     soil.\n       Thank you for reading this and please share his words with \n     others.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Ann B. Sensenich.\n\n  Attached to Ms. Sensenich's correspondence is the letter that a \ndeployed servicemember wrote to her when her package was shared with \nfellow servicemembers. He wrote:\n\n       Dear Ann Sensenich, I am deployed with the 3/3 ACR. We \n     received your package, and I just wanted to take a little bit \n     of my time to say thanks.\n       Your package helped with the morale of a lot of soldiers. \n     Due to the negative feedback we get from the media and people \n     back home, it is nice to receive a package from someone who \n     supports us and what we do.\n       People like you are the reason why we fight this war. We \n     sit over here day to day risk getting shot at or having \n     mortar rounds dropped in on us so that the people back home \n     (like yourself) can keep on enjoying the freedoms that a lot \n     of people take for granted everyday. I, myself used to take \n     those things for granted also until I was deployed to fight \n     for our freedom.

I just wanted you to know that your \n     package that you sent did not go unnoticed.\n\n  Mr. President, these stories need to be told. Our soldiers are \nsacrificing their lives for us; they are putting themselves in harm's \nway each and every day over there, and missing valuable time with their \nfamilies and loved ones. They need to know that we support them, and \nthat their bravery and hard work is not going unnoticed.\n  We cannot allow critics here in the United States to influence the \nmentality of our troops. They need to know that we stand with them and \nthat we support their invaluable mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13336-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13336-S13337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR U.S. AGRICULTURE IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS?\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, our top U.S. trade negotiators traveled \nthis week and last in Europe, Africa, and Asia. They are making a \nconcerted effort to encourage certain influential countries among our \n148 trading partners in the World Trade Organization to put meaningful \nagricultural offers on the table in Geneva. We are coming down to the \nwire in the most recent round of multilateral trade negotiations, \nreferred to as the Doha Development Round. The offers that our trading \npartners put on the table in the next month or two are the starting \npoint for agricultural negotiators. That deal in agriculture will be \ncombined with the results of similar negotiations in the manufacturing \nand services sectors of the economy. Together, they constitute the \noutcome of the round that has been going on for the last 4 years. \nWithout a deal in agriculture, however, the Doha Development Round will \nfalter.\n  While bilateral trade agreements are beneficial to U.S. exporters, it \nis through multilateral negotiations that across-the-board tariff \nreductions can be achieved. That is why the Doha Development Round is \nso crucial.\n  The agricultural negotiations are significant to all of us \nrepresenting states with agricultural constituencies. In the case of \nPennsylvania, production agriculture generated $4 billion in cash \nreceipts in 2003, according to USDA statistics. That's $4 billion for \nthe producers of livestock and commodities in my State. Pennsylvania \ngenerates only 2 percent of agricultural cash receipts received by \nproducers nationwide, so you can imagine how important agriculture is \nto the 31 States with larger agricultural economies. Then there is the \nadded value to the Pennsylvania economy of further processing and \nmanufacture of food products and their export. Virtually every State \nhas a stake in these negotiations.\n  The producers of U.S. food and fiber no longer are producing for the \nU.S. market alone. Those days are gone forever. Our farmers are part of \nthe global economy. In fact, because they are so efficient, they \nproduce in excess of what the U.S. can consume and must gain access to \nglobal markets to expand sales opportunities.\n  Yet many markets overseas remain closed to U.S. producers because of \nhigh tariffs applied against U.S. exports. Particularly egregious are \nthe tariffs imposed by the European Union and Japan among developed \neconomies and by certain developing countries such as India and Brazil, \nwhere they continue to claim developing status despite making major \nadvances in certain sectors of their economies.\n  These issues have been discussed at the WTO during the past 4 years \nof the current Doha Development Round, with little movement in \nagriculture. In an effort to move the round forward, the U.S. last \nmonth put forth in Geneva an aggressive proposal to jumpstart the \nstalled negotiations. Since U.S. tariffs already are low compared to \nour trading partners, there was little the U.S. could offer in market \naccess to encourage comparable reductions. So the U.S. proposed to pull \nback its own domestic subsidies in exchange for significant cuts by our \ntrading partners in the tariffs protecting their market access.\n  The rationale behind the offer is that U.S. producers are so \nefficient that they require minimal domestic subsidies, as long as they \nhave unfettered access to expanding markets. Those markets increasingly \nare found overseas where the increased prosperity of growing middle \nclasses demands the kind of dietary diversity and convenience we have \nlong enjoyed. U.S. producers and food manufacturers can supply both \nthat diversity and convenience and supply it year in and year out.\n  But not all agriculture is as efficient as that in the U.S. Rather \nthan improve efficiency, some countries protect producers excessively \nwith high tariff barriers to market access. And they are not \nforthcoming with offers of significance to begin the process of \nreducing those barriers. Frankly, there isn't much time left. The round \nends at the end of 2006, and the initial offers for negotiation should \nbe on the table this December at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting so \nnegotiators are able to assemble the final package of tariff reductions \nand subsidy cuts in the next year. They will need every minute to do \nso.\n  After last week in Europe, the Secretary of Agriculture and the U.S. \nTrade Representative were far from optimistic that the Hong Kong \nministerial meeting would grapple with the type of formulas to be used \nin cutting tariffs or with the number of ``sensitive'' products that \ncountries could declare protected behind a high tariff.\n  And what happens if there is no agreement or a face saving agreement \nwith minimal substance? That's what worries me and should worry \nAmerican farmers. U.S. production agriculture has been a partner in the \ninternational effort of our trade negotiators to gain market access. \nBut how long can the partnership last if the round fails? Where do \nfarmers and ranchers put their efforts if the latest round of \nnegotiations fails to live up to its promise?\n  The European Union, for example, insists that dairy is sensitive and \ndeserves special protection. How can the dairy farmers of the U.S. be \nconvinced that overseas market access is the key to increased \nprofitability if the European market remains unavailable behind high \ntariff walls? I am concerned that agriculture will lose patience with \nthe trade negotiation process and return to familiar domestic farm \nprograms to augment its income because the world market could not. What \ndo responsible Members of Congress do then, facing the kind of fiscal \nconstraints we do in 2006, just as existing farm programs expire?\n  There is real potential under those circumstances for backlash. \nTestimony by commodity groups earlier this month in the House has \ntelegraphed that already. Wheat, corn, and soy producers all expressed \nreservations at the degree of ambition and commitment to trade \nliberalization shown by U.S. trading partners, particularly \nthe European Union and the G-20 group of developing nations, as \nevidenced by their counter proposals to the U.S. proposal in the WTO. \nU.S. producers are savvy. They see the inadequacy of those offers by \nour trading partners and have no intention of venturing too far in the \ndirection of liberalized trade alone without a very strong safety net. \nThe weaker the commitment to reform among our trading partners, as \nevidenced by the degree of success in the Doha Development Round, the \nmore expensive will be the net required by our producers. That's bad \nnews for those in Congress wishing to lead their agricultural producers \ntoward a more productive and profitable model based on increased \nmarkets overseas, where 95 percent of the world's consumers live.\n\n  A recent study by Australia, a leading member of the Cairns Group of \ntrade-liberalizing nations within the WTO, underscores the potential \nloss if the more robust proposal of the U.S. in the WTO is not \nrealized. Australia's agricultural economics bureau, ABARE, estimates \nthe U.S. proposal would deliver an extra $17.5 billion in gross income \nper year to U.S. farmers from increased exports. Much of that increase \nwould flow to producers of meat and fruit and vegetables, who would \nbenefit from increased market access. In fact, the U.S. proposal would \nbenefit all efficient producers in the world, according to ABARE.\n  This is not the time to accept less than the U.S. proposal in the \nnegotiations. ABARE estimates the European Union proposal would yield \nonly about $3 billion, barely enough to account for\n\n[[Page S13337]]\n\nassumption variables in the study, and it would continue to protect a \nnumber of its product lines where the U.S. stands to gain the most from \nmarket access. The proposal of the G-20 group would yield an extra $7.5 \nbillion per year, a bare minimum.\n  Moreover, the benefit to U.S. production agriculture from increased \nearnings under the U.S. proposal would provide latitude for writers of \nthe next farm bill to adjust domestic programs to accommodate two \nimportant realities. Some of our domestic programs have been ruled \ntrade-distorting under the WTO. Ultimately we will have to reform these \nprograms. Either we change our farm programs now by negotiation in the \nWTO where we can get something in return for them, or we will be forced \nto change them by litigation by which we don't get anything for them. \nHere is the perfect opportunity, where we can gain market access and \nincome to offset changes made domestically.\n  The second reality is the cost of farm programs. That cost may not \nseem like much in years of little budget competition. But today we are \nin a budgetary climate where any policy that depends on government \nfinancing is subject for review. There is strong competition for public \noutlays, and an effort to reduce the deficit places new scrutiny on all \nprograms.\n  We all have just experienced the budget reconciliation process in \nCongress. In agriculture, we were obligated to find $3 billion worth of \nsavings to accommodate budget targets. That is just the beginning, and \nwe are well advised to know the alternatives available to us to make \nadjustments in important programs in advance of the need. This WTO \nnegotiation provides the U.S. with the opportunity to convert its \naggressive proposal for reform into real income for farmers and \nagribusiness. For instance, if the U.S. program crops like wheat, corn, \nrice, and soybeans continue to be under pressure in the WTO for the \nportions of their domestic subsidy programs that ``distort'' trade, the \nadvent of the next farm bill provides us a chance to convert supports \nfor those crops into a format that conforms to WTO guidelines. In \nreturn, we gain the market access from our trading partners to sell \nthem U.S. fruit and vegetables, meat and dairy products, and other \nspecialty crops not previously allowed into their markets in sufficient \nquantity.\n  If we don't succeed in opening those opportunities for U.S. \nagriculture, we will have nothing with which to persuade our producers \nto give up the expensive domestic subsidies to which they have become \naccustomed. Another expensive, non-innovative, and divisive farm bill \nmight unfortunately be the result. Mr. President, a great deal is \nriding on the success of the Doha Round.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13337-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REPRESENTATIVE JOHN MURTHA'S SPEECH\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

The administration should have had one before the \nwar.\n  As I and other Members of Congress consistently requested before \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, OIF, began, it was imperative for the \nadministration to have a plan for both entering and, now more \nimportantly, for exiting Iraq. We are 2 years into OIF with no clear \nend in sight. There is no excuse for not having one now.\n  We must provide the Iraqi people with the tools necessary to stand on \ntheir own. Only the Iraqi people can rebuild Iraq. Only the Iraqi \npeople can defend Iraq. We cannot do it for them. We cannot want it \nmore than they want it. What we must do is provide them with the means \nto accomplish this, but what we are unable to do is to give them the \nwill.\n  Whether we leave Iraq tomorrow, or in 6 months, or longer, the \nPresident needs to tell the American people when and how we will be \nable to withdraw our troops. We cannot afford to lose more Americans in \nIraq.\n  John Murtha is a great patriotic American. His service in the \nmilitary and in the U.S. Congress cannot be measured. Those who \ndisparage him tarnish only themselves.\n  Everyone who knows John Murtha knows that he believes in his heart \nand soul in the American military and he will do everything he can to \nhelp them. He should be listened to for what he has done, for who he \nis, and because he is right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13337-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL SECURITY PERSONNEL SYSTEM REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am very disappointed with the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense and Office of Personnel Management's final \nregulations for the National Security Personnel System, NSPS, that will \naffect more than 350,000 defense civil service employees throughout our \nNation. What makes the new system dangerous is that upon a cursory \nglance, it would almost appear ``acceptable'' in the name of national \nsecurity. Scratch the surface, however, and it becomes very alarming.\n  The rhetoric does not match reality. U.S. Defense Secretary Donald \nRumsfeld in public testimony stated that these new regulations ``would \nnot end collective bargaining,'' but, rather, would ``bring collective \nbargaining to the national level'' to avoid duplication and \ninefficiency. This has not occurred, nor do I believe there is a \nsincere interest in the Pentagon to pursue national collective \nbargaining. In fact, I would suspect that the Pentagon's plan is just \nthe opposite--to substantially remove from the table the number of \nsubjects for good faith collective bargaining.\n  For this reason, I am pleased that the employee unions have gone to \nFederal court to challenge the regulations, in the same fashion that \nthey challenged the Department of Homeland Security regulations. I hope \nthey will prevail in their call for injunctive relief, as they did in \nthe Homeland Security case, as well as to prevail in the final \ndisposition of both cases.\n  While I would be the first to say that the Federal civil service \nsystem is not perfect, it is a system that has withstood the test of \ntime as fair and impartial. To overhaul it in favor of vesting the \nsubjective power to hire, fire, discipline and promote in the hands of \na few political appointees is very dangerous. At this point, the \n``seemingly acceptable'' national security rationale for the wholesale \nstripping of employees' rights fast begins to lose its luster. It is no \nlonger reasonable. There seems to me to be an inherent conflict. In the \nname of national security, this administration is willing to deny its \nown workers a small modicum of security--employment and family \nsecurity--especially when I do not believe it is necessary to achieve \nour goal of national security. I call into question the motivations \nbehind their actions.\n  My position on the Pentagon's issuance of the NSPS regulations is \nwhat I believe any decent fellow would say: Now is the time for our \nNation to come together in support of our armed services abroad. To do \nso, we must stand behind our civilian defense workforce from whom we \nare demanding great productivity in support of our troops.\n  Now is not the time to be divisive and punitive of our Federal \nworkforce. It creates low morale, mistrust, and a decreasing level of \nrespect between worker and management. The consequences stemming from \nsuch instability, could be dire. For me, the stakes in terms of human \nlives are too high to be taking such a gamble. United we stand--\ncivilian and military together. Divided we could fail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13337-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13337-S13338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of my amendment \nNo. 2528, unanimously adopted into the National Defense Authorization \nAct for fiscal year 2006, to provide targeted size standard relief for \nsmall U.S. contractors incurring extraordinary security and protection \ncosts on foreign battlefields in the global war on terror.\n  Right now, in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are many brave, small \ncontracting businesses working alongside our uniformed soldiers in many \ncases. Employees of these small contracting firms get shot at and \nencounter roadside bombs, suicide attacks, ambushes, and kidnapings. \nYet, in order to provide our military with desperately needed goods and \nservices, these small\n\n[[Page S13338]]\n\nbattlefield firms diligently endure these daily risks.\n  These daily dangers force small conflict zone firms to hire well \narmed, private security guards, and to incur extraordinary security \nexpenses in order to protect their employees. The violence towards \ncivilian contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan has become so prevalent \nthat the government often requires companies to provide security \nservices, and treats these extraordinary security costs as reimbursable \ncontractor expenses. These security expense reimbursements do not \nincrease or expand small contracting firms' core business capabilities. \nInstead the money the government pays to small battlefield contractors \nfor security expenses is passed directly through to the security \nsubcontractor providing protection to the small firms' employees.\n  Unfortunately, the Government's valid reimbursement of conflict-zone \nsecurity expenses artificially inflates the size of many small \nbattlefield firms causing them to out grow the Small Business \nAdministration's small businesses size standards. It is important to \nunderstand that the SBA size standards were established on the basis of \nnormal revenues for small businesses operating in North America. But, \ncurrently, these domestic size standards are penalizing our small \ncontractors operating outside the U.S. and in war zones by eliminating \ntheir ability to obtain crucial small business contracts and loans once \nthey exceed the domestic standards.\n  Our most reliable and dependable small battlefield firms, because \nthey operate overseas, are.in danger of artificially outgrowing the \nSBA's domestic size standards. Not only does this artificial growth \nhurt small business ability to survive, it also harms the U.S. \nGovernment's ability to secure contracts for much needed goods and \nservices that are used to support our troops in war zones. This \nultimately reduces the Federal Government's access to experienced small \ncontractors and hampers the Government's efforts to comply with the \nGovernment's annual statutory small business contracting goals.\n  My amendment directs the SBA to conduct a study and provide a report \nto Congress on the fairness of exempting reimbursement for subcontracts \nfor private security services from the size standards caps applicable \nto small firms that perform contracts and subcontracts on overseas \nbattlefields. I urge my colleagues to support our small battlefield \ncontractors currently in harms' way by retaining this important \namendment in the Defense authorization conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13338-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13338-S13339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SCIENCE, STATE, JUSTICE, AND COMMERCE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, earlier this week the Senate passed the \nconference report accompanying H.R. 2862, the Science, State, Justice \nand Commerce Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2006.\n  As the ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, \nJustice, and Science, I rise today to explain how this legislation is \ncritical to spurring economic innovation in our Nation and how the bill \nprotects communities and saves lives and livelihoods.\n  I believe this appropriations bill is an important step in making our \ncountry more competitive in the global economy. The future of our \neconomic security as well as our national security will depend upon our \nability to innovate. This bill is a major Federal investment in \ninnovation through science and technology, and it will help make \nAmerica stronger by investing in our future.\n  Innovation begins with basic research. H.R. 2862 funds the National \nScience Foundation, NSF, at $5.6 billion, a $180 million increase over \nlast year.\n  The key to innovation is investing in basic research in the physical \nsciences- biology, chemistry, physics and the cutting edge \ninterdisciplinary initiatives in nanotechnology, biotechnology and \ninformation technology. The National Academy of Sciences, the Council \non Competitiveness, and numerous other organizations have all called \nfor a substantial increase in our investment in basic scientific \nresearch. This bill makes a downpayment on that investment.\n  The technology of tomorrow will create the jobs of tomorrow. But if \nwe don't invest in research, the technology and the jobs will go \noverseas.\n  But it is not just about investing in research, we also have to \ninvest in education. This bill preserves funding for graduate student \nstipends at $30,000 per year. NSF funds critical programs to improve \nthe teaching of math and science and to improve science and math \ncurriculum in our schools. We must increase the number of math and \nscience teachers as well as the number of math and science students.\n  In addition, government and the private sector must work together to \nspur innovation in our economy. That is where the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, NIST, comes into play. NIST invests in new \ntechnologies that lead to new breakthroughs that create jobs to make \nour nation more competitive. NIST also sets industry standards so that \nAmerican business can be competitive abroad. H.R. 2862 funds NIST at \n$761 million, a $62 million increase over last year.\n  This legislation also funds other important agencies that are on the \ncutting edge of science and technology that can save lives and \ncommunities.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, is \nresponsible for the National Weather Service as well as critical \nresearch into oceans, fisheries and the Earth's atmosphere.\n  For NOAA, we have provided $3.9 billion, a $20 million increase over \nlast year. Whether it is warning us about severe weather so we can \nsecure our property and get out of harm's way, or helping to restore \nour fisheries that are so critical to our economy, NOAA saves lives and \ncommunities every day.\n  In space, this appropriations bill fully funds the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, and the cutting edge \nscientific and technological research that only NASA can do.\n  For NASA, we have provided $16.4 billion, which is a $260 million \nincrease over last year. This includes $271 million for the Hubble \nSpace Telescope, $50 million over the President's budget request to \naccommodate a servicing mission to Hubble, should the Administrator \ndetermine that the space shuttle is safe to use.\n  The servicing of Hubble will involve replacing batteries, gyroscopes \nand installing new scientific instruments to make Hubble more powerful \nthan ever. Hubble is the very symbol of innovation and discovery that \nare hallmarks of America's space program.\n  We continue our investment in the Mars program and fully fund the \nnext generation of launch vehicles to replace the space shuttle.\n  All major science programs are funded at the President's request \nlevel or higher including the Living With A Star program which is \ncrucial to understanding the Sun's effects on the Earth.\n  While NSF, NOAA, NIST and NASA are all integral to our nation's \nability to innovate, along with our other federal agencies, it is the \nprivate sector that is responsible for most of the innovation that \ndrives our economy.\n  The Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, plays a central role in \nprotecting our nation's valuable intellectual property. The PTO has a \nbacklog of applications waiting to be processed. H.R. 2862 funds the \nPTO at a record $1.7 billion, a 30 percent increase over last year.\n  This record increase will go a long way towards helping the PTO \nreduce the backlog of patent applications so we can properly protect \nour intellectual property and maintain our competitiveness.\n  But as we invest in our future, this legislation also takes care of \nour day-to-day needs especially when it comes to protecting our \nneighborhoods and communities\n  In making our country safer, the Department of Justice is our front \nline. This bill provides $21 billion to the Justice Department, $800 \nmillion more than last year. The Justice Department accounts for almost \n50% of the entire bill. This includes funding for the FBI, DEA, ATF, \nU.S. Marshals, U.S Attorneys as well as the Federal Prison System.\n  The Justice Department provides assistance to our state and local law \nenforcement and help communities fight gang violence. It also protects \nus from terrorists and protects our neighborhoods and communities. \nSpecifically, the FBI will receive $5.7 billion in 2006,\n\n[[Page S13339]]\n\na $500 million increase over last year. Most of this increase has been \ndevoted to counterterrorism.\n  H.R. 2862 also increases funding to fight sexual predators who prey \nupon our children. The bill provides $48 million to continue and expand \nthe Missing and Exploited Children Program. It also funds a Cyber-\nTipline, an online resource where people can report leads and tips \nabout child sexual exploitation.\n  Finally, the bill provides $2.7 million for the FBI's innocent images \nprogram to investigate and capture child pornographers who use the \nInternet to prey on children.\n  In addition to sexual predators, gangs are becoming a growing local, \nregional, and national problem. We have provided increases to the ATF, \nU.S Attorneys and the FBI to help fight against gangs in our schools \nand communities.\n  Any anti-gang strategy must focus on three principles: prevention, \nintervention and suppression. In my own State of Maryland, in \nMontgomery and Prince George's Counties, and around the State, gangs \nare a growing problem.\n  This bill provides $2 million for Montgomery and Prince George's \nCounties to deal with gang violence and fund prevention programs. It \nalso provides another $2 million to combat gang violence and gang \nprevention programs around the State of Maryland. The purpose of this \nfunding is to bring federal resources to the local level to help stop \nand prevent further gang violence from afflicting our neighborhoods and \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, the President's budget cut state and local law \nenforcement by $1.4 billion. We were able to restore $1.1 billion of \nthat cut in this bill.\n  I know how important our local police are to fighting crime and \ngangs. Our local police are the first responders. If we were not \nsubjected to strict limits on spending that were imposed on us by the \nBudget Resolution, we would have provided additional funding for state \nand local law enforcement.\n  But with the need to increase funding for counterterrorism and \ncounterintelligence, plus the need to address the growing problems of \nboth methamphetamine abuse and regional and even international gang \nviolence, we had to make difficult choices, under very difficult \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. President, the Science, State, Justice, and Commerce \nAppropriations bill is about investing in science and technology to \nspur innovation in our economy, protecting our Nation, and saving \ncommunities, lives, and livelihoods.\n  Investments in innovation are critical so America will retain its \ncompetitiveness as well as its economic and national security. Through \nthe Department of Justice and its major law enforcement bureaus, we are \nincreasing our commitment to protecting children from sexual predators \nand making our neighborhoods and communities safer from gang violence \nand street crime.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues next year to continue \nthe progress we have made and increase our commitment to innovation, \nscience and technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13339-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13339-S13340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, winter is coming, and it could easily \nbecome a perfect storm of high energy prices, bitter cold, and too \nlittle heat for those in need.\n  Households heating primarily with natural gas will pay an average of \n$306 more this winter for heat, an increase of an incredible 41 percent \nover last year. Those relying primarily on oil for heat will pay $325 \nmore, an increase of 27 percent.\n  The poor, the elderly, and the disabled need our help and they need \nit now.\n  Wilhelmina Mathis is one example of what is happening to the most \nvulnerable in our society. Wilhelmina is 71 years old and lives alone. \nAll last winter she kept her thermostat set at 60 degrees to save \nmoney. She hopes the Federal Government will come through with more \nLIHEAP money. She says: ``I turn down the thermostat as low as I can \nand sometimes I turn it off and put on extra sweaters. I don't know how \nmuch longer I can keep doing this.''\n  We have tried four times this year to increase funds for LIHEAP, and \nall four times we were defeated by the overwhelming Republican majority \nwho voted in lock-step to reject it.\n  The failure of the Republican Congress to increase LIHEAP funds \ncontinues to put millions of our fellow citizens at risk. But the Bush \nadministration and the Republican Congress are telling the elderly, the \ndisabled, and children across America that it doesn't matter if they \nhave no heat this winter--they aren't a priority.\n  In fact, the Republican leadership is forcing us to make impossible \nchoices. Look at the Labor-HHS bill. The Republican leadership is \ntelling us that if we fund LIHEAP, we must cut health care for seniors, \ncut education for our children, cut essential job training funds for \npeople trying desperately to enter the workforce and attain a level of \nself-sufficiency.\n  It is unconscionable. Why are we being forced to help one family at \nthe expense of another? We must increase LIHEAP funds and fight against \ncuts to other essential health, education, and labor programs. It is \ntime for Congress to stand up for the American people. We tell them we \nhear them and understand their struggle, now it is time to put our \nmoney where our mouth is. We need to stop the rhetoric and take action. \nThe American people deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the amendment \noffered yesterday by the Senator from Rhode Island to the tax \nreconciliation bill. This amendment addresses a concern that is on the \nmind of many Wisconsinites as winter quickly approaches--the increased \ncost of home heating.\n  The timing of this amendment could not be more relevant. Last week, \nexecutives from several major oil companies attempted to defend their \nrecord-breaking profits over the last quarter, in a hearing before the \nSenate Commerce and Energy Committees. Despite their efforts, they were \nunable to provide adequate answers. More importantly, they were unable, \nor unwilling, to provide solutions that would ease the burden on \nAmerican consumers.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that while prices at the pump \nhave declined slightly, we are not yet in the clear. Winter is just \naround the corner, and with colder temperatures comes higher heating \nbills. I know my constituents in Wisconsin are worried not only about \nthe costs of filling their cars, but also the costs of heating their \nhomes. As the profits of these oil companies continue, what answers can \nI provide to these constituents, these hard-working Americans, about \nhow they will pay their heating bills?\n  I believe the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island was a first \nstep towards offering my constituents some piece of mind when it comes \nto heating their homes. This amendment would have created a temporary, \n1-year levy on the excess profits of U.S. oil companies to provide \n$2.92 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. \nBecause this would only be in place for 1 year, and only effect profits \nmade in 2005, this amendment would have no effect on gas prices or do \nanything to increase dependence on foreign oil. The amendment offered a \nsimple, short-term solution that would provide real help to those who \nwill need it most, when the temperature starts to drop.\n  The Energy Information Administration has forecasted significantly \nincreased home heating costs this winter. For those using home heating \noil, the average increase in price will be $325 over last year. While \nthat might not be much to the oil executives, I can assure you that it \ncould mean going without heat for some families in Wisconsin. I believe \nit is the responsibility of the Federal Government to protect consumers \nwhen the market fails to do so.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the amendment failed in last night's \nvote. I assure my constituents that I will continue to work towards a \ncomprehensive solution to high heating costs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am pleased to voice my support for the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and for the Reed amendment \nthat I cosponsored to S.2020, the tax reconciliation bill. The Reed \namendment would have fully funded LIHEAP in fiscal year 2006 and would \nhave paid for the increased funding with a temporary tax on the \nwindfall profits of major oil companies.\n\n[[Page S13340]]\n\n  The Senate fiscal year 2006 Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations bill took an important first step toward \nproviding adequate LIHEAP funds by including $2.183 billion for the \nprogram for next fiscal year. This is a good starting point.\n  However, $2.183 billion represents only a very slight increase over \nfiscal year 2005 levels and is likely not enough to meet the needs of \nLIHEAP beneficiaries in the coming winter.\n  For this reason, I have worked to find ways to increase funding for \nthe LIHEAP program and to do so in a manner that is fiscally \nresponsible. The Reed amendment would have added $2.92 billion to the \nLIHEAP program and paid for this increase by taxing the windfall \nprofits of major oil companies.\n  Some have criticized this windfall profits tax. Yet I believe that a \ntemporary, limited tax on the windfall profits of energy companies is a \nreasonable way to help the least fortunate among us pay for their home \nenergy needs.\n  Indeed, I believe that the country's oil producers can afford to help \npay for LIHEAP. Last month they posted record profits. ExxonMobil \nreported that their profits rose 75 percent, and in just 3 months they \nmade $9.92 billion in profit. Similar record profits have been reported \nby all of the major integrated oil companies. Some of this increase in \nprofit is due to oil prices that started to rise this summer even \nbefore Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the gulf coast. After the \nhurricanes, though, the price of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other \nrefined oil products soared.\n  Our Nation is still struggling to recover from the disasters along \nthe gulf coast. All Americans have had to make sacrifices as a result. \nThis winter the country is facing another crisis, record energy prices \nand associated increased household heating bills.\n  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, consumers \nwho heat their homes with natural gas prices--about 55 percent of U.S. \nhouseholds--are expected to see their heating bills rise by 48 percent \nthis winter. Those who heat with oil will pay 32 percent more, those \nwho heat with propane will pay 30 percent more, and those who heat with \nelectricity will pay 5 percent more.\n  These increases will take the greatest toll on the least fortunate \namong us. Low-income Americans will have a harder time heating their \nhomes and may turn their heat down dangerously low in hopes of being \nable to pay their monthly bills.\n  That is why the LIHEAP program is so important. LIHEAP provides vital \nhome energy assistance to low-income families to help them weatherize \ntheir homes and pay their energy bills.\n  The Reed amendment would have asked the oil companies that have \nprofited so much from recent rising energy prices to help ease the \nburden of this winter's high prices.\n  I am pleased with the approach taken by the Reed amendment because I \nbelieve that we should try to pay for increases in spending. I have \nbeen uncomfortable supporting some previous amendments to increase \nfunding for the LIHEAP program because they did not find a way to pay \nfor the increased spending.\n  Senator Reed has found a way not only to fully fund this vital \nprogram, but to pay for it as well.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Reed's amendment was not accepted by the full \nSenate during consideration of the tax reconciliation bill. The \namendment needed 60 votes to overcome a point of order and received \nonly 50.\n  We will keep trying though.\n  The LIHEAP program serves a vital function in helping as many as 5 \nmillion low-income households who need a bit of help paying their \nenergy bills or weatherizing their homes. I'm pleased to have been a \ncosponsor of the Reed amendment and I will continue to look for ways to \nincrease funding for the LIHEAP program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13340-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTERNET GOVERNANCE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the \nresolution I submitted and which was approved by unanimous consent on \nthe Senate floor this week, in support of the President's position on \nInternet governance at the U.N. Summit on the Information Society. I \nthank the cosponsors on this resolution: Senators Stevens, Inouye, \nLeahy, Smith, Sununu, Bill Nelson, Hutchison, Inhofe and Craig. And I \nalso acknowledge Senator Coleman for all his good work on this issue.\n  No one can really control the Internet. It is not supposed to be \ncontrolled. It is an architecture, literally and figuratively, of \nfreedom--freedom of information, of speech, of interconnection, of \nreligion. Because the Internet was developed and commercialized in the \nUnited States, it reflects those core American values, and boosts them \nall around the world. And the United States should be proud of the way \nit has handled the growth of the Internet--particularly in the way it \nhas kept the private sector experts in charge, and government \nbureaucrats out.\n  I have been particularly concerned the status of the Internet \nCorporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN, the private, expert \nbody that oversees and manages the Internet's Domam Name System. This \nis the ``plumbing'' that makes each Internet site unique and keeps the \nInternet a global unitary network. The United States created ICANN and \nits unique model of oversight, with the input of international \nstakeholders. And U.S. Government oversight of ICANN has been critical \nin making ICANN more responsive and more capable of carrying out its \nimportant technical mission. ICANN is not perfect. I have been critical \nof its shortcomings in the past, and will continue to do so in the \nfuture. But I strongly support its model of governance that leaves the \nprivate-sector experts in charge.\n  The preliminary news from the U.N. conference seems to be good. Some \nof the worst ideas, such as creating a new U.N. bureaucracy instead of \nICANN, or to direct ICANN, seem to have been avoided. But I will look \nclosely at the final results and make sure that nothing has been agreed \nto that could damage the Internet. I hope to hold a hearing in the \nCommerce Committee early next year about this, and I look forward to \nhearing the testimony of the key stakeholders at that time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13340-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13340-S13341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE SUCCESS OF THE 1994 BRADY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, statistics released last month by the \nDepartment of Justice indicate that the 1994 Brady Act has had a \nmeaningful impact on keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals. \nThe annual Bureau of Justice Statistics bulletin titled ``Background \nChecks for Firearms Transfers'' reveals that nearly 126,000 firearm \ntransactions to prohibited individuals were prevented in 2004 alone.\n  As my colleagues know, the 1994 Brady Act requires individuals \nseeking to acquire guns from a federally licensed firearms dealer to \nundergo a background check. This process requires the applicant to \nprovide a variety of personal information, which is not retained longer \nthan 4 days unless the person is prohibited by law from receiving or \npossessing firearms. The primary factors that disqualify individuals \nfrom receiving firearms include felony or domestic violence \nconvictions, identification as a fugitive or illegal alien, substance \nabuse, and serious mental illness. Unfortunately, membership in a known \nterrorist organization does not automatically disqualify an applicant \nfrom receiving or possessing a firearm under current law. This is one \nof the loopholes in our gun safety laws that should be addressed by \nCongress.\n  The Department of Justice reports that since enactment of the 1994 \nBrady Act, more than 1.2 million applications for firearms transfers \nhave been rejected because disqualifying information was uncovered \nduring a background check of the applicant. Of the applications that \nwere rejected in 2004, 44 percent were rejected because the applicant \nhad been convicted of or was under indictment for a felony offense. In \naddition, 16 percent were rejected because of domestic violence \nconvictions or a related restraining order.\n  According to the Department of Justice statistics, almost 80 percent \nof the rejected applicants in 2004 had a serious criminal history, had \nbeen involved in domestic violence, or were identified as a fugitive. \nThis means that nearly 100,000 times last year, criminals and\n\n[[Page S13341]]\n\nknown domestic abusers were denied access to dangerous firearms because \nof background checks required by the 1994 Brady Act.\n  Unfortunately, not all firearms transactions are subject to a \nbackground check. The law requires background checks only for those \ntransactions that involve a federally licensed firearms dealer. \nAccording to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence ``two out of every five \nguns acquired in the United States; including guns bought at gun shows, \nthrough classified ads, and between individuals; change hands without a \nbackground check.'' The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence also estimates \nthat ``extending criminal background checks to all gun transactions in \nthe United States could prevent nearly 120,000 additional illegal gun \nsales every year.''\n  It is important that we do not infringe on the rights of law-abiding \ncitizens. However, with those rights in mind and protected, we should \nnot allow those with a violent or serious criminal record to acquire \ndangerous firearms. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \ncommonsense gun safety legislation, such as the 1994 Brady Act, that \nwill make our nation safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13341-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AIR FORCE ACADEMY\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, in an era when college football players \nare almost universally derided as troublemakers, stories about football \nplayers who become leaders and role models off the field are indeed \nhard to find. One such leader currently exists at the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy.\n  Earlier this week the Air Force Academy announced that Andy Gray, a \nsenior cadet, has been selected to take over as the commander of the \nentire 4,000-strong cadet wing next semester. In this position, Andy \nwill serve as the chief liaison between the academy's leadership and \nthe cadet student body, akin to a student body president.\n  However, Andy is different than the average student body president. \nHe has received extensive leadership training along with his fellow \ncadets. He has endured the rigorous cadet schedule of academics and \nmilitary training. And, he has done it all while excelling as a member \nof the NCAA Division One Air Force Academy Falcon football team.\n  Andy is only the sixth football player to be chosen for this \nleadership role, and the first in 16 years. The last academy athlete to \nserve as the cadet wing commander was Delavane Diaz who played \nvolleyball for the Falcons in 2003.\n  Andy Gray entered the academy in 2000 and played quarterback and \ndefensive safety for much of his cadet career. In the fall of 2004, he \nwas No. 1 on the depth chart as quarterback for the Falcons. This past \nseason he played safety and had a big interception in the Air Force \nAcademy's victory over UNLV.\n  Becoming a cadet wing commander is not easy and requires candidates \nto go through a rigorous screening process. Only the top two cadets \nfrom each of the academy's 35 squadrons are nominated to be considered. \nThen the pool is narrowed to 20. Each of the surviving candidates is \nclosely interviewed by a board that includes members of the academy's \nleadership.\n  I commend Andy for his selection to be the academy's cadet wing \ncommander. This selection is a real honor for him, and I know he will \nnot take his new responsibilities lightly. I wish Andy the best as he \ntakes up this important leadership position.\n  I also applaud the academy's football coach, Fisher DeBerry, for \nbeing such an outstanding role model for cadets like Andy. Coach \nDeBerry is a man of character who, for over 22 years, has turned \nhundreds of cadets into leaders while running a top-notch football \nprogram. I look forward to seeing in the future many more Academy \nfootball players become leaders in our Air Force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13341-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13341-S13342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE SITUATION IN NEPAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. It may seem strange that on a day when the Congress is \ndebating the budget resolution, I would be asking the Senate to turn \nits attention for a moment to the remote and tiny nation of Nepal.\n  I do so because for the past several years, a ruthless Maoist \ninsurgency and a corrupt, repressive monarchy have brought that \nimpoverished but breathtakingly beautiful country to the brink of \ndisaster. It is important for the Nepalese people to know that while \nthey may live half a world away, the difficulties they are facing have \nnot gone unnoticed by the U.S. Congress.\n  It has been almost 9 months since Nepal's King Gyanendra dismissed \nthe multiparty government, suspended civil liberties, and arrested the \nprime minister along with other opposition political leaders, human \nrights defenders, prodemocracy student activists, and journalists.\n  The king's explanation was that democracy had failed to solve the \nMaoist problem. He said that he would take care of it himself and then \nrestore democracy after 3 years.\n  It is true that Nepal's nascent democracy had not solved the Maoist \nproblem. Neither had the king. In the 4\\1/2\\ years since King Gyanendra \nassumed the throne and became commander in chief of the Nepalese army, \nthe Maoists have grown from a minor irritant to a national menace. \nWhile the Maoists use threats and violence to extort money and property \nand they abduct children from poor Nepalese villagers, the army often \nbrutalizes those same people for suspicion of supporting the Maoists. \nLike most armed conflicts, defenseless civilians are caught in the \nmiddle.\n  What the Nepalese people desire most is peace. Despite the king's \nautocratic maneuvers on February 1, many would have given him the \nbenefit of the doubt if he had a workable plan to quickly end the \nconflict. Nine months later, it is clear that he does not. One can only \nwonder why King Gyanendra thought that he could defeat the Maoists by \ndissolving the government, curtailing civil liberties, and surrounding \nhimself with a clique of elderly advisers from the discredited, \nfeudalistic Panchayat era.\n  The United States, Great Britain, and India criticized the king's \nactions and have urged him to negotiate with Nepal's political parties \nto restore democratic government. Unfortunately, although he has \nreleased most political prisoners and reinstated some civil liberties, \nthe king has increasingly behaved like a despot who is determined to \nconsolidate his own power.\n  In the meantime, the Maoists declared a ceasefire. The violence has \nreportedly decreased, although abductions and extortions have continued \napace. Whether the ceasefire is a sinister ploy or a sincere overture \nfor peace may never be known, however, because it is due to expire next \nmonth and neither the king nor the army has indicated a willingness to \nreciprocate.\n\n  Against this disheartening backdrop, the Congress, on November 10, \n2005, approved my amendment to impose new restrictions on military aid \nfor Nepal. On November 14, President Bush signed it into law. I want to \nbriefly review what we did, and why.\n  The amendment says that before the Nepalese army can receive U.S. \naid, the Secretary of State must certify that the Government of Nepal \nhas ``restored civil liberties, is protecting human rights, and has \ndemonstrated, through dialogue with Nepal's political parties, a \ncommitment to a clear timetable to restore multi-part democratic \ngovernment consistent with the 1990 Nepalese Constitution.''\n  This builds on an amendment that was adopted last year, which \nrequired the Secretary of State to certify that the Nepalese army was \nproviding unimpeded access to places of detention and cooperating with \nthe National Human Rights Commission, NHRC, to resolve security related \ncases of people in custody. Unfortunately, the Secretary was not able \nto make the certification. Not only were the NHRC's members replaced \nthrough a process that was contrary to Nepal's constitution, the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross suspended its visits to \nmilitary detention centers because it was denied the free access it \nrequires.\n  The Nepalese Government objects to any conditions on U.S. aid, \narguing that the army needs help to fight the Maoists. The army does \nneed help, but it also needs to respect the law and the rights of the \nNepalese people. The Congress took this action only after it could no \nlonger ignore the pattern of arbitrary arrests, disappearances, torture \nand extrajudicial killings by the army. The army's abusive conduct,\n\n[[Page S13342]]\n\ncoupled with the king's repressive actions since February 1, have \ncontributed to a political crisis that threatens not only the future of \ndemocracy but the monarchy itself.\n  Economic aid to support health, agriculture, hydropower, and other \nprograms through nongovernmental organizations is not affected by my \namendment. If the situation changes and the Secretary of State \ncertifies that the conditions in U.S. law have been met, military aid \ncan resume. But that alone will not solve the Maoist problem. The \nMaoists are expert at intimidating the civilian population and carrying \nout surprise attacks and melting back into the mountains. While they do \nnot have the strength to defeat the army, neither can they be defeated \nmilitarily.\n  The only feasible solution is through a democratic political process \nthat has the broad support of the Nepalese people. Perhaps seeking to \nplacate his critics, the king, without consulting the political \nopposition parties, announced municipal elections for February 8, 2006. \nNot surprisingly, the parties say they will not participate in an \nelectoral process dictated by the palace and when the army and the \nking's handpicked representatives have taken control of local affairs \nand are unlikely to relinquish power.\n  The U.S. Embassy is skeptical of the Maoists' intentions and has \npublicly discouraged the political parties from forging an agreement \nwith the Maoists. This is understandable, since the Maoists have used \nbarbaric tactics that should be universally condemned. But this \nconflict cannot be won militarily and the king has rejected a political \naccommodation with the country's democratic forces. He is imposing new \nrestrictions on the media and civil society, and he has spumed offers \nby the international community to mediate. Nepal's younger generation, \nwho see no role for the monarchy in Nepal's future, are taking to the \nstreets. It may not be long before the army is faced with a fateful \nchoice. Will it continue to side with the palace even if it means \nturning its weapons on prodemocracy protesters and facing international \ncensure, or will it cast its lot with the people?\n  It is a choice that we may also have to make. For the better part of \na year, the United States and others friends of Nepal, as well as many \nbrave Nepalese citizens, have tried to nudge the king back toward \ndemocracy. It has not worked. With the king increasingly imperious and \nisolated and the political parties already making overtures to the \nMaoists, what is to be lost by calling for the Maoists to extend the \nceasefire, for the army to reciprocate, for international monitors to \nverify compliance, and for representatives of all sectors of society \nwho support a democratic, peaceful Nepal to sit down at the negotiating \ntable?\n  There are no guarantees, but it would test the Maoists' intentions \nand it might create an opening for agreement on a democratic process, \nwith the support of international mediation, that can finally begin to \naddress the poverty, corruption, discrimination and other social ills \nthat have fueled the conflict. The people of Nepal, who for generations \nhave suffered far more than their share of hardship and injustice, \ndeserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13342-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last Tuesday the open enrollment period \nfor the Medicare Part D prescription drug program began. This program \nhas been praised by the administration as a great benefit for seniors, \nbut I can tell you that seniors are not so sure. According to a survey \nconducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 20 percent say they \nwill sign up. Over one-third say they won't, and the rest don't know \nwhat they are going to do.\n  One thing we do know for sure is that seniors are confused and \nscared. I have received over 4,000 letters from them telling me so. And \nwhy wouldn't they be. They have a series of complicated decisions to \nmake.\n  First, they have to decide whether they want drug coverage. Do they \nalready have drug coverage that is better or just as good as what is \noffered under the plan? And if they don't, do the costs of the plan \nexceed the benefits? And what will happen in the future? Should they \nsign up now to avoid the penalty for signing up late?\n  Second, if they do decide to join the program, what plan do they \nchoose? In California, 18 companies are providing 47 stand-alone \nprescription drug plans. These plans all have different premiums, \ncopays, and lists of drugs they will cover. For those in managed care \nplans, if they choose one of the stand-alone drug plans instead of \ntheir managed care plan, they will lose their health coverage.\n  In addition, seniors must make sure that their neighborhood pharmacy \naccepts the plan. Otherwise, they will end up having to find a new \npharmacy that is probably less convenient. And after all that, any plan \ncan--on 60 days notice--change the list of drugs it covers. Seniors, \nhowever, can change their plans only once a year.\n  If seniors do choose to participate, the benefit itself is meager. \nThere is a large coverage gap--the so-called donut hole--so seniors \nmust pay 100 percent of drug costs once they spend $2,250 and before \nthey spend $5,100. Moreover, there is nothing in the program that will \nactually lower the cost of prescription drugs, and, in fact, Medicare \nis expressly prohibited from negotiating for lower prices.\n  Mr. President, the seniors who are the sickest and poorest have the \nmost to lose with this new program. Those 6.1 million seniors are \neligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. They are known as dual \neligibles. Currently, State Medicaid programs cover their drug costs, \nbut as of January 1, they will be switched to the less generous \nMedicare program, and the States will be prohibited from using Medicaid \nto provide better coverage.\n  We need to make changes to the program now so that our seniors do not \nsuffer. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of several bills that will \nchange the harshest parts of this program. We must allow Medicare to \nnegotiate on behalf of seniors for lower drug prices. We must allow \nStates to use Medicaid to improve the drug coverage of the sickest and \npoorest seniors. We must end the coverage gap for all seniors. We must \nallow seniors more time to understand the program before they are \nrequired to enroll.\n  Mr. President, these changes are needed--and needed now. Without \nthem, the promise of a Medicare prescription drug benefit may turn out \nto be a hollow one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13342-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13342-S13343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION \n                                  ACT.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I was proud to serve on the Education \nCommittee when it recommended the original Education for the All \nHandicapped Children Act in 1975, and I am proud to join Senator Enzi \ntoday as a sponsor of this resolution, which recognizes the major \nimpact of the law on the lives of disabled children and their families \nacross the Nation, by guaranteeing the right of every disabled child to \na free public education.\n  We know that disabled does not mean unable. Children with \ndisabilities have the same dreams as every other child in America to \ngrow up and lead a happy and productive life. We know that IDEA helps \nthem fulfill that dream.\n  It says children cannot be cast aside or locked away because they \nhave a disability. Those days are gone in America--hopefully forever.\n  Children with disabilities have rights like every other child in \nAmerica, including the right to learn with other children in public \nschools and prepare themselves for the future.\n  But even as we celebrate 30 years of continuing success in the \neducation of disabled children, we continue to hear objections to the \nact's high cost, its paperwork, and the burden of litigation. Those are \nimportant considerations, but we can't let them overwhelm the vast \nbenefit of IDEA.\n  The act is about disabled children and their rights. It is about \ntheir hopes and dreams of living independent and productive lives. It \nis about parents who love their children and struggle for them every \nday against a world that is too often inflexible and unwilling to meet \ntheir needs. It is about teachers who see the potential inside a \ndisabled child, but don't have the support or training they need to \nfulfill it.\n  IDEA is our declaration as a nation that these children matter and \nthat we\n\n[[Page S13343]]\n\nwill do all we can to help their parents and teachers and communities \nachieve their education goals. That is why the government should make a \nclear commitment to provide adequate funds for special education. What \nis needed is a solid education plan for each child, a way to chart the \nchild's progress, and a way to hold schools accountable if they fall \nshort. That is not placing an unfair burden on schools. It is the \ncorrect expectation of a decent school system in America.\n  Brown v. the Board of Education struck down school segregation by \nrace and said that all children deserve equal access to education under \nthe Constitution. But it wasn't until the passage of the Education for \nthe Handicapped Act in 1975 that the Brown decision had real meaning \nfor children with disabilities.\n  Only then did we finally end school segregation by disability and \nopen the doors of public schools to disabled children. Only then did \nthe Nation's 4 million disabled children begin to have the same \nopportunities as other children to develop their talents, share their \ngifts, and lead productive lives.\n  We must never go back to the days when disabled children were denied \npublic education, when few if any preschool children with disabilities \nreceived services, and when the disabled were passed off to \ninstitutions and substandard schools to be kept out of sight and out of \nmind.\n  We have made immense progress since those days. Six and a half \nmillion children with disabilities now receive special education \nservices. Almost all of them--96 percent--are learning alongside their \nnondisabled fellow students.\n  The number of young children with early development problems who \nreceive childhood services has tripled in the past 30 years. More \ndisabled students are participating in State and national testing \nprograms. Graduation rates and college enrollment rates for disabled \nstudents are steadily rising.\n  The opportunities for further progress are boundless. We know far \nmore about disability today than a quarter century ago. We have much \ngreater understanding of childhood disabilities, and how to help all \nsuch children to learn and achieve. We are finding out more and more \neach year about the power of technology to enable these children to \nlead independent lives. It means they can communicate with others, \nexplore the world on the Internet, and move in ways we couldn't have \nimagined 5 years ago, much less in 1975 when the law was first enacted.\n  I hope all our colleagues will join us in recognizing the \nextraordinary role of IDEA in protecting the rights and broadening the \nopportunities available to children with disabilities. Let's work \ntogether to renew our commitment to IDEA and fulfill its great promise \nof hope for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13343-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13343-S13344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEDICATION AND OPERATION OF THE U.S. AIR FORCE \n                                ACADEMY\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I rise today to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the \ndedication and operation of the U.S. Air Force Academy, located in my \nhome State of Colorado. It has been a privilege for Colorado to host \nthe Academy for more than five decades. The Academy's outstanding \nrecord of turning cadets into officers of integrity and honor is a \nsource of pride for many in Colorado.\n  Yet sometimes when we drive on I-25 and pass the Air Force Academy's \nbeautiful campus, we assume that Academy has always been there. It is \neasy to forget the hard work it took to get the Academy to Colorado in \nthe first place\n  It all began in May of 1949 when then-Secretary of Defense James \nForrestal appointed a commission to evaluate the general education for \neach military service. This commission was chaired by Robert L. \nStearns, president of the University of Colorado and father-in-law of \nSupreme Court Justice Byron ``Whizzer'' White. The commission also \nincluded other notables such as GEN. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was then \npresident of Colombia University. The Stearns Board quickly agreed that \nthe U.S. Air Force needed an academic institution of excellence and \nthat such an Academy should be established without delay.\n  Congress authorized the creation of the Air Force Academy in 1954. To \ndetermine a site for the new institution, then-Secretary of the Air \nForce Harold E. Talbott, appointed a team of individuals to assist him. \nThe Air Force Academy Site Selection Board, as it was called, reviewed \nmore than 580 locations in 34 States, and narrowed the field down to 7, \n1 of which was Colorado Springs, CO. A year later, the majestic 14,000 \nacre area in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains near Colorado Springs \nwas chosen by Secretary Talbott to be the site for the new U.S. Air \nForce Academy.\n  The selection of the site, however, would prove to be easy part. The \ndesign and construction of the permanent location would take years to \ncomplete. In the meantime, the Air Force had to find an alternate site \nso classes and training could begin. Lowry Air Force Base in Denver \ntook on this mission and hosted the Academy until permanent buildings \ncould be constructed.\n  The Academy staff was activated in the summer of 1954 when LTG Hubert \nHarmon, who had previously served as special assistant for Air Force \nAcademy matters and was a member of the 1949 Air Academy Site Selection \nBoard, assumed command. President Eisenhower, a West Point classmate \nand close personal friend of General Harmon, personally selected him as \nthe first superintendent, stating ``Doodles'' Harmon would be the best \nman for the job.\n  The staff had only 11 months to prepare for the arrival of the first \nclass in the summer of 1955. Due to space limitations, only 306 young \nmen were admitted into the first class, the class of 1959. Thousands of \napplications were reduced to a few hundred, and those selected were \ntruly America's ``cream of the crop''.\n  Dedication Day began with the arrival of 306 young men on July 11, \n1955. The morning was spent processing such as fitting uniforms and \ngetting haircuts. By 11 a.m. they were all lined up for intensive drill \ninstruction. That afternoon, the stands were filled with over 4,000 \nmilitary and civilian dignitaries, public officials, foreign attaches, \ncadets from West Point and Annapolis, press, and parents. With a flight \nof B-36 bombers flying overhead and the USAF band playing, the 306 \ncadets marched on the field in a near perfect formation.\n  At the time no one could have predicted that this small class would \nturn out Rhodes Scholars, numerous general officers and even All-\nAmerican football players. Surprisingly, before they were to graduate, \nthey would lead their football team to an undefeated season and a tie \nin the 1959 Cotton Bowl, one of the most underrated achievements in the \nhistory of major college sports.\n  LTG Hubert Harmon retired with lung cancer before the first class \ngraduated in 1959. He will be remembered for his tireless work and \ndedication to the establishment of the Academy. He was the first person \ninterred at the Air Force Academy Cemetery and is recognized by many as \nthe ``Father of the Air Force Academy.''\n  Major General Briggs took over as the Academy's second \nsuperintendent, and during his tour of duty there, in 1958, the wing of \n1,145 cadets moved to its present site from Denver. A year later, the \nAcademy received its accreditation, and on March 3, 1964, the \nauthorized strength of the cadet wing was increased to 4,417. In 1976, \nwomen were admitted for the first time into the Academy. The first \nclass of women graduated in May 1980.\n  To date, more than 35,000 cadets have graduated from the Academy. The \nachievements of those who have graduated from the Academy have been \nmany: 315 of these graduates have become general officers, to include \nformer Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force, Generals Ronald Fogelman and \nMike Ryan, 32 cadets have been selected as Rhodes Scholars, and 539 \nhave entered medical school.\n  Even more important, 128 graduates have given their lives in the \ndefense of our Nation, and 36 have been prisoners of war. We honor \nthose who have served our Nation with such sacrifice and patriotism.\n  Over the years, the Air Force Academy has had to confront several \ndifficult challenges. The institution has risen above these challenges \nand, in its quest for excellence, has become a model for other academic \ninstitutions\n\n[[Page S13344]]\n\nto follow. The Air Force Academy continues to be recognized as an \ninvaluable proving ground for tomorrow's military leaders.\n  As we look back at the establishment of the Academy, we cannot help \nbut be thankful to those who worked so hard to establish the Academy in \nColorado. The citizens of Colorado are indeed honored to have this \ninstitution in our beloved State. We have stood by the Academy through \nboth the good and tough times. We in Colorado continue to believe in \nthe Academy's mission and support the institution's effort to train \nofficers of integrity and honor. We salute the Air Force Academy's 50 \nyears of success and look forward to many more decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13344-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13344-S13345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PREVENTING TAX INCREASES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to take some time to discuss the \nimportance of preventing tax increases that are scheduled to occur over \nthe next several years.\n  The budget resolution conference agreement reached in April provides \nreconciliation protection for $70 billion of tax reductions over 5 \nyears, with the direction that the allocation be used to prevent tax \nincreases during the budget window. This sent a signal to investors \nthat capital gains and dividends tax rates would be extended through \n2010. I am disappointed that the legislation approved by the Senate \ndoes not meet that expectation. Fortunately, the bill approved by the \nWays and Means Committee in the other body does, and I pledge to all \ninvestors that I will continue to work for that outcome. Indeed, the \nSenate majority leader pledged that he would not bring the bill back \nfrom conference without an extension of these investment tax rates. \nSimilarly, the administration released its Statement of Administration \nPolicy on the bill, which urged Congress to extend the lower rates for \ncapital gains and dividends, noting, ``These extensions are necessary \nto provide certainty for investors and businesses and are essential to \nsustaining long-term economic growth.''\n  The tax reconciliation bill is intended to prevent tax increases by \nextending ``widely applicable'' tax provisions. My colleagues might \nfind it interesting that more taxpayers benefit from the lower rates on \ndividends and capital gains than benefit from any of the provisions \nincluded in the tax reconciliation bill approved by the Senate. For \nexample, nationwide, fewer than 8 million filers were helped by the AMT \nhold-harmless provisions in 2003, while more than 30 million filers \nreported dividend income and more than 22 million reported capital \ngains Income.\n  Nationwide, 17 percent of all tax filers reported capital gains in \n2003, the most recent year for which statistics are available. Of all \nfilers reporting capital gains income in 2003, 30.1 percent had \nadjusted gross income under $30,000 compared to just 8.7 percent who \nhad AGI of $200,000 or more. In Arizona, 18 percent of all filers \nreported capital gains income, and of those reporting capital gains \nincome, 32 percent had AGI under $30,000.\n  The story is similar for tax filers reporting dividend income. \nNationwide, 23 percent of all filers reported dividend income in 2003. \nOf all filers reporting dividend income in 2003, 30.6 percent had AGI \nunder $30,000 compared to 6.9 percent who had AGI of $200,000 or more. \nIn Arizona, 22 percent of all filers reported dividend income and, of \nthose filers reporting dividend income, 32 percent had AGI under \n$30,000.\n  But beyond the number of taxpayers who have benefited directly, the \nmost important thing to know about these lower rates that were enacted \nin 2003 is that they are working. At the lower rates, the tax penalty \nimposed on the additional investment earnings--the reward from taking \non additional risk--is smaller, and thus makes the risk more \nattractive. When investors get to keep more of their reward, they are \nencouraged to invest more; with more investment, businesses have an \neasier time attracting the capital they need to expand, create new \ngoods and services, and also create more jobs. It is all of this \nadditional economic activity that creates economic growth.\n  All Americans have benefited as the economy has rebounded with the \nhelp of these tax policies. Whether you embraced these lower rates at \nthe time or not, everyone must now acknowledge that since the 2003 tax \nrelief legislation was signed into law, gross domestic product has \ngrown by more than 3 percent for 10 straight quarters, most recently \nexpanding at a 3.8-percent annual rate in the third quarter. The United \nStates remains the fastest growing major industrialized country in the \nworld. Business investment had fallen in nine consecutive quarters \nbefore the 2003 bill's passage, but cutting taxes on capital helped \nreverse that decline. In the last nine consecutive quarters, business \ninvestment increased at a 6.9-percent annual rate.\n\n  The strong economy has had a very positive effect on the Government's \nfinances, as more revenue is flowing into the Treasury even at the \nlower tax rates. As a share of the Nation's GDP, the 2005 deficit was \n2.6-percent--down from the 3.6-percent share in 2004. In fiscal year \n2005, taxpayers sent $274 billion more in revenue to Washington than \nthe year before and $100 billion more than the Congressional Budget \nOffice predicted. Clearly the American taxpayers are doing their part.\n  Yet some of my colleagues claim that we cannot afford to keep these \nlower rates, even though they have spurred economic growth, because we \nare still running a deficit. If We are to keep these tax rates, they \nargue, we must raise taxes someplace else. What they are seeking is a \nflawed form of budget discipline called paygo or pay-as-you-go. I am \nconsistently rated one of the most fiscally responsible Senators by \nnonpartisan watchdog groups, but I don't support paygo because it has \nnothing to do with budget discipline when applied to taxes. The fact \nis, paygo simply does not work. Americans are not undertaxed; our \nproblem is that Congress spends too much, and paygo will do nothing to \ncontrol the fastest growing part of the Federal budget: mandatory \nspending. Paygo only applies to new spending or tax cuts; it does not \napply to existing mandatory programs that grow unchecked year after \nyear without Congress acting. Mandatory spending will grow from just \nover half of total Federal spending this year to two-thirds of total \nFederal spending by 2015, and paygo will do nothing to control it. So \npaygo is a false solution that is designed to prevent us from extending \ntax cuts--from making sure tax rates do not increase automatically--but \nthat does nothing to prevent spending from increasing automatically.\n  I talked earlier about the extension of the dividend and capital \ngains tax rates that I expect to be added to the reconciliation bill in \nconference. I also want to mention some of the provisions that are \nalready in the bill. It extends for 1 more year the increased exemption \namounts for the alternative minimum tax that are scheduled to expire at \nthe end of the year. Clearly, Congress must address the problem of the \nAMI in a comprehensive way, but until we can agree on a solution we \nmust not allow the increased exemption amounts to expire. If we allow \nthese exemption amounts to fall back to their pre-2001 levels, millions \nof middle-income American families will get hit by the AMT. The bill \nalso prevents the AMT from eroding certain credits.\n  The tax reconciliation bill also includes an extension of the \nincreased small business expensing amounts. Under current law, small \nbusinesses can deduct the cost of qualified investments in the first \nyear they are made, up to $100,000 indexed for inflation. After 2007, \nthis amount will drop back to $25,000. The bill extends the increased \namount through 2009. Allowing them to expense a greater portion of \ntheir investments enables small businesses, which create most new jobs, \nto invest and grow.\n  The bill also includes an extension of the saver's credit. The \nsaver's credit is a nonrefundable tax credit that encourages low-income \ntaxpayers to make contributions to an employer-provided retirement \nsavings plan or an IRA. The tax reconciliation bill extends the credit \nthrough 2009; it is currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2006.\n  The bill also extends the above-the-line deduction for college-\ntuition expenses. Under current law, the provision that allows a \ntaxpayer to take an above-the-line deduction for the cost of college \ntuition expires at the end of 2005. The tax reconciliation bill would \nextend it through 2009, which will\n\n[[Page S13345]]\n\nmake it easier for families and students to plan for their educational \nexpenses.\n  The bill extends for an additional year an entire group of business \ntax incentives that generally expire on a yearly basis. Many of these \nprovisions should be made permanent, and some others probably could be \nallowed to expire. Some of the provisions that I strongly support \ninclude the 15-year depreciation-recovery period for restaurant \nimprovements, the 15-year depreciation-recovery period for leasehold \nimprovements, and the extension and improvement of the research and \ndevelopment tax credit.\n  Finally, the Senate-passed tax reconciliation bill includes several \nbusiness tax incentives designed to encourage investment in the \nhurricane-ravaged area of the southeastern United States. These include \nfinancing incentives and depreciation provisions to encourage business \ninvestment, and are very time-sensitive. We must encourage businesses \nto rebuild in the gulf coast area; these particular incentives have \nproven successful in other areas and I expect they will be successful \nin the Gulf region as well.\n  So, Mr. President, this tax reconciliation bill is not perfect, but \nit does include several very important provisions. I am confident we \nwill make the necessary improvements by adding an extension of the \nlower rates for dividends and capital gains once we get the bill into \nconference with the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13345-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13345-S13346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, when it comes to energy, the Federal Trade \nCommission, FTC, is basically out of the consumer protection business.\n  Well over a year ago, I released a report documenting the Federal \nTrade Commission's campaign of inaction when it comes to protecting \nconsumers at the gas pump. My report documented how the FTC has refused \nto challenge oil industry mergers that the Government Accountability \nOffice says have raised gas prices at the pump by 7 cents a gallon on \nthe West Coast. My report also documented how the FTC failed to act \nwhen refineries have been shut down or to stop anti-competitive \npractices like redlining and zone pricing.\n  Since then, nothing has changed.\n  Despite the recent record-high prices for consumers and record \nprofits by big oil companies, we are seeing a record level of inaction \nby the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, on behalf of energy consumers.\n  In the last few months, when the price of gasoline soared to an all-\ntime record-high level, the FTC has been invisible. As far as I can \ntell, the FTC failed to take any action at all in the wake of \nhurricanes in the gulf that sent the price of gasoline skyrocketing to \nover $3 a gallon nationwide.\n  If you do a Google search on the ``FTC and gasoline prices,'' nothing \ncomes up that shows the FTC is taking any action on behalf of energy \nconsumers.\n  What you will find are statements by the Chairman of the Federal \nTrade Commission arguing against giving the agency additional authority \nto protect consumers against price gouging at the gas pump. For \nexample, the FTC Chairman recently made statements opposing Federal \nprice gouging laws, because ``they are not simple to enforce'' and that \nthey could do more harm to consumers.\n  But 28 States already have price gouging laws on their books and two \nstate attorney General testified at last week's joint hearing by the \nSenate Energy and Commerce Committees that these laws are more \nbeneficial than harmful to consumers.\n  In her testimony before the joint Senate hearing last week, FTC \nChairman Majoras described what I consider to be an astounding theory \nof consumer protection when she essentially said there is no need for \nFederal price gouging laws no matter how high the price goes. She \nargued that gasoline price gouging was a ``local issue'' even if the \nprice gouger was a multinational oil company.\n  FTC officials also recently testified before Congress that the agency \nhas no authority to stop price gouging by individual oil companies. \nDespite this clear gap in the agency's authority, the FTC has refused \nto say what additional authority it needs to go after price gouging, as \nI have pressed them to do for years.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, there is gasoline price gouging going \non today and it didn't start with Hurricane Katrina. As The Wall Street \nJournal documented in September, gasoline prices have increased twice \nas fast as crude oil price during the past year. Clearly, the oil \ncompanies are not simply passing on higher crude oil costs but are also \nadding on substantial increases to the cost of gasoline above and \nbeyond the higher crude costs.\n  Since the early 1970s, there has never been the kind of disparity \nbetween increases in the price of gasoline and the increase in the \nprice of crude oil that we are seeing today. We didn't see this great \nof a price difference even in the days of the longest gas lines \nfollowing the OPEC embargo.\n  Over the past 30 years, gasoline prices never rose more than 5 \npercent higher in a year than the cost of crude increased. But in the \npast year, gas price increases outpaced crude by 36 percent. And since \nHurricane Katrina, the price difference has soared even higher to 68 \npercent.\n  Further evidence of price gouging can be found in what happened on \nthe west coast immediately following Hurricane Katrina when prices \nsurged 15 cents per gallon overnight. For years, oil industry \nofficials, the Federal Trade Commission and other government agencies \nhave maintained that the west coast is an isolated gasoline market from \nthe rest of the country.\n  West coast supplies were not affected by the hurricane. The west \ncoast gets almost none of its gasoline from the gulf. If the west coast \nis an isolated market as the oil industry has claimed for years, then \nKatrina is no justification for jacking up gas prices on the west coast \nimmediately after the hurricane hit.\n  The FTC is the principal consumer protection agency in the Federal \nGovernment. It is the Federal agency that\n\n[[Page S13347]]\n\ncan and should take action when gasoline markets are going haywire as \nthey have both before and since Hurricane Katrina.\n  But instead of action, we have excuses. In the past, the FTC often \nclaimed that it was studying the problem or monitoring gasoline markets \nas an excuse for its inaction on gas pricing.\n  Recently, the FTC's campaign of inaction has even extended to its \nstudies. The FTC Chairman testified last week that a study of gas price \ngouging that Congress required the FTC to complete by this month would \nnot be ready until next spring.\n  Mr. President, the FTC's campaign of inaction is approaching the \npoint of paralysis!\n  The FTC has continued its program of inaction on behalf of gasoline \nconsumers despite findings by the U.S. Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO, that the FTC's policies are raising prices at the gas \npump.\n  In May 2004, GAO released a major study showing how oil industry \nmergers the FTC allowed to go through during the 1990's substantially \nincreased concentration in the oil industry and increased gasoline \nprices for consumers by as much as seven cents per gallon on the West \nCoast.\n  Specifically, GAO found that during the 1990's the FTC allowed a wave \nof oil industry mergers to proceed, that these mergers had \nsubstantially increased concentration in the oil industry and that \nalmost all of the largest of the oil industry mega-mergers examined by \nGAO each had increased gasoline prices by one to two cents per gallon. \nEssentially, the GAO found that the FTC's oil merger policies during \nthe 1990's had permitted serial price gouging.\n  Two years ago, when the current FTC Chairman, Deborah Majoras, came \nbefore the Senate for confirmation, I asked her to respond to the GAO's \nreport. Despite her promise to do so, I have yet to receive any \nresponse from Chairman Majoras.\n  The GAO is not alone in documenting how FTC regulators have been \nmissing in action when it comes to protecting consumers at the gas \npump. Since 2001, oil industry mergers totaling $19.5 billion have been \nunchallenged by the FTC, according to an article in Bloomberg News. The \narticle also reported that these unchecked mergers may have contributed \nto the highest gasoline prices in the past 20 years.\n  According to the FTC's own records, the agency imposed no conditions \non 28 of 33 oil mergers since 2001.\n  You can see the results of the FTC's inaction at gas stations in \nOregon and all across America. Nationwide, the GAO found that between \n1994 and 2002, gasoline market concentration increased in all but four \nstates. As a result of FTC merger policies, 46 States' gasoline markets \nare now moderately or highly concentrated, compared to 27 States in \n1994.\n  The FTC, oil industry officials and consumer groups all agree that in \nthese concentrated markets, oil companies don't need to collude in \norder to raise prices. The FTC's former General Counsel William Kovacic \nhas said that ``It may be possible in selected markets for individual \nfirms to unilaterally increase prices.'' In other words, the FTC \nGeneral Counsel basically admitted that oil companies in these markets \ncan price gouge with impunity. Mr. Kovacis is one of the two nominees \nfor FTC Commissioner who is now before the Senate.\n  Despite all this evidence that gasoline markets around the country \nhave become more concentrated and, in these concentrated markets, \nindividual firms can raise prices and extract monopoly profits, the FTC \nhas failed to take effective action to check oil industry mergers. In \nthe vast majority of cases, the FTC took no action at all.\n  In addition to its inaction in merger cases, the FTC has also failed \nto act against proven areas of anti-competitive activity.\n  Major oil companies are charging dealers discriminatory ``Azone \nprices'' that make it impossible for dealers to compete fairly with \ncompany-owned stations or even other dealers in the same geographic \narea. With zone pricing, one oil company sells the same gasoline to its \nown brand service stations at different prices. The cost to the oil \ncompany of making the gasoline is the same. In many cases, the cost of \ndelivering that gasoline to the service stations is the same, but the \nprice the service stations pay is not the same. And the station that \npays the higher price is not able to compete.\n  Another example of anticompetitive practices now occurring in \ngasoline markets is a practice known as ``redlining.'' This involves \noil companies making certain areas off-limits to independent gasoline \ndistributors known as jobbers who could bring competition to the area.\n  The Federal Trade Commission's own investigation of west coast \ngasoline markets found that the practice of redlining was rampant in \nwest coast markets and that it hurt consumers. But the FTC concluded it \ncould only take action to stop this anti-competitive practice if the \nredlining was the result of out-and-out collusion, a standard that is \nalmost impossible to prove in court.\n  In my home State of Oregon, one courageous gasoline dealer took on \nthe big oil companies and won a multi-million dollar court judgment in \na case that involved redlining. This dealer gave the evidence he used \nto win his case in court to the Federal Trade Commission. But the \nFederal Trade Commission the preeminent consumer protection agency in \nthe Federal Government failed to do anything to help this dealer or \nreign in the anti-competitive practices at issue in his case.\n  In areas other than energy, the Federal Trade Commission has been a \ngreat consumer protection agency. It has not hesitated to move \naggressively to act on behalf of consumers.\n  To give one example, the FTC created a ``Do Not Call'' program to \nprevent consumers from being hassled at home by telemarketers. With its \n``Do Not Call'' program, the agency pushed to protect consumers to the \nlimits of its authority and even went beyond what the courts said it \nhad authority to do.\n  But in the case of energy, the FTC has a regulatory blind spot. And \nthis has been true in both Democratic and Republican administrations. \nIt's been a bipartisan blind spot that keeps the agency from looking \nout for gasoline consumers.\n  The FTC won't even speak out on behalf of consumers getting gouged at \nthe gas pump. The agency won't use its bully pulpit to even say that \nrecord-high gasoline prices are an issue of concern, that they will be \nlooking at closely.\n  The FTC's approach on gas prices has got to change. I'm not going to \nsupport the business as usual approach on energy we've seen for too \nlong at the FTC. So, I have asked the Senate leadership for additional \ntime to study the views of the two nominees to the Federal Trade \nCommission, Mr. William Kovacic and Mr. Thomas Rousch. I just received \ndetailed letters and other documents from each of them.\n  I have asked the leadership for time for consultation on these two \nnominations, as it is not my intent at this time to lodge a formal \nobjection to a unanimous consent request to consider them. I will use \nthe time between now and when the Senate returns in December to examine \ntheir records more carefully and reach a decision as to whether these \nindividuals are committed to and will in fact work aggressively toward \nchanging the culture of inaction at the FTC regarding consumer \nprotection in the energy field.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13347-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13347-S13348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO EARL LEE MONHOLLAND\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

WILLIAM FULBRIGHT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Dr. Allan Goodman, President of the \nInstitute for International Education, recently passed along a speech \nthat Senator Dick Lugar gave at Pembroke College in Oxford, England \ncommemorating the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of J. William \nFulbright.\n  Senator Lugar is one of the finest statesmen in the Senate, and I \nhave enjoyed working closely with him on a number of issues. His speech \nat Pembroke College highlights his leadership and insight on U.S. \nforeign policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his statement be printed in the \nCongressional Record so that all Senators can see these thoughtful \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The 100th Anniversary of the Birth of J. William Fulbright\n\n       My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen, it is an honor to have the \n     opportunity to deliver this address as we commemorate the \n     100th anniversary of Senator J. William Fulbright's birth and \n     celebrate the achievements of a visionary statesman, \n     humanitarian, and son of Pembroke College. It is particularly \n     moving to be here in a place that meant so much to Senator \n     Fulbright and means so much to me.\n       Last year, I joined 25 of my classmates for the 50th \n     reunion of the entering Class of 1954 at Pembroke College, \n     and we have continued that reunion through our \n     correspondence. I was the only American in the College in \n     1954, but was elected President of the JCR the following year \n     in a most generous spirit of Trans-Atlantic cooperation. The \n     election provided a spur to my vivid imagination of what \n     might happen in years to come.\n\n\n                    The Example of Senator Fulbright\n\n       Soon after I arrived at Pembroke, my tutor in politics, \n     Master R.B. McCallum, told me about his tutorial work with \n     Senator William Fulbright of Arkansas. I did not have the \n     pleasure of serving with Senator Fulbright in the Senate. He \n     left office in 1974, two years before I was elected to \n     represent Indiana. But his influence on my career and \n     development was profound and permanent.\n       Senator Fulbright and I shared a remarkable number of \n     common experiences, though generally these. occurred decades \n     apart. Both Senator Fulbright and I won Rhodes Scholarships \n     after earning our bachelor's degrees. Both of us chose to \n     study at Pembroke College. Both of us focused much attention \n     on government and economics while at Oxford. And both of us \n     were blessed with the same tutor, R. B. McCallum. Senator \n     Fulbright studied under the Master near the beginning of his \n     career, while I was tutored much later.\n       Both of us were elected to the Senate from our home \n     states--Arkansas in his case, and Indiana in mine. Both of \n     these states are in the interior of the United States and \n     neither was typically associated with international interests \n     a half-century ago. But both of us sought a seat on the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has oversight of \n     US. foreign policy and diplomacy. Both of us, ascended to the \n     chairmanship of this Committee. Senator Fulbright, in fact, \n     holds he record as the longest serving chairman of the \n     Foreign Relations Committee, a remarkable tenure from 1959 to \n     1974.\n       Since the beginning of the United States Senate, there have \n     been only 1884 Senators. Of these, only 48 have served five \n     complete six-year terms. Senator Fulbright is a member of \n     this exclusive club, having served from 1945 through 1974. At \n     the end of next year, I would join this group of Senators who \n     have served at least 30 years in the Senate.\n       Like Senator Fulbright, I discovered the extraordinary \n     challenges and opportunities of international education at \n     Pembroke College--my first trip outside of the United States. \n     The parameters of my imagination expanded enormously during \n     this time, as I gained a sense of how large the world was, \n     how many talented people there were, and how many \n     opportunities one could embrace.\n       In my first year of residence at Pembroke College, \n     emboldened by Master McCallum's Fulbright stories, I decided \n     to write to Senator Fulbright. He was in the midst of an \n     embattled relationship with Senator Joseph McCarthy of \n     Wisconsin, and he shared with me his thoughts about the \n     McCarthy era in a series of letters as our correspondence \n     expanded. I was deeply moved that he took the time to write \n     to me and even more astonished to learn, years later, that he \n     had kept my letters.\n       He was especially generous to me when I became chairman of \n     the Foreign Relations Committee in 1985 for the first time. \n     He wrote: ``It is an unusual coincidence that two Rhodes men \n     from Pembroke should be Chairmen of the Committee. I think \n     Cecil Rhodes would be as pleased as the two Masters of \n     Pembroke would be.'' He continued to offer encouragement \n     during visits that we enjoyed at Senate receptions and \n     reunions. In September 1986, I had the great pleasure to join \n     Senator Fulbright at the University of Arkansas, where he had \n     served as President, for a celebration of the Fulbright \n     Scholarship Program.\n\n\n                     the fulbright program at work\n\n       Senator Fulbright is known throughout the world for the \n     educational exchange program that bears his name. Each year, \n     approximately 2,600 international students receive \n     scholarships to study in the United States through the \n     Fulbright program. Simultaneously, it provides about 1,200 \n     American students the opportunity to study overseas. In \n     addition, 1,000 American scholars and 700 international \n     scholars teach and perform research each year under Fulbright \n     grants. Since Senator Fulbright's legislation passed in 1946, \n     the program has provided more than 290,000 participants the \n     chance to study, teach, and conduct research in a foreign \n     country. As Master McCallum declared in 1963, ``Fulbright is \n     responsible for the greatest movement of scholars across the \n     face of the earth since the fall of Constantinople in 1453.''\n       Fulbright students and scholars are selected according to \n     academic achievement and leadership potential. Alumni of the \n     program have received 35 Nobel Prizes, 65 Pulitzer Prizes, 22 \n     MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' awards, and 15 U.S. \n     Presidential Medals of Freedom.\n       The Fulbright Program's remarkable contributions to the \n     development of the 290,000 participants provide ample \n     justification for the program. But Senator Fulbright expected \n     much more. He always was unabashed in his advocacy of the \n     program as a foreign policy tool. For him, the Fulbright \n     Program was not intended merely to benefit individual \n     scholars, or more generally to advance human knowledge--\n     though those goals have been fulfilled beyond his original \n     expectations. The program was meant to expand ties between \n     nations, improve international commerce, encourage \n     cooperative solutions to global problems, and prevent war. In \n     his book, The Price of Empire, he wrote: ``Educational \n     exchange is not merely one of those nice but marginal \n     activities in which we engage in international affairs, but \n     rather, from the standpoint of future world peace and order, \n     probably the most important and potentially rewarding of our \n     foreign policy activities.'' He called the Fulbright \n     Scholarship Program, ``a modest program with an immodest \n     aim--the achievement in international affairs of a regime \n     more civilized, rational, and humane than the empty system of \n     power of the past.''\n       For Senator Fulbright, the program also was intended to \n     give participants a chance to develop a sense of global \n     service and responsibility. Alumni of the program are among \n     the most visible leaders in their respective countries. Over \n     the decades, they have explained to their fellow citizens why \n     diplomacy and international cooperation are important. They \n     have been advocates of international engagement within \n     governments, corporations, schools, and communities that do \n     not always recognize the urgency of solving global problems.\n       In August of this year, I traveled to Morocco, a key U.S. \n     ally and a lynchpin in the development of democracy and \n     liberalism in the Arab world. I was there following a \n     humanitarian mission to finalize the release of the last 404 \n     Moroccan POWs held by the Polisario Front since the Algerian-\n     Moroccan conflict over the Western Sahara. While in Morocco, \n     I asked our Embassy in Rabat to set up a meeting with \n     Moroccan opinion leaders to discuss bilateral ties and \n     regional issues. It has been my experience that in most \n     nations, such groups of opinion leaders will contain \n     Fulbright alumni. Sure enough, two of the seven guests had \n     benefited from study in the United States through the \n     Fulbright program--a college President who had done research \n     at Princeton University and a law professor who had done \n     research at George Washington University.\n       In my judgment, the impact of the Fulbright program as a \n     foreign policy tool has extended well beyond the \n     accomplishments and understanding of its own participants. It \n     has been the most influential large-scale model for promoting \n     the concept of international education, and it has been the \n     primary validation of the American university system to the \n     rest of the world.\n       In the United States, we have critiqued and even lamented \n     some aspects of our public diplomacy since the end of the \n     Cold War. But hosting foreign students has been an \n     unqualified public diplomacy success. In numerous hearings \n     and discussions on public diplomacy, the Foreign Relations \n     Committee has heard reports of the impact of foreign \n     exchanges. Of the 12.8 million students enrolled in higher \n     education in the United States during the last academic year, \n     almost 600,000--some 4.6 percent--were foreign undergraduate \n     and graduate students. My home state of Indiana currently is \n     the temporary home of about 13,500 foreign students. The \n     success of American universities with foreign students \n     would not have been as profound without the stimulation of \n     foreign interest in American higher education provided by \n     the Fulbright program.\n       Last year, I traveled to Georgia and met with its new \n     president, Mikhail Saakashvili. President Saakashvili \n     received his law degree from Columbia University, where he \n     studied under the Muskie Fellowship program. In fact, almost \n     every member of his cabinet had attended an American college \n     or university during their academic careers.\n\n[[Page S13349]]\n\n     The result was that the leadership of an important country \n     had a personal understanding of the core elements of American \n     society and governance. Perhaps more importantly, they had an \n     understanding and appreciation of Americans themselves. These \n     individuals were key participants in the ``Rose Revolution'' \n     in Georgia, which is transforming that country.\n\n\n                  National Pride and National Humility\n\n       Funding a great foreign exchange program is a sign of both \n     national pride and national humility. Implicit in such a \n     program is the audacious view that people from other nations \n     view one's country and educational system as a beacon of \n     knowledge--as a place where thousands of top international \n     scholars would want to study and live. But it is also an \n     admission that a nation does not have all the answers--that \n     our national understanding of the world is incomplete. It is \n     an admission that we are just a part of a much larger world \n     that has intellectual, scientific, and moral wisdom that we \n     need to learn.\n       In a speech on the Senate floor in 1966, during the Vietnam \n     War, Senator Fulbright underscored his concern about our \n     national humility by saying: ``Power tends to confuse itself \n     with virtue and a great nation is particularly susceptible to \n     the idea that its power is a sign of God's favor.''\n       Senator Fulbright understood that a great nation must \n     continue to invest in its own wisdom and capabilities for \n     human interaction. He understood that no amount of military \n     strength or even skillful decision-making could make up for a \n     lack of alliances, trading partners, diplomatic capabilities, \n     and international respect. Maintaining alliances and \n     friendships between nations is hard work. No matter how close \n     allies become, centrifugal forces generated by basic \n     differences in the size, location, wealth, histories, and \n     political systems of nations tend to pull nations apart. \n     Alliances work over long periods of time only when leaders \n     and citizens continually reinvigorate the union and its \n     purposes.\n\n\n                 The Building Blocks of Foreign Policy\n\n       Often we need to pause to remember that the practice of \n     foreign policy is not defined by a set of decisions. \n     Unfortunately, reporters, politicians, and even most \n     historians portray foreign policy as a geopolitical chess \n     game or a series of great diplomatic events. This perception \n     is reinforced by books and movies about dramatic moments in \n     diplomatic history, like the Cuban Missile Crisis. These \n     events capture our imagination, because we relive the \n     struggles of leaders during times of great risk as they weigh \n     the potential consequences of their actions. We ask whether \n     Presidents and Prime Ministers were right or wrong in \n     adopting a particular strategy.\n       But Senator Fulbright understood that crisis decision-\n     making is a very small slice of a nation's foreign policy. He \n     understood that a successful foreign policy depends much more \n     on how well a nation prepares to avoid a crisis.\n       When a nation gets to the point of having to make tactical \n     choices in a time of crisis--it almost always is choosing \n     between a bad option and a worse option. Crisis decision-\n     making is to foreign policy what a surgeon is to personal \n     health. Whether a body will resist disease depends on good \n     nutrition, consistent exercise, and other healthy \n     preparations much more than the skill of a surgeon employed \n     as a last resort after the body has broken down. The \n     preparation for good health and for a strong foreign policy \n     is the part that we can best control, and it is the part that \n     must receive most of our energies and resources.\n       Earlier this week, I presided over a hearing of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee that was concerned with the \n     potential threat from avian influenza. If the H5 N1 virus \n     develops in a way that allows it to be efficiently \n     transmissible between humans, tens of millions of lives \n     worldwide will be at risk. No nation is likely to be spared \n     the effects of such a pandemic. However, nations working \n     together to detect the emergence of new strains and to \n     contain quickly an outbreak could greatly mitigate the risk. \n     In a very real and discernible way, our ability to \n     communicate and work with each other across borders may well \n     determine the fate of millions of people. The effectiveness \n     of our response will depend on the investments we have made \n     in knowledge, relationships, and communications.\n       The same can be said for cooperation in the disarmament \n     arena. For fourteen years, I have been engaged in overseeing \n     and expanding the Nunn- Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction \n     program. This is the U.S. effort to help the states of the \n     former Soviet Union safeguard and destroy their vast \n     stockpiles of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, so \n     that they do not fall into the hands of terrorists. Just as \n     Senator Fulbright counted scholars who benefited from his \n     program, I have made a point of counting the weapons \n     eliminated by the Nunn-Lugar program. Currently, almost 7,000 \n     nuclear warheads have been safely dismantled, along with \n     hundreds of missiles and bombers. We are in the process of \n     destroying vast stockpiles of chemical weapons, safeguarding \n     numerous biological weapons facilities, and providing \n     employment to tens of thousands of weapons scientists. Each \n     weapon that is disabled represents a small step toward \n     security.\n       Explaining and promoting the Nunn-Lugar program has been \n     complicated by the fact that most of its accomplishments have \n     occurred outside the attention of the media. Although \n     progress is measurable, it does not occur as dramatic events \n     that make good news stories. At Surovatikha, for example, \n     Russian solid fuel SS-18 and SS-19 missiles are being \n     dismantled at a rate of four per month. This facility will \n     grind on for years, until all the designated missiles are \n     destroyed. At Shchuchye, the United States and Russia are \n     building a chemical weapons destruction facility that will \n     become operational in 2007. It will destroy about 4\\1/2\\ \n     percent of Russia's currently declared chemical weapons \n     stockpile per year. This is a painstaking business conducted \n     far away from our shores outside the light of media interest.\n       The destruction of a decaying nuclear warhead, the links \n     between international epidemiologists, and the training of an \n     individual scholar appear to be small matters in the context \n     of global affairs. But these are exactly the kinds of \n     building blocks on which international security and human \n     progress depend.\n\n\n                      The Source of National Power\n\n       Since September 11, 2001, the United States has been \n     engaged in a debate over how to apply national power and \n     resources most effectively to achieve the maximum degree of \n     security. Recent foreign policy discussions have often \n     focused on whether to make concessions to world opinion or \n     whether to pursue perceived national security interests \n     unencumbered by the need to seek the counsel and support of \n     the international community. But this is a false choice. \n     National security can rarely be separated from the support of \n     the international community, if only because American \n     resources and influence are finite.\n       Throughout this process, I have been making the point that \n     we are not placing sufficient weight on the diplomatic and \n     economic tools of national power. Even as we seek to capture \n     key terrorists and destroy terrorist cells, we must be \n     working with many nations to perfect a longer term strategy \n     that reshapes the world in ways that are not conducive to \n     terrorist recruitment and influence.\n       To survive and to prosper in this century, the United \n     States must assign U.S. economic and diplomatic capabilities \n     the same strategic priority that we assign to military \n     capabilities. We must commit ourselves to the painstaking \n     work of foreign policy day by day and year by year. We must \n     commit ourselves to a sustained program of repairing and \n     building alliances, expanding trade, fighting disease, \n     pursuing resolutions to regional conflicts, fostering and \n     supporting democracy and development worldwide, controlling \n     weapons of mass destruction, and explaining ourselves to the \n     world.\n       Very fortunately, leaders of the United Kingdom have been \n     thinking with us and working with us during these years of \n     worldwide terrorist threats and severe challenges to human \n     values. Earlier this year, I enjoyed a breakfast meeting with \n     Prime Minister Tony Blair at the British Embassy in \n     Washington and later a second visit with him in his offices \n     at 10 Downing Street. We discussed development assistance and \n     debt forgiveness in Africa; democracy building in Iraq and \n     the wider Middle East; terrorist threats to the United \n     States, Great Britain, and many other places; and how to \n     maintain U.S.-UK. solidarity, even in the midst of political \n     partisanship in both the House of Commons and the U.S. \n     Congress. Foreign Minister Jack Straw has been a frequent \n     visitor to my Senate office, and I will enjoy additional \n     visits with British officials in London in the next few days.\n       In addition to the vision of William Fulbright, which we \n     celebrate today, I am certain he would join me in \n     celebrating, again, the vision of Cecil Rhodes as he \n     established the Rhodes scholarships, which brought us to \n     Pembroke. In the years of our selection, Senator Fulbright \n     and I were one of 32 young Americans who were given an \n     extraordinary opportunity through the generosity of the \n     Rhodes Trust to come to Oxford University.\n       We both chose Pembroke College and were admitted to this \n     College. That opportunity changed the horizons of our lives, \n     our expectations of what we might achieve, and our \n     obligations to assume more risks and to undertake more \n     challenges in the service of others.\n       One of my Rhodes Scholar selectors put it very bluntly when \n     he asked, ``Why should we put Rhodes Trust money on you as \n     opposed to any of the thousands of talented young Americans \n     we could choose?\n       A host of circumstances finally made it possible for both \n     of us to serve as a U.S. Senator and as Chairman of the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In my case, I sincerely \n     doubt that I would have enjoyed these opportunities without \n     those remarkably formative two years at Pembroke College. I \n     feel safe in saying that neither Senator Fulbright nor I \n     would have approached international scholarships, \n     international diplomacy, and a passionate quest for world \n     peace with the same inspiration and tenacity without our \n     Rhodes Scholar experiences at Pembroke College, Oxford \n     University.\n       As Senator Fulbright explained in a 1945 Senate speech, \n     just before the end of the war in Europe, ``Peace does not \n     consist merely of a solemn declaration or a well-drafted \n     Constitution. The making of peace is a continuing process \n     that must go on from day to day, from year to year, so long \n     as our civilization shall last.''\n       The success of such peacemaking will depend on our \n     willingness to prepare for the long-term future as Senator \n     Fulbright did--\n\n[[Page S13350]]\n\n     through enlightened investments in people and relationships. \n     And it will depend upon our devotion to movements exemplified \n     by the Fulbright Program and the Rhodes Trust that reach out \n     to the world with both pride and humility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13350-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to express my deep concern \nregarding recent news reports about piracy off the coast of Somalia. As \nwe all know, Somalia has been without a central, recognized government \nfor well over a decade. It has been over 3 years since I chaired a \nseries of hearings in the Foreign Relations African Affairs \nSubcommittee on weak and failing states in Africa, one of which focused \non the dire situation in Somalia and inadequate U.S. policy there. \nYears later, U.S. policy is still stagnant, I am sorry to report, and \nthe danger persists, as these news reports indicate. The time is long \noverdue for the U.S. to make a long-term commitment to addressing this \npotential trouble spot.\n  I have consistently urged the Administration to be vigilant in \nfocusing on weak states as part of the global fight against terrorism. \nAll the characteristics of some of Africa's weakest states--\nmanifestations of lawlessness such as piracy, illicit air transport \nnetworks, and traffic in arms and gemstones and people--can make the \nregion attractive to terrorists and international criminals. \nRegrettably, Somalia is still not on the administration's radar.\n  According to recent press reports, pirates off the coast of Somalia \nare building strength and growing comfortable in expanding their \nattacks. Despite a lull in pirate attacks over the last 2 years, in \njust the last 6 months there have been 25 attacks off the coast of \nSomalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Attacks are no \nlonger confined to the coast but reportedly include raids on ships \nhundreds of miles from the coast of the Indian Ocean. The resources and \nthe audacity of the pirates appear to be growing. The attacks pose a \ntremendous threat to stability and economic development in the region, \nincluding neighboring countries such as Kenya and Djibouti that rely on \nmaritime trade and tourism. The more organized the pirates become, and \nthe more lucrative their crimes, the more we are faced with another \npotential front in the fight against terrorism, one involving a state-\nless network of some of the worst international actors.\n  The State Department 2004 report on counter terrorism in Africa \nstates that the Somalia-based al-Ittihad al-Islami, AIAI, ``has become \nhighly factionalized and diffuse, and its membership is difficult to \ndefine'' and that ``some members are sympathetic to and maintain ties'' \nwith al-Qaida. State Department officials also acknowledge that AIAI is \nfinancing basic civil society needs in Somalia, including schools and \nbasic health care. The international community is failing to empower \nSomali civil society. Without our attention and support, how long do we \nexpect this community to refuse basic human needs funded by terrorist \norganizations? And what are the consequences of groups like AIAI being \nperceived by the Somali people as generous benefactors? The U.S. must \nwork harder at providing an alternative to such extremist influences in \nSomalia.\n  We can no longer insulate ourselves from weak states. We must engage. \nIt is in our own national security interests that we work to strengthen \ninstitutions and empower civil society in weak and failing states in \nAfrica in order to curtail opportunities for terrorists and other \ninternational criminals.\n  A multifaceted approach is necessary for the future of Somalia and \nfor the future of our own campaign against terrorism. We cannot stand \nby as terrorist threats cross borders and destabilize the Horn of \nAfrica. The international community must intensify its maritime \nvigilance. The U.S. long-term policy should include coordinating with \nregional actors in Africa and the international community to aid \npositive actors working in Somalia, build institutional capacity and \nlegitimacy, promote national reconciliation, and sever community \ndependency on terrorist funding for basic services. These are difficult \nchallenges, but Somalia is not hopeless. A transition government and \nopposing factions are requesting international mediation and attention. \nThey are asking us to act, and we must answer the call, for their sake \nas well as ours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13350-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CSBG\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, no one is more committed to the \nCommunity Services Block Grant than I am. The Community Services Block \nGrant program helps to strengthen communities through services for poor \nindividuals and families, assisting these low-income individuals to \nbecome self-sufficient.\n  CSBG provides critical services to poor families throughout the \ncountry. Services offered by CSBG entities can help support these \nimportant social services programs such as: Head Start, Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Programs, LIHEAP, weatherization, literacy and job \ntraining programs, child health care, after-school programs, housing \nand homeownership services, financial literacy and asset development, \nand food pantries and meal programs. In FY 2002, the 1,100 community \naction network served more than 13 million individuals in more than 4 \nmillion families nationwide.\n  Over the past few months, I have received dozens of letters from \nCommunity Action Agencies from across the country, thanking me for my \nefforts on behalf on the Community Services Block Grant. I, along with \nSenator Chris Dodd, spearheaded a letter, signed by 56 of our \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, urging Senate conferees to \nthe Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations bill to uphold the Senate \nfunding level of $637 million. I understand that the conference report \non the Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations bill includes $637 million \nfor CSBG.\n  I hope that the conference report on the Labor/HHS/Education \nAppropriations bill will be enacted soon and that these vital resources \nwill be directed to important services for low income individuals.\n  However, I cannot support the Harkin amendment because if that \namendment passed, it would result in an interruption of funding not \nonly for CSBG, but for all the social spending programs that low income \nindividuals depend upon. That is not a responsible course of action.\n  We should not make support for CSBG a partisan issue--we should work \ntogether to enact the Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations Conference \nReport so that money can be appropriately directed to fund these \nimportant services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13350-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13350-S13351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMERCE-JUSTICE-SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to express my disappointment in \nthe cuts that the conference report for H.R. 2862, the Departments of \nCommerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act \nof 2006, made to important grant programs that assist State and local \nlaw enforcement agencies. I voted in favor of H.R. 2862 because of the \nother important programs that it funds, but I have grave concerns about \nthese particular grant funding cuts.\n  I believe that Congress, in partnership with States and local \ncommunities, has an obligation to provide the tools, technology, and \ntraining that our Nation's law enforcement officers need in order to \nprotect our communities. I have consistently supported a number of \nFederal grant programs, including the Community Oriented Policing \nServices, COPS, Program, which is instrumental in providing funding to \ntrain new officers and provide crime-fighting technologies. I also have \nlong supported funding for the Byrne Grant Program, which provides \nfunding to help fight violent and drug-related crime, including support \nto multijurisdictional drug task forces, drug courts, drug education \nand prevention programs, and many other efforts to reduce drug abuse \nand prosecute drug offenders. I know how important these programs have \nbeen to Wisconsin law enforcement efforts, in particular with regard to \nfighting the spread of methamphetamine abuse. Both of these programs \nsuffered major funding cuts in the conference report for H.R. 2682, \nwhich the Senate passed on November 16, 2005.\n\n[[Page S13351]]\n\n  Funding for the COPS Program has been reduced dramatically in recent \nyears. In fiscal year 2003 the COPS Program received $929 million in \nFederal funding. In fiscal year 2004, that level was reduced to $756 \nmillion, only to drop again in fiscal year 2005 to $606 million. And \nnow, for fiscal year 2006, the funding level has again been reduced to \na mere $487.3 million, a dramatic decrease just over the last 3 fiscal \nyears. This is unacceptable. Funding for these grant programs has \ncontinually dropped even as the needs of law enforcement officers, our \nfirst responders, grow.\n  Funding cuts like the ones to the COPS Program have been mirrored in \ncuts to Byrne grants. For fiscal year 2006, the administration's budget \nproposal would have completely eliminated this critical law enforcement \nprogram in full. Congress rightly rejected the administration's \nunjustified attempt to entirely do away with this important program, \nbut unfortunately the funding level provided this year is inadequate. \nIn fiscal year 2003, Byrne and the local law enforcement block grants, \nwhich have now been merged into one program, received a total of $900 \nmillion in Federal funding. By fiscal year 2005, that number was \nreduced to $634 million. This year, the Byrne program will receive a \nmeager $416 million in Federal funding. It is irresponsible to \nhabitually take the rug out from under our hard-working law enforcement \nofficers by taking away their access to the funding they need to keep \nour communities across the country safe.\n  It is my hope that in the next fiscal year, the administration and \nCongress will work together to repair the damage done and increase \ncritical funding to these and other programs that assist our State and \nlocal law enforcement officers on a daily basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13351-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE KENNEDY CENTER HONORS TONY BENNETT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Tony Bennett is renowned and revered by \nmillions because of his extraordinary talent and outstanding musical \ncareer which spans a half century, and he will always be a part of \nAmerica's musical legacy. His performances are part of our national \nsongbook--tunes each of us know by heart and love to hear time and \nagain.\n  His distinctive voice and inspiring interpretations have set the \nstandard for musical artists across the years. His signature song, ``I \nLeft My Heart in San Francisco,'' was released over 40 years ago, but \nit is as fresh today as it was in 1962, the year it won three Grammy \nawards.\n  His album ``MTV Unplugged'' captured the hearts of a new generation \nand was awarded a Grammy for Album of the Year in 1994. It was also one \nof the most successful recordings in a career that includes countless \nother musical awards and achievements.\n  He has left his heart in communities far beyond San Francisco. Still \ntoday, he remains forever young at heart, as one of America's most \nbeloved musical icons who continues to entertain us and enrich all our \nlives.\n  It is gratifying to know that his remarkable career will be \nrecognized in the Honors Awards celebration at the Kennedy Center next \nmonth as a tribute to his enduring contributions to our national \ncultural heritage.\n  Countless lives have been touched by his artistry. This year at the \nKennedy Center Honors, the country will have the opportunity to thank \nhim for all that he has done so well for so long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13351-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 KENNEDY CENTER SALUTES ROBERT REDFORD\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, each year the Kennedy Center pays tribute \nto distinguished artists who have made extraordinary contributions to \nthe American cultural experience. The Nation will be delighted to know \nthat this year Robert Redford will receive one of these prestigious \nawards.\n  Mr. Redford exemplifies the record of achievement and accomplishment \nthat define the Kennedy Center Honors Awards. With special grace and \ngreat talent, he has become a legend in film. His roles as an actor are \namong the most memorable ever on screen. He can be charming, as he was \nin Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, and Barefoot in the \nPark. He can be serious, as he was in The Candidate and All the \nPresident's Men. And he is always compelling--never more so than in The \nGreat Gatsby and A River Runs Through It.\n  Mr. Redford is equally accomplished as a director and producer. But \nwhether he stars, directs, or produces--and sometimes all three--a \nRedford project is always remarkable for its integrity, beauty, and \npower.\n  In 2003, he was in Washington to deliver the annual Nancy Hanks \nLecture on the role of the arts in public policy. This lecture is a \ntribute to the memory of Nancy Hanks, who served as the early chair of \nthe National Endowment for the Arts, and Mr. Redford's lecture was \nespecially fitting, because he believes so deeply in the fundamental \nimportance of the arts in our public policy.\n  His passionate belief in arts education has been a continuing part of \nhis outstanding career. He founded the Sundance Institute as part of \nhis lifelong commitment to expand opportunities for new works and new \nartists to ensure a vigorous American cultural legacy for future \ngenerations.\n  I commend all that he has accomplished. It is a privilege to join in \ncongratulating him on this well-deserved award from the Kennedy Center. \nI am sure my brother would be proud of him.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, this week the Senate Banking Committee \nreported out S. 467, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 \nwhich will extend for 2 years the terrorism risk insurance program that \nis due to expire on December 31. I suspect the insurance industry is \nbreathing a collective sigh of relief that this bill has finally passed \nin the Senate. All Americans concerned about economic growth should \nalso feel some relief.\n  This bill represents a compromise between the very strong views of \nthe administration and the approach originally set forth in the bill as \nintroduced. I must commend Senators Dodd and Bennett and their staffs \nfor their tireless work on this legislation, as well as Chairman Shelby \nand Ranking Member Sarbanes. I understand that getting to this point \nwas not without its challenges. Nevertheless, we arrived at a \nbipartisan compromise.\n  There are still some who believe that we do not need a terrorism \ninsurance program with a Federal backstop; that the capacity of the \nindustry to provide this insurance has improved, and the program has \nachieved its goals. Frankly, I am not convinced. Because of the random \nand unpredictable nature of terrorism, I am not yet convinced that the \nprivate sector can adequately or accurately assess terrorism risk in \nthe absence of a Federal backstop.\n  It has been 4 years since the September 11 attacks that prompted the \npassage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. And while we have been \nfortunate here in the United States that no events have triggered the \nuse of this Federal backstop, the bombings in London this summer, the \nMadrid train bombing last year, the nightclub bombing in Bali in 2002, \nand the alarming increase in suicide bombers in the Middle East serve \nas painful reminders of the reality of the ongoing war on terror, and \nthe fact that attacks can happen anywhere at anytime.\n  Prior to September 11, the risk of terrorism was not a factor when \ninsurers wrote policies. However, in the post-9/11 environment, the \navailability of affordable insurance for terrorism risks has become a \nnecessity. The war on terror involves protecting our homeland and \nprotecting our citizens. In light of the current environment, it would \nbe both unrealistic and premature to conclude that a Federal backstop \nis no longer necessary. I think it was irresponsible for the \nadministration to suggest that it is now appropriate to shift the \nburden of insuring against the risk of terrorist attacks solely to the \nprivate insurance market.\n\n[[Page S13352]]\n\n  We accepted the recommendations of the administration by dropping \nseveral lines of insurance from the program. However, there is one very \ncritical line that has never been included, and one that I am \ndisappointed is not part of this compromise bill, and that is group \nlife. As I have said on numerous occasions, it is critical that we \ncreate conditions that permit the private insurance markets to continue \nto offer group life insurance coverage to employees at high risk of \nattack.\n  Since 2002, I have fought to include group life insurance in the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program. I was disappointed, at that time, \nthat the Bush administration chose to focus its efforts on insuring \nbuildings against terrorism but was dismissive of the critical role \nthat group life insurance plays for tens of thousands of families at \nthe highest risk of terrorist attack.\n  We saw vividly, post-9/11, the suffering of so many families, and \nwhile the most immediate grieving was for the loss of human life, the \nharsh reality is that many families lost their livelihood as well. In a \ntime of loss, a life insurance policy can mean the difference between \nhaving to sell the family home, pulling the kids out of college, or \neven, in some cases, having enough money to put food on the table.\n  Moreover, the lack of affordable reinsurance for group life products \ncalls into question the administration's position that TRIA is crowding \nout innovation that would otherwise enable the industry to offer \ninsurance for terrorism risk without a governmental backstop. \nReinsurance has essentially evaporated for the group life sector, which \nTreasury specifically chose not to include in the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Program, and thus was not hindered in its pursuit of market \ninnovations. We ought to be working to create a marketplace where \nreinsurance can reemerge for group life products, rather than \njeopardize the TRIA-facilitated appearance of reinsurance for products, \nlike workers compensation, which are comparable to group life.\n  I certainly appreciate that innovations within the insurance industry \nmay be part of the long-term solution, and we certainly must facilitate \nthat as we go forward. The time has come for Congress to review the \ncurrent regulatory landscape of the insurance industry to ensure that \nit does not unnecessarily restrict innovation. I believe that this \nlegislation is consistent with that objective--extending TRIA for a \nperiod of time sufficient for Congress to begin looking at modernizing \nthe regulatory scheme for insurance while it also reviews longer term \nsolutions to the challenge of insuring against acts of terror.\n  I am pleased that this legislation requires the Presidential Working \nGroup to do a study on the long-term viability and affordability of \nterrorism insurance and the affordability of inclusion of group life \ninsurance. I look forward to reviewing the Presidential Working Group's \nrecommendations, and it is my hope that it recommends inclusion of \ngroup life in the program.\n  Additionally, I am satisfied with the ``make available'' provisions \nin this bill. At the end of the day, this program is not about the \nprofits of the insurance industry; it is about the ability of American \nbusinesses to have access to insurance protection. That should be the \nvery minimum required of an industry that enjoys the type of protection \nwe have provided.\n  Estimating the likelihood of attacks or the extent of loss is \ndifficult, if not impossible. Now is not the time for the \nadministration or Congress to leave the private insurers to go it \nalone. I am pleased that last night the Senate passed this important \nlegislation. Doing nothing would not have been acceptable.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, although the Senate's passage \nof the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 is a good start \nto ensuring continuity within our financial markets in the event they \nare impacted by another terrorist attack, I am disappointed the Act \nfailed to include group life insurance.\n  Over 160 million working Americans have coverage through a group life \npolicy. For many, this coverage is their only form of life insurance. \nLoss of this benefit would threaten their families' financial \nstability.\n  Group life insurance poses unique risks to the carriers that provide \nit. Much like workers' compensation insurance, the high level of risk \nconcentration by employer and worksite makes group life insurance \nparticularly vulnerable to large-scale losses from events such as \nterrorist attacks.\n  Before the September 11 tragedy, group life insurers protected \nagainst large-scale losses through the purchase of catastrophe \nreinsurance. Since that time, group life insurers have experienced a \ndecreased availability of catastrophe reinsurance coverage. At the same \ntime, the cost of this limited coverage and its related deductible have \nincreased to the point where the coverage is cost-prohibitive. \nAdditionally, it is not uncommon for catastrophe reinsurers to exclude \nterrorism on most quotes.\n  Opponents of group life's inclusion argue that free market \nparticipants should be able to reach a price on any commodity. But this \nmindset ignores the fact that group life insurers do not operate in a \ntruly free market. Even if group life insurers wanted to exclude \ncoverage for terrorist acts--which many, for good public policy \nreasons, reject as an option--they currently are prohibited from doing \nso.\n  Ordinarily, insurers would control their risk exposure through the \npremiums they charge. However, in the context of terrorism, this \nmechanism also is no longer available for group life insurers. The lack \nof historical data on the incidence rate of terrorism in the United \nStates prevents insurers from pricing for this risk. Moreover, the very \nnature of terrorism--a non natural event--makes it a risk for which \nactuaries have no basis to price.\n  The bill's required analysis of the long-term availability and \naffordability of insurance for terrorism risk, including group life \ncoverage, simply offers the distant hope of a solution for group life \ninsurers. Daily reminders of the continued threat of terrorism require \nan immediate solution.\n  For these reasons, I respectfully urge members of the conference \ncommittee to look beyond the buildings the act would protect and \nprotect the people inside those buildings by including group life in \nthe extension.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13352-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13352-S13354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, they say that timing is everything. And the \ntiming of the Congress's actions these days is indicative of our \npriorities. Yesterday, the House rightly voted against the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services and Education appropriations bill that under \nfunded job training, education and health care. Last night, the House \nvoted to pass a reconciliation spending package that would cut programs \nsuch as child support, food stamps, and Medicaid. Also last night, the \nSenate passed $60 billion worth of tax cuts.\n  What does that say to hard working Americans about the priorities of \nthis Government? I want to make it clear to my colleagues that I \nsupport many of the provisions that are included in this legislation. I \nsupport tax provisions aimed at helping Gulf States recover from \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. I support extending the tuition deduction, \nthe research and development tax credit, and a deduction for teacher \nexpenses, among others. And I strongly support the extension of the \nincreased exemption amounts for the alternative minimum tax.\n  In fact, I would support much broader reform of the AMT. More and \nmore middle class individuals and families will find themselves \nimpacted by this onerous tax if Congress does not act soon to correct \nit. I would also support some capital gains and dividend rate reform. I \nwant to make it clear to my constituents that I am not opposed to tax \ncuts--when the time is right--when we are in surplus. In 2001, I \nsupported the tax cut legislation, based on the fact that we were \nrunning a surplus. It stands to reason, then, that during these times \nof record deficits, that we can ill afford the tax package the Senate \napproved yesterday.\n  I want to repeat what I just said--I am not opposed to tax cuts. That \nis why I supported the alternative package of extensions offered by \nSenator Conrad. This amendment contained nearly identical extension \nprovisions. The amendment even went further on the AMT then the \nunderlying bill, ensuring that no more taxpayers pay the tax over 2005. \nThe difference? The alternative was fully paid for, through a series of \noffsets.\n\n[[Page S13353]]\n\n  It remains a mystery to me why so many of my colleagues chose to add \nto the deficit rather than responsibly extend these important \nprovisions. I would have hoped that more of my colleagues that voted \nagainst this alternative would have come to the floor to give their \nreasoning. Adding $60 billion to the deficit is not something any of us \nshould take lightly. When we are cutting fundamental programs in order \nto reduce the deficit, when we are faced with continued costs \nassociated with rebuilding after the hurricanes, when costs associated \nwith Iraq and Afghanistan continue to mount--is that the time to extend \ntax cuts without paying for them?\n  For me, the answer is a resounding no. Timing is everything. When we \nwere in surplus, I supported tax cuts. Times have changed, and we can \nno longer afford to adopt tax legislation without paying for it. \nYesterday, the Senate had a chance to show our constituents that we can \nmake difficult budget decisions, just as so many American families do \nevery month. But instead, the Senate chose to pass the buck on that \ndecision, and add $60 billion to our growing deficit.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. With this week's consideration of the tax reconciliation \nact, the United States Senate engaged in a heated exchange over the \nreinstatement of the windfall profits tax on American oil. The key \nquestion in this debate, which my colleagues have not been able to \nanswer, is how can a tax increase on oil and gas production reduce \nprices? It can't and history proves it.\n  First enacted under President Jimmy Carter in 1980, Congress imposed \nan excise levy on domestic oil production called the windfall profits \ntax. The result was inevitable. According to a 1990 report by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the results of Carter's WPT \nwere hugely counterproductive: ``The WPT reduced domestic oil \nproduction between 3 and 6 percent, and increased oil imports from \nbetween 8 and 16 percent . . .  This made the U.S. more dependent upon \nimported oil.''\n  The stakes for Oklahoma are huge considering that oil and gas \nproduction is our largest single industry. During debate, Democrats \nfiled amendment after amendment, nine in total, to penalize and to \nincrease taxes by billions of dollars on one of America's most vital \nindustries. To Oklahoma's good fortune, and that of the American \nconsumer, each of these amendments was either soundly defeated or \nwithdrawn.\n  Over the past few months, Democrats have fired a barrage of unfair \nrhetoric maligning all those who work in the oil and gas business. With \none breath they demand Congress reign in the recent high oil prices, \nwith the next they insist on tax increases to punish those who they \nclaim are responsible. With so many friends, acquaintances, and \nconstituents in the business, I find these reckless demands and \naccusations unfair and dangerous for Oklahoma.\n  As a teenager, I worked as a tool dresser on a drilling rig for a man \nby the name of A.W. Swift. Many in Oklahoma know his name, but few in \nthis Chamber would. Like many who have operated in oil and gas, he ran \na thrifty and tight operation but was eventually taxed out of business. \nThis same man lost his son, Burt Swift, after a rig explosion claimed \nhis life but spared mine. Sacrifices, such as his, are often a part of \nthe harsh realities faced by many in the oil business.\n  Oklahoma would be especially hard hit by a WPT. Currently, well over \ntwo-thirds of the State's oil production comes from marginal wells. A \nmarginal well is typically defined as one which produces less than 10 \nbarrels of oil or 60 mcf of gas a day. They are called ``marginal'' \nbecause their profitability is at times just at the margin, depending \nupon production costs and current market prices.\n  As oil prices decrease many of these wells become uneconomical and \nare increasingly ``shut in'' or ``plugged and abandoned.'' However, as \noil prices increase, Oklahoma's independents increasingly drill for and \nproduce from marginal wells. The added cost of a windfall profits tax \ndrastically harms the economic viability Oklahoma's marginal wells.\n  Outside of the damage a WPT would inflict upon Oklahoma, this tax \nwould only further harm our Nation's shrinking energy independence. \nAmerica's major oil companies already pay the second highest corporate \ntax rate in the industrialized world. How are they to compete \ninternationally with an additional WPT tax? How could Conoco Phillips \nor Chevron Texaco compete with Total (French), BP (British), and Royal \nDutch Shell (British/Dutch) not to mention government owned and \noperated oil giants like Saudi Aramco, NIOC (National Iran Oil \nCompany), Petro China, CNOOC (China National Offshore Oil Corporation), \nGazprom (Russia), and dozens more. With enactment of a WPT, American \ncompanies would be hard pressed to effectively compete in the \ncompetitive global market for exploration and production. The WPT gives \nall foreign owned oil companies a strong competitive advantage.\n  With more than 2,100 firms and 60,000 people the oil and gas industry \nis the most critical component of Oklahoma's economy. Many of those in \nthe business have in the past lost their business, their savings and \ntheir livelihood. The industry is cyclical with booms followed by busts \nas we saw most poignantly in the 1980s. For the jobs in Oklahoma and \nthe consumers at the pump, let's reject WPT.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the tax \nreconciliation bill before the Senate today.\n  Today, Americans are saddled with more than $8 trillion in national \ndebt, an obligation being passed on to our children and grandchildren. \nAnd our Nation's expenditures--because of the War in Iraq, the global \nwar on terrorism, Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters, and \ncountless other challenges our Nation is confronting are far \noutstripping our tax receipts.\n  The current administration has placed passing tax cuts for the few \nahead of targeted tax cuts for the middle class and to grow business \nand has made us less able to address other important priorities, \nhomeland security, paying for the war in Iraq, our nation's \ninfrastructure, health care, and education.\n  I believe we need a tax system that is fiscally responsible, helps \nbusiness grow, and provides maximum relief to the middle class. That is \nwhy I support tax policies that work to achieve those goals, and that \nis why I voted for the Conrad substitute amendment, which would have \nfully paid for the cost of targeted middle class tax relief.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about passing a $60 billion tax \ncut bill at a time when we are cutting Medicaid, food stamps, student \nloans, and other domestic programs that will spur economic growth and \nhelp all Americans. Just 2 weeks ago, the Senate Republican leadership \nbrought a spending cut to the floor to cut $35 billion from areas like \nhealthcare and education. The budget that passed this body contains the \nwrong priorities. It imposes painful cuts on working families, as I \nsaid at the time.\n  Mr. President, too many working families in American don't feel \nsecure. They are worried about high gas prices and how they are going \nto heat their homes this winter. They are worried about how they will \npay for their health insurance and their prescription drugs. And they \nare worried they won't be able to afford a home or college tuition for \ntheir children.\n  Given all this, why would the Congress pull the rug from under these \nworking Americans at exactly the time they need our support? The answer \nis before us today to make room for more tax cuts. Now, some of the tax \ncuts contained in the tax reconciliation bill are certainly helpful. \nThe research and development tax credit, the deduction of State and \nlocal sales tax, and the deduction for teacher's expenses are all \nimportant provisions and should be extended. I have voted for and \ncosponsored bills that extend or make permanent some of these \nprovisions. In fact, I voted to extend these tax provisions and all \nthose expiring at the end of the year when I voted for the Conrad \nsubstitute amendment. That amendment fully paid for the tax cut \nextensions and the Hurricane tax relief over 10 years and did not cost \nthe Federal Treasury a dime.\n  I oppose cutting critical services to pass unbalanced tax cuts that \nprimarily benefit the wealthy. The capital gains and dividend tax cut \nextensions, which primarily benefit those making\n\n[[Page S13354]]\n\nmore than $1 million, are not in the current version of this bill. But \nI know that when the tax reconciliation bill comes back from \nconference, it will have those provisions. We all heard Senate Majority \nLeader Frist when he said, and I quote ``I will not bring a conference \nreport to the Senate floor that does not include this extension.''\n  So, Mr. President, we have a choice to make: will we invest in \npriorities like health care, education, transportation and job training \nthat spur economic growth and keep families out of poverty, or will we \ncontinue to conduct business as usual and pass tax cuts in a fiscally \nirresponsible way? Based on the vote 2 weeks ago to cut $35 billion in \ncritical help for Americans in the most need, it appears that the \nRepublican-controlled Congress has chosen the latter.\n  I understand the importance of a responsible Federal budget. Our \nnation's annual deficit is more than $300 billion. Foreign owned debt \nhas increased by more than 100 percent over the last 5 years, and we \nwill soon be asked to increase the country's debt ceiling by another \n$781 billion. At a time when we are facing such tremendous spending \npressures and an increasing deficit, I think it would be wise to heed \nthe words of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said during \ntestimony before the Budget Committee last year:\n  ``If you are going to lower taxes, you should not be borrowing \nessentially the tax cut. That over the long run is not a stable fiscal \nsituation.''\n  Unfortunately, the tax reconciliation bill before us will increase \nthe deficit and borrow money to do so. The Senate was presented with \nthe option to extend the tax provisions expiring at the end of this \nyear and pass the hurricane tax relief in a fiscally responsible \nmanner. Unfortunately, the sound Democratic alternative we offered \nfailed on a party line vote.\n  Mr. President, these are very challenging times for our country and \nour people. Working families don't feel secure about their jobs, their \nhealth care, their pensions or their future. Many Americans are making \ntremendous sacrifices by serving in our military. We need to show that \nwe are on their side. We need to help make America strong again. The \nway to do that is to invest in our people invest in their education, \ntheir job training, and their future.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nwinners of the United States Professor of the Year Award. Since 1981, \nthis prestigious honor has been awarded to professors who show an \nexceptional dedication to teaching. This year, professors from 40 \nStates, the District of Columbia, and Guam are being honored with this \naward. Their disciplines are varied; they come from both private and \npublic institutions. But they have one thing in common, and that is \ndedication to teaching.\n  These undergraduate professors do more than teach information. They \nimpact their classes by inspiring students to excel. They think up new \nand inventive ways for their students to learn. They create programs \nthat allow students to learn through working and teaching experience. \nSometimes these professors go as far as establishing new departments in \ntheir institutions, broadening academic choices for undergraduates. \nCollege professors contribute so much to their institutions and \nsurrounding communities, and often these vast contributions go \nunnoticed by society.

Mr. President, in the spring of this year, I had \nthe remarkable experience of hosting a recording of a history for the \nLibrary of Congress Veterans History Project. A distinguished, elderly \nIdahoan recounted his\n\n[[Page S13355]]\n\nexperiences as a supply officer during World War II, notably in one of \nthe units that liberated the Nazi concentration camp, Dachau.\n  Ralph Leseburg is 86 years old and lives in St. Anthony, ID with his \nbeloved wife of 66 years, Wanda. Before visiting my office, he returned \nto Dachau, Germany on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the \ncamp's liberation by the Americans. After taking part in the \ncommemoration ceremony, he stopped in Washington, DC to visit the World \nWar II Memorial and pay respects to his fallen comrades.\n  Ralph was drafted in 1944 when he was a young married man with three \nchildren living in Layton, UT. That young man was evident in the \nwizened gentleman who sat in my office some months ago, his experiences \nof those difficult times surprisingly vivid in his blue eyes. He spent \ntime in France and then in Germany assigned to the 42nd Quartermaster \nCompany of the Army. He remembers the bombings that cleared Wersberg, \nGermany, and bringing in supplies of food, clothing and ammunition for \nthe soldiers.\n  Clearly, his most difficult time was to come, for it was just months \nlater on April 29, 1945, around 6 or 7 p.m. in the evening that his \ncompany followed the troops into the liberated camps with two \ntruckloads of food for the survivors. Up to this point in the \ninterview, Ralph had shared his experiences in great detail, telling of \ndates, places and times with remarkable acuity. When asked about what \nhe saw that night, Ralph paused for a long minute and said, ``Well, \nit's just something you don't like to talk about.'' At that moment, he \nwas thousands of miles and many years away from my office in the \nDirksen Building. His blue eyes, glinting with the shine of old tears, \nreflected the stark horror of that day, the memory too overwhelming to \nput to words.\n  Ralph continued to serve until 1946, when he returned to his wife and \nchildren and civilian life. Looking back, he said that he remembered \npaying attention to the lifestyle of the people in the countries where \nhe served, and remarked that ``We are blessed to be in this nation, a \nnation of human rights and humanitarian service.'' When asked about \nserving his country, Ralph said only this: ``It wasn't easy to leave my \nwife and children, but I served my country when I was called, and I \nknew why I was called.'' I would like to offer my sincere thanks and \ngratitude for Ralph and his family for their sacrifice and service so \nmany years ago. It was a tremendous honor for me to have this \nparticular member of ``the greatest generation'' in my office that \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13355-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National \nAdoption Day.\n  If the events of the last few months have done nothing else, they \nhave reminded us of the importance of family, friends, and faith in a \ntime of crisis. Not a moment has gone by without an image of a mother \nsearching for her son or a daughter looking for her grandmother. \nFamilies bring people together and make it possible for them to make it \nthrough these times of uncertainty and hardship.\n  Now, more than ever, our focus is on bringing families together: we \nmust rebuild, create, and transform these families. National Adoption \nDay is a way for this goal to be realized. It is in its sixth year and \nhelps the dream of a permanent family come true through courts, judges, \nattorneys, and advocates who help to finalize adoptions.\n  On this day, I would like to paint two pictures for you all: In 227 \ncities and 45 States, at courthouses, churches, museums, parks, and \nbeautiful public places all over the country, at least 4,000 children \nwill find forever families, and dreams of thousands of adults will be \nrealized. I want you to picture what happens on this fall day, children \nrunning, laughing, and playing with their new parent. Think about a \ngirl or boy planning their special outfit and joyously awaiting the \nfamily celebration. Imagine the excitement welling up inside of a child \nas he or she looks into their new parent's eyes and knows they are \nfinally part of a family. They will never dread the sound of a car \ncoming to take them away again or wonder where they will lay their \nheads or which school they will be moved to. the other picture is \ndramatically different: In Louisiana alone, there are 4,424 children in \nfoster care and 581,000 children nationwide waiting to be adopted. Only \n10 percent of these children will ever be adopted. They have not had \nthe luxury of their own room, a stable school environment, or a \nconstant adult in their lives.\n  Most of these children entered into State custody because their \nparents were either unable or unwilling to care for them. What today is \nall about is transforming barriers into foundations. Tonight they will \ngo home to their forever families. In speaking about forever families, \nI want to bring your attention to two of the many children in Louisiana \nthat need forever families.\n  Many children in the foster care system are teenagers and have more \ndifficulty being adopted. These beautiful children are just waiting to \nflourish with the right parent's guidance. Reva, for example, is a 15-\nyear-old, reserved young woman who loves playing board games. She also \nis great at basketball and swimming. Reva does have a diagnosis of \nmajor depression and postraumatic stress disorder more than likely \nexacerbated by her time in foster care.\n  D'Vonte is a 13-year-old vivacious young man who loves to dance and \nlisten to music on his CD player. His favorite activities are working \non art projects and going swimming during the summer months. As a true \nLouisianan, he loves gumbo and is a caring and affectionate child.\n  I could stand here every day for the next month and talk about each \nchild that needs to be adopted out of foster care. The bottom line is \nthat each of these children, from 1 day old to 22 years old, needs \npermanency. They all need a loving, nurturing family that will help \nthem to grow, bring out their unique personalities, and transform them \ninto beautiful adults.\n  Today, on National Adoption Day, I have faith that this can be done \nand we must continue to be the catalysis. The miracle of adoption \ncannot be explained, but the loving parents that are holding their \nchildren for the first time today are living examples of how dreams can \nbe realized. As an adoptive mother myself, I cannot really explain the \nmiracle of it, but I can only take a moment to offer my most humble \nthanks, gratitude, and appreciation to all those across the Nation who \nhave given their Saturday to help find waiting children safe and loving \nhomes.\n  Let us continue to remember, when National Adoption Month and Day \nends that there are still thousands of children like D'Vonte and Reva \nwho need that sense of permanency. I challenge Congress to make these \nchildren their first priority and to help them to finally realize that \ndream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13355-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13355-S13356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HILTON A. WICK\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Hilton \nWick, a great Vermonter who was recently honored at a dedication \nceremony in Burlington, VT. As a token of thanks for his tireless \nfundraising efforts on behalf of Fletcher Allen Health Care, the plaza \nin front of Fletcher Allen's Ambulatory Care Center will now bear \nHilton's name. For decades, Hilton Wick has committed his talents and \nenergy to improving his community, raising awareness, and inspiring \ninvolvement on a wide variety of community development projects. Not \nonly Burlington but all of Vermont can be grateful for his outstanding \nleadership and enormous generosity.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues an article from the October \n29, 2005, edition of the Burlington Free Press which magnificently \ndescribes the contributions of Hilton Wick. I ask that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Oct. 29, 2005]\n\n                 Hilton Wick Gives His All To Community\n\n       It is a fitting tribute to Burlington's Hilton Wick that \n     the plaza in front of Fletcher Allen Health Care's new \n     Ambulatory Care Center is being named after him.\n       The dedication for the Hilton A. Wick Plaza on Sunday \n     honors a man who has been one of the most generous and \n     steadfast community builders Burlington has known.\n       When the hospital's Renaissance Project was in its darkest \n     hours, Wick persevered with community fund-raising efforts \n     despite the adversity, convinced that the goal of a\n\n[[Page S13356]]\n\n     better hospital remained sound and that Vernmonters would \n     benefit from it.\n       Through the years and with a broad array of causes, Wick's \n     message has been ``get involved, get committed, do what you \n     can to help achieve success and don't forget that little \n     things do matter,'' according to his friend, Dan Feeney, who \n     worked with Wick on several capital campaigns.\n       Burlington, and Vermont, have been the fortunate \n     benefactors of Wick's remarkable ability to rally people \n     around good causes, including the United Way, the American \n     Cancer Society, the Intervale Foundation, the ECHO Center and \n     the Community Health Center.\n       The health center, which serves underinsured and uninsured \n     Vermonters, recognized Wick at its annual meeting this week \n     as a kind of guru or ``professor'' of community fund-raisers \n     in Burlington. ``To have Hilton as your friend is to have a \n     mentor, a philanthropic advisor, social connector, politician \n     and the best story teller,'' according to an announcement \n     from the health center.\n       When people gather Sunday to honor wick, now 85, they will \n     share stories of a man who leads by example, inspiring others \n     to give back to the community--a commitment he has held \n     deeply since escaping death in the South Pacific during World \n     War II.\n       The son of a railroad worker and homemaker in rural \n     Pennsylvania, Wick came to Vermont in 1949 after graduating \n     from Harvard Law School the previous year. He practiced law \n     and continues the practice with his son Jim at Wick & \n     Maddocks in Burlington; he taught business law at the \n     University of Vermont; and he was president and later \n     chairman of the board of Chittenden Trust Co. He ran for \n     governor in 1984 and served a term as a state senator in \n     1988.\n       His friends know him especially for his devotion to his \n     family--his five children and his late wife Barbara, who died \n     of breast cancer in 2001--and his community.\n       George Little, a former state senator who served with Wick \n     on a number of fund-raising drives, said his longtime friend \n     has raised more money for health care, education and other \n     projects ``than I can possibly count.\n       ``Hilton is an extraordinary human being who has made his \n     life an example of thoughtful, unselfish generosity to his \n     community,'' Little said.\n       Lois McClure said Wick encouraged her and her late husband, \n     Mac, to give to a number of worthy projects including a \n     building constructed in the 1980s at Fletcher Allen that \n     bears the McClure name. ``Mac said, `When someone like Hilton \n     feels I should do it, I guess I had better do it.' '' McClure \n     recalled.\n       For Wick's daughter, Julia, her father is a kind-hearted \n     role model with a unique sense of humor and a love of story-\n     telling. He is dedicated, she said, to helping those in need, \n     ``a quiet and determined leader who imparts his knowledge \n     through inspiration.''\n       Wick, who now lives at Shelburne Bay Senior Living \n     Community, said in an interview Friday that he has enjoyed \n     helping Burlington, ``a great place to live''--and \n     particularly the hospital, where ``the wonderful medical \n     personnel have kept me alive, when I'm not sure I was \n     entitled to it.''\n       Wick's countless hours of public service have been \n     recognized with numerous accolades over the years, including \n     several ``Man of the Year'' awards from organizations and \n     ``Father of the Year'' from the Lund Family Center. But the \n     real benefits are experienced every day in the community, \n     which has been enriched and improved because of him.\n       Next time you walk across the plaza at Fletcher Allen \n     Health Care, think of Hilton Wick and the many contributions \n     he has made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13356-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING SALYERSVILLE GRADE SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

A bill to amend to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nto provide a tax credit for property owners who remove lead-based paint \nhazards; to the Committee on Finance\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2053\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Home Lead \n     Safety Tax Credit Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Of the 98,000,000 housing units in the United States, \n     38,000,000 have lead-based paint.\n       (2) Of the 38,000,000 housing units with lead-based paint, \n     25,000,000 pose a hazard, as defined by Environmental \n     Protection Agency and Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development standards, due to conditions such as peeling \n     paint and settled dust on floors and windowsills that contain \n     lead at levels above Federal safety standards.\n       (3) Though the number of children in the United States ages \n     1 through 5 with blood levels higher than the Centers for \n     Disease Control action level of 10 micrograms per deciliter \n     has declined to 300,000, lead poisoning remains a serious, \n     entirely preventable threat to a child's intelligence, \n     behavior, and learning.\n       (4) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n     established a national goal of ending childhood lead \n     poisoning by 2010.\n       (5) Current Federal lead abatement programs, such as the \n     Lead Hazard Control Grant Program of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development, only have resources sufficient \n     to make approximately 7,000 homes lead-safe each year. In \n     many cases, when State and local public health departments \n     identify a lead-poisoned child, resources are insufficient to \n     reduce or eliminate the hazards.\n       (6) Old windows typically pose significant risks because \n     wood trim is more likely to be painted with lead-based paint, \n     moisture causes paint to deteriorate, and friction generates \n     lead dust. The replacement of old windows that contain lead \n     based paint significantly reduces lead poisoning hazards in \n     addition to producing significant energy savings.\n       (7) Childhood lead poisoning can be dramatically reduced by \n     the abatement or complete removal of all lead-based paint. \n     Empirical studies also have shown substantial reductions in \n     lead poisoning when the affected properties have undergone \n     so-called ``interim control measures'' that are far less \n     costly than abatement.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to encourage \n     the safe removal of lead hazards from homes and thereby \n     decrease the number of children who suffer reduced \n     intelligence, learning difficulties, behavioral problems, and \n     other health consequences due to lead-poisoning.\n\n     SEC. 2. HOME LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION ACTIVITY TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of \n     chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     foreign tax credit, etc.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 30D.

Mr. President, today I rise in support of Senator \nClinton's bill which would provide tax credits of $1,000 to $3,000 to \nproperty owners who eliminate or contain lead-based paint hazards in \nhomes where low-income young children or women of childbearing age \nlive.\n  Children who eat lead paint chips ingest a highly toxic substance \nthat can produce a range of health effects including reduced IQ, \nreading and learning disabilities, reduced attention spans, kidney \ndamage, and hyperactivity. The sad fact is that there are still over \n400,000 children suffering from lead poisoning in this country, many of \nthem poor and many of them minorities. My home State, Illinois, is the \nState with the highest number of these children.\n  The loss of IQ and ability to learn affects these children and their \nfamilies for the rest of their lives and imposes an economic burden on \nthe rest of us because of their reduced productivity.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Clinton, Smith, DeWine, and me \nin preventing future lead poisonings by giving property owners a tax \nincentive to eliminate this problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2055. A bill to amend titles 10 and 14, United States Code, to \nprovide for the use of gold in the metal content of the Medal of Honor; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill requiring that the \nCongressional Medal of Honor be made out of 90 percent gold instead of \ngold-plated brass as is currently the case.\n  The Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award our country \nbestows for valor in action against an enemy force. Its recipients are \nordinary Americans who perform extraordinary deeds in battle, often \ngiving their lives.\n  This is the medal awarded posthumously to Sergeant First Class Paul \nR. Smith. Under attack at Baghdad International Airport, Sergeant Smith \nquickly organized the defense of his position, engaging a company-sized \nenemy force. He showed no concern for his own personal safety when in \nthe face of hostile-fire he mounted an armored personnel carrier and \nmanned a .50 caliber machine gun. As the citations accompanying his \naward put it, ``In total disregard for his own life, he maintained his \nexposed position in order to engage the attacking enemy force. During \nthis action, he was mortally wounded. His courageous actions helped \ndefeat the enemy attack, and resulted in as many as 50 enemy soldiers \nkilled, while allowing the safe withdrawal of numerous wounded \nsoldiers.''\n\n[[Page S13365]]\n\n  This is the medal won by Captain Humbert Roque Versace. During an \nintense attack by the Viet Cong in the Xuyen Province, Captain Versace \nwas wounded twice while engaging the enemy but continued to fight until \nexhaustion and lack of ammunition led to his capture. The citation \naccompanying his award reads: ``Taken prisoner by the Viet Cong, he \nexemplified the tenets of the Code of Conduct from the time he entered \ninto Prisoner of War status. Captain Versace assumed command of his \nfellow American soldiers, scorned the enemy's exhaustive interrogation \nand indoctrination efforts, and made three unsuccessful attempts to \nescape, despite his weakened condition which was brought about by his \nwounds and the extreme privation and hardships he was forced to endure. \nDuring his captivity, Captain Versace was segregated in an isolated \nprisoner of war cage, manacled in irons for prolonged periods of time, \nand placed on extremely reduced ration. The enemy was unable to break \nhis indomitable will, his faith in God, and his trust in the United \nStates of America. Captain Versace, an American fighting man who \nepitomized the principles of his country and the Code of Conduct, was \nexecuted by the Viet Cong on 26 September 1965.''\n  This is the medal won by Marine Corps Second Lieutenant Robert Dale \nReem, who on the night of November 6, 1950, after leading three \nseparate assaults on an enemy position in the vicinity of Chinhung-ni, \nKorea, threw himself on top of an enemy grenade that landed amidst his \nmen.\n  This is the medal won by Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Donald Gary, who, \nwhile serving aboard the U.S.S. Franklin on July 23, 1945, calmly led \nhis crewmates to safety after their ship was attacked. His citation \nreads: ``Stationed on the third deck when the ship was rocked by a \nseries of violent explosions set off in her own ready bombs, rockets, \nand ammunition by the hostile attack, Lt. (j.g.) Gary unhesitatingly \nrisked his life to assist several hundred men trapped in a messing \ncompartment filled with smoke, and with no apparent egress. As the \nimperiled men below decks became increasingly panic stricken under the \nraging fury of incessant explosions, he confidently assured them he \nwould find a means of effecting their release and, groping through the \ndark, debris-filled corridors, ultimately discovered an escapeway. \nStaunchly determined, he struggled back to the messing compartment \nthree times despite menacing flames, flooding water, and the ominous \nthreat of sudden additional explosions, on each occasion calmly leading \nhis men through the blanketing pall of smoke until the last one had \nbeen saved.''\n  As I have said previously, those who earned these medals are the \nstuff of legend. But they are more than legends. They are actual people \nwhose deeds inspire humility and gratitude in all of us. In bestowing \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor, the president enrolls the recipient \nin a sacred club of heroes.\n  The medal itself, however, while invaluable in significance and \ntribute, does not do enough to show our appreciation. The medal is gold \nin color but is actually brass plated with gold and only costs \napproximately $30 to produce. Other Congressional medals given to \nforeign dignitaries, famous entertainers, and other worthy citizens can \ncost $30,000 to produce. Now I will be the first to tell you that I \nbelieve the value of this medal is found in the deeds of every American \nwho has earned it. But also believe that we can do better.\n  Put simply, this legislation will forge a medal more worthy of the \nesteem with which the Nation holds those few who have earned the \nCongressional Medal of Honor through valor and heroism beyond compare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2055\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to redesign \n$1 Federal reserve notes so as to incorporate the preamble of the \nConstitution of the United States, a list describing the Articles of \nthe Constitution, and a list describing the amendments to the \nConstitution, on the reverse side of such note; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that is designed to honor the document allows us to all be \nhere today. The document I am referring to is the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America, the greatest and longest lasting political \ndocument in the history of the world. Drafted in part by the great \npatriot Thomas Jefferson, this document sets forth both the structure \nof our government and the fundamental freedoms we enjoy every day. \nIngenious by its simplicity, the Constitution is a living breathing \ndocument that has allowed our country to evolve from 13 colonies who \nbanded together to win her independence from Great Britain to the most \npowerful Nation in the world. While this document has created a strong \nnational government that is unrivaled in the world, it has also kept \nthe power in the States to decide how to govern themselves. As governor \nof the Commonwealth of Virginia and now as United States Senator I have \nhad the unique opportunity to experience how this ingenious system of \nfederalism plays out in every action we take as leaders.\n  This legislation that I am introducing today will serve to remind all \nAmericans of the freedoms embodied in the Constitution. For many of us, \nit has been a long time since we have had the opportunity to sit down \nand actually read this historic document. By placing the headings of \nthe articles and the amendments on the back of the dollar bill, all \npeople will have the chance to look at the provisions. I sincerely hope \nthat when children take a look at the reverse side of a dollar bill, \nthey will take the time to ask their parents about what they are \nreading so they can gain a better understanding of our great Nation and \nthe principals our country was founded.\n  By looking at the order of the amendments to the constitution, \nstudents can also trace the history of our country. The amendments to \nthe constitution embody the four pillars of a free and just society. \nThe first of these pillars is freedom of religion, this important \nfreedom is protected by the First Amendment which allows all people of \nall religions to freely practice their chosen religion without fear of \ngovernment interference. The second pillar is the freedom of \nexpression, which again is protected in the First Amendment. The third \npillar is the private ownership of property. This important freedom is \nprotected by the Fifth Amendment which limits the government's power to \ntake private property. This freedom is also protected in the Third. The \nfourth Amendment which protects citizens from being forced to quarter \nsolders in their homes and protects private property from unreasonable \nsearches and seizures respectively. The fourth pillar is the rule of \nlaw. Protection of the rule of law runs throughout the Constitution, \nmost notably in the Sixth Amendment which guarantees the right to a \nspeedy trial and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments which require due \nprocess of law.\n  Looking at the remaining amendments one can trace the evolution of \nthe Constitution and the United States from the Thirteenth Amendment \nprohibiting slavery, to the Fifteenth Amendment providing for the right \nto vote regardless of race, the Nineteenth Amendment granting women the \nright to vote and the Twenty Fourth Amendment prohibiting the poll tax.\n  Throughout our history, hundreds of thousands of brave men and women \nhave laid down their lives protecting the freedoms granted to us in the \nconstitution. Having it been Veterans Day a few days ago, I feel it is \nhigh time\n\n[[Page S13366]]\n\nthat we do all we can to publicize what these freedom are that we hold \nso dearly.\n  Before I yield the floor I would like to recognize the contributions \nof one of my constituents, Mr. Randy Wright who teaches at Liberty \nMiddle School in Hanover, VA. Mr. Wright brought this idea to my \nattention several years ago and he along with his students over the \nyears have been instrumental is providing support for this piece of \nlegislation. I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 2057. A bill to establish State infrastructure banks for \neducation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nco-sponsored with Senator Harkin that would begin to rebuild America's \nschools. If approved, the Investing for Tomorrow's Schools Act would \nenable states to develop State Infrastructure Banks--a flexible and \ninexpensive way to finance school construction and renovation. This \napproach offers an innovative solution to the urgent problem of fixing \ndeteriorating schools. Every dollar invested to create State \nInfrastructure Banks would be reused to support project after project \nin the form of loans and credit support.\n  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, three in \nfour schools in America need assistance to come into ``good overall \ncondition.'' Repairs and modernizations will cost, according to the \nNational Education Association, $322 billion. New York State has a \ngreater need than any other state--estimated at $51 billion. Just in \nNew York City, schools are estimated to need $21 billion. The city's \nschools are so old that they would nearly qualify for social security, \naveraging 61-years-old.\n  Acute need for school repair and modernization exists nationwide. \nNeed is estimated at $33 billion in California, $25 billion in Ohio, \n$22 billion in New Jersey, $13 billion in Texas, and $10 billion each \nin Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Utah. Nation-\nwide costs add up to $322 billion.\n  In 2005, an estimated $19.6 billion was spent nation-wide on school \nconstruction. At that rate, it will take more than 16 years to \nmodernize school buildings. Last year in New York, $984 million was \nspent on school construction. At that rate, it will take more than 50 \nyears to modernize New York's schools--and that's assuming that in the \nmeantime we don't need to build more new schools and that no schools \nfall apart!\n  When students attend schools in disrepair, the consequences are all \ntoo clear.\n  An article from 2004 in the Poughkeepsie Journal described how, in \nHyde Park, New York along the Hudson River, ventilation problems at the \n45-year-old Franklin D. Roosevelt High School sickened students and \nstaff causing watery eyes, headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I would \nlike to include this article in the Congressional Record. State \nInfrastructure Banks would make funding available to address \nenvironmental hazards including poor ventilation and bad air quality. \nThey would help more schools become healthy and high-performing.\n  An article in Newsday newspaper described how, in Hempstead New York, \non Long Island, Prospect Elementary, a 100-year-old school, was closed \nin the fall of 2003 after administrators discovered a rodent problem, \nmold in the cafeteria, and a crumbling chimney in a classroom.\n  The Marguerite Golden Rhodes Elementary School was closed after state \neducation officials found a gap between where the paint on the walls \nended and where the ceiling began--an indication that either the wall \nor the ceiling was moving.\n  Hempstead High School was closed for a week, after a blackboard fell \noff a wall exposing asbestos left over from a botched cleanup in 1990. \n1'd like to include this article in the Congressional Record.\n  The school closures worsened overcrowding, as parents Celia Ridely \nand Olive Warner pointed out to Newsday and the New York Times. With \nschools in such poor condition, is it surprising that just 38 percent \nof students in Hempstead graduate from high school?\n  In Washingtonville, 54 miles north of New York City, the roof over a \nclassroom in 44-year-old Taft Elementary collapsed. Fortunately the \ncatastrophic collapse occurred in August of 2004, before the school \nyear began, and no one was injured.\n  Unfortunately, the U-shaped joist which contributed to the collapse \nwas popular in school construction across New York and throughout \nAmerica from 1900 to the early 1970s. Many of these schools are still \nin operation. New York's Department of Education took the precaution of \nadvising school districts to check similar joists to make sure they are \nin good condition.\n  The lack of funding for school construction can lead school districts \nto put off maintenance. Paul Abramson, a consultant based in \nWestchester County, New York told a school construction website, ``What \nhappens, unfortunately, is [that] school districts cut down on \nmaintenance.''\n  Barbara Knisely-Michelman of the American Association of School \nAdministrators said, ``It comes down to the issue of resource. If \nschool administrators had unlimited resources, [maintenance] would be \nat the top of the agenda.''\n  We can do better. Schoolchildren should not have to contend with \nfalling-down schools. The lack of adequate school buildings hampers \ntoday' s most promising and innovative efforts to boost student \nachievement.\n  Charter schools hold the promise of expanding the supply of high-\nquality public schools, especially in disadvantaged communities. But \nmost charter schools have limited credit histories and lack access to \npublic school facilities or traditional funding streams such as bonds. \nOne in three charter school operators report that school construction \ncosts are a major obstacle to their schools' success.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act promised that children in \nunderperforming schools would have the opportunity to transfer to \nbetter public schools. But in many communities, more students seek \ntransfers than are spaces available. In New York City last year, 33,000 \nstudents applied to transfer out of underperforming schools but only \n7,000 could be accommodated.\n  Charter school operators should have access to affordable financing \nfor school construction. Schoolchildren promised public school choice \nshould be able to exercise that right. Innovative reforms should not be \nblocked by inadequate school buildings.\n  In 2004, an editorialist for Newsday newspaper on Long Island wrote, \n``School construction is one area where the federal government could do \nmore. Little . . . has been heard on the subject since the late 90s--\nthat's a shame. . . . Money must be found to keep schools safe, \nfunctional, and welcoming places.''\n  Senator Harkin and I agree. That's why today we are introducing the \nInvesting for Tomorrow's Schools Act. At the heart of our proposal is \nthe creation of State Infrastructure Banks, which would improve \nfinancing for school construction. This financing mechanism has been \nused since the Reagan Administration to help local communities fund \nwater treatment and clean water facilities and transportation projects. \nFor example, my own State of New York received $2.48 billion in Federal \nsupport for its Clean Water State Revolving Fund between 1989 and 2004. \nIt leveraged that money into more than $10 billion of loans to local \ncommunities.\n  For example, State Infrastructure Banks would offer school districts \na flexible menu of loan and credit enhancement assistance, such as low \ninterest loans, bond-financing security, loan guarantees, and credit \nsupport for financing projects, which result in lower interest rates.\n  State Infrastructure Banks would not strain Federal Treasury or the \nAmerican taxpayer. After initial funding, they would require no ongoing \nfederal appropriations. As each loan is repaid, the money can be \noffered as a new loan.\n  Passage of this bill would lay the groundwork for a robust system of \nState Infrastructure Banks that provide immediate aid to the neediest \nschools and help local communities\n\n[[Page S13367]]\n\nfund affordable construction far into the future.\n  This modest proposal is one piece of the school construction \nsolution. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me today to pass this \nlegislation without delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 2 articles be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From Poughkeepsie Journal, Dec. 9, 2004.]\n\n               Ventilation Blamed for FDR High Illnesses\n\n                            (By John Davis)\n\n       Ventilation problems were the cause of a rash of complaints \n     about the air at Franklin D. Roosevelt High School in October \n     and November, according to health officials.\n       After weeks of testing and monitoring conditions at the \n     Hyde Park high school, Dutchess County Health Commissioner \n     Dr. Michael Caldwell recently relayed his findings in a \n     letter to Hyde Park schools Superintendent Carole Pickering.\n       ``The reported symptoms and effects among students and \n     staff in the school are consistent with those reported in a \n     building with inadequate ventilation,'' Caldwell wrote.\n       In response to the complaints by students and staff \n     reporting headaches, dizziness and watery eyes, the county \n     health department considered a number of factors as being the \n     source of the problem.\n       The health department has ruled out mold, toxic agents or \n     germs as being the culprit.\n       ``Recent modifications made to the school's ventilation \n     system appear to have had a beneficial effect upon the FDR \n     high school community,'' Caldwell noted in his letter.\n       Pickering expressed sympathy Wednesday for those who \n     suffered during the period of the air problem.\n       ``I regret that even one single person was ill due to the \n     air quality problems over the last seven weeks,'' Pickering \n     said in a prepared statement Wednesday. ``We will continue to \n     monitor FDR and to proactively assess heating and ventilation \n     systems in all our buildings.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From Daily News (New York), Nov. 21, 2004.]\n\n   It's a Foul School Stew--Firings, Probes and Lawsuits in Hempstead\n\n                          (By Laura Williams)\n\n       It already seemed more than the Hempstead School District \n     could bear. Asbestos and mold forced school closings. The \n     school board abruptly fired the superintendent. Board members \n     were suing each other amid accusations of corruption.\n       Then last week came word that the State Education \n     Department is launching an investigation into financial \n     hanky-panky by school board members. That revelation, in \n     fact, was welcome news to fed-up parents.\n       Board members ``cannot get through a school board meeting \n     without arguing about which friend is going to benefit and \n     how they're going to get money back from the district,'' said \n     Ron Mazile, co-chairman of Hempstead Parents Community \n     United.\n       The investigation will be conducted in addition to an in-\n     depth audit of the district's books being done by State \n     Controller Alan Hevesi.\n       As if all that weren't enough, a Hempstead High student was \n     stabbed to death near the school Tuesday. A former gang \n     member was arrested, and cops were seeking two more suspects \n     last week.\n       And there's still more: the school district is facing $100 \n     million worth of lawsuits, included in these are suits filed \n     by school employees making charges of sexual harassment and \n     discrimination. In addition, school board member Thomas \n     Parsley is suing colleague Ralph Schneider over something \n     personal.\n       Parsley himself was charged in September with stealing an \n     ATM card from a principal, though he has said the charge was \n     politically motivated.\n       Neither the district superintendent nor any of the five \n     board members returned repeated calls.\n       The 6,800-student district is struggling with the problems \n     that plague so many financially-strapped communities. Almost \n     three-quarters of the Hempstead district's students qualify \n     for free lunch.\n       Less than 40% of its high school students graduate, \n     compared to wealthy next-door neighbor Garden City, where 99% \n     graduate. Reading and math scores continue to lag behind the \n     county average.\n       And school buildings have not been properly maintained.\n       Prospect Elementary was closed last year after mold was \n     discovered in the cafeteria. Marguerite Golden Rhodes \n     Elementary School also was closed after it appeared the \n     building was shifting dangerously. Both schools' students are \n     attending classes held in trailers.\n       Last year, a problem with the hot water heater sickened \n     staffers and students at Alverta Bray Schultz Middle School, \n     which also was found to be serving spoiled food in its \n     cafeteria. And Hempstead High was shut down for a week last \n     year after a chalkboard fell, exposing asbestos.\n       Amid all these problems, the school board last month fired \n     Superintendent Nathaniel Clay, replacing him with Susan \n     Johnson.\n       Johnson, who was fired as the district's director of \n     personnel just two months before getting the top job, had \n     launched her own lawsuit against the district, charging \n     wrongful termination.\n       Parents are planning a Dec. 4 rally and march--from Village \n     Hall to school district offices--in an attempt to get local \n     school leaders to perform dutifully.\n       ``Taxpayers, parents and students are fuming,'' Mazile \n     said. ``We're going to hold their feet to fire.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2058. A bill to promote transparency and reduce anti-competitive \npractices in the radio and concert industries; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday that will promote openness and fair competition in the radio and \nconcert industries.\n  I have followed the changes in the radio and concert industries since \nthe 1996 Telecommunication Act with great concern. For years, I have \nheard complaints from my constituents about the increasing \nconcentration of ownership in the radio and concert industries and, in \nturn, the increasingly uneven playing field for small radio stations \nand independent concert promoters. For consumers this has meant less \ndiversity, less local content and growing dissatisfaction with the \nradio and concerts they are offered.\n  Most recently in the last Congress, I introduced broad legislation to \naddress ownership consolidation and the anti-competitive practices \ncommon in the industry. These practices include tacit or explicit pay-\nfor-play, or ``payola,'' payments, and corporate radio stations putting \nuntoward pressure on artists to play at the same corporation's venues \nuse affiliated concert promoters. While I continue to be concerned by \nconsolidation and believe this centralization exacerbates the potential \nfor abuse, the bill I introduce today focuses instead on the anti-\ncompetitive practices, whether they occur at a radio station group of a \nhandful of stations or one that owns thousands of stations.\n  Some might question why we need added scrutiny and accountability for \nthe radio and concert industries specifically. Besides the unique role \nradio plays for communication and entertainment in each American's \nlife, radio also is, in a sense, a public-private partnership. With \nradio's use of the public airwaves, it also has a responsibility to \nserve the public good.\n  The abuses within the radio and concert industry are not entirely \nnew. In fact, problems have occasionally sprung up almost throughout \nthe entire history of the medium. There almost seems to be a cyclical \npattern as the payola is rooted out and then several years later is \nreincarnated in slightly different form to grow to become pervasive \nagain. So while the original payola practices predated the recent rapid \nconsolidation in the industry, the concentration of power has made the \nproblem more widespread and its effects possibly more severe on local \nstations, promoters, artists and consumers.\n  While paying a radio station or radio station employee to play a \ncertain song without telling the audience has a long history in radio, \nthis does not make the fraud and bribery any more acceptable. In the \n1950s, the practice was relatively simple. Artists, their labels or \nmanagers would often directly bribe DJs to play their songs either in \ncash or through other consideration. When this practice became public, \nthere were investigations and Congress and the Federal Communications \nCommission (FCC) took actions to block this payola.\n  The most recent incarnation of payola takes a more complicated and \nsophisticated--corporate, if you will--approach to skirt the current \nrules that prevent direct pay-for-play. Indirect payments through \nindependent music promoters have been an open secret, as have more \ndirect payments, as the ground-breaking investigation of New York \nAttorney General Eliot Spitzer demonstrates. While the Spitzer \ninvestigation is ongoing, he has already uncovered significant abuses \nand this summer reached a $10 million settlement with a record label.\n  While not traditionally considered payola, there are other abuses of \npower over airplay decisions by radio stations and their corporate \nparents, especially when the conglomerate also owns concert promoters \nand venues. This cross-\n\n[[Page S13368]]\n\nownership sets up a situation where the same corporation that is \nnegotiating a contract for an artist to perform at its concert also \ncontrols the lifeblood of that artist's success--airplay of his or her \nsongs. The result can be intense pressure on artists to play radio \nstation-promoted shows and, often, to do so for less than the normal \nrate. This practice hurts the artist, hurts competing independent \nstations and promoters and, ultimately, hurts the listening public, \nwhich ends up choosing from songs on the radio that have been selected \nbased on where and for whom the artist is performing a concert, and for \nthe songs' artistic merit. Moreover, for any artist who deigns to \nrefuse the direct or implied extortion from the conglomerate, as Don \nHenley's courageous testimony in a 2003 Commerce Committee hearing \nclearly explained, there is the risk of retaliation--either immediately \nor by boycotting the next single or album the artist produces. And with \nthe consolidation in the industry, that boycott might not just be in \none station in one market; it could be forty stations in many markets. \nFacing this kind of potential threat, you can see why even the most \npopular acts are afraid to speak publicly.\n  The bill I introduce today proposes a multi-faceted approach to the \nvarious entrenched forms of payola. The bill would simultaneously \nstrengthen the FCC's ability to prove and punish violators, close the \nloophole allowing indirect payola, prevent cross-ownership from \nhindering fair competition, and, perhaps most importantly, increase \ntransparency through disclosure of the payments to radio stations from \nartists, labels, promoters and others who may have an interest in \nimproperly influencing airplay decisions.\n  The bill improves the FCC's ability to enforce payola violations \nthrough several means. It requires radio stations to make transactions \nwith entities like record labels that might have an interest in \ninfluencing airplay on an ``arm's length basis.'' Moreover the bill \nrequires record-keeping of such transactions and makes the records \navailable to the FCC in the event of an investigation. In addition, the \nbill significantly increases penalties for payola violations and allows \nthe FCC to consider revoking a station's license. As we have seen in \nthe realm of indecency, multimillion dollar companies do not blink at \nthe current fines of $10,000 per violation, but the prospect of putting \na license in jeopardy will get their attention.\n  As I've already mentioned, the current payola rules were put in place \nfor an earlier, simpler incarnation of the practice--the direct bribing \nof DJs and stations. Payola has changed, often going through third \nparties such as independent music promoters or under the guise of a \nlegitimate transaction. The bill broadens the current rules to include \nthese indirect payments, so no matter what tortured path money or other \nconsideration travels, if it is for airplay and not disclosed, it is \npayola.\n  Cross-ownership of radio stations and concert promoters or venues \nposes a serious problem for fair competition. Without controls, the \nrelationship injects the profitability of a concert and not artistic \nmerit into airplay decisions. The bill would either prohibit this, in \nthe case of cross-ownership, or place controls to ensure fair \ncompetition in the concert promotion industry.\n  The final element of the bill--increased transparency--hopefully will \nhave the biggest impact by deterring payola in all its past, present \nand future incarnations. The bill requires radio stations to disclose \nall receipts of payments or consideration that could be used as a front \nfor payola along with a list of the songs played every month, broken \ndown by label and artist. While corporations may not fear the current \nhard-to-prove $10,000 fines, they do understand public relations. The \npotential for consumers and the media to use these records to connect \nthe dots should have a chilling effect on the practice and may mean \nthat the FCC Enforcement Bureau will rarely even need to be involved. \nBut if problems persist, this bill will provide the Bureau with better \npowers and evidence to combat payola in all its forms.\n  Finally let me put this in context and remind my colleagues that \nradio stations use a public resource, the airwaves, to reach their \nlisteners. With this use comes a responsibility to the public and an \nunderstanding that they accept a degree of increased scrutiny. My \nlegislation strives to ensure that the public knows when it hears a \nsong on the radio that it is because the station, the DJ, the public, \nor even a focus group, believes it has artistic merit and that it is \nsomething the listeners will enjoy. Too often, today's radio listeners \nare left to wonder whether a song was played because the station \nmanager got a new laptop or because the station's parent company is \nproducing the artist's upcoming concert.\n  It boils down to choices. This bill will reinstate choices, the \nfundamental basis of competition; choice for the artists to pick which \nconcerts to play and who they want to promote their concerts; choices \nfor the radio stations to play songs based on merit, or at least not \nbased on narrow financial interests; and ultimately choices for \nconsumers as artistic merit instead of the ability to pay carefully \ndisguised bribes broadens the field of artists who can compete.\n  I am pleased that my bill has been endorsed by the following groups, \nand I am grateful for the input they have provided about problems in \nthe radio and concert industries: the American Association of \nIndependent Music/A2IM; the American Federation of Television and Radio \nArtists; the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and \nCanada; Consumers Union; Free Press; the Future of Music Coalition; the \nNational Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, Inc.; and the \nRecording Artists' Coalition. I urge my colleagues to join me and \nsupport this legislation to promote fair competition in the radio and \nconcert industries.

A bill to extend the District of Columbia College Access Act \nof 1999 and make certain improvements; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nto reauthorize the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant (D.C. \nTAG) program for five additional years. This program has had a \ntremendously beneficial impact on promoting higher education for high \nschool graduates in our Nation's capital.\n  The aim of this program is to assist District students, who do not \nhave access to state-supported education systems, in attending college. \nD.C. TAG scholarships are used by District residents to pay the \ndifference between in-State and out-of-State tuition at State \nuniversities nationwide, up to $10,000 per student per school year, \nwith a cumulative cap of $50,000 per student. In addition, since March \n2002, District students attending private institutions in Maryland and \nVirginia, as well as Historically Black Colleges and Universities \nnationwide, started receiving tuition grants under the program of \n$2,500 per student per school year, with a cumulative cap of $12,500 \nper student.\n  Since the first grants were awarded in 2000, the program has \ndispersed over $98 million to 8,454 District students; many are the \nfirst in their family to attend college. Moreover, District high school \ngraduating seniors have seen a 28 percent increase in college \nattendance. Seventy five percent of District students said that D.C. \nTAG made a difference in their decision to continue their education \nbeyond high school. Sixty five percent of District students have \nindicated that D.C. TAG has enabled them to choose a college that best \nsuits their educational needs.\n  Because of the great success and positive impact of this program, I \npropose to expand the program to private schools nationwide, thereby \ncreating greater equity between all private colleges, while \nestablishing a cap on program funding at the current appropriation of \n$33.2 million annually. In addition, this legislation will require the \nMayor of the District of Columbia to submit an annual report to \nCongress on the program's status.\n\n[[Page S13370]]\n\n  As Chairman of the District of Columbia authorizing subcommittee, \nleveling the playing field for high school graduates in the District \nand enhancing their educational opportunities continues to be a top \npriority. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2060\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. 5-YEAR REAUTHORIZATION OF TUITION ASSISTANCE \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Public School Program.--Section 3(i) of the District of \n     Columbia College Access Act of 1999 (sec. 38-2702(i), D.C. \n     Official Code) is amended by striking ``each of the 7 \n     succeeding fiscal years'' and inserting ``each of the 11 \n     succeeding fiscal years''.\n       (b) Private School Program.--Section 5(f) of such Act (sec. \n     38-2704(f), D.C.

A bill to assist chemical manufacturers and importers in \npreparing material safety data sheets pursuant to the requirements of \nthe Hazard Communication standard and to establish a Commission to \nstudy and make recommendations regarding the implementation of the \nGlobally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to announce the \nintroduction of legislation designed to improve our workplace health \nand safety. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions, that I Chair, has a broad range of responsibilities. None of \nthem is more important than the oversight of our occupational safety \nand health laws.\n  In the past decade or so we have witnessed steady progress toward \nsafer and healthier workplaces. For example, in 1992, approximately 9 \nout of every 100 American workers suffered a workplace injury. By 2003, \nthat injury rate had been cut nearly in half. Over the same period we \nhave seen more than a 20 percent decline in the annual rate of \nfatalities from workplace injuries.\n  As encouraging as this progress is, however, it should not be cause \nfor anyone to become complacent. The number of work-related deaths and \ninjuries remains unacceptably high. For example, last year, despite the \nefforts of all concerned, some 4.4 million workers suffered work-\nrelated injuries, with 1.3 million of those injuries involving lost \nwork days. Such workplace injuries continue to bring hardship to \nemployees and their families and to impose significant burdens on our \neconomy. We need to continue our efforts to improve workplace safety.\n  If we are to be successful in our efforts we must be prepared to cast \naside old assumptions, be willing to embrace new ideas, and be candid \nenough to agree on some fundamental realities. First among these \nrealities is that the overwhelming number of employers are concerned \nabout the welfare of their employees and are fully prepared to comply \nwith laws aimed at enhancing their safety on the job. The notion that \nemployers care little about worker safety, or are prepared to sacrifice \nworker health in the pursuit of higher profits is a dangerously \ninaccurate myth. It is dangerous because it promotes and perpetuates an \nadversarial relationship between employers and government safety \nagencies at the very time that we need precisely the opposite. \nCooperation, not confrontation is essential in making our workplaces \nsafer.\n  It is fortunate that most employers want to do the right thing since \nwithout the cooperation of the employer community there is little \nrealistic hope of continuing to improve workplace safety. That is the \nsecond fundamental reality we must accept. Where the vast majority of \nemployers are committed to establishing and maintaining a safe \nworkplace, it makes little sense to perpetuate a system built largely \non a system of inspections and sanctions. Any system aimed at fostering \nworkplace safety that relies principally on such measures is not only \nimproperly focused; it cannot, as a practical matter, even hope to \nachieve its intended goal.\n  Simple mathematics makes it clear that we cannot inspect or sanction \nour way to greater job safety. Today, the total number of OSHA \ninspectors, including those employed by the states, as well as those \nemployed by the Federal Government, is less than 2,400. Each of these \nindividuals conducts an average of about 40 inspections a year. In \nother words, there will be less than 100,000 work sites inspected by \nState and Federal OSHA combined in any given year. At the present time, \nthere are well over seven million worksites in the United States. At \ncurrent inspection rates, we would need nearly 170,000 OSHA inspectors \nin order to inspect all U.S. work sites just once a year. In addition, \nsince most industrial accidents occur in a split second, and since many \nare caused by unsafe acts rather than unsafe conditions, even an army \nof inspectors could not adequately address the issue.\n\n  It is my view that any practical approach to addressing the issue of \nworkplace safety must recognize these realities and be designed to \nencourage and assist employers in achieving this end--not merely punish \nthem for failing to do so. For these reasons, the legislation that I \nhave introduced today contains a number of provisions designed to \nenhance voluntary compliance, and to provide technical assistance to \nthe vast majority of employers that strive every day to ensure the \nhealth and safety of their employees. Thus, these bills contain \nprovisions that encourage employers to engage the services of highly \nqualified third-party safety consultants to assist them in creating \nsafer workplaces. The legislation also seeks to extend the benefits of \nsuch worthwhile initiatives as the current Voluntary Protection Plan to \nsmaller employers; and it increases the level of government outreach \nand technical help to employers seeking assistance in making their \nworkplaces safer. It also provides for increased training of OSHA \npersonnel and fosters a greater understanding of specific workplace\n\n[[Page S13371]]\n\nsafety issues through a unique cross- training and exchange program \nbetween OSHA and the business community. These last two initiatives are \npredicated on the common sense notion that the more we know and the \nmore we collaborate toward a common goal, the more likely it is that we \nwill achieve the desired result.\n  While I believe that the interests of workplace safety compel us to \ndramatically increase our efforts at encouraging voluntary compliance, \nwe cannot be unmindful that the Occupational Safety and Health Act is a \nregulatory statute; and that, like all regulation, there are points at \nwhich the process becomes adversarial. I certainly believe there should \nbe a less adversarial process, however, when it does occur I believe it \nneeds to be fair and regular. In the regulatory context, the power and \nresources of the Federal Government can be overwhelming, particularly \nto small businesses. We need to make sure that the adversarial playing \nfield is a level one, and that the legitimate expectations of fairness \nand regularity of process are adequately met. For this reason, the \nbills which I have introduced today contain a number of provisions \naimed at ensuring this result. Thus, the bill provides for the recovery \nof attorney's fees by small businesses that prevail in litigation \nagainst the government in an OSHA claim, and codifies procedural \nflexibility and fairness in the issuance and processing of disputed \nclaims. The legislation also recognizes that no one, least of all \nemployees, are well served by lengthy delays in the resolution of \ncontested claims by increasing the size of the Review Commission and \nmaking additional changes designed to insure the issuance of more \ntimely decisions. The legislation also returns the Review Commission to \nthe status of a fully independent adjudicatory body as envisioned in \nthe original OSHA legislation by insuring that its decisions are \naccorded appropriate legal deference. The legislation also injects some \nmuch needed flexibility into the administration and enforcement of the \nstatute by permitting the use of alternative, site-specific compliance \nmethods, giving inspectors a degree of compliance discretion, and \nencouraging the prompt correction of certain non-serious violations.\n  In addition to these changes that are based upon procedural and \nregulatory fairness, the legislation also contains provisions designed \nto address the root cause of many industrial injuries, and others aimed \nat bringing a much-needed measure of simplicity and uniformity to our \nworkplace safety laws.\n  In the first instance, for too long we have held the one-dimensional \nview that work conditions and employer practices are the principal, if \nnot exclusive, factors in workplace safety. The reality is that unsafe \nindividual behavior also has an extraordinary impact. For example, it \nis estimated that 47 percent of all serious workplace accidents, and 40 \npercent of all workplace fatalities involve drugs or alcohol. Some 38 \nto 50 percent of all workers' compensation claims are related to drug \nor alcohol abuse in the workplace. An industrial accident typically \ntakes only a split second to occur. The safest conceivable conditions \nand systems can be rendered useless in that instant by an employee \nwhose judgment or reactions are impaired.\n\n  Apart from substance abuse, we also cannot ignore the fact that any \nemployer's safety policies and procedures can be rendered useless \nwhenever someone breaks the rules.\n  If we are serious about workplace safety we have to understand that \nthe employer is not the only factor in the equation. And, if we propose \nto achieve workplace safety solely by regulating employer conduct, then \nwe fail to adequately address the entire issue. At a minimum, we need \nto provide employers some tools and encouragement to control the \nsafety-related behavior of others. We cannot mandate that employers \ntake disciplinary action against their employees who violate safety \nrules, but we can encourage them to enforce such rules appropriately \nand consistently. We likewise cannot compel employers to institute drug \nand alcohol testing programs, but we can remove the legal barriers to \ntheir doing so. Today's legislation, by codifying the third party \nmisconduct defense, and authorizing the establishment of substance \ntesting, provides exactly the type of tools and encouragement that are \nnecessary.\n  It may be the employer's workplace, but workplace safety is \neverybody's job. We need laws that reflect the fact that a safer \nworkplace is everybody's responsibility. For this reason today's \nlegislation also contains a provision that allows OSHA to issue \ncitations and impose limited fines on employees that violate rules and \nprocedures regarding the use of company-supplied personal protective \nequipment. As noted, the authority here, although limited, is \nnonetheless intended to make clear the notion that safety is \neverybody's responsibility.\n  Lastly, our current law provides that employers must communicate \nworkplace hazards to their employees. This is an important, and \nappropriate goal. ``Communication,'' however, requires the delivery of \nclear, and meaningful information to the recipient. Unfortunately, in \nmany respects our hazard communication efforts have become so \ncomplicated that the complexity stands in the way of the original \nnotion that employees need plain information about workplace hazards so \nthat they can take adequate precautions to protect themselves. This \nprocess has become even more complicated by the globalization of our \neconomy, and the fact that many hazardous substances routinely in use \nin our workplaces originate outside our borders. These are likewise \nrealities that we must address, and that the legislation offered today \ndoes. Thus, the HazCom Simplification and Modernization Act that is a \npart of the legislative package introduced today provides for the \nsimplification of current hazard communication standards and it creates \na commission designed to review and make recommendations regarding the \nimplementation of the global harmonization of chemical labeling, hazard \ncommunication and a variety of related issues. I am particularly proud \nof the fact that this bill is the product of considerable bi-partisan \neffort, and I am particularly pleased to have Senator Murray as its \ncosponsor. I am deeply grateful for all her efforts in bringing this \nlegislation to this point.\n  It is my belief that the three bills introduced today reflect the \ncorrect and balanced approach to the goal of increased work place \nsafety that all of us want to achieve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2065\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to preserve existing judgeships on the Superior Court \nof the District of Columbia; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that would preserve existing seats on the District of \nColumbia Superior Court. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenators Voinovich and Akaka.\n  The Superior Court is the trail court of general jurisdiction over \nlocal matters in the District of Columbia. The associate judges on the \ncourt are selected through a two-step review process. When a vacancy on \nthe court occurs, usually because of a retiring judge, the District of \nColumbia Judicial Nominations Commission solicits applicants to fill \nthe vacancy. The commission narrows the possible number of candidates \nto three and sends those three names to the President. The President \nthen selects one of those three candidates and sends the nominee to the \nSenate for confirmation. Existing law caps the total number of judges \non the superior court at 59.\n  Unfortunately, two nominees currently pending in the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs and an additional candidate \nexpected to be nominated in the coming months may not be able to be \nseated on the court even if they are confirmed by the Senate. The three \nseats that these candidates are intended to fill were left open by \nretiring judges, so they are not new seats on the court.\n  The cause of this unusual problem is the District of Columbia Family \nCourt Act, enacted during the 107th Congress. That act created three \nnew seats for the family court, which is a division of the superior \ncourt, but failed to increase the overall cap on the number of judges \nseated on the court. As a result, the Family Court Act effectively \neliminated three existing seats in the other divisions of the court, \nincluding the criminal and civil divisions.\n\n       As a result of this situation, the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs currently has two \n     nominations pending for the superior court but no seats left \n     to fill. I also understand that there is yet another \n     nomination expected in the coming months. Since existing law \n     sets strict requirements on both the DC Judicial Nominations \n     Commission as well as the White House on how quickly they \n     must process potential candidates and make a nomination, it \n     is unclear whether they have legal grounds to halt their \n     processes.\n\n  This is a highly unusual situation for this body to have nominations \npending\n\n[[Page S13377]]\n\nbefore it for which there are no open positions. The bill I introduce \ntoday would rectify this problem by amending the District of Columbia \nCode to increase the cap on the number of associate judges on the \nsuperior court. This is not intended to create new seats on the Court; \nthat was already done when the DC Family Court Act was enacted. \nInstead, this would preserve existing seats on the court and remedy a \nproblem that is affecting not only the court but the Senate as well.\n  I believe that it is also important to not only remedy the immediate \nproblem before the Senate but also to ensure that all of the divisions \nof the superior court are fully staffed. This is more than just a \nprocedural issue. It is also important for the citizens of the District \nof Columbia to know that all of the divisions, including criminal and \ncivil, are operating at full capacity. Eliminating existing seats in \nthe criminal and civil divisions will not improve the administration of \njustice in the District, but can only result an increased judicial \ncaseload and delays at the courthouse.\n  The legislation I introduce today is similar to legislation that was \nfavorably reported by the Committee on Governmental Affairs and \nsubsequently passed by the Senate by unanimous consent during the 108th \nCongress. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dorgan, \n        and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 2071. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nclarify congressional intent regarding the counting of residents in the \nnonhospital setting under the medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community and \nRural Medical Residency Preservation Act of 2005, which will serve to \nensure the continued viability of medical residency training programs \nin our local communities. I am particularly pleased to introduce this \nbill with several of my colleagues, Senators Bingaman, Collins, Dorgan, \nand Rockefeller, who share my concerns about the need to clarify \ncongressional intent so that teaching hospitals will be able to offer \nthese essential residency training programs in the community and so \nthat medical residents, as well as many who live in these communities, \nwill be able to continue to benefit from these programs.\n  Many medical residency training programs have traditionally operated \nin sites located outside the hospital setting for their educational \nprograms. These nonhospital settings are, in fact, where most of this \ntype of physician training occurs. The community and rural sites which \noperate these programs include physician offices, nursing homes, and \ncommunity health centers--cornerstones of ambulatory training for \ngraduate medical education, GME, programs. These programs often rely \nupon volunteer physician faculty to provide educational opportunities \nin practice settings which are similar to those in which these \nphysicians in training will ultimately practice.\n  Congress clearly stated support for this concept as part of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, when they reformed the GME funding \nformulas to allow funding for residents training in nonhospital \nsettings. However, recent rulemaking, agency interpretations, and \nguidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nare creating a chilling effect on these training programs. Teaching \nprograms across the Nation are facing audits and scrutiny as a result \nof confusing and unclear CMS policies and guidance on this issue. This \nhas happened in my State, as well as many others, and is posing a \nserious threat to our future physician workforce and to teaching \nhospitals and medical schools which offer these programs.\n\n  If these agency policies are not halted and reversed, teaching \nhospitals throughout the country will be forced to train all residents \nin the hospital setting or potentially eliminate their residency \nprograms. Not only does this do a disservice to medical residents who \nare able to obtain practical experience and be exposed to settings \nwhere they may ultimately practice, but these programs provide \nindividuals living in medically underserved and rural areas with access \nto health care which might otherwise not be available.\n  Training medical residents outside the hospital setting is sound \neducational policy and a worthwhile public policy goal that Congress \nclearly mandated in 1997. In an effort to preserve the utilization of \nnonhospital training sites, I am therefore introducing legislation \ntoday which would clarify the meaning of the term ``all, or \nsubstantially all, of the costs for the training program,'' a phrase \nwhich has been subject to differing, and confusing, interpretations by \nCMS.\n  My legislation would clarify that, for teaching hospitals and \nentities operating training programs outside the hospital setting, the \nteaching hospital shall not be required to pay the entity operating the \nnonhospital setting any amounts other than those determined by the \nhospital and the entity for the hospital to be considered to have \nincurred all, or substantially all, of the costs for the training \nprogram. Medical associations, teaching hospitals, and academic \nmedicine all strongly support this legislation.\n  This language will also make clear that hospitals shall not be \nrequired to pay an entity operating a nonhospital setting for any \nactual or imputed costs of time voluntarily spent supervising interns \nor residents as a condition for computing residents for purposes of \nreceiving either direct graduate medical education payments or indirect \nmedical education payments.\n  We have received strong support from a number of organizations who \nare in the forefront of training America's future physicians and who \nhave confirmed the critical need for this legislation, including the \nAssociation of American Medical Colleges, the Academic Family Medicine \nAdvocacy Alliance, representing the Society of Teachers of Family \nMedicine, the Association of Departments of Family Medicine, the \nAssociation of Family Medicine Residency Directors, and the North \nAmerican Primary Care Research Group, and the American Osteopathic \nAssociation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the letters of \nsupport from these organizations printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2071\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community and Rural Medical \n     Residency Preservation Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL INTENT REGARDING THE \n                   COUNTING OF RESIDENTS IN A NONHOSPITAL SETTING.\n\n       (a) D-GME.--Section 1886(h)(4)(E) (42 U.S.C. \n     1395ww(h)(4)(E)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new sentences: ``For purposes of the preceding \n     sentence, the term `all, or substantially all, of the costs \n     for the training program' means the stipends and benefits \n     provided to the resident and other amounts, if any, as \n     determined by the hospital and the entity operating the \n     nonhospital setting. The hospital is not required to pay the \n     entity any amounts other than those determined by the \n     hospital and the entity in order for the hospital to be \n     considered to have incurred all, or substantially all, of the \n     costs for the training program in that setting.''.\n       (b) IME.--Section 1886(d)(5)(B)(iv) (42 U.S.C. \n     1395ww(d)(5)(B)(iv)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new sentences: ``For purposes of the preceding \n     sentence, the term `all, or substantially all, of the costs \n     for the training program' means the stipends and benefits \n     provided to the resident and other amounts, if any, as \n     determined by the hospital and the entity operating the \n     nonhospital setting. The hospital is not required to pay the \n     entity any amounts other than those determined by the \n     hospital and the entity in order for the hospital to be \n     considered to have incurred all, or substantially all, of the \n     costs for the training program in that setting.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on January 1, 2005.\n                                  ____\n\n                                 American Osteopathic Association,\n\n\n                           Department of Government Relations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: As President of the American \n     Osteopathic Association (AOA), I write to express our strong \n     support for the ``Community and Rural Medical Residency \n     Preservation Act of 2005.'' On behalf of the\n\n[[Page S13378]]\n\n     56,000 osteopathic physicians represented by the AOA, thank \n     you for your tireless efforts to protect and promote quality \n     graduate medical education.\n       A majority of osteopathic residency programs, in all \n     specialties, use non-hospital settings in their educational \n     programs. These non-hospital sites, which consist of \n     physician offices, nursing homes, community health centers, \n     and other ambulatory settings, provide resident physicians \n     with valuable educational experiences in settings similar to \n     those in which they ultimately will practice. This concept is \n     a cornerstone of osteopathic graduate medical education.\n       The training of residents in non-hospital settings is sound \n     educational policy and a worthwhile public policy goal that \n     Congress clearly mandated in 1997. It continues to enjoy \n     strong Congressional support. Congress endorsed this concept \n     as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, when the graduate \n     medical education, GME, funding formulas were reformed to \n     allow funding for residents training in non-hospital settings \n     with volunteer faculty.\n       However, recent rule-making, agency interpretations, and \n     guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services, CMS, create a chilling effect on residency training \n     programs. If CMS policy is not halted, hospitals will be \n     forced to train all residents in the hospital setting or \n     potentially eliminate programs. Teaching programs across the \n     nation face audits and scrutiny as a result of confusing and \n     unclear CMS policy on this issue.\n       Your legislation establishes, in statute, clear and concise \n     guidance on the use of ambulatory sites in teaching programs. \n     If enacted, it will preserve the quality education of \n     resident physicians originally envisioned by Congress in \n     1997. The AOA and our members stand ready to use all \n     available resources to ensure enactment of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Philip Shettle, D.O.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                     Association of American Medical Colleges,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the Association of the \n     American Medical Colleges, AAMC, I write to endorse the \n     ``Community and Rural Medical Residency Preservation Act of \n     2005.'' The AAMC represents 125 accredited U.S. medical \n     schools; approximately 400 major teaching hospitals and \n     health systems, 94 academic and professional societies, \n     representing 109,000 faculty members; and the nation's 67,000 \n     medical students and 104,000 residents.\n       Your bill would ensure that CMS regulations and guidance no \n     longer impede the ability of teaching programs to train \n     resident physicians in ambulatory and rural settings. As you \n     know, ambulatory training is a vital aspect of every \n     resident's training and is designed to expose residents to a \n     variety of rural, suburban and urban settings in which they \n     ultimately choose to practice such as physicians offices, \n     nursing homes, and community health centers. Such training is \n     coordinated by program directors at teaching hospitals in \n     conjunction with community physicians--many of whom volunteer \n     their time as a professional commitment to train the next \n     generation of physicians.\n       Specifically, your bill clarifies that supervising \n     physicians in non-hospital settings would be allowed to \n     volunteer their teaching time. It also ensures that any \n     teaching costs associated with supervising physicians who are \n     not volunteers would be based on negotiations between the \n     hospital and the nonhospital setting, rather than a \n     complicated formula requiring unreasonable administrative \n     burdens on both the teaching programs and nonhospital \n     training settings.\n       We appreciate your continued interest in this issue and \n     your efforts to ensure the viability of community and rural \n     residency training. The AAMC looks forward to continuing to \n     work with you and your staff to advance this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n     Jordan Cohen, M.D.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                   Academic Family Medicine Advocacy Alliance,\n\n                                                November 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the undersigned academic \n     family medicine organizations I would like to commend you for \n     introducing the ``Community and Rural Medical Residency \n     Preservation Act of 2005'', legislation intended to solve a \n     longstanding problem in Medicare regulations that deals with \n     volunteer teachers of residents in nonhospital settings.\n       We have appreciated your support through the years on this \n     issue, and value your continued efforts to find a solution to \n     the problem. As you know, the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, \n     included a change in statute that allowed forthe counting of \n     training time in non-hospital settings to be included in \n     Medicare cost reports forboth IME and DME FTE counts. As part \n     of that change, the statute, stated that a hospital must \n     incur ``all pr substantially all'' the costs ofthe training \n     in that setting. In the implementing regulations CMS (then \n     HCFA) added the faculty costs to the already included \n     residents' salary and benefits, and required a written \n     agreement between the hospital and the non hospital site.\n       This change in regulation, and the interpretations of it \n     that CMS has used during audits have caused many hospitals to \n     lose the ability to count residents that train in non-\n     hospital settings, and required them to refund large sums of \n     IMEand DME money to CMS.\n       Congress made the change in statute. to encourage training \n     in rural and underserved settings. Unfortunately. CMS's, \n     actions have had just the opposite effect. It has had a \n     dampening effect on training in the non-hospital setting--\n     including rural rotations. It has resulted in much training \n     being brought back into the hospital, ironically both at a \n     time when accrediting bodies are requiring more training \n     outside the hospital, and contrary to the wishes of Congress.\n       As you are well aware, several of the Family Medicine \n     residency programs in Maine are at risk of closing due to the \n     financial implications of CMS's interpretations. We are also \n     aware of similar situations throughout the United States. For \n     example, if the current situation continues, we have heard \n     that in Iowa, four of the eight Family Medicine training \n     programs are at risk of closing in the next couple of years. \n     In Oregon, several residencies are at risk of losing many \n     FTE's, including Internal Medicine, Surgery, OB-Gyn, and \n     Emergency Medicine. In Montana, the only Family Medicine \n     residency program in the state is in danger of losing funding \n     oJ all it's outside rotations due to CMS's unreasonable \n     requirements related to non-hospital rotations. Across the \n     country, residency programs are at risk. CMS has had several \n     years to solve the problem. The report of the Office of \n     Inspector General (OIG) that was required by Congress in the \n     MMA has given CMS several options, and yet nothing has been \n     done.\n       We appreciate your efforts to put an end to this war of \n     attrition. Please count on us to support your efforts at \n     resolving this situation legislatively. Thank you for your \n     help in this area. We look forward to your moving this \n     legislation forward.\n           Sincerely,\n     William K. Mygdal, EdD,\n       President, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine.\n     Penny Tenzer, MD,\n       President, Association of Family Practice Residency \n     Directors.\n     Warren Newton, MD,\n       President, Association of Departments of Family Medicine.\n     Perry Dickinson, MD,\n       President, North American Primary Care Research Group.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2072. A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain public lands \nin and around historic mining townsites in Nevada, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nevada Mining \nTownsite Conveyance Act, which addresses an important public land issue \nin rural Nevada. As you may know, the Federal Government controls more \nthan 87 percent of the land in Nevada. That is more than 61 million \nacres of land. This fact makes it necessary for our State and our \ncommunities to pursue Federal remedies for problems that in other \nStates can be handled in a much more expeditious manner.\n  The residents of Ione and Gold Point in Nevada have asked for our \nhelp in settling longstanding trespass issues that affect these \nhistoric mining communities. These communities have been continuously \noccupied for over 100 years. Many residents live on land that their \nfamilies have ostensibly owned for several decades. These citizens have \npaid their property taxes and made improvements to their properties, \nrehabilitated historic structures and built new ones.\n  The documents by which many of these people claim possession of the \nproperties date back many years. In fact, some of the deeds are \nhistoric documents themselves. Yet because many of these documents do \nnot satisfy modern requirements for demonstrating land title, they have \nbeen deemed invalid. In other words, the Bureau of Land Management has \ndetermined that some of the residents of Ione and Gold Point are \ntrespassing on Federal land. This unfortunate situation puts the BLM at \nodds with the local residents and county governments and is hampering \nefforts to improve basic community services such as fire protection, \nand water supply and treatment facilities.\n  Nye County, Esmeralda County, and the BLM have worked together for \nnearly a decade to solve this problem. All of these parties support the \nlegislation that we offer today as a solution to these land ownerships \nconflicts, and\n\n[[Page S13379]]\n\nas a means of promoting responsible resource management. All of the \nland included in this bill has been identified by the BLM for disposal.\n  This legislation represents the first of a two-part solution. Under \nthis bill, specified lands within the historic mining townsites of Ione \nand Gold Point would be conveyed to the respective counties. Under the \nprovisions of a State law passed several years ago in Nevada, the \ncounties will then reconvey the land to these people or entities who \ncan demonstrate ownership or longstanding occupancy of specific land \nparcels.\n  My bill conveys, for no consideration, approximately 760 acres in the \ncommunities of Ione and Gold Point from the BLM to Nye and Esmeralda \nCounties. As a condition of the conveyance, all historic and cultural \nresources contained in the townsites shall be preserved and protected \nunder applicable Federal and State law. It should also be noted that \napproximately 145 acres of the total land conveyed to Nye County will \nstay in county hands in order to simplify management of a cemetery, a \nlandfill and an airstrip. These conveyances will benefit the agencies \nthat manage Nevada's vast Federal lands as well as the proud citizens \nof our rural communities.\n  I sincerely hope that my colleagues will support this legislation. It \nis a practical solution that deserves swift passage. We salute the \nBureau of Land Management, the counties, and the local residents for \ntheir cooperation and hard work in crafting a reasonable solution to \nthis problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2072\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nevada Mining Townsite \n     Conveyance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISPOSAL OF PUBLIC LANDS IN MINING TOWNSITES, \n                   ESMERALDA AND NYE COUNTIES, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government owns real property in and around \n     historic mining townsites in the counties of Esmeralda and \n     Nye in the State of Nevada.\n       (2) While the real property is under the jurisdiction of \n     the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of \n     Land Management, some of the real property land has been \n     occupied for decades by persons who took possession by \n     purchase or other documented and putatively legal \n     transactions, but whose continued occupation of the real \n     property constitutes a ``trespass'' upon the title held by \n     the Federal Government.\n       (3) As a result of the confused and conflicting ownership \n     claims, the real property is difficult to manage under \n     multiple use policies and creates a continuing source of \n     friction and unease between the Federal Government and local \n     residents.\n       (4) All of the real property is appropriate for disposal \n     for the purpose of promoting administrative efficiency and \n     effectiveness, and the Bureau of Land Management has already \n     identified certain parcels of the real property for disposal.\n       (5) Some of the real property contains historic and \n     cultural values that must be protected.\n       (6) To promote responsible resource management of the real \n     property, certain parcels should be conveyed to the county in \n     which the property is situated in accordance with land use \n     management plans of the Bureau of Land Management so that the \n     county can, among other things, dispose of the property to \n     persons residing on or otherwise occupying the property.\n       (b) Mining Townsite Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``mining townsite'' means real property in the counties of \n     Esmeralda and Nye, Nevada, that is owned by the Federal \n     Government, but upon which improvements were constructed \n     because of a mining operation on or near the property and \n     based upon the belief that--\n       (1) the property had been or would be acquired from the \n     Federal Government by the entity that operated the mine; or\n       (2) the person who made the improvement had a valid claim \n     for acquiring the property from the Federal Government.\n       (c) Conveyance Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding sections 202 and 203 of \n     the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1712, 1713), the Secretary of the Interior, acting through \n     the Bureau of Land Management, shall convey, without \n     consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to mining townsites (including improvements \n     thereon) identified for conveyance on the maps entitled \n     ``Original Mining Townsite, Ione, Nevada'' and ``Original \n     Mining Townsite, Gold Point, Nevada'' and dated October 17, \n     2005.\n       (2) Availability of maps.--The maps referred to in \n     paragraph (1) shall be on file and available for public \n     inspection in the appropriate offices of the Secretary of the \n     Interior, including the office of the Bureau of Land \n     Management located in the State of Nevada.\n       (d) Recipients.--\n       (1) Original recipient.--Subject to paragraph (2), the \n     conveyance of a mining townsite under subsection (c) shall be \n     made to the county in which the mining townsite is situated.\n       (2) Reconveyance to occupants.--In the case of a mining \n     townsite conveyed under subsection (c) for which a valid \n     interest is proven by one or more persons, under the \n     provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 244, the county \n     that received the mining townsite under paragraph (1) shall \n     reconvey the property to that person or persons by \n     appropriate deed or other legal conveyance as provided in \n     that State law. The county is not required to recognize a \n     claim under this paragraph submitted more than 10 years after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Protection of Historic and Cultural Resources.--As a \n     condition on the conveyance or reconveyance of a mining \n     townsite under subsection (c), all historic and cultural \n     resources (including improvements) on the mining townsite \n     shall be preserved and protected in accordance with \n     applicable Federal and State law.\n       (f) Valid Existing Rights.--The conveyance of a mining \n     townsite under this section shall be subject to valid \n     existing rights, including any easement or other right-of-way \n     or lease in existence as of the date of the conveyance. All \n     valid existing rights and interests of mining claimants shall \n     be maintained, unless those rights or interests are deemed \n     abandoned and void or null and void under--\n       (1) section 2320 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 21 et \n     seq.);\n       (2) the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 \n     U.S.C. 1701 et seq.); or\n       (3) subtitle B of title X of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 (30 U.S.C. 28(f)-(k)), including \n     regulations promulgated under section 3833.1 of title 43, \n     Code of Federal Regulations or any successor regulation.\n       (g) Survey.--A mining townsite to be conveyed by the United \n     States under this section shall be sufficiently surveyed to \n     legally describe the land for patent conveyance.\n       (h) Release.--On completion of the conveyance of a mining \n     townsite under subsection (c), the United States shall be \n     relieved from liability for, and shall be held harmless from, \n     any and all claims arising from the presence of improvements \n     and materials on the conveyed property.\n       (i) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior such \n     amounts as may be necessary to carry out the conveyances \n     required by this section, including funds to cover the costs \n     of cadastral and mineral surveys, mineral potential reports, \n     hazardous materials, biological, cultural and archaeological \n     clearances, validity examinations and other expenses \n     incidental to the conveyances.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLlNTON:\n  S. 2073. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for property owners who remove lead-based paint hazards; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a serious, \npersistent, and entirely preventable threat to the health and well-\nbeing of our children.\n  Lead is highly toxic and continues to be a major environmental health \nproblem in the United States, especially for infants, children, and \npregnant women. A CDC survey conducted between 1999-2002, estimated \nthat 310,000 American children under 6 were at risk for exposure to \nharmful lead levels in United States. Childhood lead poisoning has been \nlinked to impaired growth and function of vital organs and problems \nwith intellectual and behavioral development. A study from the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine also found that children suffered up to a \n7.4-percent decrease in IQ at lead levels that CDC considers safe. At \nvery high levels, lead poisoning can cause seizures, coma, and even \ndeath.\n  The most common source of lead exposure for children today is lead \npaint in older housing and the contaminated lead dust it generates. \nDespite a ban on lead paint in 1978, there are still over 24 million \nhousing units in the United States that have lead paint hazards, with \nabout 1.2 million in New York State alone. According to 2000 census \ndata, New York State has over 37 percent of homes that were built prior \nto 1950 and more pre-1950 housing units available for occupancy than \nany other State.\n  Though New York State has made considerable progress in prevention \nand early identification of childhood lead poisoning, more needs to be \ndone to minimize the risk of lead exposure in the home, by our kids. \nAbout 5 percent of New York children screened for lead\n\n[[Page S13380]]\n\npoisoning at age 2 were found to have elevated levels of lead in the \nblood, more than twice the national average. Minority and poor children \nare disproportionately at risk, as these groups are more likely to live \nin older housing with poor building maintenance, where the risk of lead \npaint hazards are greater. Low-income children are eight times more \nlikely to develop lead poisoning than more affluent children, and \nAfrican-American and Mexican-American children are five and two times \nmore likely, respectively, to have toxic blood lead levels than white \nchildren. In New York City, about 95 percent of children with elevated \nblood levels were African American, Hispanic or Asian.\n  I am glad that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \nconsiders lead poisoning to be a priority, and established a national \ngoal of ending childhood lead poisoning by 2010. However, Federal \nprograms only have resources to remove lead-based paint hazards from \nless than 0.1 percent of the 24 million housing units that have these \nhazards. At this pace, we will not be able to end childhood lead \npoisoning by 3010, let alone 2010.\n  We will never stop childhood lead poisoning unless we get lead out of \nthe buildings in which children live, work, and play. In Brooklyn, more \nthan a third of the buildings in one community have a lead-based paint \nhazard. Parents of children with lead poisoning are being told that \nnothing can be done until their children's lead poisoning becomes \nworse. How can we ask parents to watch and wait while their sons and \ndaughters suffer from lead poisoning before we remove the lead from \ntheir homes?\n\n  That is why today, I am proud to introduce the Home Lead Safety Tax \nCredit Act of 2005 with my colleagues, Senators DeWine, Obama, and \nSmith. This legislation would provide a tax credit to aide and \nencourage homeowners and landlords to engage in the safe removal of \nlead-based paint hazards from their homes and rental units. \nSpecifically, it would change the IRS Code of 1986 to provide a tax \ncredit for 50 percent of the allowable costs paid by the taxpayer, up \nto a maximum of $3000 and $1000 for lead abatement and interim control \nmeasures, respectively. Interim control measures, which can include \nreplacement of windows, specialized maintenance, safe repainting and \nrenovation work practices to eliminate lead hazards, are a cost-\neffective means of protecting the largest number of children in the \nnear term. While total elimination of lead paint in housing is the most \ndesirable, interim control measures typically cost three to nine times \nless and can be equally effective at removing the lead hazard.\n  The credit is targeted to homes that contain children less than 6 \nyears of age or a woman of childbearing age, low-income residents, and \nto buildings built before 1960, as these include more than 96 percent \nof all units where lead-based paint is prevalent. In Massachusetts, a \nsimilar tax credit helped reduce the number of new cases of childhood \nlead poisoning by almost two-thirds in a decade.\n  The Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2005 would help homeowners \nmake over 80,000 homes each year safe from lead, which is more than 10 \ntimes the number of homes made lead safe by current Federal programs. \nIt would greatly accelerate our progress in ridding our Nation of the \nsignificant problem of childhood lead poisoning. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this legislation, which will provide needed \nincentives for property owners to ensure that our homes are safeguarded \nagainst environmental hazards that detrimentally affect the health and \nsafety of our children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2073\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Home Lead \n     Safety Tax Credit Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Of the 98,000,000 housing units in the United States, \n     38,000,000 have lead-based paint.\n       (2) Of the 38,000,000 housing units with lead-based paint, \n     25,000,000 pose a hazard, as defined by Environmental \n     Protection Agency and Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development standards, due to conditions such as peeling \n     paint and settled dust on floors and windowsills that contain \n     lead at levels above Federal safety standards.\n       (3) Though the number of children in the United States ages \n     1 through 5 with blood levels higher than the Centers for \n     Disease Control action level of 10 micrograms per deciliter \n     has declined to 300,000, lead poisoning remains a serious, \n     entirely preventable threat to a child's intelligence, \n     behavior, and learning.\n       (4) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n     established a national goal of ending childhood lead \n     poisoning by 2010.\n       (5) Current Federal lead abatement programs, such as the \n     Lead Hazard Control Grant Program of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development, only have resources sufficient \n     to make approximately 7,000 homes lead-safe each year. In \n     many cases, when State and local public health departments \n     identify a lead-poisoned child, resources are insufficient to \n     reduce or eliminate the hazards.\n       (6) Old windows typically pose significant risks because \n     wood trim is more likely to be painted with lead-based paint, \n     moisture causes paint to deteriorate, and friction generates \n     lead dust. The replacement of old windows that contain lead \n     based paint significantly reduces lead poisoning hazards in \n     addition to producing significant energy savings.\n       (7) Childhood lead poisoning can be dramatically reduced by \n     the abatement or complete removal of all lead-based paint. \n     Empirical studies also have shown substantial reductions in \n     lead poisoning when the affected properties have undergone \n     so-called ``interim control measures'' that are far less \n     costly than abatement.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to encourage \n     the safe removal of lead hazards from homes and thereby \n     decrease the number of children who suffer reduced \n     intelligence, learning difficulties, behavioral problems, and \n     other health consequences due to lead-poisoning.\n\n     SEC. 2. HOME LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION ACTIVITY TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of \n     chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     foreign tax credit, etc.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 30D.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for fair treatment of services furnished to Indians under the \nmedicaid program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the \nIndian Medicaid Health Act of 2005 with Senators Baucus, Dorgan, \nMurray, Cantwell and Johnson.\n  This legislation addresses a number of technical but critically \nimportant provisions within the Medicaid Program that devote special \nattention to Native Americans, the Indian Health Service, IHS, tribal \nhealth organizations, and urban Indian health organizations. These \nprovisions would:\n  No. 1, codify protections that American Indians and Alaska Natives \nhave obtained over the years in the Medicaid program, such as the \nrequirement that states consult with tribes and tribal health \norganizations prior to seeking a federal Medicaid waiver;\n  No. 2, clarify that American Indians and Alaska Natives are not \nsubject to additional cost sharing or benefit limitations within \nMedicaid that will result in nothing more than a cost-shift from the \nMedicaid program to IHS or tribal health providers;\n  No. 3, codify critically important provisions that provide \nprotections against states or the federal government taking Indian \nproperty or tribal lands in exchange for medical services delivered \nthrough Medicaid; and,\n  No. 4, eliminate certain inequities such as the lack of 100 percent \nfederal matching payments within Medicaid for care delivered to Native \nAmericans at urban Indian health clinics.\n  American Indians and Alaska Natives continue to suffer enormous \ndisparities in the health and medical care they receive. It should not \ncome as a surprise to anyone at the Federal level that health care \nfunding for American Indians and Alaska Natives, AI/AN, is well below \nwhat it should be and, consequently, Native Americans received rationed \nhealth care services that deny them access to the quality and medically \nnecessary health care services.\n  However, year after year, budget and appropriations amendments are \noffered to more fully fund health care for Native Americans but both \nthe administration and Congress routinely fail to provide adequate \nfunding. The result is a continued and growing divide between the \nhealth of American Indians and Alaska Natives compared to that of the \ngeneral population.\n  The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, USCCR, held meetings in \nAlbuquerque, NM, and visited the Gallup Indian Medical Center in 2003 \nas part of a factfinding mission to review the current disparities in \nthe health status and outcomes of Native Americans. What they found \nserved as a basis for the release of their report in September 2004 \nentitled Broken Promises: Evaluating the Native American Health Care \nSystem. The opening line in that report reads, ``Today, in Indian \nCountry, health-related problems and the lack of adequate health care \nare the enemy.''\n  This is in large part due to the fact that the IHS operates on just \n57 percent of the budget it needs and had more than $3 billion in unmet \nneeds in 2003. USCCR cites estimates by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, that per capita health spending for all Americans \nat $4,065, while IHS spent about $1,914 per person and average spending \non Navajo patients is just $1,187.\n\n[[Page S13382]]\n\n  The USCCR adds, ``In fact, the federal government spends nearly twice \nas much money for a federal prisoner's health care than it does for an \nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native.''\n  Consequently and not surprisingly, this disparity in funding \ntranslates into severe health disparities for Native Americans. For \nexample, life expectancy is 6 years less than the rest of the U.S. \ncitizens. Tuberculosis rates are four times the national average. \nComplications due to diabetes are almost three times the national \naverage and death rates exceed the Healthy People 2010 targets by 233 \npercent. Infant mortality rates are 1.7 times higher than the rate for \nwhite infants.\n  In recognition of these facts, the National Indian Health Board has \nsaid, ``The travesty in looking at the deplorable health of American \nIndians and Alaska Natives is recognizing that the poor health \nindicators could be improved if funding was available to provide even a \nbasic level of care.''\n  The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights adds, ``In this light, this \nreport should be considered a clarion call to those who inexplicably \nfail to acknowledge the present state of Native American health care \nand to those who lack a commitment necessary to address the \noverwhelming need for clear and decisive action. Such a call is \ncertainly appropriate for our political leadership and the message is \nclear--it is finally time to honor our nation's commitment to \nprotecting the health of Native Americans.''\n  Such an agenda is actually a fairly simple one. It would include:\n  No. 1, full funding for the Indian Health Service and tribal health \norganizations, which should include conversion of IHS into an \nentitlement program;\n  No. 2, increased numbers and funding of urban Indian health \norganizations;\n  No. 3, reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act;\n  No. 4, coverage of as many American Indians and Alaska Natives who \nqualify for federal health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as \npossible to ensure they are enrolled and receiving benefits in order to \naugment funding to IHS facilities; and,\n  No. 5, targeted efforts to address health disparities in Indian \nCountry, such as diabetes.\n  For this reason, I strongly support the annual budget and \nappropriations efforts, which have been led by Senator Daschle in the \npast and Senator Dorgan this year, to increase funding for the Indian \nHealth Service. Unfortunately, those efforts continue to be voted down \nin the Congress.\n  I also strongly support reauthorization of the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act, IHCIA, which is led by Senators McCain and Dorgan. \nThis effort has been ongoing for 6 years and it is long past time for \nthe Congress to take up and pass IHCIA. Unfortunately, due to \ncontinued opposition to certain provisions by the administration, the \nlegislation continues to be bottled up in the Congress and has not even \nbeen reintroduced in the House of Representatives.\n\n  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, one area that I have \nbeen able to focus on in recent years is to improve coverage for Native \nAmericans in both Medicare and Medicaid. I was able to pass \nlegislation, the Native American Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment \nTechnical Amendment Act of 2001 or Public Law 107-121, to correct \nproblems whereby Native American women had previously been wrongly \ndenied coverage under Medicaid's breast and cervical cancer treatment \noption. After a year of work, we were able to pass legislation to \ncorrect that outrageous and discriminatory error.\n  I was also able to pass two provisions in 2003 from my bill, the \nMedicare Indian Health Fairness Act of 2003, that expanded \nreimbursement to IHS and tribal health providers for all Medicare Part \nB services and limited the amount that providers outside the IHS system \ncan charge for services delivered to Native Americans through the \ncontract health services, CHS, program. As with anything related to \nNative Americans in this Administration, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, continues to fail to publish regulations necessary \nto implement the latter provision, even though the law required \npublishing of those regulations in December 2004.\n  Although most involved in Indian health feel frustrated and argue \nthat we are taking one step forward and two steps back with respect to \nIndian health care policy, it is in the area of Medicare, Medicaid and \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, policy that we \nhave been making some progress. The legislation I am introducing today, \nthe Medicaid Indian Health Care Act of 2005, seeks to protect the gains \nthat have been made and to take another few steps forward.\n  For one, while IHS funding continues to fall further and further \nbehind what is needed, the one bright spot is that collections from \nthird party payers has increased over time with Medicaid playing a \nfundamental role in that growth.\n  IHS was first authorized to seek Medicaid payment for services \ndelivered in Indian health facilities, whether operated by the IHS \ndirectly or by tribes as part of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \nof 1976 or Public Law 94-437.\n  As Indian health experts Mim Dixon and Kris Locke said, ``This \nentitlement funding was expected to provide critical resources to \nimprove the quality of health care for AI/AN and to reduce the health \nstatus disparities. To support this outcome, there is an additional \nprovision in the IHCIA that Medicaid and Medicare revenues shall not \noffset Congressional appropriations for the IHS, so that the total \namount of funding for Indian health care would increase and not merely \nbe shifted from one funding stream to another.''\n  With regard to that requirement, however, the U.S. Commission on \nCivil Rights adds, ``. . . Congress included language to articulate the \nexpress intent that increased collections not be used to justify lower \nappropriations levels. Congress has failed to abide by this clear \nmandate. Only enhanced collection efforts have made up for shortfalls \ncreated by inflation and population growth, and prevented a continuous \ndecline from 1991 until today.''\n  Growth in Medicaid collections has been used to partially offset the \ndramatic decline in IHS purchasing power over the years, despite the \nFederal provision stating that such revenues should not reduce overall \nIHS spending.\n  The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights noted that `` . . . collections \nfrom third parties increased 453 percent from 1991 to 2003.'' Without \nthat increase, the fate of IHS and health care services for Native \nAmericans would even be more severe.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, GAO, in its August \n2005 report entitled ``Indian Health Service: Health Care Services Are \nNot Always Available to Native Americans'', ``In fiscal year 2004, IHS-\nfunded facilities obtained approximately $628 million in \nreimbursements, with 92 percent collected from Medicare and Medicaid \nand 8 percent from private insurance.''\n  Medicaid collections, alone, have by 2004 ``grown to $446 million, \nwhich is 71 percent of the total third party collections reported by \nIHS In FY 2004, . . . Medicaid collections provided about 16.8 percent \nof the IHS budget for clinical services,'' according to Dixon and \nLocke.\n  Consequently, the administration's own congressional justification \ndocument for its IHS budget proposes just a 2.1-percent increase, or \n$62.9 million, in additional IHS funding in fiscal year 2006 while \nnoting that the IHS will increase their Medicare and Medicaid \ncollections by another $8.4 million in fiscal year 2006. The Northwest \nPortland Area Indian Health Board estimates it will take $371 million \nto maintain current services for IHS and tribally operated health \nprograms. Therefore, the administration's ridiculously low proposed \nincrease for IHS combined with their estimated increase in Medicare and \nMedicaid collections will still fall $300 million short of providing \ncurrent services.\n  Whether intentional or not, as direct IHS funding continues to fail \nto cover inflation or population growth year after year, Medicaid \ncollections are now a growing and critical component to providing basic \nhealth care services by IHS and tribal health organizations. Yet, while \nMedicaid has become critically important to the health of American \nIndians and Alaska Natives, Native Americans constitute a small share \nof overall Medicaid costs. As the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health \nBoard has found, Medicaid accounts for almost 20 percent of the IHS\n\n[[Page S13383]]\n\nbudget but less than 0.5 percent of Medicaid expenditures go to Indian \nhealth.\n  Consequently, the legislation I am introducing today with Senators \nBaucus, Dorgan, Murray, Cantwell, and Johnson entitled the ``Medicaid \nIndian Health Act of 2005'' is primarily an attempt to prevent the \nFederal Government and States from inflicting harm on the health and \nwell-being of American Indians and Alaska Natives, but it also seeks to \ntake a few steps forward as well.\n  What is at stake? First, from the ``do no harm'' prescriptive, both \nthe National Governors' Association, NGA, and the House of \nRepresentatives budget reconciliation legislation contemplate major \nchanges to the Medicaid program to achieve $10 billion or more in \nproposed budget cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. Unfortunately, it is \nclear that neither the NGA nor the House of Representatives considered \nthe tremendous impact that the cuts they are proposing will have on the \nhealth and well-being of Native Americans across this Nation.\n\n  For example, both the NGA and the House budget reconciliation package \nprovide for States being able to impose additional premiums, \ncopayments, and other forms of cost-sharing on low-income Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, including Native Americans. Such changes can have \nenormous consequences for AI/ANs as well as the Indian Health Service, \ntribal, and urban Indian, I/T/U providers from whom many Native \nAmericans receive health services.\n  As Andy Schneider of Medicaid Policy, LLC, stated at a meeting in \nAugust of this year on Medicaid and Indian health care, ``Regrettably, \nthe NGA recommendations [which have been adopted as part of the House \nbudget reconciliation package] could well make matters even worse for \nAI/ANs and the I/T/U providers that serve them. The NGA proposal to \nincrease beneficiary cost-sharing could impose additional financial \nburdens on IHS and tribal health budgets. The NGA proposal for more \nbenefits package `flexibility' could result in significant \nreimbursement losses to I/T/U providers.''\n  How would this occur? With respect to additional cost sharing, \nevidence shows that additional cost sharing either results in reduced \nuse of medical services, which could result in further a decline in the \nhealth status of AI/ANs, or that the I/T/U providers will pick up the \nadded cost sharing burden. As Schneider points out, ``These costs \ninclude not only the amounts of the copayments and deductibles but also \nthe administrative expense of processing them and tracking the \ncumulative out-of-pocket payments, particularly if the services subject \nto cost-sharing are delivered by a non-I/T/U provider.''\n  Even if you subscribe to the ideology that Medicaid beneficiaries \nshould pay more for their health care, as Dixon and Locke point out, \n``The intended outcome of enrollee cost sharing is not achieved in the \nIndian health system and actually acts to further deplete funding.''\n  Put simply, added copayments in Medicaid would result in the \nunintended effect of shifting Medicaid costs directly upon the already \nhorribly underfunded IHS system. In other words, the imposition of \nconsumer cost-sharing provisions by Medicaid on Native American \npopulations would effectively reduce the level and quality of health \ncare services in Indian communities.\n  With respect to benefit flexibility as proposed by NGA and adopted in \nthe House budget reconciliation package, according to Schneider, ``The \neffect of reducing Medicaid coverage will be to reduce Medicaid \nrevenues to the I/T/U providers that furnish covered services to this \npopulation. Services for which the I/T/U could previously collect \nMedicaid revenues will no longer be reimburseable because the patient \nis no longer eligible for Medicaid.''\n  To address these concerns, the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health \nBoard has recommended, ``The Medicaid program could be a more effective \nmeans of financial Indian health programs if it would exempt American \nIndians and Alaska Natives from cost sharing including co-pays, \npremiums and any form of cost sharing. It makes little sense to Indian \npeople to sign up for a health program that charges them for health \ncare services that their tribe gave up lands and others considerations \nto secure for all generations. The practical effect is that they will \nnot sign up for Medicaid and the IHS funded programs will end up paying \nall the costs of their health care. If this becomes the case, CMS will \nsave the federal government millions of dollars, but renege on rights \nguaranteed by law and treaties.''\n  In order to address these important points, one need look no further \nthan the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, rules and \nregulations. As Schneider adds, ``Federal regulations prohibit states \nfrom imposing premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments or AI/\nAN children enrolled in their SCHIP programs. There is no comparable \nregulatory protection for AI/AN children or adults enrolled in \nMedicaid.''\n  Consequently, to prevent harm to the health and well-being of Native \nAmericans, section 3 of the Medicaid Indian Health Act of 2005 would \nexplicitly prohibit imposing such things as premiums or other forms of \ncost sharing on Native Americans within Medicaid, just as SCHIP already \ndoes. Section 4 adds a prohibition on the recovery of the estates of \nAI/AN Medicaid beneficiaries or tribal property by States through the \nMedicaid Program. Furthermore, section 8 of the legislation allows \nStates to include special provisions exempting Native Americans from \nadditional cost sharing or from benefit reductions in recognition of \nthe special circumstances of Native Americans in the Medicaid Program.\n  In light of the failure of the NGA to consider the special \ncircumstances of American Indians and Alaska Natives with respect to \nMedicaid policy, section 5 of the legislation recognizes the Federal \ntrust responsibility and requires the Secretary, prior to the approval \nof any State Medicaid waivers, to assure that there has been \nconsultation with tribes whose members or tribal health programs could \nbe adversely affected by the waiver. Otherwise, the current waiver \nprocess can result in the approval of waivers that may include \nreductions in Medicaid eligibility, benefits and/or reimbursement or \nincreases in cost sharing that can have a negative impact on Native \nAmericans or tribal health programs.\n  In short, sections 3, 4, 5, and 8 seek to adopt a policy of ``do no \nharm'' by preventing changes in Medicaid policy from having negative \nconsequences for Native Americans. Meanwhile, sections 2, 6, and 7 in \nthe bill seek to make some additional progress on behalf of Native \nAmericans through the Medicaid Program.\n  Foremost among those provisions in section 2, which provides for 100 \npercent Federal Medicaid matching funds for services delivered to AI/AN \nMedicaid beneficiaries at urban Indian health programs. Although the \nMedicaid statute currently provides for 100 percent Federal Medicaid \nmatching funds for Medicaid services delivered to AI/ANs through IHS \nfacilities and a subsequent Memorandum of Agreement, MOA, in 1996 \nclarified those payments also apply to services provided through \ntribally owned facilities, the 100 Percent Federal Medical Assistance \nPercentage, FMAP, does not apply to urban Indian clinics.\n  In short, if an AI/AN Medicaid beneficiary received services from an \nIHS or tribal facility, the Federal Government is paying 100 percent of \nthe cost, but if the same individual received the same services from an \nurban Indian health program funded by the IHS, the Federal Government \nshifts part of the costs of that care to the State in proportion to the \nState's share of the FMAP. There is no justification for this cost \nshift. Just as IHS and tribal facilities are part of the I/T/U delivery \nsystem for Native Americans, so are urban Indian health programs and, \nas part of the ``Federal trust responsibility,'' States should not be \nrequired to subsidize any element of this system.\n\n  Section 6 of the legislation would simply ensure that I/T/U providers \nthat do not have the status of federally qualified health centers, \nFQHCs, receive the same level of reimbursement from Medicaid managed \ncare organizations, MCOs, as they would if they were a FQHC. If \nMedicaid MCOs are continued to be allowed to pay I/T/U providers less \nfor the same services that they pay other network providers, the I/T/U \nproviders will, effectively, be subsidizing the MCO or other network \nproviders, which is not an appropriate use of limited federal IHS \nresources.\n\n[[Page S13384]]\n\n  And finally, section 7 of the Medicaid Indian Health Act of 2005 \nensures that IHS spending on behalf of a Native American does not \ndisqualify them for Medicaid coverage under the ``medically needy \noption.'' Current policy prohibits such care from counting toward the \n``spend down'' requirements for qualifying as ``medically needy'' in \nMedicaid. Receiving services at an IHS facility should certainly not \ndisqualify anybody from Medicaid coverage and, once again, IHS should \nnot be subsidizing the Medicaid program.\n  In total, the provisions in the Medicaid Indian Health Act of 2005 \nmight at first glance appear to be a hodge podge set of provisions \nrelated to both Medicaid and Indian health. However, they are not. They \nreflect a concerted effort on behalf of Native American people to \nprotect the gains that have already been made within the Medicaid \nProgram for American Indians and Alaska Natives and the need to make \nadditional strides to improve the delivery of health services \nthroughout to Native people, including those in urban areas, through \nMedicaid.\n  Furthermore, this is just the first in a series of bills addressing \nIndian issues within the Medicaid and Medicare Programs. The next two \nwill focus, respectively, on improving the Medicare Program and fixing \nproblems with respect to the Medicare prescription drug program for \nNative Americans and Indian health providers.\n  As part of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 report, the \nCongress said, ``The most basic human right must be the right to enjoy \ndecent health. Certainly, any effort to fulfill Federal \nresponsibilities to the Indian people must begin with the provision of \nhealth services. In fact, health services must be the cornerstone upon \nwhich rest all the other Federal programs for the benefit of Indians. \nWithout a proper health status, the Indian people will be unable to \nfully avail themselves of the many economic, educational, and social \nprograms already directed to them or which this Congress and future \nCongresses will provide them.''\n  The Federal Government has a ``Federal trust responsibility'' to \nIndian people that it is simple not fulfilling. This administration and \nthis Congress can and simply must do better. Part of that multipronged \nagenda should include passage of the Medicaid Indian Health Act of \n2005.\n  This could occur in a variety of ways. First, the provision from this \nbill could be incorporated in any budget reconciliation conference \nreport package. Consequently, during Finance Committee consideration of \nthe Senate's version of the budget reconciliation package on October \n25, 2005, I offered an amendment that included a number of the \nprovisions from this bill. Opponents of the amendment, which failed on \na 9-to-11 party-line vote with Democrats in favor and Republicans \nopposing it, argued at the time that the budget reconciliation package \nwas not the right vehicle but that we should look to the \nreauthorization bill for the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nattach these provisions instead.\n  Two days later, on October 27, 2005, the Committee on Indian Affairs \ntook up and passed S. 1057, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \nAmendments of 2005, but did not include any of the Medicaid provisions \nI have been discussing as part of this bill. They were told that \ninclusion of Medicaid provisions within IHCIA was objected to by both \nthe administration and the Senate Finance Committee. However, in light \nof the Senate Finance Committee's failure to take up the amendment \nearlier this month, another possible vehicle should be the \nreauthorization bill for the Indian Health Care Improvement Act when it \ncomes to the Senate floor.\n  And finally, if we fail to get these provisions included in either of \nthose legislative vehicles, we will push to get the Medicaid Indian \nHealth Act of 2005 passed as a free standing piece of legislation. \nMedicaid has become such a crucial and necessary piece in maintaining \nand improving the health and well-being of American Indians and Alaska \nNatives that it is unacceptable that the various Senate committees \npoint to each other as being in charge while not taking the necessary \nresponsibility to get this important protections for Native Americans \npassed into law.\n  The Federal Government and the States also point figures at each \nother as to who is in charge. As Jim Crouch, executive director of the \nCalifornia Rural Indian Health Board, has said, ``The joint operation \nof the Medicaid program by federal and state authorities often ignores \nthe governmental status of Tribes and the unique needs of Tribal \ncitizens. It is always appropriate for the federal government to \nestablish special provisions that are in the best interest of Tribes \nand American Indians due to the governmental status of federally \nrecognized tribes.''\n  Mr. President, it is well past time to enact legislative initiatives \nsuch as the Medicaid Indian Health Act of 2005 and reauthorization of \nIHCIA. Years of broken promises to Indian Country must come to an end. \nPassage of the provisions in both the Medicaid Indian Health Act of \n2005 and IHCIA reauthorization are just two of the pieces that the \nFederal Government must take in order to fulfill the Federal trust \nresponsibility and make real progress at providing the full array of \nmedically necessary health services that have been long promised to \nAmerican Indians.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a fact sheet \ndescribing the various provisions in the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2074\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), this \n     Act and the amendments made by this Act apply to items or \n     services furnished on or after January 1, 2006.\n       (b) Extension of Effective Date for State Law Amendment.--\n     In the case of a State plan under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act which the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     determines requires State legislation in order for the plan \n     to meet the additional requirements imposed by the amendments \n     made by a provision of this Act, the State plan shall not be \n     regarded as failing to comply with the requirements of this \n     Act solely on the basis of its failure to meet these \n     additional requirements before the first day of the first \n     calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first \n     regular session of the State legislature that begins after \n     the date of enactment of this Act. For purposes of the \n     previous sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year \n     legislative session, each year of the session shall be \n     considered to be a separate regular session of the State \n     legislature.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Fact Sheet--``Medicaid Indian Health Act of 2005''\n\n       Senators Bingaman, Baucus, Dorgan, Murray, Cantwell, and \n     Johnson are introducing legislation entitled the ``Medicaid \n     Indian Health Act of 2005'' that would make technical but \n     important changes to the Medicaid program to address the \n     unique issues confronting Native Americans and Indian Health \n     Service (IHS) providers within that program.\n       The provisions within this legislation are as follows:\n\n\n  Sec. 2. 100% FMAP for Services to AI/AN Medicaid Patients of Urban \n                         Indian Health Programs\n\n     Current Law\n       The cost of covered services to AI/AN Medicaid \n     beneficiaries is matched by the federal government at a 100% \n     rate if the services are received through an IHS facility, \n     whether operated by the IHS or a tribe or tribal \n     organization. However, the federal government matches the \n     cost of covered services furnished to AI/AN Medicaid \n     beneficiaries by urban Indian health programs funded by the \n     IHS only at a state's regular federal matching rate, which \n     varies from 50% to 77%. Thus, states must pay a share of the \n     cost of Medicaid services furnished to AI/AN beneficiaries by \n     urban Indian health programs.\n     Proposed Change\n       Extend the 100% federal matching rate to services received \n     through an urban Indian health program receiving funds under \n     Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n     Justification\n       Under current policy, if an AI/AN Medicaid beneficiary \n     receives covered services from an IHS or tribal hospital or \n     clinic, the federal government pays 100% of the cost, but if \n     the same individual receives covered services from an urban \n     Indian health program funded by the IHS, the federal \n     government shifts part of the costs to the state in \n     proportion to the state's share of Medicaid spending \n     generally. There is no principled justification for this cost \n     shift. Just as IHS and tribal facilities receive IHS funds, \n     so do urban Indian health programs. The urban Indian health \n     programs are part of the same ``I/T/U'' delivery system as \n     are IHS and tribal facilities. States should not be required \n     to subsidize any element of this system.\n\n\n Sec. 3. Prohibiting Imposition of Medicaid Premiums on AI/AN Medicaid \n                             Beneficiaries\n\n     Current Law\n       State Medicaid programs are allowed to impose premiums only \n     on certain categories of Medicaid beneficiaries--principally \n     those who qualify as ``medically needy'' by incurring \n     high medical expenses that, when applied against their \n     income, enable them to ``spend down'' into eligibility. \n     Any premiums imposed on this group must be income-related, \n     as specified in federal regulations. In contrast, State \n     SCHIP programs are prohibited by regulation from imposing \n     premiums on AI/AN beneficiaries.\n     Proposed Change\n       Prohibit states from imposing any premiums, enrollment \n     fees, or similar charges in any amount on AI/AN \n     beneficiaries, regardless of the basis of eligibility for \n     Medicaid.\n     Justification\n       The Federal government, through the IHS, has the \n     responsibility for providing health care free of charge to \n     AI/ANs eligible for its services. Thus, if a state imposes a \n     premium requirement as a condition of Medicaid enrollment, in \n     the case of an AI/AN the premium must be paid by the IHS or \n     the contracting tribe from the limited federal funds \n     allocated to it. The effect is to reduce the appropriated \n     funds available to the IHS or tribal facility for serving \n     patients who are eligible for IHS services but are not \n     eligible for Medicaid. In this respect, Medicaid policy \n     should be conformed to SCHIP policy.\n\n\n  Sec. 3. Prohibiting Imposition of Medicaid Copayments or Other Cost-\n                Sharing on AI/AN Medicaid Beneficiaries\n\n     Current Law\n       States Medicaid programs may impose deductibles, \n     copayments, or co-insurance requirements on certain services \n     with respect to certain populations. Any cost-sharing imposed \n     must be ``nominal'' in amount, as defined in federal \n     regulations. States are prohibited from imposing any cost-\n     sharing, nominal or otherwise, on certain services (e.g., \n     emergency services and family planning services and supplies) \n     and certain populations (e.g., children under 18). In \n     contrast, State SCHIP programs are prohibited by regulation \n     from imposing deductibles, copayments, or co-insurance \n     requirements on AI/AN beneficiaries.\n     Proposed Change\n       Prohibit states from imposing deductibles, copayments, or \n     co-insurance requirements in any amount on AI/AN Medicaid \n     beneficiaries.\n     Justification\n       The Federal government, through the IHS, has the \n     responsibility for providing health care free of charge to \n     AI/ANs eligible for its services. Thus, if a state imposes \n     deductibles, copayments, or co-insurance requirements, in the \n     case of an AI/AN beneficiary cost-sharing amount must be paid \n     by the IHS or the contracting tribe from the limited federal \n     funds allocated to it. The effect is to reduce the \n     appropriated funds available to the IHS or tribal facility \n     for serving patients who are eligible for IHS services but \n     are not eligible for Medicaid. In this respect, Medicaid \n     policy should be conformed to SCHIP policy.\n\n\n  Sec. 4. Prohibiting Recovery Against the Estates of AI/AN Medicaid \n                             Beneficiaries\n\n     Current Law\n       States are required to recover from the estates of deceased \n     Medicaid beneficiaries the costs of long-term care services \n     (nursing facility services, home and community-based \n     services, and related hospital services and prescription \n     drugs) paid for by Medicaid when the individual was age 55 or \n     over. The state may not recover against an individual's \n     estate until the death of any surviving spouse and so long as \n     there is not a child under 21 or an adult child who is blind \n     or disabled. Under federal administrative guidance, certain \n     AI/AN property is exempt from estate recovery.\n     Proposed Change\n       Exempt the property/estates of deceased AI/AN beneficiaries \n     from recovery for costs correctly paid by Medicaid.\n     Justification\n       The Federal government, through the IHS, has the \n     responsibility for providing health care to AI/ANs eligible \n     for its services. Because the IHS, due to funding \n     limitations, generally does not have the capacity to furnish \n     long-term care services, low-income AI/ANs who are eligible \n     for IHS services must turn to Medicaid for coverage for this \n     care. To recover Medicaid costs correctly paid from the \n     estates of these individuals violates the Federal \n     government's responsibility to them. Tribal lands and \n     property should not be threatened by federal or state \n     governments.\n\n\nSec. 5. Requiring Tribal Consultation Prior to Approval of Section 1115 \n                                Waivers\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 1115 of the Social Security Act, the \n     Secretary of HHS has the authority to waive certain \n     requirements of federal Medicaid law to enable states to \n     conduct demonstrations that, in his judgment, ``is likely to \n     assist in promoting the objectives of'' the Medicaid program. \n     Section 1115 contains no requirement that the Secretary \n     consult with Indian tribes prior to approval of Medicaid \n     demonstration waivers that may adversely affect their members \n     or their tribal health programs. The January 2005 HHS\n\n[[Page S13386]]\n\n     tribal consultation policy does not specify that consultation \n     is required in these specific circumstances, although the \n     previous July 2001 guidance had.\n     Proposed Change\n       Require the Secretary, prior to approval of any new section \n     1115 waiver or renewal of any existing section 1115 waiver to \n     consult with tribes whose members or tribal health programs \n     could be affected by the waiver.\n     Justification\n       Section 1115 waivers are commonly negotiated by the \n     Secretary (acting through CMS) and the Governor of the state \n     seeking the waiver (through his Medicaid or Budget director). \n     Affected Indian tribes have no formal role in these \n     negotiations, even when those negotiations result in \n     reductions in Medicaid eligibility, benefits, and/or \n     reimbursement or increases in premiums and cost-sharing that \n     have an adverse impact on tribal members or tribal health \n     programs.\n\n\n    sec. 6. require fair payment by medicaid mcos to i/t/u providers\n\n     Current Law\n       Managed care organizations (MCOs) contracting with Medicaid \n     on a risk basis are required to pay health care providers, \n     whether in- or out-of-network, on a timely basis for covered \n     services furnished to Medicaid beneficiaries. Although there \n     are generally no minimum payment requirements, in the case of \n     federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and rural health \n     clinics (RHCs), MCOs are required to pay the same amount for \n     a covered service as they would if the provider were not an \n     FQHC or RHC. In addition, the State Medicaid agency is \n     required to pay the difference, if any, between: (1) the \n     MCO's payment to the FQHC or RHC; and, (2) the prospective \n     payment amount to which the FQHC or RHC is entitled under \n     Medicaid law. There is no similar protection for I/T/U \n     providers that are not FQHCs or RHCs.\n     Proposed Change\n       Require that MCOs to pay I/T/U providers that are not FQHCs \n     or RHCs the same amount that the MCO would pay for the same \n     service to a non-I/T/U provider.\n     Justification\n       Current law protects I/T/U providers that are FQHCs or \n     Rural Health Clinics against underpayment by Medicaid MCOs. \n     This provision extends some of these protections to other I/\n     T/U providers. If Medicaid MCOs are allowed to pay I/T/U \n     providers less for the same services than they pay other \n     network providers, the I/T/U providers will, in effect, be \n     subsidizing the MCO or other network providers. This is not \n     an appropriate use of limited federal IHS resources.\n\n\n    Sec. 7. Treatment of IHS or Tribal Payments as Incurred Medical \n                                Expenses\n\n     Current Law\n       States have the option of extending Medicaid coverage to \n     individuals who are ``medically needy''--that is, individuals \n     who ``spend-down'' by incurring high medical expenses that, \n     when subtracted from their incomes, reduce their incomes to \n     below the state eligibility threshold. If the IHS or a Tribe \n     pays the health care costs of an AI/AN, that individual is \n     not considered to have ``incurred'' the cost for purposes of \n     meeting the ``spend-down'' requirements for qualifying as \n     ``medically needy.''\n     Proposal\n       Allow medical expenses paid by the IHS or a Tribe or tribal \n     organization on behalf of an AI/AN to count as costs \n     ``incurred'' for medical care for purposes of establishing \n     eligibility for Medicaid in states with ``medically needy'' \n     programs.\n     Justification\n       Current policy has the effect of disqualifying AI/ANs from \n     Medicaid eligibility as ``medically needy'' individuals. \n     This, in turn, results in IHS, Tribes, and tribal \n     organizations paying for services that Medicaid would \n     otherwise cover once these individuals established \n     ``medically needy'' eligibility. Subsidizing Medicaid is not \n     an appropriate use of limited IHS and Tribal resources.\n\n\n    sec. 8. option for states to exempt indians from reductions in \n                        eligibility or benefits\n\n     Current Law\n       CMS policy has been to acknowledge the federal government's \n     unique responsibilities under the trust obligation and to \n     take into account special circumstances of American Indians \n     and Alaska Natives in Medicaid and SCHIP programs. As such, \n     states have historically been allowed to include special \n     provisions with respect to Tribes and Indian people in their \n     Medicaid and SCHIP programs. However, in 2004, CMS informed \n     Oregon and Washington that it would not approve waiver \n     amendments containing special provisions for Indian \n     participation in the Medicaid program.\n     Proposed Change\n       Secretary shall not disapprove a state Plan amendment, or \n     deny a state request for a waiver under section 1115, on the \n     grounds that the amendment or waiver would exempt eligible \n     Indians (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care \n     Improvement Act) from:\n       (1) any restriction on eligibility for medical assistance \n     under this Title that would otherwise apply under the \n     amendment or waiver;\n       (2) any imposition of premiums, deductibles, copayments or \n     other cost-sharing that would otherwise apply under the \n     amendment or waiver; or\n       (3) any reduction in covered services or supplies that \n     would otherwise apply under the amendment or waiver.''\n     Justification\n       The federal government should continue to acknowledge the \n     federal government's unique responsibilities under the trust \n     obligation and to take into account and allow states to take \n     into account the special circumstances of American Indians \n     and Alaska Natives in Medicaid and SCHIP programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. McCain, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 2075.

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide to \nassistant United States attorneys the same retirement benefits as are \nafforded to Federal law enforcement officers; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased to join with Senator Hatch in introducing the \nAssistant United States Attorney Retirement Benefit Equity Act of 2005. \nThis bill was previously introduced in the 107th and 108th Congresses. \nA House companion bill, H.R. 3183, has already been introduced and \ncurrently has 43 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  Fairness is the driving force behind this legislation. The bill would \ncorrect an inequity that exists under current law, whereby AUSAs \nreceive substantially less favorable retirement benefits than nearly \nall other people involved in the Federal criminal justice system. The \nbill would increase the retirement benefits given to AUSAs, as well as \nother designated attorneys employed by DOJ who act primarily as \ncriminal prosecutors, by including them in the Civil Service Retirement \nSystem. This change would bring their retirement benefits inline with \nthousands of other employees involved in the Federal criminal justice \nsystem.\n  Enhanced retirement benefits will allow us to attract and retain the \nbest and the brightest for these vital positions in Government. As a \nformer prosecutor, I know that experienced prosecutors are needed to \nbring ever more sophisticated cases under increasingly complex federal \ncriminal laws. The Government's success in combating the threats posed \nby organized crime, drug cartels, terrorist groups, and other \nsophisticated criminals depends upon representation by skilled, \nexperienced litigators.\n  Because of the lure of higher salaries and benefits, the average \nassistant U.S. attorney remains with the Department of Justice only 8 \nyears. The hours are long, the pay is low, and they place themselves in \nharm's way by prosecuting criminals. Surveys of assistant U.S. \nattorneys have shown that a fair retirement benefit is the foremost \nincentive that would increase their tenure with the Department of \nJustice. Creating an enticement for them to remain with the Department \nof Justice for the length of their careers would be a tremendous \nvictory for the American people. This legislation would improve public \nsafety for us all by ensuring a strong, knowledgeable, and experienced \ncrop of prosecutors at the federal level.\n  I want to thank Senators Hatch, Mikulski, Durbin, DeWine, Biden, \nFeinstein, Feingold, Smith, Dodd, Chambliss, Rockefeller, Lieberman, \nBoxer, Wyden, Nelson, and Corzine, for cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2076\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Assistant United States \n     Attorney Retirement Benefit Equity Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to clarify \nthe authority of the National Indian Gaming Commission to regulate \nclass III gaming, to limit the lands eligible for gaming, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to amend \nregulatory provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). The \nbill clarifies that the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) has \nauthority to promulgate and enforce Minimum Internal Control Standards \nas to Class III gaming; grants the NIGC Chairman authority to approve \ncontracts, and expands contract approval to include contracts not only \nfor management contracts but also for gaming operation development \ncontracts and consulting services, as well as for any contract the fees \nfor which are to be paid as a percentage of gaming revenue; tightens \nrestrictions on off-reservation gaming;\n\n[[Page S13390]]\n\ngives the NIGC authority to issue complaints against any individual or \nentity, not just against tribes or management contractors, that violate \nIGRA or federal regulations; and requires all tribes to pay fees to the \nNIGC.\n  When IGRA was enacted in 1988, Indian gaming was a $200 million \ndollar industry. Today, the industry earns $19 billion a year and is \nspread throughout the nation. The amendments reflect the need to re-\nevaluate what constitutes appropriate regulation of this vastly changed \nenterprise. I have always been and continue to be a supporter of the \nrights of Indian tribes to conduct gaming, a right guaranteed by the \nSupreme Court in the California v. Cabazon decision and codified in \nIGRA, but I also continue to believe that effective regulation of these \nenterprises are critical to tribes' continued success.\n  Ensuring that the NIGC is able to continue its oversight of Class ill \ngaming is necessary to this effective regulation. On August 24, 2005, \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued its \ndecision in Colorado River Indian Tribes v. NIGC (``CRIT''), ruling \nthat the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) did not have \njurisdiction to issue Class ill Minimum Internal Controls Standards \n(MICS). These standards regulate day-to-day operations of gaming \noperations. Specifically, they provide rules that designate how cash is \nhandled by the gaming operation, prescribe surveillance over game play, \nand provide auditing procedures.\n  Until the Court's decision, the NIGC had been regulating Class ill \ngaming through MICS since 1999. The regulations applied both to Class \nII gaming--that is, bingo and games similar to bingo--and to Class III \ngaming--including slot machines and table games--which represents the \nlargest source of revenue in Indian gaming. Following to CRIT decision \nthis summer, however, some tribes have challenged NIGC's authority to \nissue or enforce the MICS. Although without NIGC authority, oversight \nof Class ill gaming may be provided by tribal-State compacts, States' \nroles in enforcement varies widely and many have left such regulation \nto NIGC. In a Nationwide industry, uniform federal minimum internal \ncontrol standards are appropriate. This amendment makes clear that NIGC \ncontinues to have the authority it has exercised until now to issue and \nenforce MICS, including the ability to inspect facilities and audit \npremises in order to assure compliance.\n  Protecting the integrity of Indian gaming also requires that the \nNIGC's authority to review manager contracts be expanded. IGRA \noriginally identified only one kind of contract that was subject to \nNIGC approval: management contracts. History has shown, however, that \nin order to avoid NIGC review, some contracts have been fashioned as \n``consulting'' contracts or ``development'' contracts, i.e., something \nother than ``management'' contracts that require NIGC review. In these \ncases, tribes run the risk that contractors will enforce unfair \ncontract terms, and tribes and patrons run the risk that the tribe will \ncontract with unsuitable partners. This amendment extends NIGC approval \nto all significant gaming operation related contracts so that the \nIndian gaming industry remains, as far as possible, free from \nunscrupulous and unsuitable contractors.\n  Related to protecting the integrity of Indian gaming is the issue of \noff-reservation gaming. When enacted in 1988, IGRA generally banned \nIndian gaming that was not located on reservations, however, in the \ninterest of fairness, several exceptions to this ban were provided. \nExploitation of these exceptions, not anticipated at the time IGRA was \nenacted, has led to a burgeoning practice by unscrupulous developers \nseeking to profit off Indian tribes desperate for economic development. \nPredictably, these ill-advised deals have invited a backlash against \nIndian gaming generally. These amendments to IGRA will put an end to \nthe most troublesome of these proposals by eliminating the authority of \nthe Secretary to take land into trust off-reservation pursuant to the \nso-called ``two-part determination'' provisions of Section 20.\n  In addressing concerns about other exceptions in Section 20 for land \nclaims, initial reservations and restored reservations, these \namendments strike a balance by curbing potential abuses of these \nexceptions, while not unfairly penalizing those who lost their lands \nthrough no fault of their own, or even had them taken illegally--often \nby force. Thus, newly recognized and restored tribes may still obtain \nlands, and conduct gaming on them, but such lands must be in the area \nwhere the particular tribe has its most significant ties. This has been \nthe case for most newly recognized and restored tribes, and surely is \nnot unfair to impose on all similarly situated tribes. For tribes that \nsuccessfully reclaim lands taken illegally and want to conduct gaming \non them, these amendments will require congressional confirmation and \nthe lands must be within the state where the tribe has or had its last \nreservation. This provision does not impair any tribe's legal rights to \nreclaim lands, but will discourage attempts by creative non-Indian \ndevelopers to turn a tribe's legal rights into a form of extortion.\n  Ensuring that penalties are appropriate and can be brought against \nthe responsible party is another means of protecting the integrity of \nIndian gaming. To this end the bill clarifies that civil penalties can \nbe imposed on any violator of IGRA, not just Indian tribes or \nmanagement contractors.\n  Finally, this bill will ensure fairness in the regulation of Indian \ngaming by assuring that all tribes bear their appropriate share of the \ncost of regulation so that the industry, as a whole, continues to \nprosper. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2078\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Forests for \nFuture Generations Act, because it addresses a very serious problem in \nour National Forests. I am not sure how many people in this body have \nwitnessed the devastation of a catastrophic wildfire, but I recommend \nthat everyone tour a burned over forest. It is a sobering reality, \noften resembling a moonscape.\n  The worst fire year in recent Montana history was the summer of 2000, \nwhen we burned 945,000 acres of productive Montana land. After months \nof smoke-filled air, we were left with decimated wildlife habitat, \ncharred hillsides, sediment-filled streams, and millions of board feet \nof dead, standing timber. Active forest management would require that \nrestoration of these fragile soils and ecosystems begin as soon as \npossible, but that is almost never the case on national forest land. \nInstead, we spend millions of dollars and thousands of hours writing a \nplan to restore the burned area, which is inevitably appealed, \nchallenged, and litigated by an environmental group. We end up arguing \nin the courtroom when we should be working in the forest.\n  I have seen side-by-side sections of land where private landowners or \neven the State of Montana has taken quick action and removed some dead \nor dying timber then replanted the forest. News are growing on the \nprivate land before any of the Federal timber is even harvested. It is \namazing to me, and it makes absolutely no sense. For that\n\n[[Page S13394]]\n\nreason I am happy to cosponsor this bill, because it is time to \nreintroduce some common sense into a system that has gone far off the \ntracks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13394-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13394-S13395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 320--CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT TO ENSURE THAT THE \nFOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES REFLECTS APPROPRIATE UNDERSTANDING \n   AND SENSITIVITY CONCERNING ISSUES RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS, ETHNIC \nCLEANSING, AND GENOCIDE DOCUMENTED IN THE UNITED STATES RECORD RELATING \n                        TO THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN (for himself and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res 320\n\n       Whereas the Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out \n     by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, resulting in the \n     deportation of nearly 2,000,000 Armenians, of whom 1,500,000 \n     men, women, and children were killed, 500,000 survivors were \n     expelled from their homes, and which succeeded in the \n     elimination of more than 2,500-year presence of Armenians in \n     their historic homeland;\n       Whereas, on May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers issued the \n     joint statement of England, France, and Russia that \n     explicitly charged, for the first time ever, another \n     government of committing ``a crime against humanity'';\n       Whereas that joint statement stated ``the Allied \n     Governments announce publicly to the Sublime Porte that they \n     will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members \n     of the Ottoman Government, as well as those of their agents \n     who are implicated in such massacres'';\n       Whereas the post-World War I Turkish Government indicted \n     the top leaders involved in the ``organization and \n     execution'' of the Armenian Genocide and in the ``massacre \n     and destruction of the Armenians'';\n       Whereas in a series of courts-martial, officials of the \n     Young Turk Regime were tried and convicted on charges of \n     organizing and executing massacres against the Armenian \n     people;\n       Whereas the officials who were the chief organizers of the \n     Armenian Genocide, Minister of War Enver, Minister of the \n     Interior Talaat, and Minister of the Navy Jemal, were tried \n     by military tribunals, found guilty, and condemned to death \n     for their crimes, however, the punishments imposed by the \n     tribunals were not enforced;\n       Whereas the Armenian Genocide and the failure to carry out \n     the death sentence against Enver, Talaat, and Jemal are \n     documented with overwhelming evidence in the national \n     archives of Austria, France, Germany, Russia, the United \n     Kingdom, the United States, the Vatican, and many other \n     countries, and this vast body of evidence attests to the same \n     facts, the same events, and the same consequences;\n       Whereas the National Archives and Records Administration of \n     the United States holds extensive and thorough documentation \n     on the Armenian Genocide, especially in its holdings for the \n     Department of State under Record Group 59, files 867.00 and \n     867.40, which are open and widely available to the public and \n     interested institutions;\n       Whereas the Honorable Henry Morgenthau, United States \n     Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to 1916, organized \n     and led protests by officials of many countries, among them \n     the allies of the Ottoman Empire, against the Armenian \n     Genocide;\n       Whereas Ambassador Morgenthau explicitly described to the \n     Department of State the policy of the Government of the \n     Ottoman Empire as ``a campaign of race extermination'', and \n     was instructed on July 16, 1915, by Secretary of State Robert \n     Lansing that the ``Department approves your procedure . . . \n     to stop Armenian persecution'';\n       Whereas Senate Concurrent Resolution 12, 64th Congress, \n     agreed to July 18, 1916, resolved that ``the President of the \n     United States be respectfully asked to designate a day on \n     which the citizens of this country may give expression to \n     their sympathy by contributing funds now being raised for the \n     relief of the Armenians'', who, at that time, were enduring \n     ``starvation, disease, and untold suffering'';\n       Whereas President Woodrow Wilson agreed with such \n     Concurrent Resolution and encouraged the formation of the \n     organization known as Near East Relief, which was \n     incorporated by the Act of August 6, 1919, 66th Congress (41 \n     Stat. 273, chapter 32);\n       Whereas, from 1915 through 1930, Near East Relief \n     contributed approximately $116,000,000 to aid survivors of \n     the Armenian Genocide, including aid to approximately 132,000 \n     Armenian orphans;\n       Whereas Senate Resolution 359, 66th Congress, agreed to May \n     11, 1920, stated in part, ``the testimony adduced at the \n     hearings conducted by the subcommittee of the Senate \n     Committee on Foreign Relations have clearly established the \n     truth of the reported massacres and other atrocities from \n     which the Armenian people have suffered'';\n       Whereas such Senate Resolution followed the report to the \n     Senate of the American Military Mission to Armenia, which was \n     led by General James Harbord, dated April 13, 1920, that \n     stated ``[m]utilation, violation, torture, and death have \n     left their haunting memories in a hundred beautiful Armenian \n     valleys, and the traveler in that region is seldom free from \n     the evidence of this most colossal crime of all the ages'';\n       Whereas, as displayed in the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Museum, Adolf Hitler, on ordering his military \n     commanders to attack Poland without provocation in 1939, \n     dismissed objections by saying ``[w]ho, after all, speaks \n     today of the annihilation of the Armenians?'' and thus set \n     the stage for the Holocaust;\n       Whereas Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term ``genocide'' in \n     1944, and who was the earliest proponent of the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, invoked the \n     Armenian case as a definitive example of genocide in the 20th \n     century;\n       Whereas the first resolution on genocide adopted by the \n     United Nations, United Nations General Assembly Resolution \n     96(1), dated December 11, 1946, (which was adopted at the \n     urging of Raphael Lemkin), and the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, done at Paris December \n     9, 1948, recognized the Armenian Genocide as the type of \n     crime the United Nations intended to prevent and punish by \n     codifying existing standards;\n       Whereas, in 1948, the United Nations War Crimes Commission \n     invoked the Armenian Genocide as ``precisely . . . one of the \n     types of acts which the modern term `crimes against humanity' \n     is intended to cover'' and as a precedent for the Nuremberg \n     tribunals;\n       Whereas such Commission stated that ``[t]he provisions of \n     Article 230 of the Peace Treaty of Sevres were obviously \n     intended to cover, in conformity with the Allied note of 1915 \n     . . . offenses which had been committed on Turkish territory \n     against persons of Turkish citizenship, though of Armenian or \n     Greek race. This article constitutes therefore a precedent \n     for Article 6c and 5c of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters, \n     and offers an example of one of the categories of `crimes \n     against humanity' as understood by these enactments'';\n       Whereas House Joint Resolution 148, 94th Congress, adopted \n     by the House of Representatives on April 8, 1975, resolved \n     that ``April 24, 1975, is hereby designated as `National Day \n     of Remembrance of Man's Inhumanity to Man', and the President \n     of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to \n     observe such day as a day of remembrance for all the victims \n     of genocide, especially those of Armenian ancestry'';\n       Whereas Proclamation 4838 of April 22, 1981 (95 Stat. 1813) \n     issued by President Ronald Reagan, stated, in part, that \n     ``[l]ike the genocide of the Armenians before it, and the \n     genocide of the Cambodians which followed it--and like too \n     many other persecutions of too many other people--the lessons \n     of the Holocaust must never be forgotten'';\n       Whereas House Joint Resolution 247, 98th Congress, adopted \n     by the House of Representatives on September 10, 1984, \n     resolved that ``April 24, 1985, is hereby designated as \n     `National Day of Remembrance of Man's Inhumanity to Man', and \n     the President of the United States is authorized and \n     requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of \n     the United States to observe such day as a day of remembrance \n     for all the victims of genocide, especially the one and one-\n     half million people of Armenian ancestry'';\n       Whereas, in August 1985, after extensive study and \n     deliberation, the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention \n     of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities voted 14 to 1 \n     to accept a report entitled ``Study of the Question of the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide'', which \n     stated ``[t]he Nazi aberration has unfortunately not been the \n     only case of genocide in the 20th century. Among other \n     examples which can be cited as qualifying are . . . the \n     Ottoman massacre of Armenians in 1915-1916'';\n       Whereas such report also explained that ``[a]t least \n     1,000,000, and possibly well over half of the Armenian \n     population, are reliably estimated to have been killed or \n     death marched by independent authorities and eye-witnesses \n     and this is corroborated by reports in United States, German, \n     and British archives and of contemporary diplomats in the \n     Ottoman Empire, including those of its ally Germany'';\n       Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, an \n     independent Federal agency that serves as the board of \n     trustees of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum \n     pursuant to section 2302 of title 36, United States Code, \n     unanimously resolved on April 30, 1981, that the Museum would \n     exhibit information regarding the Armenian Genocide and the \n     Museum has since done so;\n       Whereas, reviewing an aberrant 1982 expression by the \n     Department of State (which was later retracted) that asserted \n     that the facts of the Armenian Genocide may be ambiguous, the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     in 1993, after a review of documents pertaining to the policy \n     record of the United States, noted that the assertion on \n     ambiguity in the United States record about the Armenian \n     Genocide ``contradicted longstanding United States policy and \n     was eventually retracted'';\n       Whereas, on June 5, 1996, the House of Representatives \n     adopted an amendment to H.R. 3540, 104th Congress (the \n     Foreign Operations,\n\n[[Page S13395]]\n\n     Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, \n     1997), to reduce aid to Turkey by $3,000,000 (an estimate of \n     its payment of lobbying fees in the United States) until the \n     Turkish Government acknowledged the Armenian Genocide and \n     took steps to honor the memory of its victims;\n       Whereas President William Jefferson Clinton, on April 24, \n     1998, stated, ``[t]his year, as in the past, we join with \n     Armenian-Americans throughout the nation in commemorating one \n     of the saddest chapters in the history of this century, the \n     deportations and massacres of a million and a half Armenians \n     in the Ottoman Empire in the years 1915-1923'';\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, on April 24, 2004, \n     stated, ``[o]n this day, we pause in remembrance of one of \n     the most horrible tragedies of the 20th century, the \n     annihilation of as many as 1,500,000 Armenians through forced \n     exile and murder at the end of the Ottoman Empire''; and\n       Whereas, despite the international recognition and \n     affirmation of the Armenian Genocide, the failure of the \n     domestic and international authorities to punish those \n     responsible for the Armenian Genocide is a reason why similar \n     genocides have recurred and may recur in the future, and that \n     a just resolution will help prevent future genocides: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the President to ensure that the foreign \n     policy of the United States reflects appropriate \n     understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to \n     human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in \n     the United States record relating to the Armenian Genocide \n     and the consequences of the failure to realize a just \n     resolution; and\n       (2) calls on the President, in the President's annual \n     message commemorating the Armenian Genocide issued on or \n     about April 24 to accurately characterize the systematic and \n     deliberate annihilation of 1,500,000 Armenians as genocide \n     and to recall the proud history of United States intervention \n     in opposition to the Armenian Genocide.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recall and to honor the \n1.5 million Armenians killed by the Ottoman government between 1915 and \n1923. Genocides claimed the lives of some 60 million people in the \ncentury just past, 16 million after the end of the Second World War, \nwhen we told ourselves, ``Never again.'' The Armenian Genocide was the \n20th century's first genocide, a vicious, organized crime against \nhumanity that included murder, deportation, torture, and slave labor.\n  Some would ignore the Armenian victims and forget how they died. We \nneed to fight against such forgetfulness.\n  An Armenian named Vahram Dadrian was a survivor of the genocide and \nwrote about his experiences in a moving memoir. But by the 1940s, he \nhad begun to lose hope. ``Everything has been forgotten,'' he wrote, \n``our . . . dead could never have imagined, even for a fraction of a \nmoment, that they would have been forgotten so soon.''\n  We must restore that lost hope. We must not forget. To do so would \ndishonor the memories of the dead and send a message to the world that \nwe might tolerate genocide.\n  We will not tolerate the intolerable. We will remember, and in doing \nso, cultivate the knowledge--and the wisdom--necessary to act to \nprevent a repetition of these terrible crimes. Because the problem \nisn't simply a matter of knowing, but about knowing when and how to \nact.\n  Senator Ensign and I have submitted a resolution that acknowledges \nthe suffering of those destroyed by the Armenian genocide.\n  It calls on the President to remember the hard lessons of the \nArmenian genocide in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy and to assure \nthat our knowledge of this terrible crime informs our human rights \npolicies.\n  As I said, the Armenian genocide was the first genocide of the 20th \ncentury. It was also the first time that the American public found \nitself confronting such a cruel, man-made catastrophe.\n  America closely followed the crisis. In 1915, the New York Times \nalone published 145 articles on the Armenian massacres, roughly one \nevery 2\\1/2\\ days.\n  Dedicated and courageous American diplomats tried to end the carnage. \nOur ambassador to Constantinople, Henry Morgenthau, played an important \nrole in bringing the massacres to the attention of the outside world.\n  Americans, such as Mark Twain, Henry Adams, and Clara Barton, spoke \nout against the massacres and a broad-based American humanitarian \nmovement sought to provide relief to the desperate Armenians and pushed \nthe U.S. Government to protect the victims from further violence. It \nwas the birth of the American international human rights movement.\n  The Near East Relief Organization, founded in 1919 to assist Armenian \nrefugees, provided more than $116 million for the cause during its 10-\nyear lifetime--the equivalent of more than $1 billion in today's money.\n  We need to recapture that energy and determination because the best \nway to honor those who died is to recognize their suffering and \ndedicate ourselves to preventing such a destruction of entire \ncommunities in the future.\n  Recognizing the Armenian genocide takes on added importance in the \nface of the genocide occurring right now in the Darfur region of Sudan. \nAs we pause to reflect upon this grievous example of man's inhumanity \nto man, let us honor the victims of the Armenian genocide and all \ncrimes against humanity not only by acknowledging their suffering, but \nalso by acting to halt similar atrocities that are occurring now before \nour very eyes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13395-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13395-S13396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLTUION 321--COMMEMORATING THE LIFE, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND \n                     CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALAN A.

Res. 321\n\n       Whereas Alan Reich devoted his life to civic involvement \n     and efforts to improve the quality of life for individuals \n     with disabilities;\n       Whereas Alan Reich was born in Pearl River, New York, was a \n     well-respected and beloved member of his family, and served \n     as an inspirational figure in the disability community;\n       Whereas Alan Reich--\n       (1) graduated from Dartmouth College in 1952, where he was \n     an all-American track and field athlete;\n       (2) received a Master's degree in Russian literature from \n     Middlebury College in 1953;\n       (3) was awarded a diploma in Slavic languages and Eastern \n     European studies from the University of Oxford;\n       (4) received an M.B.A. from Harvard University in 1959; and\n       (5) was a brilliant linguist who spoke 5 languages;\n       Whereas Alan Reich served in the Army from 1953 to 1957 as \n     an infantry officer and Russian language interrogation \n     officer in Germany, and was named as a member of the United \n     States Army Infantry Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas Alan Reich married Gay Forsythe Reich, and shared \n     with her 50 years of marriage and a deep commitment to each \n     other and their three children, James, Jeffery, and \n     Elizabeth;\n       Whereas from 1960 to 1970, Alan Reich was employed as an \n     executive at Polaroid Corporation when, at age 32, he became \n     a quadriplegic due to a swimming accident, and used a \n     wheelchair as a result of his injury;\n       Whereas although Alan Reich was told he would not drive or \n     write again, he relearned both skills and returned to work at \n     Polaroid Corporation;\n       Whereas Alan Reich--\n       (1) served in the Department of State from 1970 to 1975 as \n     a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural \n     Affairs;\n       (2) later served as Director of the Bureau of East-West \n     Trade for the Department of Commerce;\n       (3) was named the President of the United States Council \n     for the International Year of Disabled Persons in 1978; and\n       (4) was the first person to address the United Nations \n     General Assembly from a wheelchair when the United Nations \n     opened the International Year of the Disabled in 1981;\n       Whereas in 1982, Alan Reich transformed the Council for the \n     International Year of Disabled Persons into the National \n     Organization on Disability, an organization that actively \n     seeks on national, State, and local levels full and equal \n     participation for individuals with disabilities in all \n     aspects of life;\n       Whereas Alan Reich--\n       (1) founded the Bimillennium Foundation in 1984 to \n     encourage national leaders to set goals aimed at improving \n     the lives of people with disabilities for the year 2000;\n       (2) served as past Chairman of the People-to-People \n     Committee on Disability; and\n       (3) worked to advance research in regeneration of the \n     central nervous system as Chairman of the Paralysis Cure \n     Research Foundation and as President of the National \n     Paraplegia Foundation;\n       Whereas Alan Reich, who used a wheelchair for 43 years, led \n     an effort that raised $1,650,000 to add the statue of \n     Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a wheelchair to the memorial of \n     the former President in Washington, D.C.;\n       Whereas Alan Reich stated in 2001, ``The unveiling is a \n     major national moment, the removal of the shroud of shame \n     that cloaks disability. The statue will become a shrine to \n     people with disabilities, but it will also inspire everyone \n     to overcome obstacles. When you see the memorial that follows \n     the statue, what will be in your mind is that he did all this \n     from a wheelchair.'';\n\n[[Page S13396]]\n\n       Whereas in July 2005, Alan Reich received the George H.

Mr. President, I am pleased today join with Senator \nHarkin to submit a resolution commemorating the many contributions and \nachievements of Alan Reich, who was an inspirational figure in the \ndisability community. Alan Reich devoted his own life to the improving \nthe quality of life for so many others--especially individuals with \ndisabilities. He recently passed away on November 8, 2005, at the age \nof 75.\n  Alan Reich was the founder of the National Organization on \nDisability. This organization is active on a local, State, and national \nlevel in efforts to seek full and equal participation for people with \ndisabilities in all aspects of life. You see, at the young age of 32, \nAlan became a quadriplegic following a swimming accident. He used a \nwheelchair as a result of this injury. While Alan was told he would not \ndrive or write again, he relearned both skills and went on to become an \ninspiration for all those in the disability community. In 1990, he \nreceived the George H.W. Bush Medal for outstanding service under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  Alan Reich is probably best known for leading an effort that raised \n$1.65 million to add the statue of FOR in a wheelchair to the former \nPresident's memorial here in Washington, DC. As Alan said in 2001:\n\n       The unveiling is a major national moment, the removal of \n     the shroud of shame that cloaks disability. The statue will \n     become a shrine to people with disabilities, but it will also \n     inspire everyone to overcome obstacles. When you see the \n     memorial that follows the statue, what will be in your mind \n     is that he did all this from a wheelchair.\n\n  Alan Reich married his best friend and partner in life, Gay Forsythe \nReich. They shared 50 years of marriage and were deeply committed to \neach other and to their 3 children--James, Jeffery, and Elizabeth-as \nwell as their 11 grandchildren.\n  Alan Reich's contributions to his family, his community, and to this \nNation will never be forgotten. As Chesterton said many years ago, \n``Great men do great things even when they're gone.'' That is certainly \ntrue of Alan Reich. His legacy will live on always.\n  My wife Fran and I extend our deepest sympathy to Alan Reich's family \nfor their loss.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am honored to be the lead Democratic \ncosponsor of this resolution to commemorate the life, achievements and \ncontributions of Alan Reich.\n  I was greatly saddened, last week, to hear about the passing of this \ngreat and passionate advocate for the rights of people with \ndisabilities. As many Senators know very well, Alan was the founder and \npresident emeritus of the National Organization on Disability. Over the \npast 25 years, both he and the National Organization on Disability have \nbeen tremendously effective advocates for the full and equal \nparticipation of persons with disabilities in all aspects of American \nlife.\n  The achievements of Alan Reich, and the sheer breadth of his activism \nand leadership, are simply remarkable. While president of the National \nOrganization on Disability, he built a broad coalition of disability \ngroups that successfully fought for the inclusion of a statue of \nPresident Roosevelt in a wheelchair at the FDR Memorial. He spearheaded \ncritical research to track the progress of Americans with disabilities \nin key areas of life. He founded and chaired the Paralysis Cure \nResearch Foundation; was president of what became the National Spinal \nCord Injury Association; and he founded the National Task Force on \nDisability. Alan also led the way in taking the disability rights \nmovement into the international arena. He chaired the World Committee \non Disability, and was the first individual using a wheelchair to \naddress the United Nations General Assembly. For these and many other \nachievements, Alan was awarded the George Bush Medal this past July.\n  I want to express my own profound respect for this remarkable \nindividual and for all that he accomplished in his life. He played a \npivotal role in the disability rights revolution that has transformed \nthis country in important ways in recent decades. He improved the lives \nof countless individuals with disabilities, both in this country and \nthroughout the world. And, perhaps best of all, he has left a living \nlegacy in the form of the advocacy organizations he founded, which will \nnow continue his work into the future.\n  Alan Reich was a wonderful advocate and a great American. He fought \nwith all his heart to win equity, access, and opportunity for people \nwith disabilities. He changed countless lives, and made America a much \nbetter and fairer society. For all these reasons, the United States \nSenate honors Alan Reich, today, with this resolution expressing our \nrespect and appreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13396-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13396-S13397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 322--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE TRIAL, \nSENTENCING, AND IMPRISONMENT OF MIKHAIL KHODORKOVSKY AND PLATON LEBEDEV\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Obama) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 322\n\n       Whereas the United States supports the development of \n     democracy, civil society, and the rule of law in the Russian \n     Federation;\n       Whereas the rule of law and the guarantee of equal justice \n     under the law are fundamental attributes of democratic \n     societies;\n       Whereas the trial, sentencing, and imprisonment of Mikhail \n     Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev have raised troubling \n     questions about the impartiality and integrity of the \n     judicial system in Russia;\n       Whereas the Department of State 2004 Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices in Russia stated that the arrest of \n     Mr. Khodorkovsky was ``widely believed to have been prompted, \n     at least in part, by the considerable financial support he \n     provided to opposition groups;''\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has remarked \n     that the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky and the dismantling of \n     his company have ``raised significant concerns'' about the \n     independence of the judiciary in Russia;\n       Whereas the independent non-governmental organization \n     Freedom House has asserted that the conviction of Mr. \n     Khodorkovsky ``underscores the serious erosion of the rule of \n     law and growing intolerance for political dissent in \n     Russia'';\n       Whereas upon concluding an investigation of the facts \n     surrounding the case of Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev, the \n     Human Rights Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the \n     Council of Europe determined that the two men were \n     ``arbitrarily singled out'' by the Russia authorities, \n     violating the principle of equality before the law;\n       Whereas in May 2005, a Moscow court sentenced Mr. \n     Khodorkovsky to serve 9 years in prison;\n       Whereas Article 73 of the Russian Criminal Penitentiary \n     Code stipulates that except under extraordinary \n     circumstances, prisoners serve their terms of deprivation of \n     liberty on the territory of subjects of the Russian \n     Federation where they reside or were convicted;\n       Whereas on or about October 16, 2005, Mr. Khodorkovsky was \n     sent to prison camp YG 14/10 in the Chita Region of Siberia;\n       Whereas on or about October 16, 2005, Mr. Lebedev was sent \n     to penal camp number 98/3 in the arctic region of Yamal-\n     Nenets;\n       Whereas the transfer of Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev \n     constitutes an apparent violation of Russia law and hearkens \n     back to the worst practices and excesses of the Soviet era;\n       Whereas a broad coalition of human rights advocates and \n     intellectuals in Russia have appealed to Vladimir Lukin, the \n     Human Rights Commissioner of the Russian Federation, to \n     investigate and rectify any abuse of Russia law associated \n     with the transfer of Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev;

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Bush \n     announced that the United States intends to maintain its \n     historic role over the master ``root zone'' file of the \n     Internet, which lists all authorized top-level Internet \n     domains;\n       Whereas the recently articulated principles of the United \n     States on the domain name and addressing system of the \n     Internet (DNS) are that--\n       (1) the Federal Government will--\n       (A) preserve the security and stability of the DNS;\n       (B) take no action with the potential to adversely affect \n     the effective and efficient operation of the DNS; and\n       (C) maintain the historic role of the United States \n     regarding modifications to the root zone file;\n       (2) governments have a legitimate interest in the \n     management of country code top level domains (ccTLD);\n       (3) the United States is committed to working with the \n     international community to address the concerns of that \n     community in accordance with the stability and security of \n     the DNS;\n       (4) ICANN is the appropriate technical manager of the \n     Internet, and the United States will continue to provide \n     oversight so that ICANN maintains focus and meets its core \n     technical mission; and\n       (5) dialogue relating to Internet governance should \n     continue in multiple relevant fora, and the United States \n     encourages an ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders and will \n     continue to support market-based approaches and private \n     sector leadership;\n       Whereas the final report issued by the Working Group on \n     Internet Governance (WGIG), established by the United Nations \n     Secretary General in accordance with a mandate given during \n     the first World Summit on the Information Society, and \n     comprised of 40 members from governments, private sector, and \n     civil society, issued 4 possible models, 1 of which envisages \n     a Global Internet Council that would assume international \n     Internet governance;\n       Whereas that report contains recommendations for relegating \n     the private sector and nongovernmental organizations to an \n     advisory capacity;\n       Whereas the European Union has also proposed transferring \n     control of the Internet, including the global allocation of \n     Internet Protocol number blocks, procedures for changing the \n     root zone file, and rules applicable to DNS, to a ``new model \n     of international cooperation'' which could confer significant \n     leverage to the Governments of Iran, Cuba, and China, and \n     could impose an undesirable layer of politicized bureaucracy \n     on the operations of the Internet that could result in an \n     inadequate response to the rapid pace of technological \n     change;\n       Whereas some nations that advocate radical change in the \n     structure of Internet governance censor the information \n     available to their citizens through the Internet and use the \n     Internet as a tool of surveillance to curtail legitimate \n     political discussion and dissent, and other nations operate \n     telecommunications systems as state-controlled monopolies or \n     highly-regulated and highly-taxed entities;\n       Whereas some nations in support of transferring Internet \n     governance to an entity affiliated with the United Nations, \n     or another international entity, might seek to have such an \n     entity endorse national policies that block access to \n     information, stifle political dissent, and maintain outmoded \n     communications structures;\n       Whereas the structure and control of Internet governance \n     has profound implications for homeland security, competition \n     and trade, democratization, free expression, access to \n     information, privacy, and the protection of intellectual \n     property, and the threat of some nations to take unilateral \n     actions that would fracture the root zone file would result \n     in a less functional Internet with diminished benefits for \n     all people;\n       Whereas in the Declaration of Principles of the First World \n     Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in 2003, \n     delegates from 175 nations declared the ``common desire and \n     commitment to build a people-centered, inclusive and \n     development oriented Information Society, where everyone can \n     create, access, utilize and share information and \n     knowledge'';\n       Whereas delegates at the First World Summit also \n     reaffirmed, ``as an essential foundation of the Information \n     Society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to \n     freedom of opinion and expression'' and that ``this right \n     includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to \n     seek, receive and import information and ideas through any \n     media and regardless of frontiers'';\n       Whereas the United Nations Secretary General has stated the \n     objective of the 2005 World Summit on the Information Society \n     in Tunis is to ensure ``benefits that new information and \n     communication technologies, including the Internet, can bring \n     to economic and social development'' and that ``to defend the \n     Internet is to defend freedom itself''; and\n       Whereas discussions at the November 2005 World Summit on \n     the Information Society may include discussion of \n     transferring control of the Internet to a new \n     intergovernmental entity, and could be the beginning of a \n     prolonged international debate regarding the future of \n     Internet governance: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the President to continue to oppose any effort \n     to transfer control of the Internet to the United Nations or \n     any other international entity;\n       (2) applauds the President for--\n       (A) clearly and forcefully asserting that the United States \n     has no present intention of relinquishing the historic \n     leadership role the United States has played in Internet \n     governance; and\n       (B) articulating a vision of the future of the Internet \n     that places privatization over politicization with respect to \n     the Internet; and\n       (3) calls on the President to--\n       (A) recognize the need for, and pursue a continuing and \n     constructive dialogue with the international community on, \n     the future of Internet governance;

Res. 326\n\n       Whereas on December 2, 1980, 4 churchwomen from the United \n     States, Maryknoll Sisters Maura Clarke and Ita Ford, Ursuline \n     Sister Dorothy Kazel, and Cleveland Lay Mission Team Member \n     Jean Donovan, were violated and executed by members of the \n     National Guard of El Salvador;\n       Whereas in 1980, Maryknoll Sisters Maura Clarke and Ita \n     Ford were working in the parish of the Church of San Juan \n     Bautista in Chalatenango, El Salvador, providing food, \n     transportation, and other assistance to refugees and Ursuline \n     Sister Dorothy Kazel and Cleveland Lay Mission Team Member \n     Jean Donovan were working in the parish of the Church of the \n     Immaculate Conception in La Libertad, El Salvador, providing \n     assistance and support to refugees and other victims of \n     violence;\n       Whereas these 4 churchwomen from the United States \n     dedicated their lives to working with the poor of El \n     Salvador, especially women and children left homeless, \n     displaced, and destitute by the Salvadoran civil war;\n       Whereas these 4 churchwomen from the United States joined \n     the more than 70,000 civilians who were murdered during the \n     course of the Salvadoran civil war;\n       Whereas on May 23 and May 24, 1984, 5 members of the \n     National Guard of El Salvador, including Subsergeant Luis \n     Antonio Colindres Aleman, Daniel Canales Ramirez, Carlos \n     Joaquin Contreras Palacios, Francisco Orlando Contreras \n     Recinos, and Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura, were found guilty \n     by the Salvadoran courts of the executions of the churchwomen \n     and were sentenced to 30 years in prison, marking the first \n     case in the history of El Salvador where a member of the \n     Salvadoran Armed Forces was convicted of murder by a \n     Salvadoran judge;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on the Truth for El \n     Salvador was established under the terms of the historic \n     January 1992 Peace Accords that ended El Salvador's 12 years \n     of civil war and was charged to investigate and report to the \n     Salvadoran people on human rights crimes committed by all \n     sides during the course of the civil war;\n       Whereas in March 1993, the United Nations Commission on the \n     Truth for El Salvador found that the execution of the 4 \n     churchwomen from the United States was planned and that \n     Subsergeant Luis Antonio Colindres Aleman carried out orders \n     from a superior to execute them, and that then Colonel Carlos \n     Eugenio Vides Casanova, then Director-General of the National \n     Guard and his cousin, Lieutenant Colonel Oscar Edgardo \n     Casanova Vejar, then Commander of the Zacatecoluca military \n     detachment where the murders were committed, and other \n     military personnel knew that members of the National Guard \n     had committed the murders pursuant to orders of a superior \n     and that the subsequent coverup of the facts adversely \n     affected the judicial investigation into the murders of the 4 \n     churchwomen from the United States;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on the Truth for El \n     Salvador determined that General Jose Guillermo Garcia, then \n     Minister of Defense, made no serious effort to conduct a \n     thorough investigation of responsibility for the murders of \n     the churchwomen;\n       Whereas the families of the 4 churchwomen from the United \n     States continue their efforts to determine the full truth \n     surrounding the murders of their loved ones, appreciate the \n     cooperation of United States Government agencies in \n     disclosing and providing documents relevant to the \n     churchwomen's murders, and pursue requests to release to the \n     family members the few remaining undisclosed documents and \n     reports pertaining to this case;\n       Whereas the families of the 4 churchwomen from the United \n     States appreciate the ability of those harmed by violence to \n     bring suit against Salvadoran military officers in United \n     States courts under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 \n     (28 U.S.C. 1350 note);\n       Whereas the lives of these 4 churchwomen from the United \n     States have, for the past 25 years, served as inspiration for \n     and continue to inspire Salvadorans, Americans, and people \n     throughout the world to answer the call to service and to \n     pursue lives dedicated to addressing the needs and \n     aspirations of the poor, the vulnerable, and the \n     disadvantaged, especially among women and children;\n       Whereas the lives of the 4 churchwomen from the United \n     States have also inspired numerous books, plays, films, \n     music, religious events, and cultural events;\n       Whereas schools, libraries, research centers, spiritual \n     centers, health clinics, women's and children's programs in \n     the United States and in El Salvador have been named after or \n     dedicated to Sisters Maura Clarke, Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel, \n     and lay missionary Jean Donovan;\n       Whereas the Maryknoll Sisters, headquartered in Ossining, \n     New York, the Ursuline Sisters, headquartered in Cleveland, \n     Ohio, numerous religious task forces in the United States, \n     and the Salvadoran and\n\n[[Page S13399]]\n\n     international religious communities based in El Salvador \n     annually commemorate the lives and martyrdom of the 4 \n     churchwomen from the United States;\n       Whereas the historic January 1992 Peace Accords ended 12 \n     years of civil war and have allowed the Government and the \n     people of El Salvador to achieve significant progress in \n     creating and strengthening democratic, political, economic, \n     and social institutions; and\n       Whereas December 2, 2005, marks the 25th anniversary of the \n     deaths of these 4 spiritual, courageous, and generous \n     churchwomen from the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) remembers and commemorates the lives and work of \n     Sisters Maura Clarke, Ita Ford, and Dorothy Kazel and lay \n     missionary Jean Donovan;\n       (2) extends sympathy and support for the families, friends, \n     and religious communities of the 4 churchwomen from the \n     United States;\n       (3) continues to find inspiration in the lives and work of \n     these 4 churchwomen from the United States;\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     religious congregations to participate in local, national, \n     and international events commemorating the 25th anniversary \n     of the martyrdom of the 4 churchwomen from the United States;\n       (5) recognizes that while progress has been made during the \n     post-war period, the work begun by the 4 churchwomen from the \n     United States remains unfinished and social and economic \n     hardships persist among many sectors of Salvadoran society; \n     and\n       (6) calls upon the President, the Secretary of State, the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development, and the heads of other Government departments \n     and agencies to continue to support and collaborate with the \n     Government of El Salvador and with private sector, \n     nongovernmental, and religious organizations in their efforts \n     to reduce poverty and hunger and to promote educational \n     opportunity, health care, and social equity for the people of \n     El Salvador.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"},

program under \n     part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act;\n       Whereas the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of \n     1975 established the Federal priority of ensuring that all \n     children, regardless of the nature or severity of their \n     disability, have available to them a free appropriate public \n     education in the least restrictive environment;\n       Whereas the Education of the Handicapped Act was further \n     amended by the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of \n     1986 (Public Law 99-457) to create a preschool grant program \n     for children with disabilities aged 3 through 5 and an early \n     intervention program for infants and toddlers with \n     disabilities under 3 years of age and their families;\n       Whereas the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of \n     1990 (Public Law 101-476) renamed the Education of the \n     Handicapped Act as the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (referred

\n     aged 6 to 21;\n       Whereas IDEA has helped reduce the number of children with \n     developmental disabilities who must live in State \n     institutions away from their families;\n       Whereas the number of children with disabilities who \n     complete high school with standard diplomas has grown \n     significantly since the enactment of IDEA;\n       Whereas more students with disabilities are participating \n     in national and State testing programs, and graduation rates \n     for students with disabilities are continuously rising, since \n     the enactment of IDEA;\n       Whereas the number of children with disabilities who enroll \n     in college as freshmen has more than tripled since the \n     enactment of IDEA;\n       Whereas IDEA promotes partnerships between parents of \n     children with disabilities and education professionals in the \n     design and implementation of the special education and \n     related services provided to children with disabilities;\n       Whereas the integration of students with disabilities in \n     the classroom, learning alongside their peers without \n     disabilities, has heightened the Nation's awareness of the \n     needs and capabilities of students with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-446) reauthorizes \n     IDEA and ensures that children with disabilities are \n     guaranteed a quality education based on the high academic \n     standards required under the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), as amended by \n     the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110);\n       Whereas the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Improvement Act of 2004 strengthens IDEA's focus on the \n     educational results of children with disabilities and better \n     prepares those children for further education beyond high \n     school or employment;\n       Whereas the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Improvement Act of 2004 further enables special education \n     teachers, related services providers, other educators, and \n     State and local educational agencies to focus on promoting \n     the academic and functional achievement of children with \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Improvement Act of 2004 places a new priority on providing \n     students with disabilities with positive behavioral supports \n     through school-wide interventions;\n       Whereas the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Improvement Act of 2004 enables students with disabilities, \n     through the power of technology, to achieve better \n     educational outcomes and enhance independent living skills;\n       Whereas the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Improvement Act of 2004 protects the procedural safeguards \n     that guarantee the

ensure that all students \n     with disabilities receive the services and supports necessary \n     in order to achieve positive educational outcomes in both \n     public and private educational settings;\n       Whereas the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Improvement Act of 2004 ensures that the vast majority of \n     IDEA funds will go directly to the classroom and provides \n     States and local educational agencies additional flexibility \n     to provide for the costs of educating high need children with \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas IDEA has supported, through its discretionary \n     programs, 3 decades of research, demonstration, and personnel \n     preparation in effective practices for educating children \n     with disabilities, enabling teachers, related services \n     providers, and other educators to effectively meet the \n     educational and developmental needs of all children;\n       Whereas Federal and State governments

contributions of \n     children with disabilities and their parents, teachers, \n     related services providers, and other educators; and\n       (3) reaffirms the commitment of Congress to the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) so \n     that all children with disabilities receive a free \n     appropriate public education.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution that \nrecognizes the 30th anniversary of the enactment of the predecessor to \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, to commemorate \nits passage, commend its many authors, and suggest some actions we \nshould take to protect, preserve, and advance its legacy as a vital \ncomponent of our laws on education and civil rights.\n  On November 29, 1975, President Gerald Ford signed into law the \nEducation for All Handicapped Children Act, a landmark piece of \nlegislation that reflected America's fundamental and continuing concern \nfor education and human rights. This legislation reaffirmed the most \nbasic values of our democracy by extending education and civil rights \nprotections to individuals with disabilities. As we celebrate the \nanniversary of the IDEA's enactment, it is, like all anniversaries, an \nappropriate time to both recount the past and contemplate the future.\n\n[[Page S13400]]\n\n  Before 1700, there was little toleration for anyone who was \ndifferent. Persons with disabilities were often abused, condemned as \nincapable of being able to participate in social activities, and simply \nforgotten. In 1817, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, a teacher of individuals \nwho are deaf, opened a school for people who are deaf in Connecticut. \nThis was the first school in America designed to serve individuals with \ndisabilities. In 1850, at a time when most caregivers believed that \npersons with disabilities needed to live in institutions apart from \ntheir families, a school for youth with cognitive disabilities was \nopened in Massachusetts.\n  In the late 1800s, the number of children with disabilities attending \npublic schools increased dramatically due to education and child labor \nlaws. Many public schools developed special education for children with \ndisabilities, however, this usually involved creating separate classes. \nIn 1899, Michigan was the first State to introduce these classes \nstatewide, and by the 1920s, special education had become well \nestablished throughout the Nation.\n  For the next 50 years, special education took place mostly in \nisolated classrooms where children with disabilities seldom mixed with \ntheir nondisabled peers. It is against this backdrop that advocates in \nthe disability community worked tirelessly to affect the passage of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act. It is also against this \nbackdrop that this Congress had the wisdom and understanding to fully \ncomprehend the nature of the problem and the resolve and determination \nto act. Similar to May 17, 1954, when the U.S. Supreme Court announced \nthe Brown v. the Board of Education decision that ``separate \neducational facilities are inherently unequal'' with the signing of the \nEducation for All Handicapped Children Act, families, Congress, and the \nPresident believed that a segregated form of education for students \nwith disabilities was inappropriate and narrowed what children with \ndisabilities could learn and become in society.\n  As President Ford noted when he signed the Education for the \nHandicapped Act into law: ``Everyone can agree with the objective \nstated in the title of this bill--educating all handicapped children in \nour Nation.'' IDEA was advanced on the equally simple and equally \ncompelling notion that segregation was not the answer and all people \nshould have the opportunity to receive a free and appropriate public \neducation. It is therefore fitting that we take a moment to remember \nall those men and women who worked with such purposefulness and passion \nto ensure that such a simple yet enduring value of our culture was \nproperly reflected in our education laws.\n  Since the passage of the IDEA, we have seen significant improvements \nin the educational employment and economic well-being of citizens with \ndisabilities. According to the Department of Education, IDEA currently \nserves almost 7 million schoolchildren, preschoolers, and infants and \ntoddlers with disabilities along side their counterparts without \ndisabilities. What was unheard of 30 years ago is now a reality for \nmillions of students with disabilities across the Nation: a right to \nreceiving a free and appropriate education in their neighborhood \nschool. Because of IDEA and other similar laws, the education that \nstudents with disabilities are receiving is providing such individuals \nwith the skills necessary to succeed in postsecondary environments, \nwork, pay taxes, live independently, and pursue the American dream.\n\n  However, anniversaries are not just for looking back, and celebrating \nthe achievements of the past. They must also be an occasion for looking \nforward in anticipation of the challenges that still lie before us. All \ninvolved should be proud of the accomplishments embodied in the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, but no one should believe \nour work is done. Indeed, there is still more to do.\n  A report issued by the Institute for Higher Education Policy in 2004 \nfocusing on the education level of students with disabilities in the \nUnited States contains some disturbing data. It notes that while 91 \npercent of the general adult population has a high school diploma, only \n78 percent of adults with disabilities do. Even more disturbing is the \nfact that only 57 percent of youths with disabilities received standard \nhigh school diplomas. Although the 78 percent graduation rate \nrepresents a significantly higher rate than 15 years ago, it remains \ninadequate, and significantly behind the rate for individuals without \ndisabilities.\n  The National Educational Longitudinal Study reported in 2000 that 73 \npercent of high school graduates with disabilities enrolled in some \nform of postsecondary education compared to 84 percent of their peers \nwithout disabilities. However, students with disabilities who were \nhighly qualified academically enrolled in 4-year colleges at the same \nrate, 79 percent, as their peers without disabilities.\n  The lesson here is a simple one. When we believe in and have high \nexpectations for all Americans, Americans with disabilities can compete \nat the same level as Americans without disabilities. With the passage \nof the No Child Left Behind Act, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, and possibilities available within the soon to be \nreauthorized Higher Education Act, we have the opportunity to make \nsignificant strides and further level the playing field. As elected \nofficials, it is our responsibility to ensure that students, teachers, \nschool systems, and teacher education programs are all held to high \nstandards, improving the education levels, graduation rates, and \npostsecondary achievements of all students, including students with \ndisabilities.\n  It is fitting that today, in this place, we recognize and celebrate \nthe anniversary of legislation that says so much about who we are as a \npeople and what we stand for as a nation when it comes to educating all \nof our citizens. It is the responsibility of those of us who follow to \nensure that the brightness never fades, the promise of opportunity \nnever wanes, and our rights to education, life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness apply equally and fully to all Americans, \nincluding those with disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13400-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13400-S13401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 329--CONGRATULATING COACH BILL SNYDER FOR HIS \n ACHIEVEMENTS DURING 17 YEARS AS THE HEAD FOOTBALL COACH OF THE KANSAS \n                       STATE UNIVERSITY WILDCATS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS (for himself and Mr. Brownback) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a Senate Resolution \ncommending the contributions and record of a most unique and deserving \nman, the retiring football coach of Kansas State University Wildcats, \nBill Snyder.\n  I suppose some, especially non sports fans, might raise an eyebrow or \nquestion a Senate Resolution congratulating a football coach, no matter \nhow successful in wins and losses--after all, as some have said, ``it's \nonly a game.'' But in the case of Coach Bill Snyder his contributions \ntranscend his outstanding record of wins and losses; they represent \nbeing a mentor and teacher of leadership and values to young men during \na time when collegiate athletics and sports in general face challenge \nafter challenge involving unbecoming conduct and worse. Coach Snyder's \ncontribution--football is a game of course but in the case of Bill \nSnyder one of his greatest contributions has been to enable young men \nto win in the game of life by being responsible citizens.\n  And, this unique ability on the athletic field became a catalyst for \nalumni interest and a renewal of financial support throughout the \nuniversity enabling all students in all academic fields to benefit.\n  Much has been said in Kansas and throughout the football sports world \nabout the amazing turnaround Coach Snyder achieved at K-State; \ndirecting and orchestrating a football program success story that is \nnow considered by many to be the greatest in the history of collegiate \nathletics.\n  The record in the resolution I have introduced speaks for itself; \nthree time national coach of the year, 11 post season bowl games, only \nthe second program in college football history to win 11 games, 6 times \nin a 7-year time span, 42 NFL draft picks, 45 All America selections, \nand 68 first team all conference players. That is quite a record.\n  The coaches that first started their careers at K-State under Coach \nSnyder now read like a ``Who's Who'' in college football.\n  But great as those and the rest of the records are, that does not \nreally tell the Bill Snyder story. Simply put, this is a man who \nrestored and instilled a new sense of pride in a university and \nthroughout our State. This is a man and his family who have given of \nthemselves and contributed countless hours and resources to charitable \ncauses throughout Kansas.\n  With all of his successes and attributes, this is a man who is \nhumble, self effacing, soft spoken, and who knows you can get a lot \nmore done if you don't care who gets the credit.\n  In many ways, Bill Snyder is a private man who has God given ability \nto inspire others in the public arena. He has taught his players that \nin the games of football and life, success is never final, failure is \nnever fatal and that in the end its courage that counts. By his \nexample, he showed them the attributes of honesty, character and \nreputation are not old fashioned. On the playing field and in life he \ninstilled the truism that if you don't drop the ball you won't have to \ncomplain about the way the ball bounces. The same is true regarding his \nindividual player marching orders, never say bad things about your \nopponent win or lose, take care of your self, conduct yourself in your \nbest interests and that of your university and teammates. A coach on \nthe field and a coach in life.\n\n  I want to get back and emphasize this restoring pride achievement on \na more personal basis. I know my example is replete with similar \nexperiences with the thousands of families who make up what is now \nreferred to in the sports pages as the ``Wildcat Nation.''\n  My Dad was a proud graduate of Kansas State as I was and my son \nattended Kansas State--three generations. Sports fans and devoted K-\nState alumni all, we went through what many loyal K-Stater's call the \ndecades of Death Valley Days, seasons of defeat, seasons of eternal \noptimism always tempered, if not shattered by the reality of yet \nanother loss. There were some average seasons, a few good seasons, but \n``depths of despair'' would not be an understatement for many of the \nfaithful who endured and endured and endured. And, the defeats somehow \nbecame interwoven with the fabric of our alma mater and apologies for \npsychological exaggeration but even into the psyche of being a K-State \ngraduate and our self worth.\n  And then came President Jon Wefald and then came Bill Snyder and both \nmen grabbed K-State by the collar and said: Enough, we're going to win \nboth academically and on the athletic field. And, wonder of wonders, \nthey did just that.\n  Sports writers have called it a miracle. To many diehard K-State fans \nthat was not an understatement. Winning season followed winning season \nand generations of alumni witnessed this success story took it to \nheart, loved it and lived it. It has been a grand experience. When K-\nState goes to a bowl game, 25,000 to 30,000 diehard fans are in \nattendance, win or lose.\n  Bill Snyder and his wife Sharon and their family gave K-State their \nall and Coach Snyder has given us all pride, self esteem, and \nconfidence. It has been one heck of a trail ride for me and my family \nas I know it has been for countless others.\n  I just don't know of anyone in their chosen profession who has made \nmore of a difference in so many people's lives than Coach Snyder. \nSimply put, Bill Snyder has been a class act and then some and \ncollegiate sports, Kansas State University, the State of Kansas and his \nplayers and fans have been the beneficiaries.\n  Thanks Coach. ``Every Man A Wildcat!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13401-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13401-S13403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 67--URGING JAPAN TO HONOR ITS COMMITMENTS \n  UNDER THE 1986 MARKET-ORIENTED SECTOR-SELECTIVE (MOSS) AGREEMENT ON \n     MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND PHARMACEUTICALS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

and\n       (B) providing opportunities for consultation with trading \n     partners.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, we share a strategic and important \nrelationship with Japan. A relationship that has proven to be vital for \nboth countries, as we enhance our collaboration on everything from \neconomic pursuits to our joint national security interests. On all of \nthese fronts Japan has demonstrated that it is both a committed partner \nof the U.S. as well as a global leader in its own right. It is because \nJapan has demonstrated its leadership on the global stage that I \nsupport its bid to become a member of the U.N. Security Council.\n  As with any partnership, the U.S. and Japan face the occasional \nchallenges to this cooperation. One might argue this is an opportunity \nfor the U.S. and Japan to strengthen their partnership and increase \ncollaboration and trade. The time is now to push this cooperation. \nHowever, I am concerned about a threat to our trade relationship with \nJapan based on our medical technology industry's market access in \nJapan. It is crucial to my State of Minnesota that we have access to \nthis market and to our country.\n  Last Congress, I submitted a resolution in the Senate expressing my \nconcern that discriminatory practices and systematic barriers have \nlimited the ability of the U.S. medical device industry to introduce \nnew technologies into the Japanese healthcare system. Today, I am \nresubmitting similar resolution. I am concerned that insufficient \nprogress has been made by the Japanese to address policies that \npenalize American companies and ultimately prevent Japanese citizens \nfrom receiving the most advanced healthcare.\n  This resolution recognizes that medical technology has driven \ndramatic productivity gains for the benefit of patients, providers, \nemployers and our economy. It also states that Japan is one of the most \nimportant trading partners of the U.S., and urges Japan to honor its \ncommitments under the Market-Oriented, Sector Specific, MOSS Agreement. \nThis agreement calls on the Japanese to improve the reimbursement \nenvironment for medical technologies by actively promoting pricing \npolicies that encourage innovation and eliminating policies based on \ninappropriate comparisons to markets outside Japan.\n  Discriminatory practices targeting the medical device industry \ndirectly affect my state and many of my constituents. This is due to \nthe fact that Minnesota is the proud home to a thriving medical \ntechnology industry. Minnesota's medical alley is a rich corridor of \nmore than 8,000 medical-related companies--12 percent of our \nworkforce--and is home to over 520 FDA-registered medical technology \nmanufacturers. Employment in the industry increased 33 percent from \n1991 to 2001, adding over 23,000 jobs to the State of Minnesota. The \njobs produced by the medical technology industry represent a lucrative \nopportunity for my constituents, as the aggregate figure for wages \nexceeds $1.3 billion an average of over $56,000 per employee.\n  The benefits that Minnesota has derived from being home to a \nflourishing medical technology industry are well-deserved and a product \nof hard work. Minnesota ranks second only to California in device \ncompanies, and our State is home to many technology firsts: the first \nimplantable cardiac pacemaker, artificial heart valve, implantable drug \ntransfusion pump, wireless cardiac monitoring system, blood pump, \nanesthesia monitor and many more examples. The success we have had in \nMinnesota is also indicative of the positive trends that have been \nexperienced by the entire industry throughout the U.S.\n  The positive trends of American medical technology companies' \nperformance in domestic and international markets are not reflected in \ntheir experience with the Japanese market. The fact of the matter is \nthat U.S. medical technology companies are discriminated by Japanese \npolicies. There are numerous examples of these policies, but I will \nonly briefly mention a few.\n  Japan has adopted a foreign reference pricing system to reduce \nreimbursement prices in Japan's health system, a tool long opposed by \nthe U.S. Government and the medical technology industry. This system \ncalls for the establishment and revision of reimbursement rates on the \nbasis of prices paid for medical technology products in the U.S., \nFrance, Germany, and the U.K. This pricing policy therefore fails to \naccount for the high costs of bringing advanced technologies to the \nJapanese market, and instead bases prices on arbitrary conditions that \nexist outside of Japan.\n  In addition, Japan's system for approving the use of new medical \ntechnologies is the slowest and most costly in the developed world. The \nbacklog in processing applications for medical technology products is \nstaggering, and may be primarily related to the lack of staff dedicated \ntowards the review of applications. Importantly, the end result has \nbeen that the medical technologies used to treat patients in Japan are \noften several generations behind the products utilized in the U.S.\n  These and other regulatory hurdles embedded in the Japanese medical \ntechnology industry conflict with regulatory commitments made to the \nU.S. under the MOSS trade agreement. They also contradict the \nphilosophy underpinning the Global Harmonization Task Force, to which \nthe U.S., Europe and Japan are a party. Even our friends need to be \nheld accountable to the agreements they sign, otherwise they become \nless valuable than the paper they are printed on.\n  I urge our friends in the Japanese Government to take aggressive \naction to remedy this clearly unfavorable situation. Non-tariff \nregulatory and reimbursement policies discriminate U.S. manufacturers. \nWhile these policies hurt U.S. manufacturers' economically, ultimately \nthe biggest losers of these policies are Japanese patients. Innovative \nmedical technologies offer the possibility of key health solutions to \nall nations, including those that face severe health care budget \nconstraints and the demands of aging populations. Past experience has \ndemonstrated that the U.S. and Japan are able to overcome challenges \nthat arise in our relationship, thus making it stronger. I think that \nboth countries\n\n[[Page S13403]]\n\nstand to gain significantly if the principles of the resolution I am \npresenting today are upheld.\n  I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in Japan to honor its \ncommitments under the 1986 Market-Oriented Sector-Selective, MOSS, \nAgreement on Medical Equipment and Pharmaceuticals by supporting this \nresolution.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 67\n\n       Whereas the revolution in medical technology has improved \n     our ability to respond to emerging threats and prevent, \n     identify, treat, and cure a broad range of diseases and \n     disabilities, and has the proven potential to bring even more \n     valuable advances in the future;\n       Whereas medical technology has driven dramatic productivity \n     gains for the benefit of patients, providers, employers, and \n     our economy;\n       Whereas investment from the United States medical \n     technology industry produces the majority of the \n     $220,000,000,000 global business in development of medical \n     devices, diagnostic products, and medical information \n     systems, allowing patients to lead longer, healthier, and \n     more productive lives;\n       Whereas the United States medical technology industry \n     supports almost 350,000 Americans in high-value jobs located \n     in every State, and was historically a key industry, as it \n     was a net contributor to the United States balance of trade \n     with Japan, which was a trade surplus of over $7,000,000,000 \n     in 2001, and continued to be a surplus until 2005, when the \n     trade balance became a trade deficit of $1,300,000,000, due \n     in part to changes in the policies of Japan that impact \n     medical devices;\n       Whereas Japan is one of the most important trading partners \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas United States products account for roughly \\1/2\\ of \n     the global market, but garner only a \\1/4\\ share of Japan's \n     market;\n       Whereas Japan has made little progress in implementing its \n     commitments to cut product review times and improve their \n     reimbursement system in bilateral consultations on policy \n     changes under the Market-Oriented Sector-Selective (MOSS) \n     Agreement on Medical Equipment and Pharmaceuticals, signed on \n     January 9, 1986, between the United States and Japan;\n       Whereas, although regulatory reviews in Japan remain among \n     the lengthiest in the world and Japan needs to accelerate \n     patient access to safe and beneficial medical technologies, \n     recently adopted measures actually increase regulatory \n     burdens on manufacturers and delay access without enhancing \n     patient safety;\n       Whereas the general cost of doing business in Japan is the \n     highest in the world and is driven significantly higher by \n     certain factors in the medical technology sector, and \n     inefficiencies in Japanese distribution networks and hospital \n     payment systems and unique regulatory burdens drive up the \n     cost of bringing innovations to Japanese consumers and impede \n     patient access to life-saving and life-enhancing medical \n     technologies;\n       Whereas artificial government price caps such as the \n     foreign average price policy adopted by the Government of \n     Japan in 2002 restrict patient access and fail to recognize \n     the value of innovation;\n       Whereas less than \\1/10\\ of 1 percent of the tens of \n     thousands of medical technologies introduced in Japan in the \n     last 10 years received new product pricing;\n       Whereas the Government of Japan has adopted artificial \n     price caps that are targeted toward technologies \n     predominately marketed by companies from the United States \n     and is considering further cuts to these products;

and\n       (B) meeting or exceeding agency performance goals for \n     premarket approvals and adopting an appropriate, risk-based \n     postmarket system consistent with globally accepted \n     practices;\n       (2) urges Japan to honor its commitments under the MOSS \n     Agreement to improve the reimbursement environment for \n     medical technologies by actively promoting pricing policies \n     that encourage innovation for the benefit of Japanese \n     patients and the Japanese economy and eliminating \n     reimbursement policies based on inappropriate comparisons to \n     markets outside Japan; and\n       (3) urges Japan to honor its commitments under the MOSS \n     Agreement by--\n       (A) implementing fair and open processes and rules that do \n     not disproportionately harm medical technology products from \n     the United States; and\n       (B) providing opportunities for consultation with trading \n     partners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13403-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2672.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 22, 2004, the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate declared that\n\n[[Page S13404]]\n\n     the atrocities occurring in the Darfur region of Sudan are \n     genocide.\n       (2) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin L. \n     Powell stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate, ``genocide has been committed in Darfur and. . . \n     the Government of Sudan and the [Janjaweed] bear \n     responsibility--and genocide may still be occurring''.\n       (3) On September 21, 2004, in an address before the United \n     Nations General Assembly, President George W. Bush affirmed \n     the Secretary of State's finding and stated, ``[a]t this \n     hour, the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible \n     crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, crimes my government \n     has concluded are genocide''.\n       (4) On July 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1556, calling upon the \n     Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias and to \n     apprehend and bring to justice Janjaweed leaders and their \n     associates who have incited and carried out violations of \n     human rights and international humanitarian law, and \n     establishing a ban on the sale or supply of arms and related \n     materiel of all types, including the provision of related \n     technical training or assistance, to all nongovernmental \n     entities and individuals, including the Janjaweed.\n       (5) On September 18, 2004, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1564, determining \n     that the Government of Sudan had failed to meet its \n     obligations under Security Council Resolution 1556, calling \n     for a military flight ban in and over the Darfur region, \n     demanding the names of Janjaweed militiamen disarmed and \n     arrested for verification, establishing an International \n     Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to investigate violations of \n     international humanitarian and human rights laws, and \n     threatening sanctions should the Government of Sudan fail to \n     fully comply with Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564, \n     including such actions as to affect Sudan's petroleum sector \n     or individual members of the Government of Sudan.\n       (6) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry \n     on Darfur established that the ``Government of the Sudan and \n     the Janjaweed are responsible for serious violations of \n     international human rights and humanitarian law amounting to \n     crimes under international law,'' that ``these acts were \n     conducted on a widespread and systematic basis, and therefore \n     may amount to crimes against humanity,'' and that Sudanese \n     officials and other individuals may have acted with \n     ``genocidal intent''.\n       (7) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry \n     on Darfur further notes that, pursuant to its mandate and in \n     the course of its work, the Commission had collected \n     information relating to individual perpetrators of acts \n     constituting ``violations of international human rights law \n     and international humanitarian law, including crimes against \n     humanity and war crimes'' and that a sealed file containing \n     the names of those individual perpetrators had been delivered \n     to the United Nations Secretary-General.\n       (8) On March 24, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1590, establishing the \n     United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), consisting of up to \n     10,000 military personnel and 715 civilian police and tasked \n     with supporting implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement for Sudan and ``closely and continuously liais[ing] \n     and coordinat[ing] at all levels with the African Union \n     Mission in Sudan (AMIS) with a view towards expeditiously \n     reinforcing the effort to foster peace in Darfur''.\n       (9) On March 29, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1591, extending the \n     military embargo established by Security Council Resolution \n     1556 to all the parties to the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement \n     and any other belligerents in the states of North Darfur, \n     South Darfur, and West Darfur, calling for an asset freeze \n     and travel ban against those individuals who impede the peace \n     process, constitute a threat to stability in Darfur and the \n     region, commit violations of international humanitarian or \n     human rights law or other atrocities, are responsible for \n     offensive military overflights, or violate the military \n     embargo, and establishing a Committee of the Security Council \n     and a Panel of Experts to assist in monitoring compliance \n     with Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591.\n       (10) On March 31, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1593, referring the \n     situation in Darfur since July 1, 2002, to the prosecutor of \n     the International Criminal Court and calling on the \n     Government of Sudan and all parties to the conflict to \n     cooperate fully with the Court.\n       (11) In remarks before the G-8 Summit on June 30, 2005, \n     President Bush reconfirmed that ``the violence in Darfur is \n     clearly genocide'' and ``the human cost is beyond \n     calculation''.\n       (12) On July 30, 2005, Dr. John Garang de Mabior, the newly \n     appointed Vice President of Sudan and the leader of the Sudan \n     People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) for the past 21 \n     years, was killed in a tragic helicopter crash in southern \n     Sudan, sparking riots in Khartoum and challenging the \n     commitment of all the people of Sudan to the Comprehensive \n     Peace Agreement for Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the genocide unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan is \n     characterized by atrocities directed against civilians, \n     including mass murder, rape, and sexual violence committed by \n     the Janjaweed and associated militias with the complicity and \n     support of the National Congress Party-led faction of the \n     Government of Sudan;\n       (2) all parties to the conflict in the Darfur region have \n     continued to violate the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement of \n     April 8, 2004, and the Abuja Protocols of November 9, 2004, \n     and violence against civilians, humanitarian aid workers, and \n     personnel of the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) is \n     increasing;\n       (3) the African Union should rapidly expand the size and \n     amend the mandate of the African Union Mission in Sudan \n     (AMIS) to authorize such action as may be necessary to \n     protect civilians and humanitarian operations, and deter \n     violence in the Darfur region without delay;\n       (4) the international community, including the United \n     Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the \n     European Union, and the United States, should immediately act \n     to mobilize sufficient political, military, and financial \n     resources to support the expansion of the African Union \n     Mission in Sudan so that it achieves the size, strength, and \n     capacity necessary for protecting civilians and humanitarian \n     operations, and ending the continued violence in the Darfur \n     region;\n       (5) if an expanded and reinforced African Union Mission in \n     Sudan fails to stop genocide in the Darfur region, the \n     international community should take additional, dispositive \n     measures to prevent and suppress acts of genocide in the \n     Darfur region;\n       (6) acting under Article 5 of the Charter of the United \n     Nations, the United Nations Security Council should call for \n     suspension of the Government of Sudan's rights and privileges \n     of membership by the General Assembly until such time as the \n     Government of Sudan has honored pledges to cease attacks upon \n     civilians, demobilize the Janjaweed and associated militias, \n     grant free and unfettered access for deliveries of \n     humanitarian assistance in the Darfur region, and allow for \n     safe, unimpeded, and voluntary return of refugees and \n     internally displaced persons;\n       (7) the President should use all necessary and appropriate \n     diplomatic means to ensure the full discharge of the \n     responsibilities of the Committee of the United Nations \n     Security Council and the Panel of Experts established \n     pursuant to section 3(a) of Security Council Resolution 1591 \n     (March 29, 2005);\n       (8) the United States should not provide assistance to the \n     Government of Sudan, other than assistance necessary for the \n     implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for \n     Sudan, the support of the regional Government of Southern \n     Sudan and marginalized areas in northern Sudan (including the \n     Nuba Mountains, Southern Blue Nile, Abyei, Eastern Sudan \n     (Beja), Darfur, and Nubia), as well as marginalized peoples \n     in and around Khartoum, or for humanitarian purposes in \n     Sudan, until such time as the Government of Sudan has honored \n     pledges to cease attacks upon civilians, demobilize the \n     Janjaweed and associated militias, grant free and unfettered \n     access for deliveries of humanitarian assistance in the \n     Darfur region, and allow for safe, unimpeded, and voluntary \n     return of refugees and internally displaced persons;\n       (9) the President should seek to assist members of the \n     Sudanese diaspora in the United States by establishing a \n     student loan forgiveness program for those individuals who \n     commit to return to southern Sudan for a period of not less \n     than 5 years for the purpose of contributing professional \n     skills needed for the reconstruction of southern Sudan;\n       (10) the President should appoint a Presidential Envoy for \n     Sudan to provide stewardship of efforts to implement the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan, seek ways to bring \n     stability and peace to the Darfur region, address instability \n     elsewhere in Sudan and northern Uganda, and pursue a truly \n     comprehensive peace throughout the region;\n       (11) in order to achieve the goals specified in paragraph \n     (10) and to further promote human rights and civil liberties, \n     build democracy, and strengthen civil society, the \n     Presidential Envoy for Sudan should be empowered to promote \n     and encourage the exchange of individuals pursuant to \n     educational and cultural programs, including programs funded \n     by the United States Government;\n       (12) the international community should strongly condemn \n     attacks against humanitarian workers and demand that all \n     armed groups in the Darfur region, including the forces of \n     the Government of Sudan, the Janjaweed, associated militias, \n     the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A), the Justice and \n     Equality Movement (JEM), and all other armed groups to \n     refrain from such attacks;\n       (13) the United States should fully support the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and urge rapid \n     implementation of its terms; and\n       (14) the new leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation \n     Movement (SPLM) should--\n       (A) seek to transform the SPLM into an inclusive, \n     transparent, and democratic political body;\n       (B) reaffirm the commitment of the SPLM to bringing peace \n     not only to southern Sudan, but also to the Darfur region, \n     eastern Sudan, and northern

Mr. President, as elected representatives of the American \npeople, we have a responsibility to work with each other and to focus \non their needs. This is an obligation that Democratic Senators have not \ntaken lightly.\n  We have spent the last 11 months trying to make a difference for each \nAmerican citizen. Democrats fought to protect Social Security when \nthose in the majority, the Republicans, tried to destroy it through \ntheir risky privatization scheme. Democrats fought for a budget that \nhonors America's values. When Republicans passed a terrible budget, \nleading religious leaders called it immoral. They called it immoral \nbecause of its deep cuts and irresponsible tax breaks. Why did they do \nthat? One only needs to look at the Old Testament or the New Testament \nto find why.\n  In the 112th Psalm we are told that: He hath given to the poor; his \nrighteousness will endure forever. In the New Testament, in the Book of \nGalatians, second chapter, 10th verse: Only that we should remember the \npoor. That is why leading religious leaders of this country have called \nthe budget an immoral one.\n  We moved quickly to help Katrina's victims, when that storm exposed \nthe Bush administration's incompetence. It became clear that \nRepublicans were going to sit on their hands. Democrats tried to help \nfamilies with energy prices, when prices spiked and congressional \nRepublicans only seemed to care about their friends in the oil \nindustry.\n  We stood for the troops, veterans, and a success story in Iraq, when \nit became clear that the White House was more interested in launching \nvicious attacks than providing the leadership America needs.\n  Democrats know that we are sent here to do a job on behalf of the \nAmerican people. We understand that together we can do better. \nUnfortunately, in most all instances, those in the majority have \nshunned our efforts. Instead of joining us in helping every American, \nthey have blocked our efforts and decided to focus on the narrow \ninterests of a special few. In fact, if you want to see the misplaced \npriorities of the Republican Party, look no further than the agenda \nthey set for the Senate.\n\n[[Page S13408]]\n\n  If the Senate could spend over 30 days debating extreme judges and \ndevote days to the tragic affairs of the Schiavo family, Republicans \nshould have been able to find a few days to help millions of Americans \nwith health care, education, and, of course, the skyrocketing cost of \ngasoline, heating oil, and natural gas.\n  While some of the work we have done this year is important, more \nimportant is the work that we have missed. Consider the latest example: \nKatrina relief. Democrats introduced a comprehensive Katrina relief \npackage. It was a good package. It was done hours after the storm had \npassed. The legislation, S. 1637, included proposals to ensure that \ndisplaced families received the health care, housing, and financial \nrelief they needed. Republicans talked a good game about helping \nvictims. Yet over 2 months later, you only have to pick up any \nnewspaper to know that tens of thousands of Americans still need \nhousing, health care, and financial help. Democrats have tried to act \non these families' behalf, but every time Republicans have found \nsomething better to do.\n  Of course, this is a pattern all too familiar. When Democrats wanted \nto discuss health care and education, Republicans decided to debate \nchanging Senate rules so they could pack the courts with some extreme \nnominees. When Democrats wanted to help families struggling with rising \noil prices, Republicans gave billions in tax breaks to oil companies \nthat are already making obscene profits. And when Democrats wanted to \nhelp the neediest among us, Republicans decided to make deep cuts to \nprograms working families depend on so they could give tax breaks to \nspecial interests and the very elite of our country.\n  America can do better than these misplaced priorities. Whether it is \nsupporting our troops or providing relief for rising health and energy \ncosts, it is time for the Senate to get its priorities straight. The \nDemocratic agenda is one that deals with health care, energy costs, \nand, in effect, getting our priorities straight.\n  When we return next session, we should not waste more time putting \nthe needs of the special few ahead of the priorities of the American \npeople. Let's pass fiscally responsible tax relief to help middle-class \nfamilies being squeezed between declining wages and rising prices. The \nrich are getting richer; the poor are getting poorer. The middle class \nis getting squeezed. Let's move forward on issues like energy \ndependence, real security, and affordable health care. Let's build on \nthe progress we made on Tuesday with our vote on Iraq.\n  On Tuesday, Democrats and Republicans voted overwhelmingly to express \nno confidence in the administration's Iraq policy. We must continue to \npush the President because it is clear that he has no interest in \ntaking the Senate's advice.\n  Instead of changing course, as the Senate demanded, the White House \nhas decided to reignite the Cheney-Rove smear machine and attack its \ncritics instead. We saw it yesterday with Congressman Jack Murtha. \nWhile I don't agree with the immediate withdrawal plan Congressman \nMurtha proposed, this brave man's patriotism and his commitment to \ndefend our country should never be questioned, especially by this White \nHouse, as it was.\n\n  Congressman Murtha served valiantly in Vietnam. He is a highly \ndecorated veteran, someone who knows what it is like to bleed in \ncombat, literally. When he speaks, the White House should listen. They \ncould learn something. Let's remember, Congressman Murtha isn't the \nonly combat veteran calling for a debate about Iraq. In the Senate, \nRepublican Senator Chuck Hagel has also said it is our patriotic duty \nto question what is going on.\n  The deceiving, distorting, and divisive political attacks must end. \nWe need an open, honest debate about what is happening in Iraq. Next \nyear I hope Republicans will join with us in this debate. It is easy to \nattack those who don't agree with you. The hard part is leading and \ngiving our troops the strategy for success.\n  The days and months ahead should be used to do the people's business. \nWe can't change the past, but we can change the future.\n  Next year we need to focus on the priorities of American families. \nTogether we can do better and give our citizens a government as good \nand honest as its people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13408-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13408-S13409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A SUCCESSFUL FIRST SESSION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened carefully to my good friend, \nthe Democratic leader, give his evaluation of the year that is coming \nto a conclusion. Let me just suggest that I, not surprisingly, see it \nsomewhat differently. In my couple of decades here in the Senate, this \nhas been quite possibly the most successful first session of a Congress \nin my time here.\n  We began the year by passing a much needed class action reform bill \nthat was long overdue to deal with one of the areas of the litigation \ncraze that is bad for American business and bad for our economy. We \nfollowed on with the Bankruptcy Reform Act, long in the making, way \noverdue, to deal with people who have increasingly decided not to \naccept their responsibilities and pay their debts.\n  We passed a budget, which is never easy around here, tax cuts, a \nCentral American free-trade agreement, an energy bill, and a highway \nbill. We confirmed a new Justice to the Supreme Court. We passed a \nterrorism reinsurance measure and a pension reform bill.\n  It has been an extraordinarily successful first session of a \nCongress, and we have much to be proud of as we go toward the \nThanksgiving holiday.\n  Even though my assessment of our accomplishments here differs \ndramatically from that of the Democratic leader, let me say to all our \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, we have much to be \nthankful for this Thanksgiving. We hope everyone will enjoy the \nholiday, come back refreshed for what we anticipate will be a very \nbrief session the week of December 12.\n  I also want to say a word about Iraq. It is much in the news these \ndays. The Senate spoke clearly this week that it is not in favor of \ncutting and running. On a bipartisan basis, the Senate said we will not \ncut and run in Iraq. That is the message of the votes that we had \nearlier this week. We intend to stay the course. We are winning in \nIraq, and the policy is to win.\n  How do you measure success in Iraq? You measure it by the election \nlast January which brought into office a temporary democratic \ngovernment. Everyone remembers the ink-stained index fingers that were \nheld up proudly by the Iraqis as they, at risk to their own lives, went \nto the polls and elected an interim government.\n  Last month on October 15--by the way, back in January, there was a \n60-percent turnout, the same as our turnout last November and ours was \n60 percent, higher than the turnout of 50 percent before that. The \nIraqis turned out the same percentages last January as we did here, and \nI don't think any Americans were afraid they were going to be shot or \nblown up by a bomb if they went out to vote.\n  If that were not good enough, in the constitutional election on \nOctober 15, 63 percent of Iraqis turned out, and large numbers of \nSunnis who had boycotted the election earlier began to participate.\n  Clearly, Iraq is heading in the right direction. Surveys taken in \nSeptember indicate Iraqis are far more optimistic about their future \nthan we are about ours in the United States. They are more optimistic \nabout their future than we are ours here. So the Iraqis feel they are \non the right path. They are going to finish the job on December 15 when \nthey elect the first permanent democratic government in Iraqi history, \na fairly unusual thing in that part of the world, I think we will all \nagree.\n  Next year, that permanent democratic government will increasingly be \nresponsible for its own future and the fate of its own citizens as the \nIraqi military improves month after month.\n  So we do, indeed, have much to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. \nMost of all, we are grateful for our wonderful troops who have done an \nastonishing job in Iraq. They are proud of their work. They are \nsomewhat perplexed about the perception that they are failing when they \nall know they are succeeding dramatically. Hopefully, in the new year, \nwe will be able to do a better job of getting out the entire story in\n\n[[Page S13409]]\n\nIraq, which is that dramatic progress is being made. After all, when \nthis democratic government is elected on December 15, it will be less \nthan 3 years from the time Saddam Hussein was toppled to the election \nof a permanent democratic government in Iraq. It took us 11 years in \nthis country to get from the Declaration of Independence to the writing \nof the Constitution in our first democratic election.\n  We are very impatient for immediate success. In fact, the Iraqis have \ncome a long way in a short period of time under very difficult \ncircumstances. We are proud of them and, most of all, we are proud of \nour troops who made it possible for that to happen.\n  With that, Mr. President, I think it is time to begin to wrap up in \nthe Senate.\n  First, I congratulate the House of Representatives and the Senate. We \nwill shortly be passing a bill to honor a great American, Rosa Parks, \nby placing a statue of her in the Capitol. I am very gratified by the \nswift action of the House, followed on by the Senate tonight. We have \nassured that Americans who visit this place 100 years from now will see \nher statue and reflect on how one woman's courage altered a nation.\n  I am also pleased and grateful to my colleagues, particularly Senator \nDodd in the Senate and Representative Jesse Jackson, Jr., in the House, \nwho took the lead over there for moving quickly to accord Ms. Parks the \nhonor she so richly deserves. I look forward to the day when her statue \nis unveiled and placed in this historic building alongside other \nAmerican heroes.\n  Ms. Parks' passing on October 24, just a few weeks ago, left us with \nsadness, but also with deep gratitude to the gift she left all of us.\n  I am reminded of Dr. Martin Luther King's conviction that human \nprogress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability. It comes \nthrough the tireless efforts of men. Today this Congress has taken \nsteps to ensure Parks' achievements will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13409-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROSA LOUISE PARKS' REFUSAL TO GIVE UP \n                                HER SEAT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

R. 4145) to direct the Joint Committee on the \n     Library to obtain a statue of Rosa Parks and to place the \n     statue in the United States Capitol in National Statuary \n     Hall, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last night, the House of Representatives \npassed H.R. 4145, a bill to direct the Architect of the Capitol to \nobtain a statue of Rosa Parks and to place the statue in the United \nStates Capitol in National Statuary Hall. Today, the Senate unanimously \npassed this legislation, and I rise to thank my colleagues in this body \nand in the House of Representatives for their leadership and support \nfor this important legislation, which sends a message of hope and \nfreedom to the American people.\n  Earlier this week a resolution sponsored by Senator McConnell and \nSenator Dodd passed this body to honor Mrs. Parks. I thank Senators \nMcCONNELL and Dodd for their leadership on this issue and considering \nmy concerns. I supported Mr. McConnell's and Mr. Dodd's measure because \nI believe it is paramount that we honor Rosa Parks in our Capitol. \nHowever, I wanted to be clear that her statue should be in Statuary \nHall, and I was glad to join Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. of \nIllinois in his effort to make that happen.\n  Largely regarded as the mother of the modern day Civil Rights \nmovement, Mrs. Parks' act of courage on\n\n[[Page S13410]]\n\nDecember 1, 1955, inspired a movement that eventually brought about \nlaws to end segregation, ensure voting rights, end discrimination in \nhousing, and create a greater equality throughout this nation. \nMoreover, it taught us all that one individual can help to change the \nworld from the way things are to the way things ought to be. With the \npassage of this legislation, we ensure that her memory is enshrined in \nthe most hallowed halls of our Government. On November 3, 2005, I \nintroduced S. 1959, the companion legislation to Representative \nJackson's H.R. 4145, which would also place a statue of Rosa Parks in \nStatuary Hall in the Capitol. This is a location of great significance, \nparticularly on this occasion and particularly with this individual. \nWhile there are memorials for prominent African Americans in the \nCapitol Collection, none of those are located in the hall that gives a \nState-by-State account of our country's history.\n  This week, Representative Jackson and I began a national week of \naction to pass our legislation honoring Rosa Parks with a statue in \nNational Statuary Hall. I thank Representative Jackson for his \nleadership on this important effort. It was through his vision and \ndedication that we were able to reach our goal of having this \nlegislation pass Congress by December 1, 2005--the 50th anniversary of \nRosa Parks' courageous decision not to move to the back of the bus. I \nalso thank Senators McConnell and Dodd for helping to make that happen. \nIt could not have been enacted without their support.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Obama, Senator Smith and my other Senate \ncolleagues who cosponsored S. 1959 for their support in raising the \nawareness and helping to ensure the passage of this legislation. Mrs. \nParks' legacy, and that of the movement she began, has been served well \nby this bipartisan effort to honor her in Statuary Hall.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statement relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4145) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13410-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXPRESSING SENSE OF SENATE ON TRIAL, SENTENCING AND IMPRISONMENT OF \n                MICHAEL KHODORKOVSKY AND PLATON LEBEDEV\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 322\n\n       Whereas the United States supports the development of \n     democracy, civil society, and the rule of law in the Russian \n     Federation;\n       Whereas the rule of law and the guarantee of equal justice \n     under the law are fundamental attributes of democratic \n     societies;\n       Whereas the trial, sentencing, and imprisonment of Mikhail \n     Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev have raised troubling \n     questions about the impartiality and integrity of the \n     judicial system in Russia;\n       Whereas the Department of State 2004 Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices in Russia stated that the arrest of \n     Mr. Khodorkovsky was ``widely believed to have been prompted, \n     at least in part, by the considerable financial support he \n     provided to opposition groups;''\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has remarked \n     that the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky and the dismantling of \n     his company have ``raised significant concerns'' about the \n     independence of the judiciary in Russia;\n       Whereas the independent non-governmental organization \n     Freedom House has asserted that the conviction of Mr. \n     Khodorkovsky ``underscores the serious erosion of the rule of \n     law and growing intolerance for political dissent in \n     Russia'';\n       Whereas upon concluding an investigation of the facts \n     surrounding the case of Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev, the \n     Human Rights Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the \n     Council of Europe determined that the two men were \n     ``arbitrarily singled out'' by the Russia authorities, \n     violating the principle of equality before the law;\n       Whereas in May 2005, a Moscow court sentenced Mr. \n     Khodorkovsky to serve 9 years in prison;\n       Whereas Article 73 of the Russian Criminal Penitentiary \n     Code stipulates that except under extraordinary \n     circumstances, prisoners serve their terms of deprivation of \n     liberty on the territory of subjects of the Russian \n     Federation where they reside or were convicted;\n       Whereas on or about October 16, 2005, Mr. Khodorkovsky was \n     sent to prison camp YG 14/10 in the Chita Region of Siberia;\n       Whereas on or about October 16, 2005, Mr. Lebedev was sent \n     to penal camp number 98/3 in the arctic region of Yamal-\n     Nenets;\n       Whereas the transfer of Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev \n     constitutes an apparent violation of Russia law and hearkens \n     back to the worst practices and excesses of the Soviet era;\n       Whereas a broad coalition of human rights advocates and \n     intellectuals in Russia have appealed to Vladimir Lukin, the \n     Human Rights Commissioner of the Russian Federation, to \n     investigate and rectify any abuse of Russia law associated \n     with the transfer of Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev; and\n       Whereas the selective disregard for the rule of law by \n     officials of the Russian Federation further undermines the \n     standing and status of the Russian Federation among the \n     democratic nations of the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the criminal justice system in Russia has not accorded \n     Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev fair, transparent, \n     and impartial treatment under the laws of the Russian \n     Federation;\n       (2) the standing and status of the Russian Federation among \n     the democratic nations of the world would be greatly enhanced \n     if the authorities of the Russian Federation were to take the \n     necessary actions to dispel widespread concerns that--\n       (A) the criminal cases against Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. \n     Lebedev, and their associates are politically motivated;\n       (B) the transfer of Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev to \n     prison camps thousands of kilometers from their homes and \n     families represents a violation of the norms and practices of \n     Russia law; and\n       (C) in cases dealing with perceived political threats to \n     the authorities, the judiciary of Russia is an instrument of \n     the Kremlin and such judiciary is not truly independent;

Res. 323\n\n       Whereas market-based policies and private sector leadership \n     have given the Internet the flexibility to evolve;\n       Whereas given the importance of the Internet to the global \n     economy, it is essential\n\n[[Page S13411]]\n\n     that the underlying domain name system and technical \n     infrastructure of the Internet remain stable and secure;\n       Whereas the Internet was created in the United States and \n     has flourished under United States supervision and oversight, \n     and the Federal Government has followed a path of \n     transferring Internet control from the defense sector to the \n     civilian sector, including the Internet Corporation for \n     Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) with the goal of full \n     privatization;\n       Whereas the developing world deserves the access to \n     knowledge, services, commerce, and communication, the \n     accompanying benefits to economic development, education, and \n     health care, and the informed discussion that is the bedrock \n     of democratic self-government that the Internet provides;\n       Whereas the explosive and hugely beneficial growth of the \n     Internet did not result from increased government involvement \n     but from the opening of the Internet to commerce and private \n     sector innovation;\n       Whereas on June 30, 2005, President George W. Bush \n     announced that the United States intends to maintain its \n     historic role over the master ``root zone'' file of the \n     Internet, which lists all authorized top-level Internet \n     domains;\n       Whereas the recently articulated principles of the United \n     States on the domain name and addressing system of the \n     Internet (DNS) are that--\n       (1) the Federal Government will--\n       (A) preserve the security and stability of the DNS;\n       (B) take no action with the potential to adversely affect \n     the effective and efficient operation of the DNS; and\n       (C) maintain the historic role of the United States \n     regarding modifications to the root zone file;\n       (2) governments have a legitimate interest in the \n     management of country code top level domains (ccTLD);\n       (3) the United States is committed to working with the \n     international community to address the concerns of that \n     community in accordance with the stability and security of \n     the DNS;\n       (4) ICANN is the appropriate technical manager of the \n     Internet, and the United States will continue to provide \n     oversight so that ICANN maintains focus and meets its core \n     technical mission; and\n       (5) dialogue relating to Internet governance should \n     continue in multiple relevant fora, and the United States \n     encourages an ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders and will \n     continue to support market-based approaches and private \n     sector leadership;\n\n       Whereas the final report issued by the Working Group on \n     Internet Governance (WGIG), established by the United Nations \n     Secretary General in accordance with a mandate given during \n     the first World Summit on the Information Society, and \n     comprised of 40 members from governments, private sector, and \n     civil society, issued 4 possible models, 1 of which envisages \n     a Global Internet Council that would assume international \n     Internet governance;\n       Whereas that report contains recommendations for relegating \n     the private sector and nongovernmental organizations to an \n     advisory capacity;\n       Whereas the European Union has also proposed transferring \n     control of the Internet, including the global allocation of \n     Internet Protocol number blocks, procedures for changing the \n     root zone file, and rules applicable to DNS, to a ``new model \n     of international cooperation'' which could confer significant \n     leverage to the Governments of Iran, Cuba, and China, and \n     could impose an undesirable layer of politicized bureaucracy \n     on the operations of the Internet that could result in an \n     inadequate response to the rapid pace of technological \n     change;\n       Whereas some nations that advocate radical change in the \n     structure of Internet governance censor the information \n     available to their citizens through the Internet and use the \n     Internet as a tool of surveillance to curtail legitimate \n     political discussion and dissent, and other nations operate \n     telecommunications systems as state-controlled monopolies or \n     highly-regulated and highly-taxed entities;\n       Whereas some nations in support of transferring Internet \n     governance to an entity affiliated with the United Nations, \n     or another international entity, might seek to have such an \n     entity endorse national policies that block access to \n     information, stifle political dissent, and maintain outmoded \n     communications structures;\n       Whereas the structure and control of Internet governance \n     has profound implications for homeland security, competition \n     and trade, democratization, free expression, access to \n     information, privacy, and the protection of intellectual \n     property, and the threat of some nations to take unilateral \n     actions that would fracture the root zone file would result \n     in a less functional Internet with diminished benefits for \n     all people;\n       Whereas in the Declaration of Principles of the First World \n     Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in 2003, \n     delegates from 175 nations declared the ``common desire and \n     commitment to build a people-centered, inclusive and \n     development oriented Information Society, where everyone can \n     create, access, utilize and share information and \n     knowledge'';\n       Whereas delegates at the First World Summit also \n     reaffirmed, ``as an essential foundation of the Information \n     Society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to \n     freedom of opinion and expression'' and that ``this right \n     includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to \n     seek, receive and import information and ideas through any \n     media and regardless of frontiers'';\n       Whereas the United Nations Secretary General has stated the \n     objective of the 2005 World Summit on the Information Society \n     in Tunis is to ensure ``benefits that new information and \n     communication technologies, including the Internet, can bring \n     to economic and social development'' and that ``to defend the \n     Internet is to defend freedom itself''; and\n       Whereas discussions at the November 2005 World Summit on \n     the Information Society may include discussion of \n     transferring control of the Internet to a new \n     intergovernmental entity, and could be the beginning of a \n     prolonged international debate regarding the future of \n     Internet governance: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the President to continue to oppose any effort \n     to transfer control of the Internet to the United Nations or \n     any other international entity;\n       (2) applauds the President for--\n       (A) clearly and forcefully asserting that the United States \n     has no present intention of relinquishing the historic \n     leadership role the United States has played in Internet \n     governance; and\n       (B) articulating a vision of the future of the Internet \n     that places privatization over politicization with respect to \n     the Internet; and\n       (3) calls on the President to--\n       (A) recognize the need for, and pursue a continuing and \n     constructive dialogue with the international community on, \n     the future of Internet governance;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Committee \non Foreign Relations be discharged from further consideration of S. \n1462 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1462) to promote peace and accountability in \n     Sudan, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today the Senate has passed the \nbipartisan Darfur Peace and Accountability Act introduced by my \ncolleague, Senator Brownback, and myself. This legislation is a \ncritical step in finally stopping the genocide raging in Darfur and \nbringing lasting peace to the region.\n  It has been 15 months since the Congress declared the atrocities in \nDarfur to be genocide, and over a year since the administration made \nthe same declaration. Yet far too little has been done to live up to \nour moral obligation to actually save lives. Fellow human beings are \nbeing mercilessly slaughtered. We have the capacity to protect them. If \nwe do not, history will forever condemn our failure. That is what this \nbill is about.\n  This is the second time a version of this bill has passed the Senate. \nIn April, the bill was included as an amendment to the emergency \nsupplement appropriations bill but was stripped out in conference. This \ntime, however, I am hopeful that the bill will be passed into law. A \ndedicated, bipartisan group of House members, including Congressman \nPayne, have pushed this legislation. Through their efforts and with the \nsupport of leadership, we can pass this bill.\n  That's when the work will really begin. This legislation outlines the \npolicies and provides the authorities necessary to stop the genocide.\n  First, the bill recognizes that boots on the ground are needed to \nprovide security. It calls for the rapid expansion of the size and \nmandate of African Union, AU, forces in Darfur. We must, however, \nprovide actual resources to the AU for it to be effective. Just a few \nweeks ago, a Senate amendment to the Foreign Operations appropriations \nbill for $50 million was removed in conference, leaving the AU with an \never-increasing shortfall at precisely the worst moment. By passing \nthis legislation, the Senate has once again stressed the need for \ngreater U.S. assistance to the AU. The administration must now follow \nup by requesting significant funding for the AU in its next \nsupplemental request.\n  While we must provide all necessary resources to the AU, we should \nalso recognize its limitations. This bill identifies specific areas \nwhere NATO should provide assistance, including training, logistics, \ncommand and control, and intelligence.\n  The message is clear: the AU's failure will be ours. And, as the \ngenocide continues to unfold, there will be only one question. Were all \navailable resources expended to stop it?\n  Second, the bill insists that the United States work to impose \nsanctions currently available under existing U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions and seek to pass a new, more effective resolution. \nThe U.N. must impose the targeted sanctions promised under previous \nresolutions. And it must extend the arms embargo to include all of \nSudan and thus truly ensure that weapons do not end up in Darfur.\n\n  The bill grants the President the authority to impose real \nsanctions--blocking of assets and denial of visas--to those responsible \nfor genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and requires that \nhe report to Congress any waiver of those sanctions. Individual \naccountability changes behavior. This is a powerful tool, and I am \nhopeful that the President will use it to its fullest.\n  This bill has other critical provisions. It denies entry to our ports \nto ships working with Sudan's oil sector. It prohibits assistance to \ncountries violating the arms embargo. And it calls for a Presidential \nenvoy to bring the full weight of this administration to bear on \nstopping the genocide and resolving the crisis engulfing Sudan and the \nregion.\n  Darfur must be a priority. The United States has faced resistance to \nmultilateral sanctions against Sudan. But the answer is not to give up. \nThe issue should be raised in bilateral and multilateral settings. \nCountries that do business with Sudan and seek to shield the government \nfrom sanctions need to understand that we are absolutely committed to \nstopping genocide and that our bilateral relations are at stake.\n  There is no time to lose. The situation in Darfur is deteriorating by \nthe day. AU troops have been attacked, held hostage and killed. IDP \ncamps have been overrun in recent weeks and dozens have been \nslaughtered. Hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons can \nno longer be reached by humanitarian organizations. The conflict has \nspread into Chad, which already is straining to support 200,000 Darfur \nrefugees. We are looking at the complete meltdown of the region. What \npositive efforts have been made in the last year and a half, the \nincredible work of NGOs, the important efforts of a couple thousand AU \ntroops in a region the size of Texas, could soon be reversed.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have \nsupported this bill and have joined me in\n\n[[Page S13414]]\n\ndemanding that we end this genocide. I must also recognize the \nincredible efforts of civic and student groups, people of faith of all \nreligions and denominations, and Americans from all over the country \nand from all walks of life who have come together on this issue.\n  I have visited the IDP camps of Darfur and camps for Darfur refugees \nin Chad. But in our time, when news of human misery crosses the globe \nin an instant, none of us can pretend that we don't see. That is why so \nmany of our citizens have risen up and demanded action, not just words.\n  The American people understand what Elie Wiesel said about Darfur \nwell over a year ago. He asked:\n\n  How can a citizen of a free country not pay attention? How can \nanyone, anywhere not feel outraged? How can a person, whether religious \nor secular, not be moved by compassion? And above all, how can anyone \nwho remembers remain silent?\n\n  Elie Wiesel was referring of course to the memory of the Holocaust \nfrom which the moral imperative of our day was borne: ``never again.'' \nNever again will we stand by. Never again will we forget our common \nhumanity. Never again will we turn away.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the Brownback amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the bill as amended be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

my government \n     has concluded are genocide''.\n       (4) On July 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1556, calling upon the \n     Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias and to \n     apprehend and bring to justice Janjaweed leaders and their \n     associates who have incited and carried out violations of \n     human rights and international humanitarian law, and \n     establishing a ban on the sale or supply of arms and related \n     materiel of all types, including the provision of related \n     technical training or assistance, to all nongovernmental \n     entities and individuals, including the Janjaweed.\n       (5) On September 18, 2004, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1564, determining \n     that the Government of Sudan had failed to meet its \n     obligations under Security Council Resolution 1556, calling \n     for a military flight ban in and over the Darfur region, \n     demanding the names of Janjaweed militiamen disarmed and \n     arrested for verification, establishing an International \n     Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to investigate violations of \n     international humanitarian and human rights laws, and \n     threatening sanctions should the Government of Sudan fail to \n     fully comply with Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564, \n     including such actions as to affect Sudan's petroleum sector \n     or individual members of the Government of Sudan.\n       (6) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry \n     on Darfur established that the ``Government of the Sudan and \n     the Janjaweed are responsible for serious violations of \n     international human rights and humanitarian law amounting to \n     crimes under international law,'' that ``these acts were \n     conducted on a widespread and systematic basis, and therefore \n     may amount to crimes against humanity,'' and that Sudanese \n     officials and other individuals may have acted with \n     ``genocidal intent''.\n       (7) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry \n     on Darfur further notes that, pursuant to its mandate and in \n     the course of its work, the Commission had collected \n     information relating to individual perpetrators of acts \n     constituting ``violations of international human rights law \n     and international humanitarian law, including crimes against \n     humanity and war crimes'' and that a sealed file containing \n     the names of those individual perpetrators had been delivered \n     to the United Nations Secretary-General.\n       (8) On March 24, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1590, establishing the \n     United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), consisting of up to \n     10,000 military personnel and 715 civilian police and tasked \n     with supporting implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement for Sudan and ``closely and continuously liais[ing] \n     and coordinat[ing] at all levels with the African Union \n     Mission in Sudan (AMIS) with a view towards expeditiously \n     reinforcing the effort to foster peace in Darfur''.\n       (9) On March 29, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1591, extending the \n     military embargo established by Security Council Resolution \n     1556 to all the parties to the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement \n     and any other belligerents in the states of North Darfur, \n     South Darfur, and West Darfur, calling for an asset freeze \n     and travel ban against those individuals who impede the peace \n     process, constitute a threat to stability in Darfur and the \n     region, commit violations of international humanitarian or \n     human rights law or other atrocities, are responsible for \n     offensive military overflights, or violate the military \n     embargo, and establishing a Committee of the Security Council \n     and a Panel of Experts to assist in monitoring compliance \n     with Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591.\n       (10) On March 31, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1593, referring the \n     situation in Darfur since July 1, 2002, to the prosecutor of \n     the International Criminal Court and calling on the \n     Government of Sudan and all parties to the conflict to \n     cooperate fully with the Court.\n       (11) In remarks before the G-8 Summit on June 30, 2005, \n     President Bush reconfirmed that ``the violence in Darfur is \n     clearly genocide'' and ``the human cost is beyond \n     calculation''.\n       (12) On July 30, 2005, Dr. John Garang de Mabior, the newly \n     appointed Vice President of Sudan and the leader of the Sudan \n     People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) for the past 21 \n     years, was killed in a tragic helicopter crash in southern \n     Sudan, sparking riots in Khartoum and challenging the \n     commitment of all the people of Sudan to the Comprehensive \n     Peace Agreement for Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the genocide unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan is \n     characterized by atrocities directed against civilians, \n     including mass murder, rape, and sexual violence committed by \n     the Janjaweed and associated militias with the complicity and \n     support of the National Congress Party-led faction of the \n     Government of Sudan;\n       (2) all parties to the conflict in the Darfur region have \n     continued to violate the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement of \n     April 8, 2004, and the Abuja Protocols of November 9, 2004, \n     and violence against civilians, humanitarian aid workers, and \n     personnel of the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) is \n     increasing;\n       (3) the African Union should rapidly expand the size and \n     amend the mandate of the African Union Mission in Sudan \n     (AMIS) to authorize such action as may be necessary to \n     protect civilians and humanitarian operations, and deter \n     violence in the Darfur region without delay;\n       (4) the international community, including the United \n     Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the \n     European Union, and the United States, should immediately act \n     to mobilize sufficient political, military, and financial \n     resources to support the expansion of the African Union \n     Mission\n\n[[Page S13415]]\n\n     in Sudan so that it achieves the size, strength, and capacity \n     necessary for protecting civilians and humanitarian \n     operations, and ending the continued violence in the Darfur \n     region;\n       (5) if an expanded and reinforced African Union Mission in \n     Sudan fails to stop genocide in the Darfur region, the \n     international community should take additional, dispositive \n     measures to prevent and suppress acts of genocide in the \n     Darfur region;\n       (6) acting under Article 5 of the Charter of the United \n     Nations, the United Nations Security Council should call for \n     suspension of the Government of Sudan's rights and privileges \n     of membership by the General Assembly until such time as the \n     Government of Sudan has honored pledges to cease attacks upon \n     civilians, demobilize the Janjaweed and associated militias, \n     grant free and unfettered access for deliveries of \n     humanitarian assistance in the Darfur region, and allow for \n     safe, unimpeded, and voluntary return of refugees and \n     internally displaced persons;\n       (7) the President should use all necessary and appropriate \n     diplomatic means to ensure the full discharge of the \n     responsibilities of the Committee of the United Nations \n     Security Council and the Panel of Experts established \n     pursuant to section 3(a) of Security Council Resolution 1591 \n     (March 29, 2005);\n       (8) the United States should not provide assistance to the \n     Government of Sudan, other than assistance necessary for the \n     implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for \n     Sudan, the support of the regional Government of Southern \n     Sudan and marginalized areas in northern Sudan (including the \n     Nuba Mountains, Southern Blue Nile, Abyei, Eastern Sudan \n     (Beja), Darfur, and Nubia), as well as marginalized peoples \n     in and around Khartoum, or for humanitarian purposes in \n     Sudan, until such time as the Government of Sudan has honored \n     pledges to cease attacks upon civilians, demobilize the \n     Janjaweed and associated militias, grant free and unfettered \n     access for deliveries of humanitarian assistance in the \n     Darfur region, and allow for safe, unimpeded, and voluntary \n     return of refugees and internally displaced persons;\n       (9) the President should seek to assist members of the \n     Sudanese diaspora in the United States by establishing a \n     student loan forgiveness program for those individuals who \n     commit to return to southern Sudan for a period of not less \n     than 5 years for the purpose of contributing professional \n     skills needed for the reconstruction of southern Sudan;\n       (10) the President should appoint a Presidential Envoy for \n     Sudan to provide stewardship of efforts to implement the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan, seek ways to bring \n     stability and peace to the Darfur region, address instability \n     elsewhere in Sudan and northern Uganda, and pursue a truly \n     comprehensive peace throughout the region;\n       (11) in order to achieve the goals specified in paragraph \n     (10) and to further promote human rights and civil liberties, \n     build democracy, and strengthen civil society, the \n     Presidential Envoy for Sudan should be empowered to promote \n     and encourage the exchange of individuals pursuant to \n     educational and cultural programs, including programs funded \n     by the United States Government;\n       (12) the international community should strongly condemn \n     attacks against humanitarian workers and demand that all \n     armed groups in the Darfur region, including the forces of \n     the Government of Sudan, the Janjaweed, associated militias, \n     the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A), the Justice and \n     Equality Movement (JEM), and all other armed groups to \n     refrain from such attacks;\n       (13) the United States should fully support the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and urge rapid \n     implementation of its terms; and\n       (14) the new leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation \n     Movement (SPLM) should--\n       (A) seek to transform the SPLM into an inclusive, \n     transparent, and democratic political body;\n       (B) reaffirm the commitment of the SPLM to bringing peace \n     not only to southern Sudan, but also to the Darfur region, \n     eastern Sudan, and northern Uganda; and\n       (C) remain united in the face of potential efforts to \n     undermine the SPLM.\n\n     SEC.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There are sectors of the United States economy, \n     including public transportation, parking meters, vending \n     machines, and low-dollar value transactions, in which the use \n     of a $1 coin is both useful and desirable for keeping costs \n     and prices down.\n       (2) For a variety of reasons, the new $1 coin introduced in \n     2000 has not been widely sought-after by the public, leading \n     to higher costs for merchants and thus higher prices for \n     consumers.\n       (3) The success of the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program \n     (31 U.S.C. 5112(l)) for circulating quarter dollars shows \n     that a design on a United States circulating coin that is \n     regularly changed in a manner similar to the systematic \n     change in designs in such Program radically increases demand \n     for the coin, rapidly pulling it through the economy.\n       (4) The 50 States Commemorative Coin Program also has been \n     an educational tool, teaching both Americans and visitors \n     something about each State for which a quarter has been \n     issued.\n       (5) A national survey and study by the Government \n     Accountability Office has indicated that many Americans who \n     do not seek, or who reject, the new $1 coin for use in \n     commerce would actively seek the coin if an attractive, \n     educational rotating design were to be struck on the coin.\n       (6) The President is the leader of our tripartite \n     government and the President's spouse has often set the \n     social tone for the White House while spear-heading and \n     highlighting important issues for the country.\n       (7) Sacagawea, as currently represented on the new $1 coin, \n     is an important symbol of American history.\n       (8) Many people cannot name all of the Presidents, and \n     fewer can name the spouses, nor can many people accurately \n     place each President in the proper time period of American \n     history.\n       (9) First Spouses have not generally been recognized on \n     American coinage.\n       (10) In order to revitalize the design of United States \n     coinage and return circulating coinage to its position as not \n     only a necessary means of exchange in commerce, but also as \n     an object of aesthetic beauty in its own right, it is \n     appropriate to move many of the mottos and emblems, the \n     inscription of the year, and the so-called ``mint marks'' \n     that currently appear on the 2 faces of each circulating coin \n     to the edge of the coin, which would allow larger and more \n     dramatic artwork on the coins reminiscent of the so-called \n     ``Golden Age of Coinage'' in the United States, at the \n     beginning of the Twentieth Century, initiated by President \n     Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted sculptors \n     and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-\n     Gaudens.\n       (11) Placing inscriptions on the edge of coins, known as \n     edge-incusing, is a hallmark of modern coinage and is common \n     in large-volume production of coinage elsewhere in the world, \n     such as the 2,700,000,000 2-Euro coins in circulation, but it \n     has not been done on a large scale in United States coinage \n     in recent years.\n       (12) Although the Congress has authorized the Secretary of \n     the Treasury to issue gold coins with a purity of 99.99 \n     percent, the Secretary has not done so.\n       (13) Bullion coins are a valuable tool for the investor \n     and, in some cases, an important aspect of coin collecting.\n\n     SEC. 102. PRESIDENTIAL $1 COIN PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(n) Redesign and Issuance of Circulating $1 Coins \n     Honoring Each of the Presidents of the United States.--\n       ``(1) Redesign Beginning in 2007.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (d) and in \n     accordance with the provisions of this subsection, $1 coins \n     issued during the period beginning January 1, 2007, and \n     ending upon the termination of the program under paragraph \n     (8), shall--\n       ``(i) have designs on the obverse selected in accordance \n     with paragraph (2)(B) which are emblematic of the Presidents \n     of the United States;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the \n     Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during \n     the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's \n     history.\n       (2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day \n     LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809, Abraham \n     Lincoln rose to the Presidency through a combination of \n     honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to the \n     United States.\n       (3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham \n     Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United \n     States.\n       (4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice \n     toward none, and with charity for all.\n       (5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the \n     country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April \n     15, 1865.\n       (6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of \n     Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for \n     accomplishing the ``American dream'' through honesty, \n     integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.\n       (7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of \n     the birth of Abraham Lincoln.\n       (8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood \n     in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in \n     Washington, D.C.\n\n[[Page S13424]]\n\n       (9) The so-called ``Lincoln cent'' was introduced in 1909 \n     on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the \n     obverse design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.\n       (10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the \n     talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen \n     to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, \n     adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.\n       (11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the ``Lincoln \n     cent'', there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the \n     original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing \n     mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln \n     Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n       (12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President \n     Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production \n     of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series \n     of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are \n     emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's \n     life.\n\n     SEC. 302.

REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009.\n\n       The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after \n     December 31, 2009, shall bear an image emblematic of \n     President Lincoln's preservation of the United States of \n     America as a single and united country.\n\n     SEC. 304. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT \n                   AS THE 1909 PENNY.\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in \n     2009 with the exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin \n     contained in 1909 in such number as the Secretary determines \n     to be appropriate for numismatic purposes.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor \n     David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic \n     departure from previous American coinage that should be \n     reproduced, using the original form and relief of the \n     likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins issued in \n     2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/18/senate-section/article/S13424-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM FURTHER ENHANCED BORROWING AUTHORITY \n                              ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.
