Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1042, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1042) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2006 for the military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Today we resume consideration of the Defense authorization \nbill. Under the agreement reached on October 26, we have a limitation \nof amendments and debate to Defense authorization. Chairman Warner and \nSenator Levin are here today and are prepared for Members to come to \nthe floor to offer their defense-related amendments. I noted last night \nthere will be no rollcall votes today, and we will delay votes until \nMonday at approximately 5:30. We will announce later on how many votes \nSenators can expect on Monday.\n  Finally, I do want to thank everybody for their participation and \ncooperation over the course of yesterday's session, a lengthy session. \nI think it was 22 consecutive rollcall votes. We didn't have any \nscheduled breaks and things went very smoothly. Indeed, we were able to \nmeet our goal of 6 o'clock last night to allow Senators to attend what \nwas a wonderful event where we had over 50 former Senators--men and \nwomen who had served in this body in the past--come back and join us \nfor a bipartisan event last night. It would not have been possible \nwithout the patience of Senators and the efforts of so many staff \nmembers who worked so hard to bring that deficit reduction bill to \ncompletion by a vote of 52 to 47.\n\n\n                         Budget Reconciliation\n\n  This was an important piece of fiscal legislation; I think clearly \nthe most important piece of fiscal legislation over the course of the \nyear, a bill that was called the deficit reduction bill because almost \n$35 billion in savings does go down directly to reduce the deficit. \nThat is a period of 4 years, $35 billion. Over 10 years, it would be \nright at $100 billion.\n  A number of people have said, well, spending cuts that we put in \nyesterday don't go far enough, and I would not disagree with that \nstatement. The deficit reduction package we passed last night, however, \nwas a major and important first step forward in reining in what has \nbecome out-of-control Federal spending, so I congratulate our \ncolleagues.\n  I also thank the committee chairmen one more time for their hard work \nand leadership, both sides of the aisle working together. There was in \nmany instances bipartisan support for their recommendations. In \nparticular, I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee, Chairman Judd \nGregg, for his strong leadership. I also thank Senator McConnell, our \nassistant Republican leader, for his deft handling of the process \nyesterday, keeping us on track to success.\n  The Senate staffers, several of them were thanked last night. And \nthere are so many, I always hesitate to start naming them, but in \ntruth, as always, they are the ones who give the discipline to the \nengine that makes it possible: Kyle Simmons, Scott Gudes, Bill \nHoagland, Sharon Soderstrom, Eric Ueland, all deserve special \nrecognition for their tireless efforts in bringing that bill to \ncompletion.\n  By rallying our resources and our will, last night the Senate passed \nthe first spending reduction bill in 8 years. It was last in 1997 that \nsuch a reconciliation on the spending side was passed. We took a tough \nlook at the budget, and we came up with a strong package of fiscally \nresponsible savings. And it is worth reflecting where we were even just \n10 months ago. We tend to focus so much on minute to minute here and \nday to day here, but if we look back 10 months ago when the President \nsubmitted his budget proposal, at that\n\n[[Page S12376]]\n\ntime the projected deficit was well past $400 billion and on its way up \nto $500 billion. Critics had bet against the majority's success. They \nsaid we could never pass a budget and be able to drive down the \ndeficit, and we have proved those critics wrong. Not only have smart \nprogrowth fiscal policies cut the deficit by $100 billion but direct \naction in the Senate yesterday cut the bottom line by another $35 \nbillion. Our GDP growth rate is strong right now, in the last quarter, \n3.7 percent, with over 4 million jobs created since May, about 15, 16 \nmonths ago.\n\n  Hurricane Katrina hit and we know hit hard, but not even Hurricane \nKatrina could knock our economy off track. As Alan Greenspan told the \nJoint Economic Committee yesterday, the economic fundamentals remain \nfirm.\n  The Republican-led Senate has defied the critics at every turn. They \nsaid we could not pass a budget resolution, and we passed a budget \nresolution. They said we could not pass the 12 appropriations bills on \nthis floor, and we did. We passed the PATRIOT Act, we passed the \nbankruptcy bill, we passed the class action bill, we passed the highway \nbill, we passed the Energy bill, we passed the gun liability reform \nbill--all this year, but we have a lot more to do.\n  Yesterday, I should add, as part of that deficit reduction bill, we \npassed exploration in ANWR which will help reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. It will strengthen our domestic supplies, again a real \ntribute to this body. Meanwhile, throughout the fall we have tackled \nrelief and recovery for the victims of Katrina and we have continued to \nsupport our troops in the war on terror. We will be doing our Defense \nauthorization bill shortly, again, to focus on continued aggressive \nsupport of the troops.\n  So despite all of the naysayers and sometimes pessimistic attitudes \nas to what is going on, we are moving this country forward in a \npositive and a constructive way.\n  Some have called the deficit reduction package yesterday immoral, and \nit really does bother me when people use words like that because, to \nme, what is immoral is saddling future generations with huge debt. What \nis immoral is ducking or hiding from today's challenges with inaction \nor empty platitudes or barriers to progress. What is immoral, to me, is \nproposing more debt while accusing others of being fiscally \nirresponsible.\n  During the budget process, the other side proposed spending \namendments, and we saw much of it on our spending speedometer--\nspendometer, I guess we call it--of over $460 billion. The other side \nproposed over $460 billion in increased spending. And who would pay for \nthis? I guess their answer would be raising taxes. It is unacceptable. \nWe have a different approach, an approach that strengthens our economic \ngrowth, strengthens our national security, that delivers real relief, \nreal relief to American families.\n  The deficit reduction package we passed last night will drive down \nthe deficit. It will increase America's energy supply. It will help \nstudents and families meet the cost of college tuition. It will take \ncritical steps to protect America's retirees, a huge victory for the \nAmerican people. We support real, measurable solutions and will \ncontinue moving America forward. Our goal is to strengthen America's \nfamilies and secure America's future.\n  We have a lot more work to do, Mr. President. Next week we have some \nof the world's top oil executives coming to Washington to explain why \ngas prices are going so high, above $3, and why oil and home heating \noil prices are so high, and at the same time, we are seeing these \nrecord profits going into their coffers.\n  The question that our constituents ask, and we ask, is Why? And those \nexecutives will have that opportunity to explain, and we will get to \nthe bottom of it.\n  We also plan to continue our work on the nomination of Judge Samuel \nAlito to the Supreme Court of the United States. The chairman and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee announced a schedule \nyesterday that does provide the strongest platform for Judge Alito to \nargue and to explain and describe the judicial restraint, the crux of \nhis philosophy, and he will be confirmed by January 20.\n  Finally, we will continue to address the pressing issues the American \npeople sent us to Washington to resolve after the first of the year, \nissues such as border security and immigration.\n  As I mentioned last night, we had a wonderful occasion in terms of \nhaving a bipartisan reunion with one out of every three former Senators \nwho are still alive in our midst last night. Most all of our colleagues \nwere there sharing stories, sharing intergenerational stories which did \nremind us what a powerful institution this is, the legacy that it \nleaves, the important role it plays as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. It was a reminder to all of us serving in this \nSenate it is an honor and it is a privilege.\n  I look forward to continue working in a bipartisan way to deliver \nbold and innovative solutions to keep this great country moving \nforward.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Be happy to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the majority leader for making \nreference to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and I just wanted to remind \nour distinguished majority leader that Hurricane Wilma, which hit the \nState of Florida, hit at a point on the southwest coast picking up \nsteam as it crossed the Everglades so that the back end of the \nhurricane gave a huge punch to the southeast coast where we have 20,000 \nstructures uninhabitable and where the winds were clocked at Lake \nOkeechobee at 150 miles an hour. That is a category 5. So I just don't \nwant us to forget Hurricane Wilma and the people who are suffering in \nFlorida at this time.\n  Would the majority leader just keep that in mind as we address these \nproblems?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is very well said. I think the \ndescription and comments by the Senator from Florida demonstrate our \nresponsibility to respond appropriately and smartly to natural \ndisasters. If we look at our response to hurricanes and natural \ndisasters in the past, I think we have done so.\n  It is sometimes frustrating because we cannot do everything, and a \nlot of people think the Federal Government has a responsibility to come \nin and solve all the problems.\n  Our challenge in responding to all these natural disasters is to \nrespond quickly, responsibly, smartly, working hand in hand with the \nlocals.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator's attention to one other natural \ndisaster we must face.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n\n\n                         Deficit Reduction Bill\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with regard to the deficit reduction bill, \nyou can have a cow and put a sign on him saying he is a horse, but he \nis still a cow. I think we would be better informed if we called this \nthe bait-and-switch bill. How do you call a bill deficit reduction when \nit raises the deficit in 1 year by $30 billion? How do you call a bill \na deficit reduction bill when it increases the deficit? If there was \never an Orwellian pronouncement, that is it. I guess if you keep saying \ndeficit reduction, some people are going to believe it is deficit \nreduction. It increases the deficit.\n  This could have been a good week for the American people. It could \nhave been a week Republicans joined Democrats and finally addressed \npriorities of working families. The polls around the country today make \na pronouncement: President Bush's approval rating is 35 percent. Do you \nthink it could be because we are trying to call a bill a deficit \nreduction bill that isn't one? How does the majority feel they can do \nthat? The American people can see through that: A deficit reduction \nbill that increases the deficit $30 billion, and the Republicans are \nbragging about increasing the deficit? They think they can get around \nthat by calling it a deficit reduction bill? No wonder this White House \nhas an approval rating of 35 percent.\n  This week could have been a week we agreed to do something about the \nrecord debt. It could have been the week we addressed the needs of \nmiddle-class families. The rich are getting richer, the poor are \ngetting poorer. The middle class is being squeezed between declining \nincomes, rising prices of health care, college tuition, gas, and heat.\n  It could have been the week we finally got serious about helping our\n\n[[Page S12377]]\n\nbrothers and sisters in the gulf coast. We can hear pronouncements from \nthe Republican majority that the response to these disasters has been \nexcellent. Prove that to the American people with the developments \nafter Katrina.\n  Listen to the radio. I listened to public radio this morning, and \nthey had a segment on about what is happening to the people in \nLouisiana. They cannot go to school; there are no schools there.\n  This could have been the week we finally got serious about the gulf \ncoast, and we have not. That is the kind of week that we Democrats \nhoped to have. The record will show we fought for multiple amendments \nthat would have helped working Americans.\n  Let me take a comment on the so-called spendometer. One of the \nSenators brought that in the other day, and I commented on it. All the \namendments that have been offered by the Democrats, with rare \nexception, have all been pursuant to Senator Conrad's pay-as-you-go \namendment that he offered; that is, we had offsets. They did not \nincrease the debt.\n  This spendometer is as phony as this deficit reduction bill. We could \nhave, if we had followed the direction of the amendments we offered--\nthere was one by Senator Bill Nelson to keep Medicare premiums from \nincreasing. That was defeated on a party-line vote. The Republicans \nbeat us on that. Senator Murray offered an amendment to protect \nprescription drug coverage for many of our Nation's seniors. That was \ndefeated on a straight party-line vote. Senator Lincoln tried to \nprovide emergency health care for survivors of Katrina. That was \ndefeated on a straight party-line vote. Senator Jack Reed tried to \nensure an adequate supply of housing, and that was defeated on a \nstraight party-line vote. Finally, Senator Cantwell had an amendment to \nprotect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska from oil \ndrilling. We fought for these amendments on this side of the aisle. We \nreached out to the other side and asked: Join us, please join us, \nbecause we understand that together America can do better.\n  I believe the Republicans have misplaced priorities. Unfortunately, \nthe good week we could have given the American people turned into a \ngreat week for special interests.\n  My distinguished friend, the majority leader, talks about all these \ngreat accomplishments we have had this past year. I am not going to \ntalk about every one of the items he mentioned, but I will talk about \nthe Energy bill.\n  The Energy bill did nothing to help the American consumer. All it did \nwas give a big sop to the already fat and beefy oil industry. They had \n$100 billion in profits this year. I don't think it was much of an \nEnergy bill. I really do believe we can do better.\n  The Republican budget we focused on this week cuts $27 billion from \nMedicare and Medicaid. It cuts housing, it cuts support for our \nfarmers, and then turns around and spends billions on tax breaks for \nspecial interests and multimillionaires. The big tax cuts are going to \ncome the week after next. We will wind up with $30 billion, if things \ngo as has been indicated by the Finance Committee. I hope we can do \nbetter than that.\n\n  Let's take a look at the tax breaks. Those who make over $1 million \nwill see a benefit of about $35,000. Those with incomes of between \n$50,000 and $200,000 will see a benefit of $112, and those with incomes \nof less than $50,000, the benefit will be $6.\n  Can't we do better than that? Yes.\n  Let's look at the lucrative benefits we handed out to the oil and gas \nindustry in the Energy bill I spoke about earlier and, of course, \nopening the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. It \ntakes our country in the wrong direction. We should diversify, becoming \nless dependent on oil as an energy source. We didn't do that in this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, let's look at what we didn't do this week. We didn't do \nanything. Very minimally did we do anything to help those people who \nare the survivors and those who were devastated along the gulf coast. \nWe didn't do anything to reduce energy prices. We didn't do anything to \ndeal with the pension crisis we are facing in America. We did nothing \nto deal with the health care crisis we are facing in America. We have \nnot passed the Terrorism Reinsurance Act.\n  I think most Senators have gotten calls from major companies who \ncan't build. I got a call yesterday from one major hotel owner who has \nhotels all over the world who said they have in Las Vegas four \nproperties they want to build and they cannot build them. They cannot \nget anybody to give them the insurance.\n  We have 2 weeks before our next recess, and we have much to \naccomplish. The American people are counting on us, and we on this side \nof the aisle, the Democrats, are going to do everything we can to not \nlet them down. Just because you call something a Deficit Reduction Act \ndoesn't mean it reduces the deficit, by definition of a Republican-\ncontrolled Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is the Senate now \non the Defense bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.

Mr. President, now that we are on the bill, it is my \nintention to eventually deliver an opening statement, but in courtesy \nto our colleague from Florida--and I believe he will be followed by \nSenator McCain to be followed by Senator Allard--I think we ought to \nproceed immediately to the amendments. Senator Levin and I will be on \nthe floor to assist all Senators who wish to bring any matters to the \nattention of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Florida, \nMr. Nelson, be recognized for 15 minutes, to be followed by the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain, for such time as he requires, to be followed \nby the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, to be followed on this side \nof the aisle--we are trying to alternate--with such amendments as \nSenator Levin may recommend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a very serious \namendment to this Defense authorization bill, but I am compelled to add \na couple of words to the colloquy that I had with the distinguished \nmajority leader regarding the hurricanes.\n  In the huge tragedy that occurred with Hurricane Katrina and the \ncontinuing observations of the reconstruction efforts, attention has \nbeen lost to the severe losses that have occurred in the last week and \na half in my State of Florida with a hurricane that hit with the force \nof a category 3 on the southeast coast of Florida and parts of that \narea having had winds of a category 5, with 20,000 residences lost.\n  We have now under consideration in the Department of Commerce \nappropriations subcommittee conference committee deliberations \nadditional personnel for the National Hurricane Center, which hopefully \nthe Senate's position will be taken which provides that additional \npersonnel. But one huge, potential downfall is that we need some kind \nof backup for the high-flying jet, the G-4, the Gulfstream-4, that \nmeasures the steering currents that is owned by NOAA.\n  In the middle of this storm, that jet had to go down for maintenance. \nLord knows what would happen if that jet had an accident and could not \nfly. The accuracy of our predictions of where\n\n[[Page S12379]]\n\nthe hurricane is going is 25 percent greater by being able to fly at \n41,000 feet measuring those steering currents.\n  It is my hope that we can see coming out of the Senate a provision \nfor a backup for NOAA, perhaps a jet shared with another agency, such \nas the Air Force or NASA, but that would give us that protection, and \nthat accuracy, as we know all too well, is so important to warn people \nin the accurate path of that storm because then prediction becomes a \nmatter of life and death.\n  Mr. President, I am honored today to speak about an amendment that is \nnecessary to fix a longstanding problem in our military survivor's \nbenefit system. The system in place right now, even with the important \nchanges we have made recently, does not take care of our military \nwidows and the surviving children in the way it should, and we should \nact now to correct this deficiency.\n  We don't have to go any further than the Good Book to remind us that \none of our greatest obligations is to take care of the widows and the \norphans.\n  That is what we have. This amendment will protect the benefit of \nwidows and orphans of our 100-percent disabled military retirees and \nthose who die on active duty.\n  I will give some background on how this problem developed. Back in \n1972, Congress established the military Survivor Benefit Plan--SBP for \nshort--to provide retirees' survivors an annuity to protect their \nincome. If we have a military retiree and they are deceased, we want to \nprotect the income of their survivors. This benefit plan is a voluntary \nprogram, and it is purchased by the retiree or it is issued \nautomatically in the case of servicemembers who are active duty and who \ndie on active duty.\n  Retired servicemembers pay for this benefit from their retired pay. \nThen upon their death, their spouse or dependent children can receive \nup to 55 percent of their retired pay as an annuity. So it is a plan \nthat has been in place since 1972 which the retired military person can \npurchase, and they do.\n  Surviving spouses or dependent children of service-connected 100-\npercent disabled retirees or those who die on active duty are also \nentitled to dependency and indemnity compensation under the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. This is a separate program. So these surviving \nspouses or dependent children of service-connected disabled veterans \nare entitled to indemnity compensation.\n  So there are two different laws, two different eligibilities, but \nwatch what happens under current law. The annuity paid by the Survivor \nBenefit Plan and received by a surviving widow or a child, what they \npay for on the pie chart that is in red, this is already paid for for \nthe surviving widow or the child. Under current law, they are also \nentitled, as a service-connected disability, to that under the \nVeterans' Administration. Under current law, one offsets the other. So \nwhat happens is the amount of the SBP is reduced by the amount of the \nDIC under current law, and a big slice of the pie, almost half of it, \nis lost when, in fact, the survivor is entitled under the law to both. \nSo this big slice shows what they are losing.\n  I wish to introduce my colleagues to Jennifer McCollum. She is from \nJacksonville, FL. This is her with her son and a photo of her husband, \na U.S. marine who was killed in 2002 while deployed in support of the \nwar on terror. Jennifer was 4 months pregnant when he was killed, and \nnow she has realized that her survivor benefits are being taken away by \nthat offset that I just described. That is what this amendment is going \nto stop. Jennifer's situation is unacceptable, and we have to fix it \nfor the sake of the widows and the orphans.\n  I do not know of any other annuity program in the Government or \nprivate sector that is permitted to offset, terminate, or reduce \npayments because of disability payments a beneficiary may receive from \nanother plan or program. That is the necessity for this amendment I am \noffering today.\n  It also makes effective immediately a change to the military SBP \nprogram that was enacted back in 1999. The Congress has already agreed \nthat military retirees who have reached the age of 70 and paid their \nSBP premiums for 30 years should stop paying a premium. We agreed back \nin 1999 that when a person reached the age of 70 and they had paid \ntheir SBP premiums for 30 years, they ought to stop paying a premium. \nBut what happened? Recently, we delayed the effective date for this \nrelief until 2008.\n  The program began over 30 years ago. Under current law, people who \nsigned up at the beginning must pay long beyond the 30 years that \nCongress intended. Do my colleagues know who this group is largely made \nup of? It is made up of World War II veterans. We call them the \n``greatest generation.'' Well, what it creates is the ``greatest \ngeneration'' tax in SBP, and we should not be delaying their relief any \nfurther.\n  This chart is going to give an example of the ``greatest generation'' \ntax. A lieutenant colonel or a commander in the Navy who joined SBP in \n1972 when it began has paid 33 years and will continue to pay under the \ncurrent law until 2008, for a total of 36 years. But someone of the \nsame rank who retired 6 years later also will stop paying in 2008 under \nthe current law, but they will have paid less. The older retiree will \nhave paid 30 percent more over that time period.\n  Of course, many of those fighting men and women are going to pass \naway by then and never enjoy the paid-up status that Congress intended \nfor them. This amendment I am offering today will fix the SBP system to \nmake sure it provides what Congress intended for our military retirees.\n  The United States owes its continued strength and protection to \ngenerations of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who have \nsacrificed throughout our history to keep us free. We owe them and \nthose they leave behind a lot--no less than a President who suffered \nthrough war, President Lincoln, instructed us that ours is an \nobligation to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his \nwidow and for his orphan. Too often, we have fallen short of this care. \nI believe we must meet this obligation with the same sense of honor as \nthe service they and their families have rendered.\n  We need to continue to do right by those who have given this Nation \ntheir all and especially for their loved ones they leave to us for our \ncare. Remember the instructions of the Good Book: The greatest \nobligation is to take care of the widows and the orphans.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am opposed to Senator Bill Nelson's \namendment, and I intend to introduce a second degree amendment that \nwould give the Commission on Veterans' Disability Benefits, which \nCongress established to study survivor benefits, the opportunity to \ncomplete its work before further changes are made to the Survivor \nBenefit Plan, or SBP.\n  I oppose Senator Nelson's amendment, because this blue ribbon \nCommission on Veterans' Disability Benefits has been established, is \ncurrently at work examining this issue, and, I believe, will provide \nvitally needed facts and recommendations regarding veterans' benefits.\n  The commission includes two Medal of Honor winners, two Distinguished \nService Cross winners, and 6 winners of the Silver Star. They can be \nrelied on to provide a comprehensive study. The commission was \nestablished to help the Congress, DOD, and the Veterans Administration \ndetermine what steps should be taken to best assist disabled veterans \nand their families. We should not implement another change to the SBP \nuntil the Commission completes its work.\n  Let's remember that in last year's Defense Authorization Act, the \nSenate significantly improved benefits provided under the SBP. Congress \ndirected the elimination of the so-called ``2-tier'' system which \nreduced the monthly SBP annuity when the survivor reached age 62. This \nwas a significant change that works to the benefit of military retirees \nand their spouses. We should stop and allow an assessment by the \ncommission of the effect of that change before we conclude that the SBP \nis in need of change.\n  Here is another consideration: Senator Nelson's amendment does not \ntake into account the great improvements in death benefits for military \nsurvivors that have been enacted this year. There has been an increase \nin the death gratuity--from $12,000 to $100,000--and an increase from \n$250,000 to $400,000 in the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, or \nSGLI. These changes clearly are substantial, and\n\n[[Page S12380]]\n\nthey have improved the quality of life for many of the survivors who my \nfriend, Senator Nelson, advocates for today. There have been various \nother benefits implemented for retirees and their survivors since 2001.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a list of these legislative \nimprovements printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and Other Leislation in \n               Support of Retirees and Military Survivors\n\n       NDAA FY 2001--TRICARE for Life Benefit for Military \n     Retirees (overage of 65 and their Families.--Under this \n     program, TRICARE pays what Medicare does not pay, and a \n     highly valuable pharmacy benefit at minimal cost.\n       NDAA FY 2002--Extension of Survivor Benefit Program SBP to \n     All Active Duty Members.--This legislation gave SBP coverage, \n     at no cost, to all military members' survivors who die on \n     active duty.\n       NDAA FY 2003--Special Compensation for Certain Combat-\n     Related Disabled Uniform Services Retirees (``Purple Heart \n     Plus'').--This afforded additional monetary monthly \n     compensation for any disabled military retiree whose \n     condition was the result of a wound or injury for which the \n     Purple Heart was awarded, and also for retirees with combat-\n     related disabling conditions rated at 60 percent or greater.\n       NDAA FY 2004--Elimination of prohibition on concurrent \n     receipt.--This legislation (phased in through 2014) permits \n     receipt of military retired pay and veterans' disability \n     compensation. It provides additional payments for all \n     disabled military retirees who have a rated disability of 50% \n     or greater.\n       NDAA FY 2005--Survivor Benefit Plan Improvements.--\n     Eliminated SBP ``two tier'' system (phased over three years) \n     which will result in no reduction in monthly annuity when \n     survivor becomes eligible for Social Security at age 62. Also \n     directed an ``open season for one year'' that will enable \n     retirees to opt in to SBP under prescribed conditions.\n       NDAA FY 2005--Accelerated Concurrent Receipt for 100 \n     Percent Disabled.--This amendment eliminated the phase in \n     period for collection of both military retired pay and \n     veterans' disability compensation for individuals who have \n     been rated at 100 percent disabled.\n       Emergency Supplemental FY 2005--Increased Death Gratuity.--\n     This legislation approved payments of $238,000 to survivors \n     of military personnel who died from combat-related causes \n     retroactive to October 7, 2001, the beginning of Operation \n     Enduring Freedom. This increased benefit is part of S. 1042.\n       Emergency Supplemental FY 2005--Increased SGLI.--This \n     legislation, which has been made permanent by the Veterans' \n     Committee, increased the maximum amount of Servicemembers' \n     Group Life Insurance (SGLI) available from $250,000 to \n     $400,000. Additionally, a Traumatic Injury Protection Program \n     (TIPP) has been authorized that will provide lump sum \n     payments of up to $50,000 to certain wounded and injured \n     military personnel.\n       Commission on Veterans' Disability Compensation \n     Established.--The 13 member Congressionally-chartered \n     Commission begins its work.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr President, the Department of Defense has opposed \nSenator Nelson's proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the DOD points of opposition be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Elimination of Survivor Benefit Program Dependency and Indemnity \n                              Compensation\n\n\n                          DoD Position: Oppose\n\n       The Department opposes eliminating the Survivor Benefit \n     Plan (SBP) and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) \n     offset.\n       SBP and DIC for active duty deaths are fully funded by the \n     Government. The offset of DIC from SBP avoids the duplication \n     of Government benefits. Since retirees pay premiums to cover \n     a portion of SBP funding, those premiums attributed to the \n     reduction for DIC are returned to the beneficiary, generally \n     in a lump-sum payment.\n       The policy is consistent with the private sector. In 2004, \n     the Department contracted with the SAG Corporation to conduct \n     a comprehensive review of military death benefits and compare \n     them to other public and private sector benefits.\n       Their study found the SBP/IDIC offset to be consistent with \n     the benefits offered by other employers. When more than one \n     annuity is available to survivors, the survivors must \n     generally choose one, or the annuities are sequential (one \n     commences when the other stops).\n       An active duty election exists. The National Defense \n     Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2004 authorizes survivors of \n     members who die on active duty who have children to elect to \n     have the SBP paid to the children. Thus, for Service members \n     who die on active duty, survivors have the option to pay DIC \n     to the spouse and SBP in the children's name.\n       Eliminating the SBP offset for all widows entitled to DIC \n     would cost the Military Retirement Fund more than $5 billion \n     over 10 years.\n       The Department opposes costly efforts that serve to \n     duplicate benefits.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, finally we can't ignore the cost of this \namendment. CBO estimates the cost of Senator Nelson's changes to the \nSBP as $903 million in Fiscal Year 2006 and $9.3 billion over 10 years. \nThis is all mandatory spending for which there is no provision in the \nbudget resolution and no offset in the legislation before us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my second degree amendment and look \nto the Commission on Veterans' Disability Benefits before we implement \nany further changes to the Survivor Benefit Plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2425\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments are set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2425.\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Relating to persons under the detention, custody, or control \n                    of the United States Government)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1073. UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR THE INTERROGATION OF PERSONS \n                   UNDER THE DETENTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) In General.--No person in the custody or under the \n     effective control of the Department of Defense or under \n     detention in a Department of Defense facility shall be \n     subject to any treatment or technique of interrogation not \n     authorized by and listed in the United States Army Field \n     Manual on Intelligence Interrogation.\n       (b) Applicability.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to with \n     respect to any person in the custody or under the effective \n     control of the Department of Defense pursuant to a criminal \n     law or immigration law of the United States.\n       (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to affect the rights under the United States \n     Constitution of any person in the custody or under the \n     physical jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1074.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, letters from the Navy League of the United \nStates and from Abraham Sofaer of the Hoover Institution to Patrick \nLeahy, which I think are important documents as far as constitutional \naspects of this issue, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is identical to the one \nthat was adopted by a vote of 90 to 9 on the appropriations bill, and \nit does the following: Establishes the Army Field Manual as the uniform \nstandard for the interrogation of Department of Defense detainees and, \ntwo, prohibits cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment of persons in \nthe detention of the U.S. Government.\n  Because of the extraordinary support for this legislation and its \nimportance\n\n[[Page S12381]]\n\nto our men and women in uniform, it is imperative that these provisions \nremain on the appropriations measure which is now in conference, \nalthough I understand the conferees have not been appointed on the \nHouse side.\n  There is a rumor that with the inclusion in the authorizing bill, \nthen an argument will be made to have it taken out of the \nappropriations bill, and then the authorizing bill would never reach \nagreement in conference. That is a bit Machiavellian. Most of all, it \nis very important because it thwarts the will of 90 Members of the \nSenate, an overwhelming majority of the House of Representatives, and \nan overwhelming majority of the American people.\n  I hope very sincerely that the inclusion of this provision on the \nauthorization bill, which is important in the authorizing process, does \nnot in any way give an excuse to have it removed from the \nappropriations bill.\n  I commend Congressman Murtha for his leadership and efforts to date \nto offer a motion to instruct conferees to keep this amendment intact \nwithout modification. I hope that no one seeks procedural maneuvers to \nthwart the overwhelming majorities in both Chambers.\n  I thank the leadership of the Armed Services Committee, particularly \nour leader Senator Warner, as well as the ranking Democrat, Senator \nLevin, who have provided guidance, leadership, and encouragement on \nthis very important issue. I am very grateful for their leadership.\n  Let me be clear.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent to be an original cosponsor, as I \nhave been consistently on the Senator's amendments. He will recall that \nour first meeting was when I was Secretary of the Navy when he returned \nfrom Vietnam. So our relationship on this issue has a long history, and \nI firmly believe it is in the best interest of the Department of \nDefense that this manual be the guide for our men and women of the U.S. \nmilitary. I commend the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. I ask unanimous consent that both \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin be added as original cosponsors of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my dear friend. Maybe he does not want me to \nrecall that was 32 years ago when we first had the opportunity of \nknowing each other, where I served under, with many layers in between, \nthen Secretary of the Navy Senator Warner. I remember the many \nkindnesses he extended to me and my friends who had returned at that \ntime. I also recall--and I do not want to take too much time of this \nbody--that Senator Warner at that time had to make a very tough \ndecision about a couple of people who had not performed to the \nstandards we expected in that environment in Hanoi. Sometimes tough \ndecisions have to be made, and I think Senator Warner made a very \ncorrect decision at that time.\n\n  I might add, he has not aged a bit since that moment when I first saw \nhim on my return.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the Record should also reflect \nthat in the course of my service as Under Secretary and Secretary of \nthe Navy, I had the great privilege of working with the Senator's \nfather, a naval officer without peer, distinction and achievement. He \nwas commander in chief of all forces Pacific during several of those \ncritical years in Vietnam when the Senator was incarcerated.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, I say again on this issue, No. 1, it is not going \naway. It is not going away. If, through some parliamentary maneuver, \ntemporarily the will of the majority of both Houses, both bicameral and \nbipartisan, is thwarted, it will be on every vehicle that goes through \nthis body because you cannot override the majority of the American \npeople and their elected representatives in a functioning democracy.\n  No one wants this issue to go away more than I. This issue is \nincredibly harmful to the United States of America and our image \nthroughout the world. The article on the front page of the Washington \nPost the day before yesterday, describing prison systems that are run \nby the CIA--the CIA wasn't set up to run prisons.\n  I point out there is no nation in the world that faces a greater \nthreat of terrorist attacks on a day-to-day basis than the State of \nIsrael. The State of Israel Supreme Court decided, and its military and \ncivil Government has implemented, a prohibition against cruel and \ninhumane treatment and torture, and they do not practice it. They do \npractice interrogation and, through various techniques--many of which I \nam sure are classified--that are not violations of the rules laid down \nby their Supreme Court, they obtain information, valuable and necessary \ninformation.\n  Why is it some people feel we should carve out an exemption for a \nbranch of our Government to practice cruel and inhumane treatment or \neven torture? Let me tell you what the consequence of that is, in case \nof another war. If we get in another war and one of our men or women in \nthe armed services is captured, they will be turned over to the secret \npolice because they will use the same rationale that is being argued by \nthe proponents for the continuation of cruel and inhumane treatment and \ntorture, that they have to have this information. We all know we need \nintelligence. We all know it is vital. We know how important it is. But \nto do differently not only offends our values as Americans but \nundermines our war efforts because abuse of prisoners harms, not helps, \nus in the war against terror.\n  First, subjecting prisoners to abuse leads to bad intelligence \nbecause under torture a detainee will tell his interrogator anything to \nmake the pain stop. Second, mistreatment of our prisoners endangers \nU.S. troops who might be captured by the enemy, if not in this war then \nin the next. And third, prisoner abuses exact on us a terrible toll in \nthe war of ideas because inevitably these abuses become public, as was \nrevealed--or at least a prison system was revealed; I don't know what \ngoes on in them--on the front page of one of our major newspapers.\n  If we inflict this cruel and inhumane treatment, the cruel actions of \na few darken the reputation of our country in the eyes of millions. \nAmerican values should win against all others in any war of ideas, and \nwe cannot let prisoner abuse tarnish our image.\n  Yet reports of detainee abuse continue to emerge, in large part \nbecause of confusion in the field as to what is permitted and what is \nnot. That is why part of this amendment would establish the Army Field \nManual as the uniform standard for the interrogation of Department of \nDefense detainees--so there is no confusion. Confusion about the rules \nresults in abuses in the field and that is not just my opinion, but it \nis the opinion of GEN Colin Powell, GEN Joseph Hoar, GEN John \nShalikashvili, RADM John Hutson, RADM Don Guter, and many others, those \nwho have had the experience of being involved with treatment of \ndetainees/POWs. These and other distinguished officers believe the \nabuses at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and elsewhere took place in part \nbecause our soldiers received ambiguous instructions.\n  My friend from South Carolina is very aware and may chronicle the \ndevelopment of these guidelines for treatment of prisoners which was \ndone without the consent of the military uniformed lawyers, and then a \ncouple of months later, because of how outrageous they were, they had \nto be retracted. It is still not clear. It is still not clear what the \npractices are that are sanctioned in treatment of prisoners.\n  The second part of this amendment is a prohibition against cruel, \ninhumane, and degrading treatment. If that doesn't sound new, that is \nbecause it is not. The prohibition has been a longstanding principle in \nboth law and policy in the United States. To mention a few examples: \nThe prohibitions are contained in the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to \nwhich the U.S. is a signatory; and the binding Convention Against \nTorture, negotiated by the Reagan administration and ratified by the \nSenate.\n  Nevertheless, the administration has held that the prohibition does \nnot legally apply to foreigners held overseas. They can, apparently, be \ntreated inhumanely. That means America is the only country in the world \nthat asserts a legal right to engage in cruel\n\n[[Page S12382]]\n\nand inhumane treatment. How far have we come?\n  What this also means is confusion about the rules becomes rampant \nagain. With this simple amendment we can restore clarity on a simple \nand fundamental question: Does America treat people inhumanely? My \nanswer is no, and from all I have seen, America's answer has always \nbeen no.\n  I noted this for my colleagues' consideration when I mentioned this \nearlier. While the State of Israel is no stranger to terrorist attacks, \nin 1999 the Israeli Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision to this \neffect--it contained words we may wish to reflect on today. I quote \nfrom the Israeli Supreme Court:\n\n       A democratic, freedom-loving society does not accept that \n     investigators use any means for the purpose of uncovering the \n     truth. The rules pertaining to investigations are important \n     to a democratic state. They reflect its character.\n\n  As I have said many times in response to a few Members of the Senate: \nIt is not about them; it is about us.\n  Let there be no question about America's character. In deciding these \nrules, each Member of this body has a vital role. Under article I, \nsection 8 of the U.S. Constitution, the Congress has the responsibility \nfor making--I quote from the U.S. Constitution: `` . . . rules \nconcerning captures on land and water.'' Not the executive branch, not \nthe courts, but Congress.\n  Our brave men and women in the field need clarity. America needs to \nshow the world that the terrible photos and stories of prison abuse are \na thing of the past. Let's step up to this responsibility and speak \nclearly on this critical issue.\n  We should do it not because we wish to coddle terrorists; we should \ndo it not because we view them as anything but evil and terrible; we \nshould do it because we are Americans and because we hold ourselves to \nhumane standards of treatment of people, no matter how evil or terrible \nthey may be. America stands for a moral mission, one of freedom and \ndemocracy and human rights at home and abroad. We are better than these \nterrorists--and we will win. I have said it before, but it bears \nrepeating: The enemy we fight has no respect for human life or human \nrights. They do not deserve our sympathy. But this isn't about who they \nare, it is about who we are. These are the values that distinguish us \nfrom our enemies, and we can never allow our enemies to take those \nvalues away.\n  I hope we could adopt this by voice vote at the appropriate time. \nSince we voted recently by a vote of 90 to 9, I don't see any reason \nwhy we should force people to be on record again.\n  Again, my heartfelt thanks to both Senator Warner and Senator Levin. \nI hope we can make this issue go away so we can begin repairing the \nimage of the United States of America throughout the world and still \ncarry on a very effective intelligence capability this Nation so badly \nneeds.\n  I thank my colleague.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                       Navy League\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, November 1, 2005.\n     Hon. C.W. Bill Young,\n     Chairman, House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Young: On behalf of the more than 65,000 \n     members of the Navy League of the United States, I want to \n     express our support for Sections 8154 and 8155 in the \n     Senate's version of H.R. 2863, the Defense Appropriations Act \n     of Fiscal Year 2006. These legislative provisions establish \n     the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogations and the \n     Convention Against Torture as the uniform standard for \n     interrogation of individuals detained by the Department of \n     Defense, and prohibit degrading treatment of detainees.\n       We encourage you to support adoption of Sections 8154 and \n     8155 in conference negotiations on H.R. 2863. America's hard-\n     earned reputation for respect of the rule of law and human \n     dignity is an integral part of our greatness as a Nation. The \n     world will judge us by our actions, and our troops have a \n     proven record of excellence. Establishing a written standard \n     for interrogation will only underscore this superb record. \n     The Navy League is proud to align itself with the position of \n     numerous credible voices in support of this action.\n       On behalf of the men and women of the sea services, for \n     whom the Navy League has advocated for more than 100 years, \n     thank you for your consideration of this important concern.\n           Sincerely,\n     John A. Panneton.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Hoover Institution,\n\n                                   Stanford, CA, January 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I have read your letter of January 19, \n     2005, and am prepared to provide my views to you on the issue \n     you raised\n       First, I must disassociate myself from those who have \n     attacked Alberto R. Gonzales in connection with issues \n     related to the Torture Convention. I support his appointment \n     and urge you to vote for his confirmation. Judge Gonzales has \n     relied on the opinions of other attorneys on this and other \n     issues, and a distinction must be maintained concerning those \n     opinions and his own considered judgments. Moreover, \n     attorneys acting ethically and in good faith can reach \n     different conclusions on issues. It is unhelpful in \n     developing national policy when personal attacks are launched \n     on those with whom we disagree, despite ample grounds for \n     professional differences.\n       Second, I have read some but not all the documents to which \n     you refer in your letter, and given the time available have \n     relied on the material quoted in your letter and on my \n     recollection with regard to the intentions of the Bush \n     Administration in submitting the Convention for ratification.\n       Third, the issue in your letter, as you state, is not \n     whether acts amounting to torture under the Convention are \n     forbidden in areas within the jurisdiction of the US, but to \n     which the Eighth Amendment would not apply. As I understand \n     it, Judge Gonzales has made clear that he believes the \n     Torture Convention and U.S. law require the U.S. government \n     to undertake to prevent and to punish acts amounting to \n     torture committed by US officials anywhere in the world.\n       Having made these disclaimers, I do not hesitate to say \n     that I disagree with the merits and wisdom of the conclusion \n     reached by the Department of Justice and cited in the \n     response of Judge Gonzales concerning the geographic reach of \n     Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, \n     Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n       Article 16 on its face limits the obligation of the United \n     States to undertake to prevent cruel, inhuman, or degrading \n     acts not amounting to torture to ``territory under its \n     jurisdiction.'' Within such territory, the US is obliged to \n     undertake to prevent such ``other'' acts, even if they do not \n     amount to torture.\n       As you state in your letter, the Senate agreed to ratify \n     the Torture Convention at the urging of the Reagan and Bush \n     Administrations, and one of its reservations was that in \n     applying Article 16 the US government would not be obliged to \n     undertake to enforce its provisions, anywhere, in a manner \n     inconsistent with the US interpretation of its almost \n     identically worded Eighth Amendment prohibiting cruel and \n     unusual punishment. As I testified at the time, in writing \n     and orally, the purpose of this reservation was to prevent \n     any tribunal or state from claiming that the US would have to \n     follow a different and broader meaning of the language of \n     Article 16 than the meaning of those same words in the Eighth \n     Amendment. The words of the reservation support this \n     understanding, in that they relate to the meaning of the \n     terms involved, not to their geographic application: ``the \n     United States considers itself bound by the obligation under \n     article 16 . . . only insofar as the term `cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading treatment or punishment' means the cruel, unusual \n     and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, \n     Eighth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments. . . .'' (Emphasis \n     added.) The Department of Justice at the time characterized \n     this reservation as ``modest,'' and explained its purpose as \n     being to use established meanings under the Eighth Amendment \n     instead of the Treaty's vague terms that had not yet evolved \n     under international law. No evidence of which I am aware \n     indicates that the reservation was intended to enable the US \n     to refuse to enforce Article 16 in any territory ``under its \n     jurisdiction.''\n       The Department of Justice contends, as I understand it, \n     that Article 16 has no application outside the territory of \n     the US, because the Supreme Court has interpreted the Eighth \n     Amendment to be inapplicable beyond our territorial limits. \n     The Department reasons that since the Senate reservation \n     limited enforcement of Artic1e 16 to the US understanding of \n     the Eighth Amendment's language, and since the Supreme Court \n     has concluded that the Eighth Amendment is inapplicable \n     beyond US territory, Article 16 itse1f is inapplicable beyond \n     US territory. On the basis of my understanding of the \n     purposes of the Convention, and of the purpose of the \n     reservation related to Article 16 and the Eighth Amendment, I \n     disagree with the Department's view and would urge the \n     Attorney General Designate to accept a different view.\n       The US has been in the vanguard of efforts to protect human \n     rights within the US and abroad. As President Bush has \n     repeatedly affirmed, the dignity and equality of all human \n     beings stems from natural law, i.e. the principle that the \n     Creator of life has endowed us all equally with the right to \n     be protected from abhorrent conduct. We agreed in the Torture \n     Convention that all humans should be protected against \n     official acts amounting to torture, or ``other acts'' covered \n     by Article 16, and we undertook to ``take effective \n     legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to \n     prevent acts of torture'' and the other acts covered by \n     Article 16, when they occur ``in any territory''\n\n[[Page S12383]]\n\n     under US jurisdiction. Article 2 of the Treaty requires us to \n     take measures against acts of torture in territory under our \n     jurisdiction, and we understand this to mean any territory, \n     not just the territory of the US to which the Eighth \n     Amendment is applicable. Since the underlying objective is \n     the same everywhere--to prevent official acts of torture, \n     cruelty, or other abuse covered by the meanings of the words \n     involved which are within our legal capacity to prevent--no \n     good reason can be given to conclude that the geographic \n     scope of the words in Article 16 should be narrower than the \n     geographic scope of the same words in Article 2.\n       In conclusion, the reference in the reservation to the \n     Eighth Amendment's language was intended to prevent \n     inconsistent interpretation of our obligations under Article \n     16, not to excuse us from abiding by its obligations within \n     the ``territory'' to which it applies by its terms, i.e., \n     territory that is within the jurisdiction of the United \n     States. To interpret it to limit our obligation under Article \n     16 would arguably allow US officials to act inconsistently \n     with the Treaty--and inconsistently with the Eighth \n     Amendment--in parts of the world in which we have \n     jurisdiction to prevent them from doing so. Judge Gonzales \n     said in his testimony that ``we want to be in compliance, as \n     a substantive matter under the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth \n     Amendment.'' I imagine that he and any other person who \n     shares the President's beliefs would not condone or seek to \n     protect any official from the full, potential consequences of \n     behavior so offensive as to violate the cruel and unusual \n     punishment clause in any place where the US has jurisdiction \n     to prevent and punish such conduct.\n       I hope that these views are helpful to you and the \n     Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Abe Sofaer.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with regard to the McCain amendment on \nwhich I spoke in favor, I have an obligation as manager of the bill to \npresent views of those who differ in some respects with Senator McCain \nand myself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks made by Mr. Stephen Hadley, \nNational Security Adviser to the President, on Wednesday, November 2, \nbe printed in the Record. The material is taken directly from a \ntranscript, which I presume is authentic.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Press Briefing With National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley\n\n       Q. Can I ask you a quick one on another subject? Why does \n     the administration feel it's necessary to maintain a network \n     of secret detention centers around the world, out of sight of \n     the Congress and the American people, and out of reach of \n     American law and values?\n       Mr. HADLEY: There have been some press reports this morning \n     that have touched on that subject. And as you can appreciate, \n     they raise some issues about possible intelligence \n     operations. And as you know, we don't talk about intelligence \n     operations from this podium.\n       Q. Don't they also raise issue of our values and our \n     reputation in the world?\n       Mr. HADLEY: Right, and I think the President has been \n     pretty clear on that, that while we have to do what we--do \n     what is necessary to defend the country against terrorists \n     attacks and to win the war on terror, the President has been \n     very clear that we're going to do that in a way that is \n     consistent with our values. And that is why he's been very \n     clear that the United States will not torture. The United \n     States will conduct its activities in compliance with law and \n     international obligations.\n       And in some of the issues involving detainees and the like, \n     as you know, where they have been allegations that people \n     have not met the standard the President has set, there have \n     been investigations, and they have been of two forms. There \n     are over a dozen investigations that have been done in the \n     Department of Defense to find out what has been going on. Two \n     things have happened as a result. There have been revisions \n     of procedures and practices to ensure that the standard the \n     President set is met; and then there have been \n     investigations, prosecutions, and people punished for the \n     failure to meet those standards. So we think that, consistent \n     with the President's guidance, we are both protecting the \n     country against the terrorists and doing it in a way that is \n     consistent with our values and principles.\n       Q. If I could just press you on that, how do those self-\n     correcting mechanism that affirm our values and laws, how do \n     they work if the sites are secret to begin with?\n       Mr. HADLEY: Well, the fact that they are secret, assuming \n     there are such sites, does not mean that simply because \n     something is--and some people say that the test of your \n     principles are what you do when no one is looking. And the \n     President has insisted that whether it is in the public, or \n     is in the private, the same principles will apply, and the \n     same principles will be respected. And to the extent people \n     do not meet up, measure up to those principles, there will be \n     accountability and responsibility.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before we move to a vote, I see another \ncolleague who may wish to speak to this issue, the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, who has been very much a part of the \nintegral working group of Senator McCain, myself, and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I echo the general themes of Senator McCain. This is an \nimportant event in the war on terror. He described very well that this \nis about us, not the terrorists. The terrorists are not having this \ndebate in their world. There is not much debate going on about how they \nshould behave toward innocent people, how they should behave toward \npeople under their control. We know how they behave.\n  The war is about, Is that a justified way of doing business? The \nanswer is, No.\n  Everyone condemns what they do, everyone who believes in freedom. \nThis war is about two sets of values, theirs and ours. As we adjust in \nthe war on terror, I think we have to understand that adjustment is \nnecessary, but the adjustments cannot equate to eroding what we are \nfighting for. I am all for the PATRIOT Act. I think it has been very \ngood that we adjust the way we have electronic surveillance. I think it \nhas been very good that we allow the intelligence community and \ndomestic law enforcement personnel to talk to each other about what is \ngoing on in the terrorist world. We are knocking some walls down with \nthe PATRIOT Act that have made us less secure.\n  We are adjusting our military policy. We are adjusting our legal \npositions to adopt to a war that is new and different. Here is the new \nand different part about it: The enemy we are fighting is \nnontraditional in terms of the Geneva Conventions. I think the \nPresident instinctively got it right, right after 9/11. He made a \ndeclaration that al-Qaida members are not going to be treated under the \nGeneva Conventions, considered Geneva Conventions qualified. He was \nright because al-Qaida is not a standing army. It is a group of \nterrorists who are not fighting for a nation. They don't wear a \nuniform. They randomly attack civilians. To give them Geneva \nConventions protection would be undermining the purpose of the Geneva \nConventions that rewards people for playing fair.\n  The Geneva Conventions has within it reporting requirements and other \ndevices that I think would undermine the war on terror. Some people \nthat we catch, senior al-Qaida operatives or associates of al-Qaida, we \ndon't want the world and their fellow terrorists to know we have them. \nUnder the Geneva Conventions it would require reporting.\n  Here is what we are trying to do, with Senator McCain's amendment. \nEven though they are not Geneva Conventions qualified, the President \nsaid they will be treated humanely. We have had interrogation \ntechniques in the past for enemy combatants, people who do not fall \nunder the Geneva Conventions, but they have never been in one source \ndocument. The Army Field Manual is an attempt on our part to provide \nclarity to the troops.\n  I have gone with the chairman to Guantanamo Bay and I asked the \nquestion to the interrogators: Is there anything in the Army Field \nManual that would prevent you from getting good intelligence, being \ninvolved in interrogations that would be fruitful to protect our \nNation? They said no. They don't see the Army Field Manual as written \nor being drafted or revised as an impediment to doing their jobs.\n  So what is the upside? The upside is the people in the Department of \nDefense--who may find themselves in a situation where they will have a \ngroup of prisoners, detainees, some Geneva Conventions qualified, some \nnot--will have a source document. The reason we are doing this \namendment is right after 9/11 there was an attempt by the Department of \nJustice to cut corners, in my opinion, to give strained legal reasoning \nto the Convention on Torture, trying to define what torture is in a way \nthat would get our own people in trouble.\n  The idea that you could actually break bones and that not be torture \nunder the convention, that it would have to be a near-death \nexperience--that gets us in a very dangerous area about physical abuse. \nThe point we were trying to make, and the uniformed JAGs were trying to \nmake, is when you start that reasoning, you have to understand there \nare other\n\n[[Page S12384]]\n\nlaws on the books that govern our military.\n  The Uniform Code of Military Justice has a whole section about what \nis in bounds and out of bounds when it comes to detainees and how you \ntreat detainees. It has an assault provision, making it a crime for a \nmilitary member to degrade or assault someone in our charge.\n  The concern of the JAGs is that this new interpretation of the \nConvention on Torture allowing certain activity would put military \npersonnel in jeopardy of being court martialed because of other laws on \nthe books. Now is the time to reconcile this. Now is the time to come \nup with a standard that looks at every legal source of who we are and \nhow we behave. The Army Field Manual will be one-stop shopping.\n  It will have interrogation techniques classified and unclassified \nthat will be a roadmap of how we handle people at the Department of \nDefense who are non-Geneva qualified. It is the best thing we can do \nfor the troops. Everybody is for the troops. We should be for the \ntroops. If you are for the troops, I believe the best thing you can for \nthem is to give them clarity so they will not run afoul of our values \nand our laws. It is the best thing we can do to help them as they \nexecute this war on terror when it comes to interrogating people.\n  The second part of Senator McCain's amendment is equally important \nbut for a different reason. Abu Ghraib happened. Things happen on our \nwatch in war that we are not proud of. But that happens in every war. \nThe fact that some people make mistakes, some people commit crimes, \nsome people go too far, is a part of war. How you deal with it is \nreally about you.\n  What has made us different is that we hold our own people \naccountable, and we don't let the end justify the means. We have been \ndoing that for a very long time because we are trying to set a value \nsystem in place that will be good for the world. And when we take \nsomeone who is a member of the military and prosecute them for abusing \na prisoner, that is different in a lot of places in this world. If we \nare prosecuting people for abusing prisoners, the worst thing we could \ndo is confuse people about what is in bounds and what is out of bounds. \nThat is why the Army Field Manual is necessary. But the statement \nSenator McCain is making about treating people humanely and cruel and \nunusual punishment interrogation techniques being out of bounds applies \nto everybody in the Government.\n  I believe we have to make a decision soon that that is what we are \ngoing to do for many years to come. The war on terror is going to be a \nlong, hard road. We are going to be constantly asked to adapt to win \nthe war. The question is, Should we sometimes set aside exceptions that \nare totally different than the way we have lived our lives for 200 \nyears to win this war? My answer is, Absolutely not, because this war \nis not about taking down a capital, sinking a navy, or capturing an \narmy; this war is about tolerance, values, religion, and respect for \nhuman rights. This war is truly about character.\n  I believe with all my heart and all my soul that what happened in Abu \nGhraib is an aberration in terms of the men and women in the military. \nIt doesn't reflect on who they are and what they believe. But it has \ndone great damage to this country. To the terrorists, they are not the \naudience; it is those millions of people out there who are looking at \ndemocracy, checking under the hood, and trying to figure out which way \nto go.\n  As a nation, we need to say as strongly as we can that no terrorist \nwill have a safe haven. We are coming after you. We are going to fight \nyou to the death. But if we capture a terrorist, we will want good \ninformation. We want to try them for their crimes, but once we have \nthem in our charge, then it becomes about us because if you do not \npractice what you preach, your children will go astray if you are a \nparent. If you do not practice what you preach, your value set that has \nmade you a great nation, standing out in a world in a unique way--you \nwill tarnish who you are. The only way we are going to win this war is \nto have American values shine brightly. And character is about doing \nthe right thing when nobody watches.\n  I am hopeful that we can have a compromise and accommodation between \nthe executive branch and the legislative branch on this issue; that we \ncan have a policy statement that if you are in the hands of the CIA or \na non-DOD agency, you can be interrogated aggressively, but you will be \ntreated with a value set that this country has been fighting for in the \npast and is fighting for now. As the President reaffirmed just days \nago, no matter where the prison is, no matter whether it is a prison \nknown or unknown, American values follow that prisoner. That is what it \nhas to be.\n  Can we do better language? Maybe. I am certainly openminded to \nworking on language that makes who we are crystal clear. But I will not \nentertain a retreat. I will not entertain an exception that washes away \nwhat we have been standing for and fighting for and what over 2,000 \nyoung men and women have died for.\n  The courts are confused. The courts are crying out for congressional \ninvolvement. The executive branch is trying to adapt. I really do \nbelieve that the best thing we could do for this President and all \nfuture Presidents is for the Congress to get into the game and be an \nally on how you detain, interrogate, and prosecute enemy combatants. \nThat is missing. We have been AWOL. It is now time for us to step up to \nthe plate and exercise our constitutional responsibility--not to weaken \nthe Presidency but to make the executive branch stronger in the eyes of \nthe courts.\n  If you had a policy that was signed off on by the Congress, signed \noff on by the executive branch, I am totally convinced that the \njudicial side of our Government would be much more deferential. They \nare telling us that. What benefit would that be? We could go to the \nworld, and this President and the next could say that America at every \nlevel of Government is united. We are going to have aggressive \ninterrogation techniques, we are going to detain people who are enemy \ncombatants, and we are going to take them off the battlefield. And some \nof them are going to stand trial for their crimes. But we are going to \ndo it together, and we are going to do it within our values. That would \nbe the strongest message we could extend to the world. It would be the \nright message to send to our own troops. If we do not get this right \nnow, people after us are going to pay a heavy price.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I followed that statement with great care. \nI commend the Senator. I think he articulated the key issues. He used \nthe word ``compromise'' and keeping an open mind.\n  I wish to assure those who are following this that our group that \nsupports Senator McCain's amendment have taken careful consideration of \nthe continuing need to collect our intelligence, first and foremost to \nprotect our troops and, of course, first and foremost to protect our \ncitizens back here in this Nation from terrorists or other attacks.\n  It is a balanced approach that we have tried to take on this, a \ncareful one, thoughtfully moving each step of the way and entertaining \ncarefully the views of others who have views different from our own.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the war against terrorism is as much as a \ncontest of values and ideals as it is a military conflict. In this \nstruggle, America should lead as it always has, setting an example by \ntreating others as we would want to be treated ourselves, even in times \nof war.\n  This golden rule has been tarnished and abandoned by the Bush \nadministration. As a result, for much of the world, the American face \nin the war on terror is represented by images of torture and abuse. The \n``anything goes'' attitude at the highest levels of the Bush White \nHouse has made the war on terror much harder to win. And it has placed \nour own soldiers at risk throughout the globe, should they be captured.\n  How can we demand that the rest of the world abide by standards of \ncommon decency when we abuse prisoners ourselves?\n  So I come to the floor today in strong support of the McCain \namendment to protect American honor by ensuring clear rules for the \ninterrogation\n\n[[Page S12385]]\n\nof prisoners. This common sense proposal ensures that we have one \nstandard of interrogation for our Government, and it makes sure the \nrules are clear so that our interrogators and case officers know what \nthe limits are.\n  Before September 11, 2001, everyone knew what the limits were. They \nwere clearly laid out in the Army Field Manual, our laws, and our \ntreaty obligations. Yet this administration began systematically taking \nthose rules apart.\n  COL. Larry Wilkerson, the chief of staff to Secretary Powell, said on \nNPR yesterday, ``The Secretary of Defense, under cover of the Vice \nPresident's office began to create an environment . . . of allowing the \nPresident in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief to deviate from the \nGeneva Conventions.''\n  William Taft, the State Department legal advisor in President Bush's \nfirst term, knew the consequences of that fundamental shift. In an \naddress at American University, he said that the decision to violate \ninternational standards ``unhinged those responsible for the treatment \nof the detainees . . . from the legal guidelines for interrogation . . \n. embodied in the Army Field Manual for decades. Set adrift in \nuncharted waters and under pressure from their leaders to develop \ninformation on the plans and practices of al Qaeda, it was predictable \nthat those managing the interrogation would eventually go too far.''\n  The Judge Advocate Generals from the Air Force, Navy, Army and \nMarines--in other words, the chief lawyers for every one of the \nuniformed services--warned that the adoption of interrogation policies \ncontrary to the Geneva Conventions would result in grave harms. These \nare all professional military lawyers who have dedicated their lives \nand distinguished careers to serving the men and women in uniform and \nprotecting their Nation. In an extraordinary set of memos they strongly \nopposed the legal theories foisted on them by the administration's \nlawyers. The JAGS warned that the policies would harm not only our \nefforts to stop terrorism, but would also put U.S. forces at risk who \nwere themselves detained in this and future conflicts. One legal \nscholar called the administration's case some of the worst legal \nreasoning he had ever seen.\n  As Air Force Major General Jack Rives said: ``We need to consider the \noverall impact of approving extreme interrogation techniques as giving \nofficial approval and legal sanction to the application of \ninterrogation techniques that U.S. forces have consistently been \ntrained are unlawful.''\n  Yet; despite the condemnation of these new interrogation policies by \nexperienced diplomatic and military personnel alike, the administration \npersists in pursuing these disturbing practices. Just last week, Vice \nPresident Cheney himself suggested that the CIA should be exempt from \nthe prohibitions against cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. As of \nthis week, it is clear why. The CIA apparently is holding more than a \nhundred detainees in secret prisons around the world to interrogate \nthem with the techniques roundly rejected by the military lawyers.\n  This is unacceptable. In America, no one is above the law. There is \nno reason the CIA--or any other agency of our government--should be \nimmune from American norms and standards of conduct.\n  This amendment will make our message clear. As Americans, not only do \nwe fight for our ideals, but we live by them. We can no longer tolerate \nambiguity when it comes to the very standards we are trying to enforce \naround the world.\n  In the first gulf war, our compliance with the Geneva Conventions--\nthe international gold standard for treatment of captives--was called \n``the best of any nation in any conflict in the history of the \nConventions'' by the International Red Cross, the organization charged \nwith overseeing compliance with the conventions.\n  There are good reasons that we should abide by the Geneva \nConventions. They protect our own troops. The Conventions require that \nall captured combatants or prisoners of war must be visited by the Red \nCross to help assure the world that their treatment is humane. The \nInternational Red Cross visited U.S. servicemen held prisoner in Kosovo \nin the 1990s. They visited our troops held in the first gulf war.\n  As Milt Bearden, a former CIA official, wrote in this morning's New \nYork Times, ``the treatment of prisoners generally reaches symmetry in \nany war.'' In other words, if we abuse prisoners in a war, others will \nabuse our soldiers if they are taken prisoner.\n  As Mr. Bearden pointed out, our actions make a difference, even in \nextreme situations. He wrote, ``The policy of three presidents--Jimmy \nCarter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush--was that both the Afghan \nmujahedeen insurgents we supported and their Soviet adversaries would \nbe treated within the precepts of the Geneva Conventions when taken \nprisoner. I can state without reservation that the United States used \nits influence consistently to promote that policy, with overwhelmingly \npositive results.''\n  Sadly, our treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib, in Afghanistan, \nGuantanamo, and other sites, makes it far more difficult for us to \nguarantee the protections of the Geneva Conventions for our military if \nthey are captured, and degrades the international consensus against \nsuch abuse.\n  America must lead by example. After the abuse of the detainees at Abu \nGhraib, President Bush said, ``Their treatment does not reflect the \nnature of the American people. That is not the way we do things in \nAmerica.''\n  Let's make the President's bold words into a reality and adopt the \nMcCain amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that full text of Mr. \nBearden's op-ed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 4, 2005]\n\n                  When the C.I.A. Played by the Rules\n\n                           (By Milt Bearden)\n\n       Today the Supreme Court justices are expected to debate \n     whether they will hear a case involving a Yemeni named Salim \n     Ahmed Hamdan, who is accused of being Osama bin Laden's \n     driver. A federal appeals court found that Mr. Hamdan, who \n     was captured in Afghanistan in 2001 and is being held at \n     Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, was not entitled to the protections \n     of the Geneva Conventions; he has appealed to the high court.\n       If the court does not choose to review the appellate \n     court's decision, and then overturn it, America's national \n     security will be endangered. I say that based on my \n     experience as the senior American intelligence officer during \n     the final three years of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan \n     (1986 to 1989). And I also feel that our intelligence \n     agencies and military commanders should make clear to the \n     Bush administration that our country's most fundamental \n     commitments of humanitarian treatment have long been extended \n     to the Afghan battlefield.\n       The policy of three presidents--Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan \n     and George H. W. Bush--was that both the Afghan mujahedeen \n     insurgents we supported and their Soviet adversaries would be \n     treated within the precepts of the Geneva Conventions when \n     taken prisoner. I can state without reservation that the \n     United States used its influence consistently to promote that \n     policy--with overwhelmingly positive results.\n       When in Pakistan, I oversaw America's covert support to the \n     Afghan resistance that had begun in December 1979. Throughout \n     that war, countless thousands of Afghan insurgents fell into \n     the hands of Soviet forces; a far smaller number of Soviet \n     soldiers were taken prisoner by the Afghan irregulars. I \n     urged the Afghans, the Pakistani officers who supported them, \n     and the politicians on both sides of the ``zero line'' (the \n     Afghan border with Pakistan) that all combatants taken \n     prisoner deserved the protection of the Geneva Conventions. \n     My most effective argument was founded on reciprocity--that \n     the treatment of prisoners generally reaches symmetry in any \n     war.\n       The Afghan war was exceptionally brutal, with more than a \n     million Afghans killed, a million and a half wounded, and \n     three million more driven into exile by the Soviet invaders \n     (who had 15,000 of their own killed). Early in the conflict, \n     the Afghans were brutal to their prisoners, using them as \n     beasts of burden and objects of amusement in traditional \n     knife play; the Soviets responded in kind. But as American \n     involvement deepened, the Afghans were persuaded to change \n     that behavior; at the same time, the Soviet troops, too, \n     began treating their prisoners in accordance with \n     international protocols.\n       One incident in particular drives home the wisdom of this \n     policy. In early August 1988, I was informed that a Soviet \n     Su-25 ground attack aircraft had been brought down, lightly \n     damaged, that day by antiaircraft fire in eastern \n     Afghanistan. Was I interested in ``buying'' it?\n       I was delighted. An Su-25, a superb plane often called the \n     Frogfoot, would nicely augment the equipment the United \n     States had been collecting from the Afghan battlefield over \n     the previous decade. After a little haggling, I agreed to \n     give the Afghan guerrillas eight Toyota pickup trucks and a \n     few rocket\n\n[[Page S12386]]\n\n     launchers in exchange. Almost as an afterthought, the Afghans \n     told me they had also taken the pilot, a silver-haired \n     colonel. Was I interested?\n       I was, indeed, interested. I remembered that just after I \n     arrived in Pakistan, I was shown a photograph of a Soviet \n     pilot in a silver flight suit, up to his waist in snow, skin \n     burned by the relentless sun, with a bullet hole in the side \n     of his head. His Tokarev semi-automatic pistol was still \n     clutched in his hand. He had killed himself rather than be \n     captured by insurgents. Back then, Soviet pilots had it \n     particularly rough when captured.\n       I had made it clear from that moment that American policy \n     was that captured pilots be treated as prisoners of war under \n     international agreements, and that I would offer rewards for \n     any pilots used in prisoner exchanges, repatriated to the \n     Soviet Union, or, if they so desired, resettled in the West.\n       I threw in another couple of Toyotas and the pilot came \n     with his downed aircraft in a sort of package deal. The \n     colonel was handed over to the Pakistanis--not wanting to \n     create an incident, I stayed clear of him, though I did make \n     sure he knew that a condominium in Phoenix, or wherever, was \n     an option open to him. He eventually chose to return to the \n     Soviet Union, where he was hailed as a national hero. Part of \n     the swap, though, was the extraction of certain guarantees \n     from the Soviet commanders that their treatment of Afghan \n     prisoners would reach ``symmetry'' of a sort with the \n     treatment of that pilot.\n       The story didn't end there, however. The next time I saw \n     that colonel he was on TV, helping beat back the 1991 coup \n     against Mikhail Gorbachev. He soon became Boris Yeltsin's \n     vice president, then turned on Mr. Yeltsin in 1993. His name \n     is Aleksandr Rutskoi, and he remains a voice for democracy \n     and one of President Vladimir Putin's leading critics.\n       There are two salient points here. First, the present war \n     in Afghanistan must be seen as part of a struggle that has \n     been under way for more than a quarter-century. The Afghan \n     insurgents themselves are not likely to distinguish to any \n     large degree the differences between being taken prisoner by \n     the Soviets in Mazar-i-Sharif in 1985 or by the Americans in \n     the same tortured city in 2005.\n       The second thing being missed, or more likely ignored, is \n     that there was an American policy toward insurgents taken \n     prisoner by the Soviets in Afghanistan during the Soviet \n     occupation. That policy was to urge both sides toward \n     accepting that the Geneva Conventions applied, and to reach a \n     point where each side treated its prisoners within \n     established rules. In the case of Colonel Rutskoi, a graphic \n     point was made to both sides.\n       It is a point that has become muddied in the Hamdan case. \n     The issue is not whether Mr. Hamdan is a Qaeda terrorist, but \n     whether as a captive of the United States he should be \n     treated under the traditional rules of the Afghan conflict--\n     that is, under international norms. A unilateral change in \n     those rules dictated by America--the latest in the line of \n     foreign powers to find themselves in Afghanistan--is not only \n     unseemly, but would also put our troops there and elsewhere \n     in the struggle against terrorism in harm's way.\n       The questions of applicability and enforcement of the \n     Geneva Conventions posed by the Hamdan case should not go \n     unanswered by the Supreme Court. We are a better nation than \n     that.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2425) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we had announced earlier--I see my \ndistinguished colleague, a member of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Reed--that we would move to Senator Allard and then follow with \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2423\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2423.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To authorize a program to provide health, medical, and life \n    insurance benefits to workers at the Rocky Flats Environmental \nTechnology Site, Colorado, who would otherwise fail to qualify for such \n         benefits because of an early physical completion date)\n\n       On page 378, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3114. RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR WORKERS AT ROCKY FLATS \n                   ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY SITE, COLORADO.\n\n       (a) Program Authorized.--Subject to the availability of \n     funds under subsection (d), the Secretary of Energy shall \n     establish a program for the purposes of providing health, \n     medical, and life insurance benefits to workers at the Rocky \n     Flats Environmental Technology Site, Colorado (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Site''), who do not qualify for \n     such benefits because the physical completion date was \n     achieved before December 15, 2006.\n       (b) Eligibility for Benefits.--A worker at the Site is \n     eligible for health, medical, and life insurance benefits \n     under the program described in subsection (a) if the \n     employee--\n       (1) was employed by the Department of Energy, or by \n     contract or first or second tier subcontract to perform \n     cleanup, security, or administrative duties or \n     responsibilities at the Site on September 29, 2003; and\n       (2) would have achieved applicable eligibility requirements \n     for health, medical, and life insurance benefits as defined \n     in the Site retirement benefit plan documents if the physical \n     completion date had been achieved on December 15, 2006, as \n     specified in the Site project completion contract.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Health, medical, and life insurance benefits.--The term \n     ``health, medical, and life insurance benefits'' means those \n     benefits that workers at the Site are eligible for through \n     collective bargaining agreements, projects, or contracts for \n     work scope.\n       (2) Physical completion date.--The term ``physical \n     completion date'' means the date the Site contractor has \n     completed all services required by the Site project \n     completion contract other than close-out tasks and services \n     related to plan sponsorship and management of post-project \n     completion retirement benefits.\n       (3) Plan sponsorship and program management of post-project \n     completion retirement benefits.--The term ``plan sponsorship \n     and program management of post-project completion retirement \n     benefits'' means those duties and responsibilities that are \n     necessary to execute, and are consistent with, the terms and \n     legal responsibilities of the instrument under which the \n     post-project completion retirement benefits are provided to \n     workers at the Site.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--Of the amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy in \n     fiscal year 2006 for the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology \n     Site, $15,000,000 shall be made available to the Secretary to \n     carry out the program described in subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the incredible \nachievements of the workers at the Department of Energy's Rocky Flats \nEnvironmental Technology Site and to offer an amendment on the behalf \nof these workers.\n  Rocky Flats is located just a few miles northwest of Denver, Co, and \nfor over four decades, this facility was the Department of Energy's \ndedicated site for manufacturing plutonium pits for the U.S. nuclear \nweapons stockpile. This highly classified production facility was run \nby over 8,000 Coloradoans who worked day and night for most of the cold \nwar and used some of the most dangerous substances known to man, \nincluding plutonium, beryllium, and uranium.\n  The workers at Rocky Flats were devoted to their job and believed in \ntheir mission. They risked their lives on a daily basis, but did so \nwith the knowledge that their efforts were contributing to the security \nof our Nation.\n  When plutonium pit production ended in 1991, it was unclear what role \nthese workers would play in the cleanup of Rocky Flats. They could have \nwalked away from the job. Yet the workers at Rocky Flats were not ready \nto quit. They saw a new challenge in front of them--the cleanup of \nRocky Flats.\n  Their task was anything but simple. Five large plutonium processing \nfacilities, encompassing over a million square feet, were highly \ncontaminated with dangerous radioactive material. The contamination was \nso severe that these buildings were ranked among the top 10 most \ncontaminated facilities in the Department of Energy nuclear weapons \ncomplex.\n  I, however, had faith in the workers at Rocky Flats. I am pleased \nthat the workers at Rocky Flats have not disappointed us. The cleanup \nat Rocky Flats was declared completed on October 12 of this year, a \nfull year and 3 months ahead of schedule.\n  We must keep in mind that most of these workers had to literally \ndevelop an entire new skill set. They went from manufacturing plutonium \npits to dismantling over 1,400 highly radioactive gloveboxes.\n  They tore down buildings while wearing stiff environmental protection \nsuits. They cleaned up rooms that were so contaminated that they were \nforced\n\n[[Page S12387]]\n\nto use the highest level of respiratory protection available.\n  Listen to some of the Rocky Flats workers' accomplishments:\n  All weapons grade plutonium was removed in 2003.\n  More than 1,400 contaminated glove boxes and hundreds of process \ntanks have been removed.\n  More than 400,000 cubic meters of low-level radioactive waste has \nbeen removed.\n  All 802 facilities have been demolished.\n  All four uranium production facilities have been demolished.\n  All five plutonium production facilities have been demolished.\n  All 360 sites of soil contamination have been remediated.\n  The last shipment of transuranic waste was shipped this past April.\n  Completion of the cleanup--1 year and 3 months ahead of schedule.\n  Just as important, these workers were extraordinarily productive even \nthough they knew they were essentially working themselves out of a job. \nWith the completion of the cleanup and the closure of Rocky Flats, they \nknew they would have to find employment elsewhere. There was no \nguarantee for a new job.\n  Despite knowing they were going to lose their jobs, the workers at \nRocky Flats remained highly motivated and totally committed to their \ncleanup mission.\n  Given the sacrifice and dedication demonstrated by these workers, you \nwould think assisting those workers who lose their retirement benefits \nbecause of the early completion of the cleanup would be a top priority \nfor the Department of Energy. After all, these workers saved the \nDepartment billions upon billions in cleanup costs.\n  Last year, however, it became clear that the cleanup at Rocky Flats \nwould be completed much earlier than anyone expected. The workers were \nsupportive of early closure, but were concerned that some of their \ncolleagues would lose retirement benefits because of early closure.\n  I shared their concern and requested in last year's Defense \nauthorization bill that the Department of Energy provide Congress with \na report on the number of workers who would not receive retirement \nbenefits and the cost of providing these benefits. After a lengthy \ndelay, the Department of Energy reported that about 29 workers at three \ncleanup sites would not receive pension and/or lifetime medical \nbenefits because of the closure, and the cost of providing benefits to \nthese workers, according to DOE's report, was just over $12 million.\n\n  To my dismay, the Department of Energy report was woefully \nincomplete. I was informed later at least 50 workers would have \nqualified for retirement benefits had the Department of Energy bothered \nto include those workers who had already been laid off because of the \naccelerated closure schedule. This means as many as 75 workers at Rocky \nFlats will lose their pension, medical benefits or, in some cases, both \nbecause they worked faster, less expensively, and achieved more than \nthey were supposed to. They not only worked themselves out of a job, \nbut they also worked themselves out of retirement benefits and, most \nimportantly, medical care.\n  Workers such as Doug Woodard and Leo Chavez now find themselves with \neither severely reduced benefits or no benefits at all. Doug started \nwork at Rocky Flats all the way into 1982 and was responsible for \nmonitoring radiation contamination at the site. He missed qualifying \nfor medical benefits by less than 2 months. For Leo Chavez, who worked \nat Rocky Flats for 17 years, DOE's treatment was even worse. The \nDepartment of Energy thanked him for his service and showed him the \ndoor 6 working days before he qualified for lifetime medical benefits--\nI repeat, just 6 days before he qualified to medical benefits.\n  Sadly, the Department of Energy has failed to step up to the plate \nand help these workers who did so much to save American taxpayers so \nmuch money. Instead, the Department of Energy has played the numbers \ngame with these workers. The Department argues that the contract signed \nwith the workers already provided sufficient incentives, and those \nindividuals already received an additional year of service time. Yet \nthe Department will not bring up the numbers that matter most.\n  Here are a couple of examples. We saved over $35 billion, the amount \nof money the Department of Energy in 1995 thought would be needed to \nclean up Rocky Flats. That was with the 60-year cleanup schedule. Then \nwe came in with a plan to dramatically shorten that length of time by \none-tenth. The amount of money the American people saved when employees \nat Rocky Flats agreed in 1999 to accelerate the cleanup at Rocky Flats \nwas $28 billion.\n  Now, $600 million exists. That is the amount of money the American \ntaxpayer saved on top of the $28 billion because the workers at Rocky \nFlats exceeded even the accelerated cleanup schedule by over a year.\n  The Department of Energy does not talk about the hundreds of millions \nthe American people will save when workers at the Savannah River, \nHanford, and Idaho cleanup sites see they will not be punished for \naccelerating their cleanup activities. Many of the workers at Rocky \nFlats have served our Nation for over two decades. They have risked \ntheir lives, day in and day out, first by building nuclear weapons \ncomponents and then by cleaning up some of the most contaminated \nbuildings in the world. All they have asked for in return is to be \ntreated with fairness and respect. To the great disappointment of the \nworkers at Rocky Flats, the Department of Energy has no intentions of \nkeeping its end of the bargain. These workers would have received their \nretirement benefits had the cleanup continued to 2035, as originally \npredicted. More importantly, these workers would have received their \nretirement benefits had the cleanup continued to December 15 of 2006, a \nlittle over a year, as the site cleanup contract specified. By \naccelerating the cleanup by over a year and saving the American \ntaxpayer over $600 million, many of these workers will be left without \nthe medical, health, and life insurance benefits they deserve and have \nearned.\n  The Department's refusal to provide these benefits has ramifications \nfar beyond Rocky Flats. Because Rocky Flats is the first major DOE \ncleanup clean site, workers at other sites around the country are \nwatching to see how the Department of Energy treats the workers at \nRocky Flats. Unfortunately, they have seen how the Department of Energy \nhas failed to step up and provide retirement benefits to those who have \nearned it. The workers at other sites now have no incentive to \naccelerate cleanup. The question is, why should they? The Department of \nEnergy hasn't lifted a finger to help the workers at Rocky Flats. It \nwould be foolish for the workers at other sites, such as Hanford and \nSanta Ana River, to think the DOE would act fairly with them.\n  To me, the Department's decision is penny wise and pound foolish. By \nrefusing to provide these benefits, the Department saves money in the \nshort term. Yet by discouraging the workers from supporting \nacceleration, the Department is going to cost the American taxpayer \nbillions in additional funding in the long run.\n  To correct this mistake, I offer an amendment that will provide some \nof the benefits to those workers who will have lost them because of \nearly closure. I am pleased my colleague from Colorado, Senator \nSalazar, has agreed to cosponsor this important amendment. This \namendment is limited and narrowly focused. It provides health, medical, \nand a life insurance benefits to those workers who would have qualified \nhad the site remained open until December 15, 2006, the date of the \nsite cleanup contract. This amendment does not add to the budget. In \nfact, all it does is direct that a very small portion of the money \nalready provided in this bill for Rocky Flats be used to help those \nworkers.\n  To be clear, these benefits are not an additional bonus for a job \nwell done, nor is it a going away present for two decades of service. \nThe benefits--the health, medical, and life insurance benefits--are \nwhat these workers have already earned, nothing more and nothing less.\n  Some might suggest these workers already received a bonus and a \nyear's worth of service time as part of their contract. Yet by closing \na year early, the Department of Energy has taken many of the bonuses \naway from the workers, including the year of service time promised to \nthem.\n\n[[Page S12388]]\n\n  The workers at Rocky Flats are ordinary people who achieved some \nextraordinary goals. They made the impossible possible. We, in this \nSenate, have an obligation to correct the injustice being perpetrated \nby the Department of Energy. In my view, it is time for this Senate to \ncorrect this mistake.\n  I have, in the Senate, a number of illustrations to share with \nMembers of the Senate. This is a picture of Rocky Flats in 1955. The \nwhole area was covered with construction. Most believed at that time it \nwould take 70 years and cost the American taxpayer $35 billion to clean \nup Rocky Flats. The Department of Energy found several buildings in \nthis complex to be among the most contaminated in the country. Building \n771, in particular, was dubbed by the national media as the most \ndangerous building in Colorado.\n\n  Now I will proceed to some of the challenges we had. This picture \nreflects the glove boxes. The most dangerous task the workers at Rocky \nFlats had was to dismantle and eventually ship out over 1,400 highly \ncontaminated glove boxes. The workers placed their hands in the gloves \nand worked with the contaminated material inside the boxes to break \nthese down and eventually ship them out. It was a real challenge. They \nhad been used primarily to fashion the plutonium pits and other nuclear \nweapon components. Obviously, they were highly contaminated. \nEventually, they had to be shipped out as a whole unit in order to \ndismantle these glove boxes.\n  The next illustration is the cleanup and demolishing of buildings at \nRocky Flats, another dangerous task. The actual demolishing of the \nbuildings and structures of Rocky Flats occurred with some very \ncontaminated buildings. Specialized machinery had to be brought in and \nextra care had to be used to ensure the safety of all involved, as well \nas to prevent radiation exposure. The workers had to learn how to work \nin a new way in these cleanup processes. They had to use many \ntechniques to protect themselves in buildings in which the very same \nworkers had been working not too long before, building triggers for the \nsame nuclear weapons.\n  The next illustration is Rocky Flats in 2005. I want the Members to \ncompare the two illustrations. This is Rocky Flats before cleanup; this \nis Rocky Flats after cleanup. We are getting back to the prairie and \nthe plains in Colorado. We have a great view of the mountains, with no \nbuildings. This is Rocky Flats 2 weeks ago. There are no buildings, no \nwaste deposits, no fences, not even asphalt. All this remains an open \nspace.\n  The workers at Rocky Flats achieved this. They should be proud about \nsaving the American taxpayer over $600 million. They completed the \nmission a year and 3 months ahead of schedule. They worked safely and \nin a manner that we can all be proud.\n  To give an idea of the kind of people we are talking about, here are \nsome of the workers at Rocky Flats. This is a group of them. They are \nordinary people. They performed their duties with professionalism and \nextraordinary competence. They made the impossible possible and \nachieved more than we ever expected. They deserve the benefits they \nwould have received had they not worked as hard or had they waited \nuntil the date specified in the site cleanup time practice. They saved \nthe American people over $600 million. It is the least we can do to \nprovide them with the benefits they have earned.\n  I remind the Senate, it is time to act, it is time to correct this \nmistake.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the balance of his time.\n  Under the unanimous consent, the Chair recognizes the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see Senator Reed is here. I will make \na few comments on Senator Allard's amendment if that is all right. I \nask the unanimous consent be modified to the extent that I be allowed \nto speak for a few minutes now and that Senator Reed then be recognized \nimmediately thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Allard for his \nleadership in the Senate, his superb leadership on the Committee on \nArmed Services. We miss him. But he is also on the very important \nCommittee on Appropriations. I am sure he had a painful decision to \nmake, but I am sure it is a decision in which his constituents will \njoin in his decision to leave us and go to Committee on Appropriations.\n  The Senator knows this issue because he dealt with it for so many \nyears. In particular, he used to chair the subcommittee that I now \nchair that deals with the issue. He has been committed to dealing with \nand promptly and effectively eliminating the difficulties at Rocky \nFlats. Our country is in his debt and the debt of those people who have \nhelped make the cleanup possible. Therefore, the Senator knows why I am \nmost reluctant to oppose his amendment as written, but I must do so. I \nshare a few thoughts about it.\n  The amendment reaches into a relationship between contract employees \nfor the Government who were performing environmental cleanup and their \nemployer, which was a private contractor, Kaiser Hill. Kaiser Hill won \nthis contract with the Department of Energy to perform the cleanup \nwork. They hired people under certain terms and agreements in a \nnegotiated contract with their employees. They were hired under that \nbasis.\n\n  So, in effect, the Government is undertaking now to modify, amend, \nalter, and fund additional moneys that relate to that contract between \nthe contractor and the employees. It directs the Secretary of Energy to \ninstruct Kaiser Hill to grant retirement and health benefits to \nemployees which those employees would have earned if the cleanup had \ntaken longer than it actually did.\n  The cleanup of Rocky Flats did not take as long as some predicted, \nbut everyone knew this was a contract that would end promptly or at \nleast at a certain date in the future. It came in quicker, for which \neveryone is delighted. But there was no doubt people knew it was not a \npermanent, lifetime contract.\n  So Rocky Flats is no more. Our country is the better for it. If you \ngo to the site, you will see, as Senator Allard has shown, an empty \nspace on that Colorado plateau. The workers for the most part have \ndispersed and gone on to other jobs. Many Government contracts complete \nearly or do not run as long as originally anticipated. That is a fact. \nWe cannot start down the road of altering the benefits of contractor \nworkers when this happens, particularly when we have a contract that we \nknow is not going to be for an extended period of time.\n  Also, I would call to the attention of all our Members that the \nGovernment and the contractor were not unaware of this problem, and \nthey advanced 1 full year of credit toward retirement and health care \nbenefits for every employee who was terminated. They also realized at \nsome point that the contract was going to be terminated early.\n  So union negotiations took place, and an agreement was reached. It \nwas agreed that,based on the termination date, additional funds would \nbe paid to compensate the employees. As I understand it, $4,200 turned \nout to be the bonus, the incentive package, payment that they received \nas a result of completing the contract early. In other words, it gave \nthem cash money they could use as a benefit or money they could utilize \nto transition to another employer.\n  The Department of Energy is very concerned that this amendment alters \nthe bargain struck between Kaiser Hill and its employees. Most of the \nKaiser Hill employees were covered under collective bargaining \nagreements, and staggered layoffs were anticipated as the cleanup \nneared.\n  I would like to offer, Mr. President, for the Record, and do offer \nfor the Record, a summary of the benefits that were made available to \nthe employees as a result of the anticipated early termination of this \ncontract. I ask unanimous consent that summary be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Rocky Flats Employee Benefit Initiatives\n\n       The Department of Energy has instituted, through its \n     closure contractors, numerous incentives to reward employees \n     for accelerating closure. Rocky Flats-Kaiser Hill has \n     implemented many benefit initiatives and has dedicated a \n     significant percentage of their fee to support closure. The \n     following lists the initiatives:\n       Retirement Plan Improvements--A ``Rule of 70'' was put in \n     place that allows a laid off\n\n[[Page S12389]]\n\n     employee to retire if their age and years of service equal at \n     least 70 and the employee is less than age 50. This was \n     reduced from the ``Rule of 80.'' This reduction results in an \n     investment of tens of millions of dollars in additional \n     retirement benefits provided to workers. The Rule of 70 \n     allows employees access to retiree medical coverage. Upon \n     layoff, they will be eligible for a reduced pension benefit \n     which they have the option of taking in a lump sum \n     distribution.\n       Robust Workforce Transition Program--This program was \n     implemented to provide many services, including an onsite \n     Career Transition Center, job search training, resume \n     development, counseling, job fairs, and financial planning. \n     Approximately 2000-2500 people took advantage of this program \n     over the last two years.\n       Severance Pay for Steelworkers--Lump sum severance pay was \n     provided for steelworkers. Workers receive one week severance \n     pay for every year of service up to 20 years plus an \n     additional lump sum amount. 313 workers received a $5,000 \n     lump sum payment and 358 workers received $7,000. (The amount \n     was increased in October 2004).\n       Bonuses--880 steelworkers received up to $4,200 in \n     performance bonuses. 365 salaried employees receive several \n     thousands in bonuses as well. On-the-spot bonuses are also \n     provided.\n       Improved Savings Plan--The 401(k) program was revised to \n     allow hourly steelworkers employees immediate plan \n     participation, and a Company match after 1 year of service. \n     This of course is in addition to traditional pension program.\n       Enhanced Tuition Reimbursement Program--This program \n     provides funds for education and retraining in non site \n     specific careers for employees. This is available for two \n     years after an employee is terminated.\n       Entrepreneurial Resource Program--This program provides up \n     to $5000 assistance for new business endeavors.\n       Leave Incentives--This program removes caps on paid leave \n     accrual, which allows employees to bank unused vacation time; \n     this provides employees with the opportunity to build an \n     additional financial cushion.\n       Relocation Incentives--This is provided for those who \n     relocate to another DOE site. Actual cost or $5,000 is \n     available. This is available for two years after an employee \n     is terminated.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say this: This was anticipated. \nCompensation for early termination was negotiated and agreed upon. And \nat whatever date you choose, some will be out of it, and some will be \nin it.\n  So I note this: In the Deficit Reduction Act we just completed \nyesterday, we had a lot of talk about the fiscal situation in which \nthis country finds itself. There was debate about the hard choices we \nface as a nation so we do not burden our children and grandchildren \nwith obligations that, in retrospect, were not wise.\n  I respect my colleague from Colorado as much as I respect any Senator \nin the Senate. I commend the workers at Rocky Flats for what has been \nachieved. I am proud of that. But I believe, as we face this amendment \nas written, the concerns of the Department of Energy are legitimate, \nprincipled concerns. They are not skinflinty concerns, mean-spirited \nconcerns, but a genuine concern that this is not a road we need to go \ndown.\n  What if we agree to build so many aircraft and we cut that number in \nhalf? We do that every day. The number of ships, contracts are \nterminated based on the terms of those contracts, and closure penalties \nare paid, and we go on. We do not need to have the politicians come in \nand redo those.\n  So I respect my colleague from Colorado. As written, I am of the \nbelief the Department of Energy's concerns are justified; therefore, I \nmust reject and ask my colleagues to not support this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama yields the floor.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to respond briefly, if I may.\n  First of all, I would like to state for the record, I was the \nchairman of the Strategic Subcommittee on Armed Services before my good \nfriend and colleague from Alabama took over that responsibility. I \ncongratulate him for a job well done. There are some very difficult \nissues relating to cleanup. Rocky Flats is the first major nuclear \nfacility in the country that has been cleaned up. This program has not \nbeen moved forward like it should be moving forward. I think it is \nimportant we leave a good taste with the workers because workers at \nother plants are obviously going to be watching what happens at Rocky \nFlats.\n  I would like to comment, the $15 million we have in here does not add \nto the spending picture. It is out of the savings that comes from early \nclosure, which is about $600 million. So you can bring it down to about \n$575 million. I think that is still a pretty good savings.\n  My point is, workers at these other nuclear sites, they will be less \nwilling to buy into these incentive contracts if they feel somehow or \nother the members cannot get health insurance and life insurance. We \nalready have limited this amendment. We limit it to health insurance.\n  How would you like to be a citizen out there shopping for health \ninsurance, being exposed to radiation to one degree or another for 15 \nyears? Insurance companies do not insure those kinds of risks. So it is \ntough. For life insurance, it is the same thing because the incidence \nof cancer and everything is well known. It is elevated whenever there \nis increased exposure to radiation, particularly in the amounts we are \ntalking about being handled out there in Rocky Flats. They do not care \nwhether it is a little amount of exposure or a lot of exposure. A \nlittle amount of exposure would not be a problem with a lot of them, \nbut it is the same concern that comes out of the insurance company; \nthey do not try to differentiate.\n  So we have workers out there, and we are just talking about their \nhealth insurance and life insurance. I think that it is a small price \nto pay to be fair to these workers.\n  My hope is we can continue to negotiate with the Department of \nEnergy. I hope we continue to negotiate with the staff and my good \nfriend from Alabama. Perhaps maybe we can tighten this down if we have \nto, but we have already tightened it down a lot. We have it listed to a \nvery specific group of employees from certain dates. We have tightened \nit down just to insurance and health benefits and nothing else. But we \nwill look and work with them to see if perhaps maybe we can find a \ndifferent way so we do not set a precedent. I am sensitive to that, \nthat we do not set an unfair precedent. But we have to be fair to the \nworkers, too.\n  I thank the Armed Services Committee and my good friend from Alabama. \nI know they have some real concerns. They have shown a willingness to \nwant to work with us, so I thank them for that gesture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, maybe there is \nsomething that can be worked out. I look forward to continuing \ndiscussions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.\n  Does the Senator from Colorado yield back?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2427\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for Mr. Levin, \n     for himself and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2427.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make available, with an offset, an additional $50,000,000 \n    for Operation and Maintenance for Cooperative Threat Reduction)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 330. ADDITIONAL AMOUNT FOR COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Increased Amount for Operation and Maintenance, \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs.--The amount authorized \n     to be appropriated by section 301(19) for the Cooperative \n     Threat Reduction programs is hereby increased by $50,000,000.\n       (b) Offset.--Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 201(4) for research, development, test, and \n     evaluation, Defense-wide activities, is hereby reduced by \n     $50,000,000, with the amount of the reduction to be allocated \n     as follows:\n       (1) The amount available in Program Element 0603882C for \n     long lead procurement of Ground-Based Interceptors is hereby \n     reduced by $30,000,000.\n       (2) The amount available for initial construction of \n     associated silos is hereby reduced by $20,000,000.\n\n\n[[Page S12390]]\n\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kerry, \nSenator Feingold, and Senator Lautenberg be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we have spent the last several days making \ndifficult decisions about national priorities with respect to spending. \nWe also have to continue to make these difficult decisions within the \ncontext of the Defense bill.\n  The amendment I propose today, along with Senator Levin and my \ncolleagues, would transfer $50 million from the Missile Defense Program \nto the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. I believe this amendment \nproperly reallocates scarce resources so we can deal with an immediate \nthreat. That immediate threat is the proliferation of nuclear materials \nand nuclear weapons.\n  When President Bush first took office in 2001, he made missile \ndefense one of his highest priorities. Since fiscal year 2002, \napproximately $45 billion has been spent on missile defense. In fact, \nthis represents a huge amount. If you look back to 1984, when President \nReagan began the search for a strategic defense initiative--we have \nspent, since President Bush took office, half again the amount of money \nthat was spent from 1984 to 2002. This has been a huge program.\n  It has been named as a priority by the President. In fact, the \nMissile Defense Agency, as a result, rushed to field a system--any \nsystem--in fact, a system that many claim--and it seems to be the \ncase--does not work very well.\n  So last year, six ground-based interceptors were placed in silos at \nFort Greely in Alaska. Two interceptors were placed in silos in \nVandenberg Air Force Base. In September 2004, President Bush declared \nthat this missile system was operational. A seventh interceptor was put \nin place at Fort Greely last month.\n  Now, one of the critical aspects of declaring a system operational, \nit seems to me, is successful testing. Unfortunately, this element--\nsuccessful testing--seems to be absent from the present ground-based \nsystem. In fact, it is highly questionable whether this is at all \noperational.\n  In missile defense, interceptor tests are critical, and they should \ninvolve a real missile intercepting a real target. These tests are the \nonly means to truly assess whether a missile defense system has a \nchance to work against an enemy missile.\n  The first intercept flight test of the system was conducted in \nDecember 2002, and it was a failure. Over the next 2 years, seven other \nplanned tests that were contemplated were canceled because of technical \nreasons. In December 2004, 3 months after the missile defense system \nwas declared operational--3 months after we supposedly had a working \nsystem--the Missile Defense Agency conducted only the second integrated \nflight test on this multibillion dollar system. It failed. On February \n14, 2005, there was another integrated flight test, and it, too, \nfailed.\n  After three consecutive failures, Lieutenant General Obering, the \nDirector of the Missile Defense Agency, established an Independent \nReview Team to examine test failures and recommend steps for improving \nthe test program. The team made some interesting observations. The \nteam's report stated:\n\n       With the focus on rapid deployment of the Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense system, there was not always adequate \n     opportunity to fully ground test the system prior to each \n     flight attempt.\n\n  The team also found:\n\n       Schedule has been the key challenge that drives daily \n     decision making in the program.\n\n  What you have here today has been a rush to failure, a succession of \nflight test failures, a premature declaration of operational \ncharacteristics of the system. No one will argue that the development, \nin a deliberate way and in a technically feasible way, of a missile \ndefense system is not a good thing for the country, but what has \nhappened over the last several years has been this rush to failure.\n  In addition to the evaluation team I previously mentioned, General \nObering requested RADM Kate Paige to direct a Mission Readiness Task \nForce to study the review team's recommendations and put the program on \na path to success.\n  This task force made the following recommendation:\n\n       There will be a significant increase in ground testing of \n     all systems, components and processes before resuming flight \n     testing. Contractors will be held accountable for their \n     performance. The first flight test will not be an intercept \n     test and the first intercept test will not take place for \n     more than a year.\n  I commend General Obering and the Missile Defense Agency for \nimplementing these recommendations, for realistically assessing their \ntechnical capacity, for realistically beginning to test on the ground \nbefore they fly, for doing the things that are both prudent and \nnecessary in this regard. The next interceptor flight test is not \nscheduled until a year from now, so we will not know until fiscal year \n2007 whether the problems that led to the past test failures have been \nfixed.\n  Let me evaluate where we are. We presently have nine interceptors in \nthe ground, but we do not know if they will work because we have not \nhad a fully successful flight test. In addition, the administration has \nrequested and Congress has provided most of the money for 30 more \ninterceptors. So we have nine in the ground which we have not \nadequately tested, and we have also, through the President's request \nand the majority's concurrence, purchased 30 more of these \ninterceptors. Yet in the President's fiscal year 2006 budget request, \nhe requested long lead funding for an additional 10 operational \ninterceptors. These are in addition to 30 interceptors we are already \nbuying on top of the 9 we have in the ground, all of which have not \nbeen adequately tested.\n  Furthermore, it must be noted there is also the issue of production \nrate capacity. Production rate capacity for the interceptor is 1 per \nmonth, or 12 per year. That means the Defense Department is seeking \nfunding for more missiles than can be built in 1 year.\n  As we all know, this is an annual authorization process. There is no \nneed to pay for more interceptors than can be built in 1 year, \nespecially when there is no guarantee that any of them will work in \noperational circumstances.\n  At this point the responsible thing to do is to slow down funding and \nreallocate the money to a more pressing threat. That is what this \namendment does. This amendment takes $30 million from the long lead \nprocurement for more interceptors and $20 million for funding for \ninitial construction of silos to house these interceptors and increases \nfunding for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program by $50 million. As \nwe all know, the goal of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program is to \neliminate the threat of unsecured nuclear material from falling into \nthe wrong hands.\n  A 2001 task force, chaired by former Senator Howard Baker and former \nWhite House Counsel Lloyd Cutler, studied nonproliferation programs for \nalmost a year and concluded:\n\n       The most urgent unmet national security threat to the U.S. \n     today is the danger that weapons of mass destruction or \n     weapons-usable material in Russia could be stolen and sold to \n     terrorists or hostile nation states and used against American \n     troops abroad or citizens at home.\n\n  That was before September 11. Certainly since September 11, this \nwarning is much more ominous and should be much more closely followed.\n  It is estimated that Russia has approximately 16,000 nuclear weapons \nstored at 150 to 210 sites. Only about 25 percent of these sites have \nreceived any upgrades for security in the past 5 years. At the rate \nplanned in the fiscal year 2006 budget request, it would be around 2011 \nor 2012 before work at only a portion of the sites would be completed \nto bring them up to the levels of security and safety that we would \nfeel confident this nuclear material would not be stolen, misplaced, or \nsomehow diverted into the wrong hands.\n  Because of the agreement between President Putin and President Bush \nat the February summit in Bratislava, we have a unique opportunity to \nimprove security at an additional 15 sites. The problem, of course, is \nfunding. The cost of securing these 15 sites is $350 million, funding \nthat is not in this budget. This project deserves top priority. This \namendment provides some funding--not complete funding--$50 million \ntoward securing nuclear material.\n  As I have said before, I support the concept and, deployment of a \nsystem\n\n[[Page S12391]]\n\nthat has been tested and truly works for national missile defense. I \nthink it is a system we should pursue. But I also believe the Missile \nDefense Agency is more than adequately funded for its fiscal year 2006 \nmission, and some money can and should be diverted to more pressing \nneeds without harming this missile defense program.\n  This amendment does not affect the funding or deployment of the first \n30 ground-based interceptors. They will continue to be built and \ndeployed. Again, this is all in a situation in which we haven't had a \ntruly effective, complete flight test of even the first missiles we \nhave acquired.\n  This amendment does not touch $53 million included in the bill for \nlong lead funding for eight test missiles. It is essential to produce \nthese missiles for testing.\n  This amendment simply takes into account that only 12 interceptors \ncan be produced in a year so the funding for the 6 that cannot be used \nshould be reallocated to the dire threat of nuclear proliferation so \nthat no one, no terrorist, can obtain nuclear material or a nuclear \ndevice because we have been negligent in securing those materials along \nwith other countries, and use those weapons against our soldiers in the \nfield or citizens here at home.\n  We have an obligation. The most existential threat that faces this \ncountry is a terrorist, nonstate actor obtaining a nuclear device, \nsurreptitiously moving into the United States or some other area of \nvital interest to the United States, and detonating that device. The \nmore we do to resist and thwart that threat, the more we are responding \nto the true threats that confront this country.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will speak in opposition to this \namendment, but to accommodate a colleague who has remained on the \nfloor, I yield such time as the distinguished Senator from Colorado, a \nformer member of our committee, former expert on our committee on this \nsubject, needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I miss the leadership on the committee and \nthe committee. I like to stay involved in many of the issues the \ncommittee is still working on because of the importance of the many \nmilitary installations in my own State and because it is good for the \ncountry.\n  I have some problems with the amendment proposed by Senators Levin \nand Reed. The first is it is reducing a program that has already been \nreduced at $1 billion by the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2006 \nand over a longer period of time, from 2006 to 2007, for a total of up \nto $5 billion in this very vital program for our Nation's security.\n  The other concern I have is, the money they are taking here is going \nto another program that hasn't spent all the money we gave it last \nfiscal year. I don't see a need, when they haven't spent all their \nmoney in the previous year.\n  I talk about the program itself because I think sometimes this \namendment brings up where we are going in missile defense and some of \nthe questions there. I understand the amendment eliminates $30 million \nfor long lead funding for ground-based interceptor missile defense and \nthen $20 million for associated silo construction. Currently, we have \nnine ground based-interceptors emplaced to protect the United States \nagainst a long-term limited ballistic missile attack. The $50 million \nis supposed to be transferred to what we call the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program, which is fully funded in the bill we have before us \nand is $7 million more than we had last year. My understanding is the \nsame program last year had $107 million in unobligated funds remaining \nafter the 2005 fiscal year. So an additional $1.6 billion is funded for \nDOE nonproliferation programs in addition to this. I think we have put \nplenty of money in that area.\n  We do have a need in missile defense, and we should not back away \nfrom our plan or obligation to develop missile defense because of \nthreats that we potentially could have from countries such as North \nKorea and Iran, for example. This amendment unnecessarily delays by 1 \nyear the fielding of the ground-based interceptors scheduled for 2009. \nWe simply cannot afford to delay it any more because we do have real \nand imminent dangers as based on the testimony from General Cartwright, \nCommander of the U.S. Strategic Command. I do believe North Korea is a \nthreat. We have already had testimony a number of years back from the \nDirector of Intelligence that missiles launched out of Korea have the \ncapability of reaching our west coast. Now North Korea is ready to \nflight test another ICBM that many of us feel--and we have been \ninformed--will reach the United States. Iran may have such a capability \nin 2015, according to the DIA. So we are facing a real threat.\n  We have already acted on this issue in the Defense appropriations \nbill. The long lead funding for ground-based interceptors 31 through 40 \nwas included in this year's fiscal year 2006 Defense appropriations \nbill. And in the report language, the bill added $200 million to the \nbudget request ``to maintain the production schedule for ground-based \ninterceptors.''\n  With this amendment, we are backing off of that commitment we put in \nthe appropriations bill. I don't think we should run counter to the \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for bringing that \npoint up. He is on that committee.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, you were participating at the time this took \nplace.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. And were the Senate to accede to the Reed amendment, it \nwould, in effect, be overruling or reversing what the Appropriations \nCommittee, through the conference report, will presumably bring before \nthe Senate in a matter of days.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is right. We would be reversing the Senate action on \nthat. I appreciate the chairman emphasizing that point.\n  I do think it is important that we move ahead. Myself and two other \nmembers on the Armed Services Committee made a special trip out to the \nsouthern part of the test bed. We went to where they were launching the \ntarget missile. We have had a few failures, but you learn from \nfailures. Our testing is not intended to be 100 percent successful. It \nis spiral development. We are pushing the system to its limits. \nOccasionally you learn from failures. We have had four successful \nprototype launches, and of the operationally configured booster we now \nhave, we have had three successful flights. One of the problems we have \nin some of these tests is the target we were supposed to be launching \nwasn't launching. So we made a special trip to look at what was \nhappening with missile defense in the southern part of the test bed.\n  I have to tell you, it is very impressive. There are three aspects to \nit. There is short range, midrange and long range. The role of the \nnaval forces in this program is very impressive. Ground forces are \ncoming along. Now we are working on some of the longer range missiles \nthrough the Air Force. I was impressed.\n  The target missile, unfortunately, the first time it didn't launch \nwas because of a computer glitch. That has been corrected. The second \none was because you had the wrong part in the wrong place and the arms, \nwhen they were supposed to retract for the missile, didn't come back \nall the way so the missile didn't launch. This was human error, things \nthat were errors that should not have happened. They have been \ncorrected. It didn't have to do with new technology. It is things we \nhave had. We have been launching for years missiles out of silos, and \nthis was the wrong part in the wrong place at the wrong time so launch \ndid not occur.\n  We have run into these kind of things. Hopefully, they don't happen \nagain. Fundamentally, the technology is there. We need to rely on it. \nThe threat is there, and we need to be prepared for it.\n  I rise in opposition to the Levin-Reed amendment and thank Chairman \nWarner for giving me an opportunity to make a few comments in this \nregard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank our former member, the Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  Would the Chair kindly advise the managers as to the time remaining \non both sides for this amendment?\n\n[[Page S12392]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 22 minutes remaining in opposition \nand 20 minutes in favor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I would like to grant time to \nour distinguished colleague from Alabama, a member of the Armed \nServices Committee, bearing in mind it is the desire of the manager to \nleave time for Monday. There are other colleagues on our side who wish \nto speak in opposition. We are pleased he will take the time to join \nus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nnotified at 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment that would \neliminate $50 million in long lead funding for missiles 31 to 40 of the \nground-based interceptor, a key component of the missile defense system \nprotecting the United States against limited long-range ballistic \nmissile attack. Senators Levin and Reed have argued these funds would \nbe better spent on the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program, but it is already fully funded at $415 million.\n  I don't believe they have spent all of their previous appropriations, \nand we are being asked to make a choice between these two issues.\n  In addition to authorizing the requested $415 million for the \nDepartment of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, the bill \nprovides $1.6 billion for the Department of Energy nonproliferation \nprograms. We have a lot of money being spent in these issues. These \naccounts are fully funded. They were not reduced. They do not need \nadditional funding, especially not by taking money from our ballistic \nmissile defense system.\n  While CTR is fully funded, it is important, please, to note that the \nDepartment of Defense, in its last-minute preparations of the 2006 \nbudget, bit the bullet. They had some tough decisions to make, and they \nmade a decision that I regretted but one I guess I would acknowledge \nand yield to, to make significant cuts in our missile defense program.\n  This year's request represents a $1 billion reduction, while the \nMissile Defense Agency has programmed a $5 billion overall reduction in \nyears 2006 through 2011. So the Department of Defense did not reduce \nthe Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and fully funded it, but they \ndid make cuts in missile defense of a significant amount.\n  The $50 million identified as an offset for this amendment \nspecifically targets the long-lead funding for ground-based interceptor \nmissiles 31 through 40 and associated silo construction. These missiles \nare scheduled for manufacture in 2007, in the 2007 timeframe, for \ndeployment in 2009 and 2010 to actually be deployed. Eliminating these \nfunds would delay fielding this important defensive capability even \nwhile our intelligence and military officials tell us there is a near-\nterm threat. Additionally, the amendment would cause a break in the GBI \nground-based interceptor production line that would cost some $270 \nmillion to restart, according to General Obering.\n  I want to make that clear. This is the problem we are dealing with. \nWe have cut that budget significantly. We have tightened up the missile \ndefense budget. We have reduced it $1 billion a year, $5 billion in 5 \nyears, but if we cut it any more, as this amendment suggests, we will \nbreak the production line that is ongoing today because if a \nmanufacturer can't keep his employees producing at least a minimum \nnumber of missiles, then the assembly line breaks, and under the \ncontracts and other ramifications, General Obering has estimated that \nit would cost some $270 million to restart that line.\n  The sponsors of this amendment argue that these missiles have not \nbeen sufficiently proven through operational testing, and they point to \nrecent test difficulties as evidence that further procurement of GBIs \nis unwise at this time.\n  While I believe the GMD system requires additional testing--we are \ngoing to have additional testing, we must have additional testing--I \nwould argue that the Missile Defense Agency has conducted sufficient \nground and flight intercept testing over the past 5 years to provide \nthe confidence necessary to acquire the basic ground-based interceptors \non the current schedule.\n  I would point out that in fiscal year 2004, the annual report to \nCongress by the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation notes that \n``the test bed architecture is now in place and should have some \nlimited capability to defend against a threat missile from North \nKorea.''\n  The independent review team, established by the Missile Defense \nAgency to investigate the test problems, found that recent test \nproblems are attributable to quality control factors rather than the \nbasic technology necessary to hit a missile with a missile. In fact, it \nhas been proven. For example, between 2001 and 2002, MDA conducted four \nout of five successful intercept tests using a GBI prototype, while in \n2003 and 2004, MDA conducted three successful test flights with the GBI \nbooster.\n  According to the director of MDA, it is unlikely we will discover \nsomething in our testing in the next year or 2 that would require any \nmajor redesign of the system.\n  With respect to the threat that we face, General Cartwright, the \ncommander of the U.S. Strategic Command, has testified before the Armed \nServices Committee that ``we have a realistic threat. We have an \nimperative.''\n  The Director of Central Intelligence has testified that the North \nKorean Taepo Dong 2 missile is capable of reaching the United States \nwith a nuclear warhead and that North Korea could resume flight testing \nat any time.\n  The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency confirmed this \nassessment as recently as April 28 in a hearing before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, and he has testified separately that Iran will have \nthe capability to develop an intercontinental missile by 2015.\n  In closing, I ask for your support for the continuing production of \nthe GBIs through missile No. 40 by defeating this amendment. The GBI \nproduction line has been stretched to the limit by slowing production \nto some 8 to 10 missiles a year, the result of Congressional actions \nlast year. Moreover, General Obering recently announced plans to divert \nanother four operational GBIs. Denying additional funding for \nadditional missiles will break the assembly line.\n  Mr. President, I would oppose this amendment. I respect my colleagues \nbut feel that we should not break the assembly line at the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, speaking on my time under my control on \nthis amendment, I wish to express my opposition to this Levin-Reid \namendment would transfer $50 million from the Ground-based Midcourse \nDefense, GMD, program to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. The \nimpact of this amendment would be, first and foremost, to delay the \nfielding of ballistic missile defense capabilities to protect the U.S. \nhomeland against the threat posed by long-range ballistic missiles; and \nsecondly, to cause a break in the production of ground-based \ninterceptors, GBIs--a production break that would cost the government \n$270 million to restart.\n\n  While I agree with the sponsors of this amendment that the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program is an important national security \ninitiative, the defense of our homeland against the growing threat of \nlong-range ballistic missiles is equally, if not more, important.\n  Asking us to choose between missile defense protection and CTR is a \nfalse choice: we need to do both. And, in fact, this bill fully funds \nthe President's requested amount for both programs.\n  The bill before the Senate authorizes the requested amount of $415.5 \nmillion for CTR programs within the Department of Defense, and $1.6 \nbillion for other non-proliferation efforts in the Department of \nEnergy. There is no current need for extra CTR funds; in fact, the CTR \nprogram has an unobligated balance of some $100 million. With a backlog \nin spending, it is hard to understand why the proponents of this \namendment think that more money is needed at this time for the CTR \nprogram.\n  The President's budget for missile defense, on the other hand, has \nalready\n\n[[Page S12393]]\n\ntaken its share of cuts. Due to last minute decisions made at the \nPentagon as the fiscal year 2006 budget was being finalized, the \nmissile defense budget request was reduced by $1 billion in fiscal year \n2006, and $5 billion overall between fiscal year 2006 and 2011.\n  Sponsors of this amendment argue that we should not provide long-lead \nfunding for GBI missiles 31-40 because of recent test failures. I am \nmindful of the recent difficulties encountered by the GMD system test \nprogram, but in my view--and that of independent test authorities--\nthese difficulties do not represent serious technological hurdles for \nthe GMD program. Indeed, such problems are to be expected during the \nresearch and development phase of complicated weapon systems.\n  To get at the root cause of these testing problems, the Director of \nthe Missile Defense Agency, to his great credit, commissioned an \nindependent review team, IRT, to examine these recent GMD test \nfailures. The IRT found no fundamental GMD system design flaws related \nto the recent test failures. Moreover, the IRT found no evidence that \nmajor modifications of the current system hardware or software will be \nrequired. In other words, it is unlikely that future testing will find \nsome major fault in the system that will require a costly retrofit to \nfielded GBIs.\n  For those of my colleagues concerned about testing, I point out that \nthis bill before you contains a provision--developed in a bipartisan \nfashion during the committee's markup--which requires the Missile \nDefense Agency, the service operational test agencies, and the Director \nof Operational Test and Evaluation to plan and conduct tests that \ndemonstrate the operational capability of the ballistic missile defense \nsystem. The bill also reallocates $100 million from longer term \ndevelopment efforts to GMD testing, consistent with the recommendations \nof the independent review team.\n  The current and growing threat posed to our country by long-range \nballistic missiles argues for proceeding without delay with the \nDepartment's approach of concurrent testing and fielding of ballistic \nmissile defense capabilities for the homeland.\n  Some of my colleagues suggest that because the current system is not \nfully proven, we should not procure additional missile interceptors. To \nthis I would respond that General Cartwright, Commander of U.S. \nStrategic Command--the senior military official charged with advising \nthe Secretary of Defense and the President on missile defense matters--\nhas testified, with respect to the current GMD system, that ``in an \nemergency, we are in fact in the position that we are confident that we \ncan operate and employ it.''\n  In addition, the Pentagon's chief independent weapons tester, the \nDirector for Operational Test and Evaluation, noted in his most recent \nAnnual Report to Congress that ``the test bed architecture is now in \nplace and should have some limited capability to defend against a \nthreat missile from North Korea.''\n  In my view, it is a good thing that we have some capability--albeit \nlimited--to defend the homeland against long range missiles. For as \nGeneral Cartwright testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nin April, ``we have a realistic threat here; we have an imperative.''\n  General Cartwright is referring to CIA and DIA estimates that the \nNorth Korean Taepo-Dong 2 ballistic missile is capable of reaching the \nUnited States with a nuclear warhead--and that North Korea could resume \nflight testing of the Taepo-Dong 2 at any time. The Defense \nIntelligence Agency also estimates that Iran will have the capability \nto develop intercontinental ballistic missile, IBCM, by 2015.\n  We simply can't wait until the threat is upon us to deploy missile \ndefenses; we can't wait until the GMD system is fully and completely \ntested before we start providing some measure of protection against \nthis threat. It is our responsibility to field what capabilities \ncurrently exist, even while we continue to test and improve the system. \nBy continuing to field missile defenses today, we send a message to \npotential adversaries that we will not be deterred or coerced by their \npossession of long-range ballistic missiles.\n  In summary, I ask my colleagues to reject the amendment offered by \nSenator Levin. This amendment would needlessly delay the fielding of a \nballistic missile defense capability to protect the homeland. As the \nCommander of STRATCOM warns, the threat is real. We must continue on \nthe current path of fielding available capabilities--even while testing \ncontinues to improve the system over time.\n  Mr. President, at this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2430\n\n(Purpose: To establish a national commission on policies and practices \n        on the treatment of detainees since September 11, 2001)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my dear friend from Virginia \nfor his invariable courtesies. We have brought a bill to the floor, \nfinally, which I will have much more to say on Monday, but at this time \nI simply would call up an amendment that is at the desk. I think it is \nNo. 2430.\n  I would make inquiry of the Chair as to whether I need to lay aside \nany pending amendments in order to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does need to lay aside pending \namendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In that case, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment and to call up amendment 2430.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2430.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I introduce this amendment on behalf of \nSenators Reed of Rhode Island, Kennedy, Rockefeller, Bingaman, Boxer, \nand Durbin, and I ask unanimous consent that they be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment would establish an independent commission on \nthe treatment of detainees in Afghanistan, Iraq, Guantanamo, and \nelsewhere. This would be modeled after the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, \nwhich was an independent commission that we all recognize as being an \nextremely successful commission. This bipartisan independent commission \nwould examine U.S. policies and practices related to the treatment of \ndetainees, including their detention, interrogation, and rendition. It \nwould also examine the causes of detainee abuses and assess the \nresponsibility of military and civilian leaders within and outside the \nDepartment of Defense for policies, actions, and failures to act which \nmay have contributed to such abuse. It would also evaluate the \neffectiveness and propriety of interrogation techniques and practices \nfor producing intelligence. The independent commission would report on \nits findings and recommendations to the President and to the Congress.\n  Mr. President, our troops serve honorably, they serve courageously \nacross the globe. Their honor is besmirched when some of those who we \ncapture are abused. And on top of that our troops' security is \njeopardized when people that we detain are not treated as we rightfully \ninsist others treat our troops when they are captured.\n  The amendment that we are proposing today will help reaffirm the \nvalues that we cherish as Americans, will help to reestablish our \ncredibility around the world, and will help to protect our troops \nshould they be captured.\n  When Secretary Rumsfeld appeared before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on May 7, 2004, shortly after the horrific pictures of Abu \nGhraib appeared in the media, he asked the world to ``judge us by our \nactions.'' Those were his words. And he went on to say, telling \neverybody, ``watch how a democracy deals with wrongdoing and with \nscandal and the pain of acknowledging and correcting our own mistakes \nand our own weaknesses.'' Secretary Rumsfeld asked all who were \nwatching and within the sound of his voice to ask those who would \nspread hatred of America if ``the willingness of Americas to \nacknowledge their own failures before humanity doesn't like the world \nas surely as the great ideas and beliefs that make this nation a beacon \nof hope and liberty for all who strive to be free.''\n\n[[Page S12394]]\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld's words were direct and they were right. It is \nimportant to our efforts to defeat terrorism that the United States \ninvestigate itself openly and thoroughly. That is the standard by which \nwe and our causes will be judged and should be judged.\n  In nearly 2 years since Specialist Darby courageously came forward to \nreport the abuses at Abu Ghraib, the Defense Department has had every \nopportunity to investigate itself. But the results have fallen far \nshort of the standard that Secretary Rumsfeld set up. Some seek to \ndownplay the significance of these detainee abuses, arguing at the \nstart that they were the result of aberrant behavior of a few rogue \nreserve Military Police on the night shift at Abu Ghraib, but with each \nsuccessive of Department of Defense report it has become increasingly \nclear that the claim that these were the isolated acts of a few rogue \nreserve MPs does not explain the causes and the factors contributing to \ndetainee abuse, and it does not explain the scope of those abuses.\n  There have been a number of Department of Defense reviews--8, 10, 12, \npick a number. Every one of them has failed to provide a comprehensive \npicture of the extent and the causes of detainee abuses, and put \ntogether, they don't come close to a comprehensive picture of the \nextent and causes of detainee abuses.\n  Every one of those reviews and investigations of detainee abuse has \nbeen carefully circumscribed, leaving significant gaps and omissions.\n  I want to go through some of the gaps and omissions of these \ninvestigations because we are going to hear on the floor that there \nhave been 10, there have been 12 reviews--whatever the number; you can \ncount them different ways--but when you put them all together, there \nare massive gaps. That cannot be allowed to remain.\n  First, we don't know the role of the CIA and other parts of the \nintelligence community in the mistreatment of detainees or what \npolicies apply to those intelligence personnel. Witness after witness \nwho was in charge of these reviews has told us they had no jurisdiction \nto look into the intelligence community's mistreatment of detainees or \nwhat their role is. They all disclaim the capability, the competence, \nor the authority to look into the role of the intelligence community, \nwhich we know from public statement after public statement of people \nwho have been found guilty and not found guilty, people who were \npictured in these pictures at Abu Ghraib, that the intelligence \npersonnel told them to soften up detainees. Yet gap No. 1, the policies \nof intelligence communities, their activities, their involvement, has \nnot been reviewed.\n  Second, we don't know what the policies and practices are of the \nUnited States regarding the rendition of detainees to other countries, \nwhere they may be interrogated using techniques that would not be \npermitted at U.S. detention facilities.\n  Third, there is insufficient information, almost total lack, on the \nrole of contractors in U.S. detention and intelligence operations. We \nare using contractors to interrogate detainees. What is their role? \nThere is total silence, a total gap on their role, with all these \nreports we have.\n  Fourth, the detention and interrogation of detainees by special \noperation forces, that needs close examination.\n  Fifth, and this is one of the largest gaps of all, all of the \nunanswered questions regarding the legality under U.S. and \ninternational law of the interrogation techniques used by Department of \nDefense personnel, regardless of whether they were authorized or not \nauthorized by a higher authority. We have sought for a year or more the \ntwo key documents that set forth the standards to be used in \ninterrogation that were approved by the Department of Justice. We \ncannot get the Office of Legal Counsel documents.\n  These issues are not going to go away. They can't be swept under the \nrug. With each passing day, we have new revelations of detainee abuses. \nCourageous and honorable soldiers, such as Captain Fishback, come \nforward--just a few weeks ago now--with new allegations of mistreatment \nof prisoners, of confusion over what policies applied, and commanders \nwho appear to have condoned this behavior. He was there. He is speaking \nout publicly.\n  There is not a week that goes by that there is not a revelation. We \nhave to get an independent investigation going so that we can refer \nallegations to an independent commission, to put it in the hands of a \nbipartisan group.\n  These revelations only serve to further undermine our international \nstanding and put our troops at risk of being treated similarly should \nthey be captured. That is why a group of retired generals and admirals \nwrote to the President in September 2004 calling for an independent \ncommission to investigate the treatment of detainees.\n  So we have a significant group of retired military leaders saying we \nmust have an independent commission. That is why the American Bar \nAssociation has endorsed an independent commission.\n  The administration, I know, opposes this, just the way they have \nopposed Senator McCain's amendment and Senator Graham's amendment that \nwill get us into the future as to what future standards there are. The \nadministration doesn't want to look at the history. They are wrong. Let \nthe chips fall where they may, wherever that may be. It will benefit \neverybody.\n  Most importantly, it will benefit the men and women who wear the \nuniform of the United States. They are entitled to have their honor. \nThey deserve their honor. They deserve an independent commission which \nwill look at how this happened and prove to the world this is not us. \nWhatever it is, whatever the policies were, whatever the practices \nwere, we are willing to look them straight in the face and say: We are \ngoing to correct that. We are not going to hide it. We are not going to \nrun away from it. We are not going to sweep it under the rug. We are \ngoing to look it square in the face. We are going to fill the gaps.\n  Those gaps are huge. No matter how often it is stated that we have \nhad 8 or 10 reviews, it does not fill the gaps because of the limits \nplaced on those reviews and the gaps that were left.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield a few \nminutes to me before he departs the floor?\n  There are evolving aspects with regard to the underlying goal of this \namendment, as he and I speak, on information which is circulating which \ngoes to how the administration dealt with these issues.\n  I am going to reserve until Monday exactly the approach the Senator \nfrom Virginia is going to take. I wish to consult with a number of my \ncolleagues in that connection. But I wish to point out two things.\n  The Senator from Michigan said we should face--speaking, of course, \nto the committee but also the United States and colleagues in the \nSenate--this issue square on. I know my distinguished friend and \ncolleague of so many years would say, by virtue of him and me being the \ntwo principal cosponsors of the McCain amendment, that we are within \nthe rights of this committee facing certain aspects of this issue head \non as it relates to the future conduct of this country.\n  I also hope at some point in our debate that we can address the very \nvaluable contribution that two individuals, together with the staff and \na third member of the commission--namely, former Secretary of Defense \nSchlesinger and former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown. Each of those \nextraordinary men--and I have been privileged to know and work with \neach of them quite closely through the years. Actually, I served under \nthree Secretaries of Defense when I was in the Navy Department as \nSecretary, and one of them, the last, was Secretary Schlesinger. He \nremains to this day one of my closest confidantes and advisers on a \nwide range of issues.\n  Harold Brown, my colleague, the Senator from Michigan, will recall, I \nsponsored--and I think the Senator from Michigan joined me when I was \non the Intelligence Committee in an overall review of our intelligence. \nThe first chairman of that commission was a distinguished former Member \nof Congress, Les Aspin, and then, following his untimely death, Harold \nBrown. I\n\n[[Page S12395]]\n\nwas the one who recommended he take over the work on that commission, \non which I was privileged to serve as a member.\n  A lot of things have been done to address the issue, which is the \ngoal of this amendment. Again, I am going to reserve until Monday just \nhow I am going to further approach this issue, but I wanted to bring \nthose two points up should the Senator from Michigan wish to comment on \neither.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do appreciate that, and I will take 1 \nminute to respond.\n  The chairman very properly points out that there was a Schlesinger \npanel. That panel said the following relative to the lack of \ncooperation from the CIA with the panel, which is gap No. 1 I have \nlisted as one of the reasons we need an independent commission. The \nSchlesinger panel said the following:\n\n       The panel did not have full access to information involving \n     the role of the Central Intelligence Agency in detention \n     operations. This is an area the panel believes needs further \n     investigation and review.\n\n  I agree they did good work, but they were limited in what they were \nallowed to do, and they themselves recommended further investigation \nand review.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. The order has it that the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island will now continue his contribution to the Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Levin amendment, \nwhich establishes a commission to look into the treatment of detainees \nby our national security forces.\n  Let me say as an initial point, I am a strong supporter of the \nMcCain-Graham amendment which would clarify the law. But the issues we \nare confronting today with respect to Abu Ghraib and with respect to \nother notorious incidents is not simply a failure of law, a failure of \nlacking legal precedent; it is a failure of leadership and a failure of \ninstitutions. Unless we look carefully, objectively, and independently \nat this leadership and these institutions, we will be bound to repeat \nthe mistakes of the past several years. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Levin amendment.\n  What prompts me to support this amendment is the belief and \nunderstanding that the treatment of our soldiers on the battlefield is \na function of how we treat our opponents. If we do not have high \nstandards of treatment, then we cannot make the moral claim that our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines should be similarly treated.\n  I understand the nature of our adversaries might reject those claims, \nmight reject standards, but if we reject those standards, then our \nability to protect our soldiers is diminished substantially.\n  I think also one just has to take note of the events of the last \nseveral years and understand that not only is there a legal and moral \npremise to our use of suitable standards of conduct, there is a very \npractical one. The incidents of Abu Ghraib, the reports of abuse of \nprisoners, have been a disastrous situation with respect to our \nprogress in the Middle East. It is harming our efforts to convince \npeople that we are there not to exploit them, not to abuse them, but to \ntry to lift them up.\n  It is essential we get to the heart of these failures of leadership, \ninstitutional direction, and policy. I think it is also essential that \nwe have accountability. One of the essential aspects of any military \norganization is accountability. Everyone who enters the military, \nparticularly an officer, learns that the first rule is they are \nresponsible for what happens and what fails to happen on their command. \nThere has been a dearth of accountability when it comes to these issues \nof abuse of detainees.\n  The plan seemed to be from the very beginning to portray this as the \nfault of aberrant soldiers. In fact, if we look at those people who \nhave been prosecuted, those people who have been brought to justice, it \nis a handful of enlisted soldiers. We know this process, this approach, \nwas not simply the result of a few soldiers. It was the result of \ndecisions that were made at the very highest level.\n  Today, in the International Herald Tribune, COL Larry Wilkerson, a \nformer chief of staff to Colin Powell, pointed out that, in his words: \nThere was a visible audit trail from the Vice President's office to the \nSecretary of Defense down to the commanders in the field authorizing \npractices that led to the abuse of detainees.\n  That suggests to me that the evidence has accumulated where we need \nto take a good look not just at individual soldiers, not just \ncompartmental reviews of certain aspects, we have to take the approach \nthat Senator Levin suggests, a comprehensive review by an independent \npanel on the model of the 9/11 Commission to look at how we came to \nthis point; not just to establish accountability I think that is \nprincipal and important but to ensure that we do not do it again, to \nensure that when we enter into a conflict everyone understands the law, \neveryone follows the law. That is to the benefit not only of the \nprotection of our troops but also to claiming the moral high ground, \naiding our mission, aiding our military forces in the field, by \ncreating an image in the world that we are bound to the highest \nstandards and we are not there for self-interest but to help other \npeople.\n  If we fail to pursue this commission, we will see a situation where \nwhat has happened in the past will happen again. It will be replicated \ntime and time again. It will create a terrible situation within our \nmilitary forces. It will appear, as it appears now, that the only \npeople who are punished for these abuses are low-ranking, enlisted \npersonnel. They bear the brunt, but the officers who directed it, the \nofficers who could have stopped it, the civilian leaders in our \nGovernment who might have directed it or encouraged it, will walk away. \nThat is unfair and that is so corrosive that it will undermine our \nmilitary forces in the future.\n  I urge passage of the Levin amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of time on our side and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment is one of great importance \nand has far-reaching consequences. As I said, as we speak, there are \nsome facts coming into the public domain. I have no idea of evaluating \ntheir authenticity, but it does, in my judgment, bear on this issue. \nTherefore, speaking for myself, we will have further statements \nregarding this amendment Monday and quite likely Tuesday before we \nvote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2432\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have an amendment to be considered. I \nconsider it to be perhaps one of the most important amendments. It is \nreferred to as the train and equip amendment.\n  What I am not going to do is take a lot of time today talking about \nit because in the event there is opposition to it, I want an \nopportunity to respond to that opposition.\n  Primarily, this is what our amendment would do: Under sections 1201 \nand 1204 of Title XII, it would allow the military to train and equip \nsome of these countries where we see an opportunity to be using their \nresources and their militia as opposed to sending our troops there. \nRight now, in order to get it done, the process is one has to go \nthrough the State Department and then the Department of Defense. A good \nexample is when the U.S. Government wanted to train and equip some of \nthe Georgia forces for counterterrorism. Seven different authorities \nfor funding and sources had to be stitched together to make this \neffort. It took 8 months. By the time 8 months goes by, the problem is \nno longer the same problem it was 8 months before.\n  What we would do is take existing O moneys, $750 million, that we \nwould be able to use to train and equip in a streamlined way of doing \nthis.\n  I will share some personal experiences and then I will yield the \nfloor. We have been talking about the five African brigades, that we \nwould be training and equipping various countries in regional areas in \nAfrica to take care of some of the problems. I am sure\n\n[[Page S12396]]\n\nI am not the only one who has been in Djibouti and worked with our \nmarines there. I have been very much concerned that they are not able \nto do as good a job and as fast a job at training some of the African \nforces as they could otherwise.\n  I have talked to President Museveni of Uganda. There are problems in \nthe northern part of Uganda where they have adequate troops, but they \nare not trained and equipped to protect themselves against the global \nwar on terrorism and would be dependent upon our troops if that should \nhappen. It is far better for us to be able to train them than it is for \nthem to have to be in a situation where they are going in untrained.\n  I say to my chairman, I visited with my counterpart in Angola. He is \nthe second ranking member on the armed services committee there, \nalthough it is called something different. His name is Paiza. As we all \nknow, in Angola they have been undergoing a civil war and there are \nendless numbers of troops. They have been bush troops. They have not \nbeen trained to do the kind of defense that would be necessary in our \nglobal war on terrorism. Consequently, what they say they need--they \nhave the Unita forces, they have their forces on both sides of the \ncivil war. They need to have an opportunity to train these people.\n  I also spoke with the President of Burundi 2 weeks ago when I was \nthere. They had the fighting, as we all know, for a long period of time \nbetween the Hutus and the Tutsis, but they are now united. What they \nneed, though, is to be able to be trained. I know that General Jones \nand others, and certainly Secretary Rumsfeld, feel very strongly that \nwe need to have a streamlined process where we can go in and train \nthese guys to do the job that otherwise American troops are going to \nhave to do.\n  That is essentially what this is all about. I will wait until Monday \nto give a little more complete description of it.\n  At this time I would like to officially call up the amendment, No. \n2432. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and \ncall up amendment No. 2432 for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2432.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: Relating to the partnership security capacity of foreign \nmilitary and security forces and security and stabilization assistance)\n\n       At the end of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. BUILDING THE PARTNERSHIP SECURITY CAPACITY OF \n                   FOREIGN MILITARY AND SECURITY FORCES.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The President may authorize building the \n     capacity of partner nations' military or security forces to \n     disrupt or destroy terrorist networks, close safe havens, or \n     participate in or support United States, coalition, or \n     international military or stability operations.\n       (b) Types of Partnership Security Capacity Building.--The \n     partnership security capacity building authorized under \n     subsection (a) may include the provision of equipment, \n     supplies, services, training, and funding.\n       (c) Availability of Funds.--The Secretary of Defense may, \n     at the request of the Secretary of State, support partnership \n     security capacity building as authorized under subsection (a) \n     including by transferring funds available to the Department \n     of Defense to the Department of State, or to any other \n     Federal agency. Any funds so transferred shall remain \n     available until expended. The amount of such partnership \n     security capacity building provided by the Department of \n     Defense under this section may not exceed $750,000,000 in any \n     fiscal year.\n       (d) Congressional Notification.--Before building \n     partnership security capacity under this section, the \n     Secretaries of State and Defense shall submit to their \n     congressional oversight committees a notification of the \n     nations designated by the President with which partnership \n     security capacity will be built under this section and the \n     nature and amounts of security capacity building to occur. \n     Any such notification shall be submitted not less than 7 days \n     before the provision of such partnership security capacity \n     building.\n       (e) Complementary Authority.--The authority to build \n     partnership security capacity under this section is in \n     addition to any other authority of the Department of Defense \n     to provide assistance to a foreign country.\n       (f) Military and Security Forces Defined.--In this section, \n     the term ``military and security forces'' includes armies, \n     guard, border security, civil defense, infrastructure \n     protection, and police forces.\n\n     SEC. __. SECURITY AND STABILIZATION ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, upon a request from the Secretary of State and upon a \n     determination by the Secretary of Defense that an unforeseen \n     emergency exists that requires immediate reconstruction, \n     security, or stabilization assistance to a foreign country \n     for the purpose of restoring or maintaining peace and \n     security in that country, and that the provision of such \n     assistance is in the national security interests of the \n     United States, the Secretary of Defense may authorize the use \n     or transfer of defense articles, services, training or other \n     support, including support acquired by contract or otherwise, \n     to provide such assistance.\n       (b) Availability of Funds.--Subject to subsection (a), the \n     Secretary of Defense may transfer funds available to the \n     Department of Defense to the Department of State, or to any \n     other Federal agency, to carry out the purposes of this \n     section, and funds so transferred shall remain available \n     until expended.\n       (c) Limitation.--The aggregate value of assistance provided \n     or funds transferred under the authority of this section may \n     not exceed $200,000,000.\n       (d) Complementary Authority.--The authority to provide \n     assistance under this section shall be in addition to any \n     other authority to provide assistance to a foreign country.\n       (e) Expiration.--The authority in this section shall expire \n     on September 30, 2006.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry: Since we have this in proper form \nto be treated, are the comments I made to be used as time for the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be an appropriate allocation of \ntime.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Can you tell me how much time has been used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. So it will be 20-some minutes. At this point I yield the \nfloor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. With permission from Senator Warner, I would like to \nspeak on the issue of this commission and express some comments on \nthat.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am delighted my distinguished colleague, \na member of the committee, would like to contribute his thoughts on \nthis very important issue and take such time, I think up to 5 or 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask to be notified in 5 minutes, and I will \ndefinitely try to keep my time within that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator inform the Chair about which \namendment he will be speaking?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Levin-Reed commission suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2427\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, my problem with this matter is that we \nhave created, through our complaints--and some of it has been \npolitical, frankly--and debates beginning back during the past \nelection, a determination to embarrass President Bush or undermine, \nmaybe, even his policies by some; to call for the resignation of the \nSecretary of Defense. And all of these matters were taken out of \ncontext and blown up and distorted in a way that I think was \nunfortunate. Yes, we have had problems with abuse of prisoners. We \nreally have. But not nearly as many as would be suggested.\n  Senator Levin said it seems like it is every week. It has been talked \nabout every week. Somebody comes up and repeats something that occurs, \nand then they repeat it again like it is new. So we are keeping alive a \nperception that our military is not performing according to the high \nstandards that it sets for itself with regard to prisoner abuse. I do \nnot believe that is so.\n  I have been there. I have talked to the troops. But it is a tough war \nand a tough enemy. It is not great duty. We know what happened in Abu \nGhraib, and I would point out the general there, within 1 day or 2 \ndays--1 day of hearing of the Abu Ghraib problem--commenced an \ninvestigation, and 3 days later announced to the world that we were \nconducting an investigation of abuse and did so publicly to the TV, \nlong before any photographs were ever released because the military, \nthe Army, did not approve of what went on there.\n\n[[Page S12397]]\n\n  They have had an investigation. It was suggested that the higher ups \nwere responsible for this; interrogation tactics and procedures were \nnot clear, and that is why all this happened.\n  I would just ask our colleagues to remember that when the evidence \ncame out during the prosecution of those individuals, the conviction of \nthem, and their being sentenced to jail, I point out it was never \nsuggested that was part of an interrogation technique. These people \nwere not being interrogated. Most of them were not even members of al-\nQaida. A lot of them are street thugs that had been arrested for normal \ncriminal behavior. They didn't have any intelligence to give us about \nthe enemy we were facing over there. So all this that has been \nsuggested, that we are completely out of control and somehow the \nDepartment of Justice memorandums about what is the maximum ability of \na U.S. office to conduct investigation, somehow that affected that.\n  Remember Mr. Sivitz, a private, I believe, or a corporal or sergeant, \nwho pled guilty and was convicted and sentenced to jail? He said our \nleaders didn't know what we were doing. If they had known what we were \ndoing, it would have been hell to pay.\n  Do you remember the incident of the African-American colonel who had \na sterling career who, in a fire fight, pulled out a gun and fired a \nbullet near the head of an individual he had captured to frighten him \nto get information he thought might help him save his troops? They \ncashiered him out of the Army.\n  We had case after case of people being disciplined. Over 200 have \nbeen. So this myth has been created that people didn't know what was \ngoing on and were not properly instructed.\n  We had hearings. I am on Judiciary, and I am on Armed Services in the \nSenate. We have House Judiciary and Armed Services and we have Senate \nIntelligence and we have Senate and House Intelligence. We have had \nover 26 hearings on this issue, more than any other.\n  We ought to spend some time trying to figure out how to win this war \nrather than going back and suggesting to the whole world, by hearing \nafter hearing, after report after report after commission, that we are \nout of control, mistreating prisoners, when it is not so. Our soldiers \nare consistently abiding by the Geneva Conventions as they have been \ninstructed, and they do their duty every day. The Field Manual applies \nto men and women in the military, and they know that. That has been \nreaffirmed to them with clarity, that that controls the treatment of \nthe prisoners in Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My 5 minutes is up? Mr. President, I will conclude--I \nmay like to talk about this later on--with a letter from a sergeant \nfrom the Arkansas National Guard who was in Iraq from April 2004 to \nMarch of 2005. He said:\n\n       My job was that of fire-team leader, responsible for three \n     soldiers. We patrolled the streets of Baghdad daily [not a \n     safe place to be] conducted raids, manned checkpoints, and \n     cleared houses and other buildings. During our stay we \n     detained dozens of Iraqis.\n       So I was somewhat astounded at Capt. Ian Fishback's letter. \n     . . .\n\n  He said he saw beatings, broken bones and other improper treatment of \nprisoners. That is inconsistent with my observations--of mine. I will \noffer this for the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will quote one paragraph.\n\n       We never experienced the confusion that Capt. Fishback and \n     his soldiers evidently experienced. Our directives were clear \n     and our approach to treating detainees was consistent: I \n     never saw a U.S. soldier physically mistreat an Iraqi. I saw \n     professional treatment of detainees from top to bottom, and I \n     was proud to be a part of this great combat team.\n\n  That is what is going on. That is the reality, in my view, of what is \ngoing on in Iraq. We have subjected ourselves and our soldiers to great \nrisk because we demanded restraint on their part, and for the most part \nthey have given us that.\n  There have been problems. We know that. But we are not allowing them \nto continue. We are stopping them and prosecuting people if they have \nviolated the law, as they should be prosecuted. So I am concerned that \nwhat we do today sends a message to the world that Members of this body \nand members of the leadership of the U.S. Government believe that our \nmilitary is out of control and that we need some sort of commission to \nget them in control.\n  That is not accurate in my view. We don't need another commission. We \nhave had at least six, eight or nine major reports, and we have had, of \ncourse, over 20 hearings in the House and Senate. I have been a part of \nmore of them than I would have wished.\n  I honestly and truly believe we need to watch our rhetoric and not \ndemean the fine men and women who are serving us because we sent them \nthere in harm's way, and they are serving us with fidelity to duty and \nthe highest degree of professionalism, giving their lives to help the \nIraqi people to have a better life. That is our goal. That is what we \nneed to keep at. I hope we will remember that as we debate these \nsubjects.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       I am a sergeant in the Arkansas Army National Guard, and I \n     was in Iraq from April 2004 to March 2005. My job was that of \n     fire-team leader, responsible for three soldiers. We \n     patrolled the streets of Baghdad daily, conducted raids, \n     manned checkpoints, and cleared houses and other buildings. \n     During our stay in Iraq, we detained dozens of Iraqis.\n       So I was somewhat astounded at Capt. Ian Fishback's letter \n     to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) about what he saw and observed \n     in Iraq concerning beatings, broken bones and other improper \n     treatment of prisoners [op-ed, Sept. 28]. His experience and \n     observations are inconsistent with mine.\n       Our unit was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division. We \n     worked with active-duty soldiers, and when I moved to a \n     forward operating base known as Headhunter, I worked every \n     day with the 1st Cavalry, which I found to be a professional \n     organization.\n       We never experienced the confusion that Capt. Fishback and \n     his soldiers evidently experienced. Our directives were clear \n     and our approach to treating detainees was consistent: I \n     never saw a U.S. soldier physically mistreat an Iraqi. I saw \n     professional treatment of detainees from the top to the \n     bottom, and I was proud to be part of this great combat team.\n       I do not challenge Capt. Fishback or his observations. But \n     I saw U.S. soldiers, both active-duty and National Guard, \n     conduct themselves professionally on a daily basis.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the men and \nwomen who make up the 101st Airborne Division based at Fort Campbell, \nKY. In the war on terror, these soldiers frequently form the front \nlines. I offer them the thanks and prayers of a grateful nation as they \nare in the process of deploying to Iraq once again.\n  The 101st has seen action in Iraq before. They led the initial wave \nof forces sent to liberate that country in March 2003. About 19,000 \nsoldiers in all from the 101st helped bring freedom to the Iraqi people \nand destroy Saddam Hussein's illegitimate regime.\n  After the fall of Hussein, the soldiers of the 101st operated around \nthe city of Mosul in northern Iraq--I had a chance to visit them there \nin 2003--keeping innocent Iraqis safe and tracking down terrorists. \nStationed in Iraq for about a year, they undertook some of the most \nhazardous duties yet in the war on terror. Tragically, 73 soldiers from \nFort Campbell have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty to \ndate, including four soldiers killed near Baghdad earlier this very \nweek.\n  My heart goes out to the families of these brave heroes. I believe \nthe best way we can respect their memories is to finish their mission \nin Iraq with honor. I have tried to do my utmost in this Senate to see \nthat our Armed Forces get everything they need to fulfill that mission, \nand I will continue to do so, as I know my other colleagues will as \nwell.\n  The 101st Airborne Division, also known as ``The Screaming Eagles,'' \nis one of the most respected divisions in our armed services and \nfrequently gets the first call when crisis strikes. They specialize in \nthe rapid deployment of soldiers into combat from helicopters.\n  The division was founded in 1942 and parachuted into Normandy on D-\nDay during World War II. Later, many of its members saw action at the \nBattle of the Bulge. The 101st continued to serve many critical \nmissions in Vietnam and the first gulf war. They are the best America \nhas to offer, and I might also add, the HBO series ``Band of Brothers'' \nfrom a few years ago was about the 101st Airborne in World War II. It \ntook that storied unit from the beaches of Normandy through to the end \nof the war.\n  The 101st Airborne began redeploying to Iraq in September, and by the \nend of this month, about 20,000 of its soldiers will be back in Iraq.\n  They will be gone for at least a year. For many soldiers, this will \nbe their third deployment since September 11, 2001: The 101st was also \ndeployed to Afghanistan soon after the attack of September 11.\n  MG Thomas R. Turner, who commands the 101st Airborne, expressed the \nconfidence and clarity of vision that all soldiers of the 101st share \nwhen he spoke at a color casing ceremony recently to signal the \nofficial departure of his soldiers to Iraq.\n  Referring to the 101st Airborne's mission, he said:\n\n       Our end state is clear: An Iraq at peace with its \n     neighbors, and an ally in the War on Terror, with a \n     representative government that respects the human rights of \n     all Iraqis.\n\n  Just as in wars before, our country fights not for land or treasure \nbut for freedom. In previous centuries, America has fought to secure \nliberty, end slavery, and stamp out fascism. Our cause today is equally \njust. We fight to defeat the terrorists who would rule by fear.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the extremely \nunfortunate decision by the highest levels of the State Department to \nmeet with Mehmet Ali Talat, the self-declared president of the so-\ncalled ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.'' For more than 30 years, \nit has been a tenet of U.S. foreign policy not to extend de jure or de \nfacto recognition to this self-declared government, which exists only \nbecause of the forcible occupation of the northern one-third of Cyprus \nby more than 43,000 Turkish troops.\n  Cyprus was divided by a Turkish invasion in 1974. With the exception \nof Turkey, all nations recognize that this invasion was illegal and \nhave refused to recognize the ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,'' \na rump state that proclaims itself the government of the occupied area. \nFar from honoring the invasion, the world recognizes only the Republic \nof Cyprus as the legitimate sovereign government for the entire island.\n  Both international law and U.S. statutory law support the free \ngovernment of Cyprus. Several U.N. Security Council resolutions implore \nnations neither to recognize nor support the self-declared government \nin the occupied area. Likewise, the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act \nestablishes the U.S. policy of supporting a free government in Cyprus, \ndemanding the withdrawal of all Turkish forces from Cyprus, and seeking \nthe reunification of the island's communities.\n  I rise today because I fear the State Department is now embarked on a \ndifferent course, a course that may irreparably damage the prospects \nfor a peaceful reunification of Cyprus. On Friday, October 28, 2005, \nthe U.S. Secretary of State met with Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat. I have heard \nthe State Department spokesperson try to justify this meeting by saying \nthat the Secretary would only be meeting with Mr. Talat in his capacity \nas a leader of the Turkish-Cypriot community, and their session would \nnot signal a change in U.S. policy toward Cyprus.\n  These explanations are disappointing. In all likelihood, meeting Mr. \nTalat in the State Department's Harry S. Truman Building will be used \nby Turkey and the rump state as evidence that the United States is \nmoving toward independent elevation of this self-declared government \nand the permanent dismemberment of Cyprus.\n  Following the defeat of an U.N.-sponsored plan in 2004, the Republic \nof Cyprus has undertaken numerous initiatives designed to bring the two \ncommunities together. Since April 2003, when the movement restrictions \nthrough the cease-fire line were partially lifted, there have been more \nthan 8 million crossings from both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. During \nthe 4 million visits by Greek-Cypriots to the occupied area, \napproximately $100 million were spent to the benefit of Turkish \nCypriots. Cyprus is contributing concretely to the economic uplifting \nof the Turkish Cypriot community--more than $43 million in social \ninsurance, more than $9 million in medical care, and more than $343 \nmillion in free electricity during the last couple of years.\n  According to Turkish Cypriot reports, one of the main reasons for the \nTurkish Cypriot economic growth is the opportunity that was provided to \nmore than 10,000 Turkish Cypriots to work in the government-controlled \nareas after the lifting of the restrictions. These skilled workers, who \ncontinue to live in the occupied areas, earn approximately $180 million \nevery year. The Republic of Cyprus has also unilaterally removed land \nmines in the cease-fire zone. More than 63,000 people in the occupied \narea have been issued Republic of Cyprus birth certificates, more than \n57,000 have been issued Republic of Cyprus identity cards, and more \nthan 32,000 have been issued Republic of Cyprus passports.\n  Unfortunately, Turkey and its rump state have been working in the \nopposite direction. In Turkey's negotiation for EU accession, Turkey \ncommitted to extending its customs union to Cyprus, but then \nunilaterally backtracked on its commitment, stating that it does not \neven recognize the Republic of Cyprus. Turkey and the ``TRNC'' have \npressed for the opening for direct airline flights and direct trade \ninto the occupied area, both of which violate the Republic of Cyprus' \nsovereign power to designate ports of entry. Last month, the Prime \nMinister of Turkey\n\n[[Page S12399]]\n\nsaid that he would only accept a solution on Cyprus that included a \npermanent division of the island into two states. ``One state in the \nnorth, one state in the south and a confederation . . . this is what \n[Cyprus President] Papadopoulos should accept, otherwise we cannot \nreach an agreement,'' the Prime Minister stated. Most egregiously, \nTurkey and the ``TRNC'' have increased the number of Turkish troops on \nthe island--from about 36,000 to more than 40,000--in the past year. \nTurkey also intensified the influx of Turkish settlers in the island \nand at the same time, both Ankara and the Turkish Cypriot leadership \ncontinued their policy of immense exploitation of Greek Cypriot \nproperties in northern occupied Cyprus. These are not the actions of \nparties committed to a peaceful resolution to the division.\n  For more than 30 years, the United States has refused to reward \nTurkey's illegal invasion with an independent Turkish state on Cyprus. \nBut the decision to extend to Mr. Talat unprecedented access to our \ngovernment's most hallowed halls only serves to validate his and the \nTurkish Prime Minister's view that the ``TRNC'' should be treated as an \nindependent entity. Because independent status is exactly what Turkey \nand the rump state seek, the meeting reduces the incentive for Turkey \nand Mr. Talat to engage in productive talks to resolve the division of \nCyprus. And why should they negotiate if they are promised to be \nprovided direct trade, direct flights, and separate treatment by the \nSecretary of State?\n  I call on the State Department to abandon this ill-conceived meeting \nwith the self-declared president of the ``TRNC,'' an illegal entity \nthat, I repeat, the U.S. government does not recognize. The meeting \nwill be viewed, and it will be used, as an elevation of the ``TRNC'' \nand a nod toward independent and separate status. The meeting is \ninconsistent with the United States' stated policy towards Cyprus, and \nit serves only to hinder efforts to resolve the division of Cyprus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/04/senate-section/article/S12399-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, first, I want Senator McConnell and his \nstaff for all the heavylifting and hard work to complete this important \nbill. As a committee chairman, I know how difficult it can be to pass \nlegislation.\n  I am pleased that the House-Senate conferees considering the State \nand Foreign Operations appropriations bills have included language \nwhich withholds taxpayer dollars to those countries which refuse to \nextradite violent criminals to the United States for prosecution. While \nthis is a positive step, I must express disappointment that the \nconferees saw fit to provide for the continued flow of tax dollars to \nthese countries upon a mere certification by the Secretary of State \nthat a cutoff would not be in the national interest of the United \nStates. My original amendment, which passed the Senate on July 20, \n2005, by a vote of 86 to 12, contained no such loophole. The earlier \npassage of my original amendment and the House passage of a similar \namendment by Representative Nathan Deal of Georgia, by a vote of 294 to \n132, sent a powerful message to those countries which refuse to \nextradite murderers and other violent criminals. The passage of these \nearlier amendments represented a victory for law enforcement, for \nvictims of violent crime, and for simple justice and the rule of law.\n  When an individual is charged with a crime and flees to a foreign \ncountry, it is the responsibility of the U.S. Department of State to \nseek extradition of the fugitive.\n  In some instances, countries refuse to extradite even defendants \ncharged with violent crimes when the evidence is overwhelming. Some \nrefuse when the defendant faces the possibility of the death penalty in \nthis country and this issue represents a particular challenge to our \nongoing relations with other countries.\n  However, even in instances in which the defendant does not face the \ndeath penalty, some countries have still refused to extradite--some for \nthe articulated reason that they do not extradite their own nationals. \nOthers--Mexico, Costa Rica, Spain, Venezuela and Portugal, for \nexample--have refused to extradite because the defendant faces a \npossible life sentence if convicted in the United States.\n  Of course the possibility of life imprisonment reflects the \nseriousness of the offense and should result in a greater, not lesser, \njustification for extradition. Such policies stand common sense on its \nhead.\n  These unjust policies by some countries came into sharp focus in \nconnection with the brutal murder of the son of David Fulton, who is a \nconstituent of mine in Hampton, GA.\n  On December 21, 2002, Mr. Fulton's son, CPL Joshia Fulton of the U.S. \nMarine Corps, was murdered right here, on the streets of Washington, \nDC.\n  At the time of his murder, CPL Fulton was a member of the elite \nPresidential Protection Program called Yankee White, an assignment \nthrough which he had the honor of traveling abroad with the President \nof the United States.\n  Corporal Fulton was awaiting assignment for service as a guard in the \nWest Wing of the White House when he was murdered.\n  After an investigation by the DC Police Department, a criminal \ncomplaint was filed charging a suspect named Carlos Almanza with the \nmurder of Joshia Fulton.\n  Almanza, however, fled the United States to his home country, the \nRepublic of Nicaragua, where that country's constitution prohibits \nextradition of its citizens. And so the person charged with this \nheinous crime is free to kill again and to live the good life while the \nfamily of his victim endures the cruel consequences of their loss day \nin and day out, without justice and without closure to their suffering.\n  If a country refuses to turn murder suspects over to U.S. authorities \nso they can be brought to justice in the United States where the \nheinous crime occurred, then that country should not receive any \nfinancial aid from the United States under the appropriations bill now \nbefore the Senate. A country's constitutional ban on extradition of its \ncitizens who are fugitives from justice is unacceptable. Quite simply, \nthat law needs to change if they want to continue to receive American \naid.\n  While I am disappointed in the final wording in the conference \nreport, I take comfort that my amendment has already gotten the \nattention of these countries. Following passage of my amendment in \nJuly, I and my staff met with representatives of various countries, as \nwell as representatives of the Departments of State and Justice. While \nwe worked diligently to craft language to address legitimate concerns \nof these countries and our own Government, the final conference \nlanguage, in my view, falls short of reflecting America's resolve to \nput a stop to refusals to extradite.\n  As I stated during debate on my original amendment in July, the \nintent of this language is not to deny aid to any country, but rather \nto provide a substantial incentive for recalcitrant countries to reform \ntheir extradition laws so that suspected criminals can be brought to \njustice in the United States. I hope that this experience will be a \nwake-up call to the State Department to redouble its efforts to \nencourage all countries to extradite murderers and other violent \ncriminals to stand before the bar of justice. I will continue to work \nfor the extradition of Corporal Fulton's killer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/04/senate-section/article/S12399-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12399-S12400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr President, yesterday I voted against the Agriculture \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2006 and I did so with some \nreservation. At the outset, I want to commend the managers of the bill, \nSenator Bennett and Senator Kohl, for trying hard to keep the bill as \nclose to the Senate bill as they could, but the House hijacked the bill \non several important points.\n  I am grateful that the conference report included funding for Tufts \nUniversity, working with local Connecticut farmers to develop more \neffective agricultural operational and marketing practices. Even though \nthe physical university is in Boston, Tufts is using the funding \nexclusively in Connecticut so that our farmers can diversify their \ncrops and market them more aggressively in local markets. Additionally, \nthe University of Connecticut, in conjunction with the University of \nIllinois, received funding to continue a research program on \ntherapeutic cloning\n\n[[Page S12400]]\n\nin cattle. Finally, language was included to again urge the Animal and \nPlant Health Inspection Service, APHIS, to indemnify a Connecticut \npoultry producer who undertook a successful emergency vaccination \nprotocol 2 years ago.\n  So while I am pleased that there are a few items specifically for my \nconstituents, I remain deeply troubled by the path this Congress is \ntaking as it tries to cut spending for programs that benefit our most \nvulnerable populations while at the same time planning for tax cuts for \nthe most wealthy, who neither need nor, on the whole, seek the \nextravagance that the majority insists on heaping upon them.\n  The Senate conferees are to be commended for pushing hard for \nincreases in food and nutrition programs, including the McGovern-Dole \nFood for Education Program, but at the same time, House conferees \ninsisted on the option of privatization of the food stamp process. That \nis often code word for closing down local centers and relying more and \nmore on remote call centers and the Internet. This puts a \ndisproportionate burden on those people who need the services most. I \nknow that in my State of Connecticut, this action could adversely \nimpact 109,250 households and that number is likely to grow. \nUnfortunately, the Republican-controlled Congress often sees \nprivatization as the panacea for saving money. Instead, studies often \nfind that contracting out these services often costs more money. But \nthe problem doesn't stop there. As Congress moves forward with the \nbudget reconciliation process, we will have to come to terms with the \nfact that the House has insisted on draconian cuts of nearly a billion \ndollars in the food stamp program. If this number were to stand, nearly \n300,000 low-income individuals could be denied benefits. The majority \nin Congress refuses to increase the minimum wage. It refuses to \nincrease low-income heating assistance, despite dire predictions of \nrecord heating costs this winter. Now Congress is on the verge of \ncutting off 300,000 people from food assistance. Such a move is \nirresponsible, and it is unconscionable.\n  Finally, the House conferees insisted on denying American consumers \nwith simple information about the meat they eat. As our colleagues \nknow, mandatory meat labeling was included in the 2002 farm bill, which \nI supported. The labeling of seafood already started but meat labeling, \nat the behest of a few powerful lobbyists and a few Members of \nCongress, continues to be delayed. Hundreds of organizations around the \ncountry, including farmers, producers, consumer groups, and individuals \noverwhelmingly support country-of-origin labeling, COOL. The fiscal \nyear 2006 House appropriations bill effectively delayed meat labeling \nby refusing to allow any funds to be used to implement COOL, while the \nSenate bill did not change the requirement. During conference on this \nbill, the House, with no consultation with the Senate and with no vote, \nunilaterally extended the COOL delay until 2008, beyond what even the \nHouse language did. Labeling would increase consumer confidence and \nassist agricultural producers.\n  So, while there are many laudable provisions in the agricultural \nappropriations bill, several provisions caused me to cast a vote \nagainst this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/04/senate-section/article/S12400-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/04/senate-section/article/S12400-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/04/senate-section/article/S12400-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:35 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Branden, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1285.

A bill to extend and expand the Child Safety Pilot Program; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Extending the \nChild Safety Pilot Program Act of 2005, along with my good friend \nSenator Hatch.\n  At the outset, let me thank Senator Hatch and his staff for joining \nwith me in this effort. I can think of no stronger advocate for \nchildren's safety than my friend from Utah, and I am so pleased to have \nhim as an original cosponsor of this bill.\n  When a mom drops her young son or daughter off at the local Boys & \nGirls Club, when a dad brings his child to little league practice, or \nwhen one of our kids is mentored by an older member of the community, \nwe hope and pray that they are going to be safe. They usually are, and \nyouth-serving organizations are constantly vetting new employees and \nvolunteers to ensure there's nothing in their background to indicate \nthat potential workers should not be around our kids.\n  But these groups can only do so much. They send information and \nfingerprints on prospective workers to their State criminal \nidentification agencies, and that effort typically results in a \ncomprehensive search of criminal history information on file in the \nState where the organization is established. But if the worker spent \ntime in another state, or if a State's records are not up to date, \nkids' safety can be put in jeopardy.\n  The organization with the most complete set of national criminal \nhistory information is the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services \nDivision, in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Years ago, I was approached by \nthe Boys & Girls Clubs and others and asked whether there would be a \nway for them to directly access CJIS' records and avoid the then-\ncumbersome system requiring them to apply for these national background \nchecks through their States.\n  I looked into the issue and discovered that a patchwork of statutes \nand regulations govern background checks at the State level. There are \nover 1,200 State statutes concerning criminal record checks. In \ndifferent States, different agencies are authorized to perform \nbackground checks for different types of organizations, distinct forms \nand information are required, and the results are returned in various \nformats that can be difficult to interpret. Youth-serving organizations \ntrying to do the right thing and keep the kids in their charge safe \nwere being forced to navigate an extremely cumbersome system.\n  Indeed, in 1998, the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services \nDivision performed an analysis of fingerprints submitted for civil \napplicant purposes. CJIS found that the average transmission time from \nthe point of fingerprint to the State bureau was 51.0 days, and from \nthe State bureau to the FBI was another 66.6 days, for a total of 117.6 \ndays from fingerprinting to receipt by the FBI. The worst performing \njurisdiction took 544.8 days from\n\n[[Page S12402]]\n\nfingerprinting to receipt by the FBI. In a survey conducted by the \nNational Mentoring Partnership, mentoring organizations waited an \naverage of 6 weeks for the results of a national criminal background \ncheck to be returned. In a New York Times article published this past \nAugust, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America's vice president of club \nsafety, Les Nichols, was quoted as saying that about a third of the \ncriminal records that Clubs' checks turned up were from states other \nthan the one where the applications were submitted. ``It can take as \nlong as 18 months to retrieve those records,'' Mr. Nichols said, ``and \nthat time lag works against us, particularly because we are in a \nbusiness where we have a lot of seasonal staff and volunteers.''\n  Not only was the national criminal history background check process \nslow, but it was often too expensive to be useful to youth-serving \norganizations. In 2000, I introduced comprehensive legislation designed \nto plug these security holes. No action was taken on my National Child \nProtection Improvement Act that year. The following year, I re-\nintroduced the bill as S. 1868. That bill cleared the Senate \nunanimously but was never acted on by the House. It would have set up \nan office in the Justice Department to coordinate background check \nrequests from youth-serving organizations, and would have required the \nresults of these checks to be forwarded from the FBI to the requesting \ngroups quickly and affordably.\n  Finally, in 2003's PROTECT Act, we were able to make some progress on \nthis critical issue. Along with Senator Hatch and Chairman \nSensenbrenner of the House Judiciary Committee, I authored section 108 \nof the PROTECT Act conference report. Section 108 of Public Law 108-21 \nestablished an 18-month pilot program for certain organizations to \nobtain national criminal history background checks. When he signed the \nPROTECT Act into law, the President noted ``this law creates important \npilot programs to help nonprofit organizations which deal with children \nto obtain quick and complete criminal background information on \nvolunteers. Listen, mentoring programs are essential for our country, \nand we must make sure they are safe for the children they serve.''\n  The Child Safety Pilot Program created in the PROTECT Act was \nextended for another 12 months by a provision in last year's \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, but the initiative is \nscheduled to expire at the end of January 2006. Although the Department \nof Justice has yet to submit a status report on the Child Safety Pilot \nProgram, as required by law, data provided by groups using the program \ndemonstrate its effectiveness and the need for it to be extended.\n  At last check, over 10,000 background checks have been conducted \nthrough the pilot program. In those performed checks, 7.5 percent of \nall workers screened had an arrest or conviction in their record. \nCrimes discovered were serious: rape, child sexual abuse, murder, and \ndomestic battery. Half of those individuals were not truthful in their \njob application and instead stated they did not have a criminal record. \nOver one-quarter, 28 percent, of applicants with a criminal record had \ncrimes from States other than where they were applying to work. In \nother words, but for the existence of the Child Safety Pilot Program, \nemployers may not have known that their applicants had a criminal \nrecord.\n  The bill Senator Hatch and I introduce today will extend the Child \nSafety Pilot Program for an additional 30-month period. It will also \nchange the original program so that more youth-serving organizations \ncan participate, and will shorten the timeframe given to the FBI in \nwhich to return the results of the background check. We are pleased \nthat our bill has been endorsed by the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, \nthe National Mentoring Partnership, and the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children.\n  I would like to thank those who have made this program such a \nsuccess. Specifically, Ernie Allen and his team at the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children have generously provided staff and \nequipment and have served as a clearinghouse to process background \ncheck requests. Robbie Callaway and Steve Salem of the Boys & Girls \nClubs of America originally came up with this idea, and have provided \ntireless advocacy on its behalf. And Margo Pedroso of the National \nMentoring Partnership has been invaluable in making Members of Congress \nand the general public aware of the need for an affordable, efficient \nnational criminal history background check system. Without her, this \nprogram would never have been created.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Child Safety Pilot Program Act, \nand I look forward to its prompt consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1963. A bill to make miscellaneous improvements to trade \nadjustment assistance; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Improvement Act of 2005.\n  I want to begin with some simple facts about international trade. The \nbenefits of trade are vast in absolute terms, but so diffuse that \nindividuals are generally unaware of how much they personally gain from \ntrade. By contrast, the harms from trade, while small in absolute \nterms, are localized and intense.\n  Research shows that, on average, a worker who loses his job due to \ntrade will make 17 percent less in his new job. The older the worker \nand the lower his level of education, the larger the lifetime wage cut \nhe is likely to experience.\n  With statistics like these, is it any wonder that workers who believe \ntheir jobs are at risk from international competition are skeptical \nabout trade? With increasing numbers of Americans feeling vulnerable in \nthe global economy--even though many of them will never lose their jobs \nbecause of trade--the potential pool of trade skeptics is growing.\n  There is a solution.\n  In a June 2002 poll conducted by the Chicago Council on Foreign \nRelations and Harris Interactive, respondents were asked which of three \npositions most closely reflects their views on international trade. \nNearly three quarters of those surveyed, 73 percent, agreed with this \nstatement: ``I favor free trade, and I believe that it is necessary for \nthe government to have programs to help workers who lose their jobs.'' \nSixteen percent said they favored free trade and did not think it \nnecessary for the government to help those who lose their jobs. Nine \npercent said they do not favor free trade.\n  The results were even more striking in a 1999 poll conducted by the \nProgram on International Policy and Attitudes at the University of \nMaryland. In that poll, 87 percent of participants agreed with this \nstatement: ``I would favor more free trade, if I was confident that we \nwere making major efforts to educate and retrain Americans to be \ncompetitive in the global economy.'' Only 11 percent disagreed.\n  If there is a more compelling case to be made for Trade Adjustment \nAssistance, I do not know what it is.\n  For more than 40 years, TAA has been providing retraining, income \nsupport, and other benefits to workers who lose their jobs due to \ntrade. Montana workers tell me that TAA has been a lifeline, making it \npossible for them to gain new skills and start new careers rather than \nmerely survive a layoff.\n  In the Trade Act of 2002, I spearheaded the most comprehensive \nexpansion and overhaul of the TAA program since 1974. We expanded the \nkinds of workers who are eligible for TAA benefits. We added new \nbenefits like wage insurance and the health coverage tax credit. We \nalso streamlined the application deadlines to get workers enrolled and \nretraining sooner.\n  I am proud of this landmark legislation. It unified a splintered TAA \nprogram to create a single, comprehensive set of benefits.\n  Like most successful legislation, however, it was the product of \ncompromise. While TAA was expanded to cover secondary workers, it was \nnot expanded to cover service workers. While we added new benefits, we \nalso added eligibility tests for those new benefits that have proven \nburdensome and unduly restrictive in practice. While we made more \nworkers eligible for training, we did not provide training funds \nadequate to serve those workers.\n  In order for TAA to truly meet the needs of displaced workers, it \nneeds to be a lot more user-friendly. This bill\n\n[[Page S12403]]\n\naccomplishes that goal by eliminating barriers to entry that, in \npractice, defeat the purpose of TAA. The bill's goal is simple: to get \nevery trade-displaced worker who needs a new start into meaningful \ntraining and back into the workforce at comparable wages.\n  The TAA Improvements Act makes the following changes to TAA:\n  First, it provides that all deadlines and time limits for applying \nfor benefits are suspended when workers are appealing the Department of \nLabor's denial of a TAA eligibility petition. According to DOL \nstatistics, in 2004 DOL denied approximately 35 percent of the TAA \npetitions on which it ruled. Among the TAA petition denials appealed to \nthe Court of International Trade in the past several years, the vast \nmajority have been reversed. Numerous judges on the Court have \nexpressed growing impatience with the Labor Department's propensity to \nstick by denials for years until workers--ultimately vindicated through \nprotracted litigation--lose the ability to receive full benefits. This \nbill rectifies the problem by allowing workers who successfully appeal \ndenials of their TAA petitions to receive the benefits to which they \nare entitled regardless of intervening deadlines.\n  Second, the bill creates a TAA Petition Adviser within the Department \nof Labor to assist workers and those who prepare TAA petitions on their \nbehalf. Most workers and employers who prepare TAA petitions have no \nexperience with the program and seldom have access to experienced \ncounsel. The petition form itself, while improved over prior versions, \nprovides little guidance on the kinds of factual information upon which \nDOL bases eligibility determinations. As the Court of International \nTrade has found on numerous occasions, the Department's practice is to \ndo little, if any, investigation beyond the facts presented on the \npetition. Accordingly, if an inexperienced group of workers fails to \nsay ``the magic words'', their petition is likely to be turned down. \nThe new Petition Adviser would be responsible for assisting workers to \nprepare petitions by advising them on the kinds of information that are \nnecessary to demonstrate TAA eligibility--eliminating much of the \nguesswork that can turn applying for TAA into a game of roulette.\n\n  Sadly, not all employers make their best efforts to help their \ndisplaced workers qualify for TAA. Employers who prepare TAA \napplications for their workers may assign the task to Human Resources \nstaff, who may lack sufficient knowledge to provide the appropriate \ninformation to the Labor Department. They sometimes provide inaccurate \nor incomplete evidence that prevents DOL from certifying the workers. \nThe bill addresses this problem by requiring that all information \nprovided to DOL by the petitioning workers' employer be certified as to \nits completeness and accuracy by counsel or by an officer of the \ncompany. This requirement assures that petitions will receive high-\nlevel management attention and, in the case of counsel, imposes an \nexternal ethical check.\n  In the Trade Act of 2002, Congress had the wisdom to create a program \nof wage insurance, called Alternative TAA. Unlike traditional TAA, \nwhich requires a worker to remain unemployed until training is \ncompleted, wage insurance creates an incentive for workers to return to \nwork sooner and train on the job. It does so by assuring the worker \nthat, if the new job pays less than the old one, he can receive a \nsubsidy equal up to half the wage differential up to $10,000 over two \nyears. This innovative program has the potential to facilitate the most \neffective kind of training, reduce worker transition time, and reduce \nthe per-worker cost of adjustment assistance.\n  Experience under the Trade Act of 2002 indicates low participation in \nthis program, both because it is limited to workers over 50 and because \nthe steps a worker needs to take to choose wage insurance have proved \ndifficult to satisfy. This bill streamlines the application process for \nalternative TAA and lowers the minimum age for participating workers \nfrom 50 to 40--the average age of TAA participants.\n  The Trade Act of 2002 expanded TAA eligibility to include so-called \n``shifts in production''--when a plant in the United States closes and \nmoves overseas. The law makes eligibility automatic when production \nshifts to a country with which the United States has a free trade \nagreement or a unilateral preference program. But when production \nshifts to another country--such as China or India--workers must satisfy \nadditional criteria before they are eligible.\n  This limitation is one of the compromises that shaped the Trade Act \nof 2002. But I have never thought it fair or equitable. A worker whose \nplant moves overseas has the same adjustment needs no matter where the \nplant relocated. The TAA Improvement Act eliminates this distinction, \nmaking eligibility for TAA automatic for shifts in production to any \ncountry. It also eliminates a similar provision that limits coverage of \ncertain secondary workers to trade with Canada and Mexico.\n  In a recent review of the TAA program, the Government Accountability \nOffice noted that inflexible training enrollment deadlines have made it \ndifficult for workers to make timely and informed decisions about their \ntraining plans and career options. Experience has shown that the \ndeadlines we set may be too short in some cases. Community colleges, \nthe principal providers of TAA training services, often enroll students \nonly twice a year, making it difficult for some workers to enroll in \nthe courses they need within the applicable deadlines. Even the most \nmotivated among laid-off workers find it difficult to do the research \nand soul-searching necessary to make informed and sensible choices \nabout retraining in the time provided. For these reasons, this bill \nextends the training enrollment deadline by several weeks.\n  Perhaps the single most important problem facing the TAA program \ntoday is the chronic shortage in training funds. Every year, there are \nstates that run out of training funds and are forced to ration \ntraining. In some cases, states have even stopped workers from \nenrolling, which can reduce the total TAA benefits the worker can \nreceive even if funds later become available. The Department of Labor \nhas wisely issued guidelines to states to help them better manage their \ntraining resources. But the truth of the matter is that Congress has \nfailed to provide states with enough training funds to adequately serve \nthe number of people who qualify for retraining. Rather than cap \ntraining spending each year at an arbitrary amount arrived at through \npolitical negotiations, this bill sets the training budget with \nreference to program enrollment and average per person training costs.\n  The bill also gives the Department of Labor flexibility to steer \nworkers into some less traditional but practical training options. Many \nworkers who go through the TAA program ultimately end up self-employed. \nUnder the Workforce Investment Act, a general retraining program for \ndislocated workers, workers can participate in entrepreneurial training \nthat prepares them for self-employment. This bill extends the same \noption to workers in the TAA program. More than 10 percent of TAA \nparticipants are not native English speakers. Because English \nproficiency is a prerequisite for most occupational training courses, \nthese workers are generally steered into English language classes and \ntend to use up their training benefits before receiving occupational \ntraining. Under WIA, the Department of Labor has recently begun \npromoting ``integrated workforce training,'' which combines \noccupational training with job-related English proficiency. My bill \nallows the same kind of training to be provided under TAA.\n  For workers entering the TAA program, the most important service they \nreceive is guidance from case workers provided by the state. These case \nworkers help displaced workers learn about local career options, make \ninformed choices about training programs, prepare necessary paperwork \nand meet deadlines for TAA income support and other benefits. They keep \nworkers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous training \nproviders who prey on confused dislocated workers and make sure workers \nknow about all the benefits to which they are entitled.\n  Because TAA is a federal program delegated to the states, the federal \ngovernment provides the states with funding to meet the program's \nadministrative costs. According to a survey by the GAO, however, the \ncost of providing case worker services far exceeds\n\n[[Page S12404]]\n\nthe amount that the federal government provides. States must either \ndivert money from other training programs or skimp on the services they \nprovide to workers under TAA. The goal of TAA is to have workers make \nsensible choices about training that will lead to successful new \ncareers. My bill makes that possible by requiring the federal \ngovernment to provide the states with adequate funds to meet these \ncritical administrative costs.\n  This legislation requires the Department of Labor to improve its data \ncollection and to disseminate more information about the operation of \nthe TAA program. Better and more accessible data will permit Congress \nand the public to more accurately assess the program's successes and \nfailures and make it easier for workers to prepare successful \npetitions.\n  Finally, this legislation makes some needed changes to the TAA for \nFarmers program. For many years, Congress and the Labor Department \ntried--unsuccessfully to shoehorn farmers into the traditional TAA \nprogram. But the adjustment issues facing American farmers from global \ncompetition are fundamentally different than those facing manufacturing \nworkers. In the Trade Act of 2002, we created TAA for Farmers by \nmodifying the eligibility criteria and benefits package to more closely \nmeet the needs of agricultural producers.\n  Congress dedicated $90 million annually to this program, with the \nintention of helping farmers to become more competitive before losing \ntheir farms. After several years in operation, however, much of the \nmoney provided by Congress has not been spent. The legislation I am \nintroducing today fine tunes the eligibility criteria, based on \nexperience, to eliminate some of the pitfalls that have excluded some \ncrops from the program.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Improvement Act is the fourth in a \nseries of bills I have recently introduced to improve and reform TAA. \nThe Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms Reorganization Act, S. 1308, \nmakes needed changes to the management structure of TAA for Firms at \nthe Department of Commerce. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Equity for \nService Workers Act, S. 1309, extends TAA to the 80 percent of American \nworkers in the service sector. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for \nIndustries Act, S. 1444, simplifies the TAA petition process and ties \nTAA more closely to displacements caused by specific trade agreements.\n  In the future, I plan to introduce additional legislation addressing \nthe TAA health coverage tax credit. HCTC is a critical new benefit \nadded to the TAA package in 2002. As with many new programs, the \nimplementation process for HCTC has been bumpy. Armed with several \nyears of experience and several objective studies of the program, the \ntime has come to start smoothing out those bumps by revisiting the \nstructure and operation of the HCTC. This further legislation should be \nready for introduction in the coming months.\n  Whenever I speak about the need to expand and improve TAA, the first \nquestion I usually get is: how much will it cost? Clearly, my proposals \nwill add to the cost of the program and I will ask CBO to provide a \nscore. But the strong implication of this common question is that we \ncannot afford to add to the cost of the TAA program. I think that is \nthe wrong starting point.\n  First, we need to put the cost of TAA in perspective. At present, TAA \ncosts around one billion dollars per year to operate. That is a cost of \nless than $10 per American household per year. By contrast, a study by \nthe Institute for International Economics recently concluded that the \nAmerican economy is roughly $1 trillion per year better off thanks to \nglobal integration, which comes to about $9,000 in extra income every \nyear for each American household. Looking at these figures, we should \nbe embarrassed at the paltry fraction of the economic gains from trade \nthat we are plowing back into adjusting and retraining our workforce.\n  The truth is, the United States as a country cannot afford not to \nmake these changes. We need to be putting more resources into worker \nretraining. We need to make sure we do not marginalize an entire \ngeneration of manufacturing workers.\n  Now more than ever, we have to prepare workers for the challenges of \nthe global market. The domestic auto industry faces unprecedented \nchallenges to remain competitive in today's world. In October alone, a \nmajor auto parts supplier filed for bankruptcy, General Motors slashed \nwages and legacy benefits, and the Ford Motor Company announced \nsubstantial layoffs. Thousands of specialized workers will be displaced \nand have to start over.\n  At the same time, I continue to read warnings of an impending labor \nshortage--even in the manufacturing sector. Baby boomers will soon \nbegin retiring in large numbers. Our educational system is not turning \nout enough new workers with the skills our employers need to succeed in \nglobal competition. I have seen estimates of a shortage of 20 million \nworkers by 2020--with the most severe shortages in the most skilled \njobs.\n  Economists estimate that increasing the education level of American \nworkers by one year would increase productivity by 8.5 percent in \nmanufacturing and 12.7 percent in nonmanufacturing industries. Is \nexpanding TAA too high a price to pay to address the coming labor \nshortage and to achieve productivity gains on this order? I certainly \ndo not think so.\n  Experts with a wide range of views on issues surrounding trade and \ncompetitiveness agree that, if our nation is to thrive in the global \neconomy of the 21st century, we must expand our worker adjustment \nprogram. From Jagdish Bagwati to Tom Friedman, from Alan Greenspan to \nthe AFL-CIO--there is near universal agreement on this point. I believe \nthe legislation I have introduced today and over the past weeks creates \na strong platform to build on and I will work to see these bills \nenacted into law.\n  But trade adjustment for workers alone cannot prepare America for the \ncompetitive challenges ahead. We must aggressively pursue our interests \nthrough the trade agreements we negotiate with other countries, and we \nmust enforce them just as aggressively. Recently I laid out my vision \nfor closer congressional oversight of trade enforcement by the United \nStates Trade Representative. I intend to introdue legislation to \naddress the need for better, more aggressive enforcement of our trade \nagreements. Finally, I believe that our global competitiveness strategy \nmust go beyond trade negotiations. Over the course of several months, I \nhave highlighted many opportunities to enhance our global \ncompetitiveness in areas such as healthcare, energy, education, and \nsavings. We must prepare the American people to take full advantage of \nthese opportunities and many more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe determination and deduction of interest on qualified education \nloans; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, every year, the cost of higher education \nand vocational education increases dramatically. College tuition and \nfees have been rising more rapidly than household income over the past \ntwo decades. The divergence is particularly pronounced for low-income \nhouseholds. The sad result is that with every year more students and \nfamilies are forced to decide whether they can afford higher education \nwhile knowing their choice is limited by price. It is imperative that \nCongress work to make higher education more accessible to all.\n  Our Nation must make a solid commitment to ensure that every \nindividual has the opportunity to pursue higher education, and our \npolicies should reflect this commitment. Education has always been the \ngreat equalizer in our society that provides every American the same \nopportunity to succeed. That is why today I, along with Senator \nSchumer, am introducing legislation that would provide for a simpler, \nmore borrower-friendly method for reporting and deducting capitalized \ninterest and origination fees in connection with qualified education \nloans.\n  In May 2004, the Treasury Department issued final regulations with \nrespect to the student loan interest deduction under the tax code. \nAmong other things, these Treasury regulations provide that the \n``original issue discount rules'' (OID) shall apply for purposes of \nstudents claiming this deduction. In particular, they would apply to \nthe portion of the student loan that relates to federally mandated \nstudent loan origination fees and the capitalized interest that does \nnot accrue on the loan while the student attends school (i.e., the \ngovernment essentially pays this interest for the student on the loan \nduring the years the student attends school).\n  OID rules are complicated and confusing. In general, these rules \nattempt to prevent taxpayers from claiming inflated interest deductions \nstemming from debt obligations. When a borrower issues a debt \nobligation at a discount, that is the note's face amount exceeds the \namount that the lender advances to the borrower, the amount of the \ndiscount represents additional interest on the obligation. The OID \nrules reflect Congress' attempt to square the tax treatment of this \nunstated or disguised interest into conformity with economic reality.\n  The OID rules, then, ``limit'' a borrower's tax deduction because \nwhereas the tax code generally permits borrowers to deduct the interest \nthey pay on debt obligations, such as student loans, the tax code \ngenerally prevents borrowers from deducting any OID they might pay on \nsuch debt.\n  For example, assume that a corporation issues thirty-year bonds with \na face value of $1,000 each and, according to their terms, paying 10 \npercent interest each year. Assume, though, that the corporation \nactually sells these bonds to investors for $850 because the 10 percent \ninterest rate is below market rates. Under these facts, there is $150, \n$1,000 - $850, that the corporation essentially is ``re-classifying'' \nas interest that it will pay to the investor; that is, the investors \nwould not be satisfied with a 10 percent return upon giving the \ncorporation $1,000 so that the corporation essentially treats a portion \nof the principle, $150, as interest.\n\n[[Page S12407]]\n\n  The tax code classifies this $150 as OID. The $150 of OID serves the \nsame function as the stated annual interest of $100, 10 percent of \n$1,000. As such, the $150 of OID is an additional cost to the \ncorporation in borrowing $850 from the investor, and it is additional \ncompensation that the corporation pays to the lender for lending that \namount. The only differences to the parties are that the corporation is \nnot required to pay the OID of $150 until the bond matures and that the \ninvestor does not receive the discount in cash until then, unless the \nbond is sold in the interim.\n\n  As I noted earlier, the OID rules prevent borrowers from deducting \nthe entire amount of ``interest'' they pay to a borrower on a loan. \nSpecifically, in the previous example, although the parties treat the \nloan principle as being $850, the application of the OID rules treats \nthe loan as $1,000, which is significant because it means the IRS \nclassifies the $150 of OID as not being interest. In turn, the borrower \ncannot deduct this $150 payment to the borrower because it is a return \nof principle on the loan rather than interest.\n  Consequently, applying OID rules to student loans would have several \nnegative effects. First, with respect to students, they would not be \nable to deduct the entire amount of ``interest'' they pay to their \nlender. In general, whereas the tax code generally permits students to \ndeduct student loan interest, subject to certain limitations, it does \nnot permit taxpayers to deduct OID. The Treasury regulations, then, \nwill reduce the cash flow of students who are repaying student loans by \nlimiting their student loan interest deduction.\n  In addition, applying the OID rules will have an enormous impact on \nthe compliance burden. Indeed, the interaction of the OID rules and the \nloan provisions of the Higher Education Act greatly magnifies the \ncomplexity of rules that lenders must follow. As such, lenders and \nservicers will be forced to create accounting systems, at enormous \nexpenses that ultimately will be passed on to student borrowers, to \nenable them to track and report the origination fees and capitalized \ninterest in accordance with the OID rules. Furthermore, given that \nthere is no track record of applying the OID rules to student lenders, \nthere is no guarantee that they can preform these tasks accurately.\n  Congress enacted the OID rules to prevent taxpayers, mostly large \ncorporations, from altering the terms of loan agreements to claim \ninflated interest deduction. Clearly, applying them to student loans is \nunreasonable and frankly unintended.\n  To remedy this problem, my legislation would permit lenders to \naccount for the OID treatment of student loans under the ``immediate \naccrual method, which colloquially is referred to as the ``bucket \nmethod.'' Under this approach, the origination fee would accrue as soon \nas it is charged to or paid by the borrower, and capitalized interest \nwould accrue under the terms of the promissory note. Accrued \norigination fee and capitalized interest would go into a ``bucket'' as \nsoon as they accrue, until such time as the borrower begins to make \npayments on the loan. Amounts in the ``bucket'' would be applied \nagainst principal payments until the bucket is empty. Capitalized \ninterest and origination fees would be reported to and deductible by \nthe eligible taxpayer in the year in which they are paid.\n  My legislation would, as I stated, provide for a simpler, more \nborrower-friendly method for reporting and deducting capitalized \ninterest and origination fees in connection with qualified education \nloans. Consequently, it would not reduce the need to engage in the \nburdensome task of calculating the OID on loans, and the student \nborrowers would be able to deduct more of the interest they pay.\n  This bill is good policy and common sense. Senator Schumer and I look \nforward to working with Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and Ranking \nMember Baucus in seeking swift action to resolve this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/04/senate-section/article/S12407-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2423.

Mr. President, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil \nRights is the face of civil rights law enforcement in America. I will \nsupport Wan Kim's nomination for this important post.\n  For nearly 50 years, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division \nhas enforced Nation's civil rights laws and combated racism, \ndiscrimination, and other civil rights abuses. And during the past 50 \nyears, our Nation has made important strides in the fight for civil \nrights. The recent death of Rosa Parks is a reminder of how far we have \ncome, and of the courageous acts it took to get here.\n  I am concerned, however, about the Bush Administration's commitment \nto civil rights law enforcement and especially voting rights. As Chief \nJustice Roberts testified at his confirmation hearing, the right to \nvote is the ``preservative'' right of all other rights. Without that \nfundamental right, citizens are voiceless and powerless.\n  At his nomination hearing, I asked Wan Kim about the Civil Rights \nDivision's August 26 preclearance of a voter identification law in the \nstate of Georgia that is discriminatory and ``a national disgrace,'' in \nthe words of the New York Times. The law requires people without a \ndriver's license--a group disproportionately consisting of the poor, \nthe elderly, and minorities to pay $20 or more for a State ID card in \norder to vote. There isn't a single place in the entire city of Atlanta \nwhere the cards are sold. The Georgia law aims to be an anti-fraud \nmeasure, but the Secretary of State in Georgia maintains there has not \nbeen a proven case of voter fraud in that state in nearly a decade.\n  Although Mr. Kim has been the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in \nthe Civil Rights Division for over 2 years, he said he has not \nsupervised voting rights issues and does not have an opinion about \nwhether the Georgia law should have been precleared. That's a fair \nanswer.\n  But I hope Mr. Kim reads a decision handed down just a few days after \nhis nomination hearing by a Federal judge in Georgia, who enjoined the \nlaw and ruled that it appeared to be unconstitutional. The judge wrote \nthat the Georgia law ``constitutes a poll tax.'' Just last week, this \nruling was affirmed by a three-judge panel of the conservative U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Two of the three judges on the \npanel were appointed by President George H.W. Bush.\n  I am also concerned that the Bush administration has not brought a \nsingle voting rights lawsuit alleging racial discrimination against \nAfrican Americans. Perhaps even more troubling is the fact that earlier \nthis year the Justice Department filed its first case ever under the \nVoting Rights Act alleging discrimination in voting\n\n[[Page S12413]]\n\nagainst white voters. This case was brought against a county in \nMississippi, a State with a long and ugly history of discrimination \nagainst African Americans in voting.\n  As Congress begins to consider reauthorization of the important \nVoting Rights Act, I urge Mr. Kim to take a hard look at the work of \nthe Civil Rights Division's Voting Section and those who supervise it. \nThe Voting Section has done an effective job enforcing voting rights on \nbehalf of language minorities, but not, in the opinion of many, on \nbehalf of racial minorities.\n  Another area of concern is the productivity and management of the \nCivil Rights Division's Appellate Section. This section has been \nspending more time lately deporting illegal immigrants than enforcing \ncivil rights. According to data provided by Mr. Kim, 62 percent of the \nbriefs filed by the Civil Rights Division's Appellate Section in FY \n2005 involved defending the government's decision to deport illegal \nimmigrants. Nearly 40 percent of attorney hours in the Civil Rights \nDivision's Appellate Section were devoted to this work, according to \nMr. Kim. These numbers are troubling and unacceptable.\n  I am also concerned about the overall decline in civil rights \nappellate enforcement by the Civil Rights Division. According to Mr. \nKim, during the first 5 years of the Bush administration, the Justice \nDepartment filed an annual average of 80 civil rights appellate briefs. \nBy contrast, during the last 5 years of the Clinton administration, the \nJustice Department filed an annual average of 122 civil rights \nappellate briefs. In other words, there has been a 34 percent decline \nin civil rights appellate filings from the Clinton administration to \nthe Bush administration. And there was a 73 percent drop in civil \nrights appellate amicus filings between 1999 and 2004. These are \ndisturbing trends and I urge Mr. Kim to address them.\n  The Bush administration has also created a serious morale problem \nwithin the career ranks of the Civil Rights Division. Several media \nreports have elaborated on this problem, most recently a September 2005 \nLegal Affairs article entitled ``An Uncivil Division'' by a former \nhigh-ranking career official in the Civil Rights Division, William \nYeomans. His article indicates that morale problems have largely been \ncaused by heavy-handed tactics used by Civil Rights Division political \nappointees in making personnel decisions, communicating with career \nattorneys, and setting civil rights enforcement priorities.\n  During the nomination hearing of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney \nGeneral earlier this year, Senator DeWine asked Mr. Gonzales what he \nwould want to be remembered for as Attorney General. Mr. Gonzales said \nhe wanted to be remembered first for fighting the war on terror, and \nsecond for protecting civil rights and voting rights.\n  I hope Attorney General Gonzales will do a better job of fulfilling \nhis pledge to protect the civil rights and voting rights of all \nAmericans, and I urge Wan Kim to play a leading role in accomplishing \nthis mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/04/senate-section/article/S12413-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
