Mr. President, we awakened this morning with the news, \nconfirmed, that major steps are going forward in connection with this \nvery important issue of the ports. I use that\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\ngeneric term, ``the ports,'' because it relates to a transaction that \nhas been thus far approved by the administration whereby a company, \nowned by the United Arab Emirates, will be engaging in terminal \noperations in a half dozen or so of our terminals here in the U.S., \nhaving acquired those assets from a British firm which has been \nconducting those operations for some time.\n  I am very pleased that the leadership of the Senate--notably my \ndistinguished majority leader, with whom I have been in conversation in \nthe past 72 hours--is taking a leadership role. I hope the other side \nshortly will speak to their role in bringing into focus the importance \nof this issue and facilitating the several committees of the Senate to \nhave hearings, briefings, or otherwise acquire the facts.\n  Last week, I believed it was imperative that a certain amount of \nfacts get into the public domain as quickly as possible. On short \nnotice, I held a briefing--in contrast to a full hearing--a briefing by \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee and the principals, basically the \nDeputy Secretaries of the various departments and agencies which have \nthe primary responsibility within the group of 12 of the organization \nknown as CFIUS, or the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United \nStates.\n  The manner in which the President, acting upon the recommendation of \nthe CFIUS group, indicated that he and the administration approved of \nthis transaction will be examined in the context of these committee \nhearings and also the intelligence that was a key factor because \neveryone is constantly concerned about the security of this Nation as \nit relates to the war on terrorism and most specifically the port \nsecurity situation. Very legitimate concerns, very legitimate \narguments, very legitimate positions, in some ways, have been stated at \nall levels of our society. I believe it is important, before people \nbecome rigid in their thinking, that they at least possess all of the \nbasic facts.\n  My remarks today will not address the past. I am concentrating on \nlooking forward, as I have spent a great deal of time in the past week \non this situation. This particular contract, this one commercial \nsituation, is of importance to many parties and of importance to this \ncountry, but it has ramifications across our global economy. Our Nation \nis daily dealing in a one-market economic market. Really it is a one-\nworld market of diplomacy among the free nations as well. Indeed, it is \na one-world market in terms of our individual and collective \nsecurities, particularly in the war on terrorism.\n  It has been fascinating to me, although I have visited the UAE in \ntimes past, to focus once again on this pivotal and rapidly growing \nnation, a nation of several emirates which have drawn together, a \nnation which is becoming one of the major financial markets in the \nworld and major investors in the world.\n  According to the United States Trade Representative, the United \nStates and UAE engaged in $4.6 billion worth of trade in 2003--and that \nfigure has doubled since then according to the Financial Times. More \nthan 500 U.S. companies have regional headquarters in the Emirates. Oil \nand Gas are leading industries in the UAE, as the country holds \napproximately 8 percent of the world's crude oil reserves and has the \n5th largest natural gas reserves. In addition, at the end of 2005 \nEmirates purchased 42 Boeing 777 aircraft for approximately $9.7 \nbillion. This represents some of the vast investments by UAE in America \nand American investment in the UAE.\n  On Saturday afternoon I went to the Department of Defense. I went \ndown to the Joint Staff, where I met with the key officers who are \ndealing with a variety of issues relating to this and other matters \nto verify that over 500 U.S. warships docked--and I use the word \n``docked'' because they went right to the piers. Our sailors went off; \nothers came on to work with the ships. They didn't anchor out in the \nharbor and send in the lighters and the other transportation. It is the \nonly port in that region in which we can dock our major supercarriers.\n\n  In addition, there are airfields that are supporting the ongoing \noperations we have in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  It is important to look at security concerns. I personally went down \nand received the briefings--I hope others do--on the intelligence \nassessment that went into the first review of CFIUS negotiations. The \nfacts speak for themselves. Ambassador Negroponte will be before the \nArmed Services Committee, and I will propound questions on the \nprocedures and his own assessment. Hopefully that can be put into the \npublic domain.\n  As we embark on this new voluntary 45-day investigative period--and I \nhave some association with the company in this. They asked to come to \nsee me, having followed with great interest the hearings at my \ncommittee, over which I presided, in which I, in a very evenhanded way, \nI believe, we began to address these issues. I spent several hours with \nthem. They were going to file here, within the next few days, the key \ndocuments with the Treasury Department which will trigger the 45-day \ntime investigation.\n  I believe our leadership should focus on that time period. It ends up \non, basically, April 15, at the very time we proceed on another recess. \nThey, the company, hope to conclude by May 1. I am sure the leadership \nof both sides, working with the administration, will try to find some \nway so Congress can stay abreast of the proceedings, rather than \nreceive the entire record and decision making of CFIUS on the eve of \ngoing on another recess period.\n  Also, we have to be extremely careful in this 45-day process because \nwe will be setting precedents as to how our Nation proceeds under the \nCFIUS process. We have to proceed with a certain amount of \nconfidentiality because when other free enterprises come to invest in \nthe U.S., they will go before CFIUS for review. Thousands of these \ncases have been handled. We have been doing it since, roughly, 1988, \nand even going back before that under the Defense Production Act to the \n1950s. While it is important that we know more of the facts; we have to \ndo it in a way to preserve a certain degree of confidentiality in the \nbusiness world. Otherwise, there could very well be a chilling effect \non foreign investment in the U.S. We don't want companies to say we \ncan't come to the United States because in the course of trying to do \nour business--which is a private transaction so often between two \ncompanies--our proprietary information could be compromised.\n  This is going to pose a challenge.\n  My last point--I am gravely concerned about the image of America. I \nhave checked into the press coverage of this in the Arab world, and I \nregret to say that it is extremely disturbing. We cannot, in the course \nof our responsible work in the Congress and the continuing responsible \nwork of the administration, allow our actions to be viewed by others as \nbeing biased. Congress must look at this not only as a business deal \nbetween two companies but also consider the global diplomatic, \neconomic, and military security issues associated with this \nacquisition.\n  It is imperative we not send a mixed message to--or impose a double \nstandard on--our allies by expecting assistance in the global war on \nterror and an open door policy toward investing in their country while \nsending a message that they are not welcome to invest in ours. We have \nto show that, yes, we are concerned about security, but in doing so and \nworking through this process, we should not be perceived as treating \nelements of the Arab world and governments of the Arab world as second-\nclass citizens. It is imperative that at the conclusion of this--\nhowever it comes out, and I am hopeful it will come out positively--the \nU.S. is viewed by the Arab world as a reliable working partner and that \nrecognizes the importance, particularly in the war on terrorism, of \nhaving the support of a number of Arab nations to protect our interests \nand those of other nations in the free world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We are all interested \nin those issues, but this issue I rise to speak about is one that \nthreatens our national unity as much as any of those graver issues.\n  Let me put it this way: Where is Dave Barry when we really need him? \nAs he would say, what I am about to say to you, I am not making up.\n  Apparently someone has discovered that it may not be true, as is now \nsuggested at the beginning of each airline flight, that using our \ncellular phones will cause our planes to plunge directly to the Earth. \nAs a result, airlines and cell phone companies, as the presiding \nofficer, who is chairman of the relevant committee, well knows, are \nencouraging the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal \nAviation Administration to allow the approximately 2 million Americans \nwho fly each day to talk on their cell phones while they are traveling.\n  There are many issues facing our country, but as I say, I can't think \nof one that threatens our national unity quite so much as this proposal \nto turn airplanes into cacophonous, steel-sheathed missiles of Babel \nrocketing through the skies.\n  Imagine squeezing into your 17-inch middle seat between an oversized \ngentleman shouting into his Blackberry and an undersized teenager \nyapping into her cell phone, while in front of you a foreign traveler \norders dinner and across the aisle a saleswoman lectures her child--all \nof them raising their voices to be heard. It would be 5 hours of \nperfect hell from Dulles to Los Angeles--a rising, deafening chorus of \n``Can you hear me now?'' In multiple languages.\n  I can promise you that this noisy symphony will cost the airlines \nmoney. To begin with, passengers will demand expensive headphones to \ndrown out the noise. These headphones will be twice as expensive to \nreplace when passengers begin wrapping them around the throats of the \nyapper in the next seat. Not to mention the added cost of the medical \nbills that will be the result of fistfights or the cost of emergency \nlandings to remove brawling passengers. To prevent these airplane \nfistfights, the airlines would need to hire three times as many air \nmarshals. And I cannot imagine how many they would have to hire for a \nlong flight to Alaska.\n  Stop and think for a moment about what we hear now in airport lobbies \nfrom those who wander aimlessly or stand next to us yelling every \nimaginable personal detail into a microphone dangling from one ear. We \nhear them babbling about last night's love life, rearranging next \nweek's schedule, or lamenting their children's behavior. We hear them \nbarking orders to an assistant, dictating messages, or engaging in \nnegotiations. All of this is done, of course, in a loud, unnatural cell \nphone voice and completely oblivious to those of us nearby who are \nbeing forced to learn more about this person than we would ever want to \nknow. An airplane is a close environment, and we are assigned to one \nseat, strapped in, and limited in our choice of seatmates. We are also \nlimited in the ability to walk around or walk away.\n  I have just one cell phone to turn off for my country, but I will \nassure you that there are many other airline travelers who will gladly \nmake the same sacrifice. I offer as evidence the statement of a senior \nmember of the House Transportation Committee and former chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee, Mr. Duncan of Tennessee, which he made on July \n14 of last year; the thoughtful comment by Court Television anchor Fred \nGraham from USA Today, November 14, 2002; and another USA Today \narticle, this one by Craig Wilson on June 1, 2000.\n  I ask unanimous consent that each of these articles be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1)\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From USA Today, November 14, 2002]\n\n                       Keep Skies Cellphone-Free\n\n                            (By Fred Graham)\n\n       As a person who makes his living in New York, I am \n     accustomed to an occasional hassle. But as a person who \n     commutes weekly on the airlines from Washington to my job in \n     New York, I can see that many more hassles may be on the way.\n       The reason is that the airlines' longtime ban on cellphone \n     chatter while aloft may be lifted. Thus air passengers could \n     be confronted with the nightmare of all cellphone annoyances: \n     being assigned a seat next to a traveler who shouts into a \n     cell phone for the duration of the trip.\n       Warning flags surfaced recently when USA TODAY reported \n     that two electronics companies--AirCell and a unit of \n     Verizon--are racing to develop technology that will eliminate \n     the interference problems that led to the ban on cellphone \n     use during flights. The troubling aspect of the article is \n     that the statements attributed to airline and Federal \n     Communications Commission (FCC) officials seemed to assume \n     that if the technological problems could be solved, that \n     would settle the matter. The bottom line: The electronics \n     companies would make huge profits, and cell phone users would \n     be accommodated in the air. There was no mention of the \n     impact that this could have on the comfort and civility of \n     traveling by air.\n       Airline passengers have heretofore been spared cellular \n     unpleasantries because government regulators decreed that \n     cellphone transmissions might interfere with airplane \n     electronics or with cellular frequencies on the ground. This \n     made air travel a blissful refuge from the cellphone \n     indignities that have spoiled many a trip on a train or bus. \n     Anyone who has used mass ground transportation in recent \n     years has witnessed it: passengers squirming in discomfort as \n     a nearby cell phone user prattled on about matters that no \n     stranger would want to hear.\n       No way to escape chatty seatmates.\n       The reality is that air travel is unique in ways that would \n     make cell phone use far more upsetting than in any other form \n     of travel. Airline passengers in tourist class are usually \n     tightly packed in these days. If an air passenger is offended \n     by the cellphone excesses of his seatmate, he often cannot \n     move to another seat, and a flight to Los Angeles could be \n     interminable. I have witnessed a near-fistfight over \n     obnoxious cellphone use on an Amtrak train. That was \n     unpleasant, but fistfights on airplanes could be dangerous.\n       There's good evidence that cellphone users on airplanes \n     don't suffer grievously from the current cellular ban. Many \n     jetliners offer their own telephones within arm's reach of \n     every passenger, which, if used frequently, could be just as \n     annoying as a cellphone. But fortunately these calls are very \n     expensive, so passengers rarely use them. This suggests that \n     very few air passengers really need to get messages to people \n     on the ground, and that much cellular chatter, if it were \n     allowed, would serve mostly to relieve the boredom of the \n     flight.\n       One small step for sanity.\n       The government regulators and the airlines should take a \n     bold step: Declare that, even if cell phone use in the air \n     ceases to be a threat to the aircraft, it should still be \n     banned as a threat to the peace and comfort of the \n     passengers.\n       But with so much money at stake, it seems reasonable to \n     expect that once the safety problems are solved, the \n     regulators and airlines will permit cellphone calls from \n     airplanes. If so, the airlines should copy the ``quiet car'' \n     concept that Amtrak has crafted by designating one car of \n     passenger trains off-limits to cellphone use.\n       Airliners could have a ``quiet space'' toward the front of \n     each plane, and every passenger who agrees not to use a \n     cellphone should have the right to be seated there--with the \n     blissful assurance that the cellphone users would be \n     chattering away in the rear.\n\n                     [From USA Today, May 31, 2005]\n\n                           (By Craig Wilson)\n\n             Cell Phone bullies Change the Tone at Airports\n\n       It was 6 in the morning in Las Vegas. I had not been up all \n     night like most everyone else in town, but I felt as if I \n     had, mainly because everything was surreal, even by Vegas \n     standards.\n       I was at the airport, drinking my coffee, wondering why I \n     had booked such an early flight home, when a man appeared out \n     of nowhere and began screaming into his cell phone that ``the \n     fools'' at the gate area would not give him the seat he was \n     always assigned. It was his seat, after all, in the emergency \n     exit row. He always sat there.\n       I know this because he was telling not only the person on \n     the phone, but also all of us in the 702 area code.\n       What he had done was call the airline's customer service \n     number. He was unhappy with the answers he was getting from \n     the gate agent who was standing right before him.\n       I haven't seen anyone his age, or size, throw such a temper \n     tantrum in a long time. In fact, I'm not sure I've ever seen \n     anyone throw such a tantrum.\n       And then he was gone. Poof.\n       Maybe angry gods swept him away, or the security guards \n     shuffled him out, or maybe his own two feet were embarrassed \n     for him and carried him off, but he was gone--much to the \n     relief of everyone waiting to board.\n       It could just be bad timing on my part, but I'm running \n     into more cell phone jerks these days. They're everywhere.\n       Just the other day, a man regaled a boarding area at \n     Washington's Reagan National Airport with his business of the \n     day. It was very clear very early that he was very important. \n     He was berating one of his underlings for all the world to \n     hear.\n       Being a bit of a jerk myself, I decided to try a little \n     experiment. Instead of fleeing, as I would usually do, I \n     remained next to the\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\n     man. He continued his lecture--staring at me on occasion as \n     if I shouldn't be eavesdropping!--then moved a few feet away. \n     So I quietly moved with him. I followed for three more moves \n     until he finally told the person on the phone he'd call back. \n     Some jerk was following him around, he said. Actually, jerk \n     wasn't the word he used.\n       I chuckled all the way to New York's LaGuardia.\n       A number of airlines are looking into the possibility of \n     cell phones being allowed in flight. The Federal \n     Communications Commission and the Federal Aviation \n     Administration have to agree before it can happen, but \n     reports indicate it could come to pass as early as next year. \n     Heaven help us all.\n       If so, I have a couple of wishes. I want whoever votes to \n     allow cellphones on planes to take a flight with the young \n     man who threw the fit at sunrise in Las Vegas. And I want \n     them to sit right next to him. But not in his emergency row. \n     I want him to be unhappy and calling people to tell them so.\n       I also want them to take a flight with the businessman who \n     was berating his colleague back at headquarters. I'm just \n     curious about whether he has whipped the office into shape \n     yet.\n       Then give me a call. I'll be home, because I doubt I'll \n     ever fly again.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Duncan Statement: Subcommittee on Aviation Hearing Cell Phones on \n                    Aircraft: Nuisance or Necessity?\n\n       Mr. MICA. Mr. Duncan.\n       Mr. DUNCAN. Thank you very, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for \n     calling this hearing. I was one of the more than 7,000 who \n     sent letter or comment to the Federal Communications \n     Commission in very, very strong opposition to the lifting of \n     this cell phone ban. And I can tell you, I come down very \n     strongly on the nuisance side of this equation. I remember \n     reading a couple of years ago that Amtrak tried out a cell \n     phone free car on its Metroliner train from New York City, \n     and so many people rushed to that car that they immediately \n     had to add on another cell phone free car. Around that same \n     time, I read about a restaurant in New York City that banned \n     cell phones from one of its dining rooms, and the next day it \n     had to double that by adding on a second dining room because \n     so many people wanted to participate.\n       Among the comments to the FCC, passenger Richard Olson \n     wrote the Commission: A fellow passenger's signal was \n     breaking up, so his remedy was to talk loudly. The flight \n     attendant had to ask him to quit using the phone. On the \n     ground, we can walk away from these rude, inconsiderate \n     jerks. In there, we are trapped.\n       The Boston Globe wrote about a conversation that Gail James \n     of Shelton, Washington found on one flight. She said, quote: \n     I was seated next to a very loud man who was explaining his \n     next porn movie on his cell phone. Everyone on the plane was \n     subjected to his explicit blabbering. Should cell use during \n     flight be allowed, we had all better be prepared for a whole \n     lot of air rage going on.\n       A CNN/USA Today Gallup poll found that 68 percent were \n     opposed to lifting this ban; only 29 percent in favor.\n       Now, cell phone technology is, in many ways, a wonderful \n     thing. It can be used, as we all know, to help in \n     emergencies, to let someone know that they are going to be \n     late for an appointment, to call for directions when you are \n     lost. But I also wish that we had much more cell phone \n     courtesy. I think most people do not realize that they talk \n     much more loudly in general on a cell phone than they do in a \n     private conversation. And almost everyone has a cell phone \n     today. A former Knoxville city councilman told me at the \n     first of this past school year that three young girls were in \n     the office at Fulton High School in Knoxville saying they \n     could not pay a $50 activities fee, but all three of the \n     girls had cell phones on which they were probably $50 a month \n     cell phone bills. Today, cell phones are heard going off, I \n     have heard them go off at funerals, weddings, at movie \n     theaters, restaurants, congressional hearings. One was even \n     answered by a reporter asking President Bush a question, and \n     apparently it caused President Bush to get very upset as it \n     should have. Gene Sorenson wrote recently in the \n     Washington Post, quote: I don't mean to interrupt your \n     phone conversation, but I thought you should know that I \n     can hear you. I would close the door, but I can't seem to \n     find one on the sidewalk, the path at Great Falls, in line \n     at Hecht's, or at table 4 by the window. It is not like \n     I'm eavesdropping. As titillating as it sounds, I am not \n     drawn into your conversation about yoga class, tonight's \n     dinner, or Fluffy's oozing skin rash.\n       Although cell phones have been around for a while, we still \n     associate one with privacy. Put one to your ear, and you will \n     think you are in your kitchen, office, or, what was called a \n     phone booth, But take a moment to look around. You are in \n     public.\n       On June 21, Robert McMillan wrote in The Washington Post \n     about some of the comments to the FCC, and he quoted Steven \n     Brown who described the perfect trajectory of what he called \n     hell: Just imagine that ring conversation being mere inches \n     from your head and on both sides of you while occupying the \n     middle seat for a five-hour flight from L.A. to New York. \n     Hideous.\n       In addition, I know there are security concerns and some \n     concerns regarding possibly the effect on aircraft avionics. \n     But I hope that we do not lift this ban, and I hope that it \n     becomes very clear in this hearing that there is a great deal \n     of opposition to this proposed change. And I thank you very \n     much for calling this hearing.\n       Mr. MICA. I thank the gentleman. Mr. DeFazio.\n       Mr. DEFAZIO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, this is \n     not an issue of first impression for this committee. I \n     remember a number of years ago we had a hearing on cell \n     phones. We had a professor from Embry-Riddle who said--sorry, \n     Mr. Chairman.\n       Yeah. Yeah. No, we are in this thing. Yeah. No, it will be. \n     Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. \n     Chairman. Okay. Bye, yeah. Yeah. All right. See you. Bye.\n       Mr. MICA. You are just lucky you didn't do that with Mr. \n     Young.\n       Mr. DEFAZIO. I know. I would have been in deep trouble. We \n     are going to put Chairman Young in charge of this issue.\n       But that is the point. I mean, and he told us and at the \n     time I was suspicious that we were being held captive by the \n     industry to these air phones, you know, and their \n     extortionate charges. But he said, convincingly, that there \n     was a possibility, particularly in a fly-by-wire aircraft, \n     small but possible, of a damaged cell phone or other \n     transmitting device causing a problem. Now they are trying to \n     deal with that with this pico technology, I guess. But I am \n     not sure that totally addresses his problem. I think the * * \n     *\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, each of these travelers argues for \npreserving one of the last refuges of privacy--the quiet of an airline \ncabin where one may read a book, listen to music, sleep, or be left \nalone. This privacy may not be enshrined in the Constitution, but \nsurely it is enshrined in common sense.\n  If there must be cell phones on airplanes, common sense suggests \nfollowing Fred Graham's advice: Create soundproof conference rooms in \nthe back of the which passengers may rent for the privilege of yelling \ninto their cell phones. Or perhaps technology itself will rescue us. \nPerhaps the Federal Communications Commission or airline plane \nexecutives in a real outburst of common sense will earn the gratitude \nof 2 million Americans who fly each day by deciding text messages, yes, \nbut conversations, no.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/27/senate-section/article/S1492-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1492-S1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We are \nhaving a hearing on this subject now.\n  But I say to my good friend that he is privileged to represent a \nState which is at the vortex of commercial transactions of world trade \nand the one-world market of which I just spoke. I hope, in the ensuing \ndays as we begin to debate this and discuss it, he will avail himself \nof his industrial base in his State and the finances in his State to \nget a broader picture of the magnitude of the investment by the \nGovernment of Kuwait and, indeed, other Arab nations in the United \nStates of America. Consequently, it is essential that we view this \nsituation as one that is not influenced by any bias or prejudice or \nduality or double standards. No.\n  I say to my friend, just ask your businessmen why would a company \nsuch as the UAE organization be looking to acquire just the franchises \nto operate terminals--not own terminal. We have to get that out. The \nterminals will remain in State control. Why would they want to invest \n$6.8 billion in projects throughout the world and in any way facilitate \nany individual or group to try an act of terror and be forced to \njeopardize their own investment? We have to attribute to these people, \neven though they are beyond our shores, a tremendous business acumen, \nconcern over their own security and their own interest.\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\n  Having the opportunity to meet with the Mr. Bilkey Saturday evening--\nhe asked to see me, and I was happy to do that--I learned a great deal \nabout the knowledge and level they have of how to put a greater \nsecurity situation in the transit of these containers.

I have talked to a good number of people in the business \ncommunity and in the ports community of New York. The issue is a \ncomplicated one but one that is hardly clear-cut. But I will continue \nto pursue that.\n  I also will make just one other point; that is, the worry many of us \nhave is not that the head of this company would be wanting to \nfacilitate terrorism but, rather, that terrorists might too easily \ninfiltrate such an organization.

Mr. President, right before the recess, the distinguished \nmajority leader and I had an exchange regarding the pension reform \nconference. Everyone acknowledges the conference is necessary. The \npension reform bill is headed to conference. It is a very important \npiece of legislation that will affect the pensions of millions of \nworking Americans. It has strong bipartisan support. It passed this \nSenate by a vote of 97 to 2.\n  This has boiled down to something that is fairly simple: Who will be \nthe conferees? We have a right, of course, on our side to choose who we \nbelieve should be in the conference. The distinguished majority leader \nhas the right to choose whom he wants to be in the conference. \nArbitrarily, the majority leader said that conference would have seven \nRepublicans and five Democrats. That is not acceptable. We have said \nthat because of the complexity of this issue we need another Democrat. \nWe are willing to maintain the margin of two where Republicans would \nhave an advantage. But we believe it should be eight to six. \nRepublicans would get another conferee. Democrats would get another \nconferee.\n  Now, certainly, we are eager to work on producing a conference report \nthat will protect the benefits working Americans have earned, provide \ncertainty to employers who sponsor pensions, and strengthen the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation. I can see nothing harmful about having \nsix Democrats instead of five. It is important to get the right people \ninto the room when these issues are being discussed and decisions are \nbeing made. Remember, this conference will have jurisdictional aspects \nrelating to the Finance and the HELP Committees.\n  When we had the corporate tax bill last year, there were 23 \nconferees--23 conferees. We are saying there should be, again, eight \nRepublicans and six Democrats. Conferees on this legislation will need \nto resolve a number of important and very technical issues because we \nhave different feelings than does the House. And when I say ``we,'' I \nmean Democrats and Republicans, as indicated by the overwhelming vote \nto get it out of here.\n  I have confidence in the abilities of the two lead Senators on our \nside, Senators Kennedy and Baucus. But this is one conference where the \naddition of a couple more sets of eyes is likely to lead to better \nlegislation. So I would hope the majority leader would focus his \nattention on this issue and let the conference go forward. The only \nthing holding this up is whether this conference will have six \nDemocrats or five in arriving at a bill that will be brought back to \nthis body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/27/senate-section/article/S1493-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1493-S1495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING THE ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about this \nadministration, the administration of George W. Bush. Unless there is a \nsignificant turnaround, this administration will not be remembered for \nits accomplishments. It, in fact, will be remembered for its \nincompetence. And this dangerous incompetence has made America less \nsecure.\n  From Social Security to border security, the American people know \nthat incompetence lies at the heart of this administration's failures. \nUltimately, this incompetence has come with a price. It has made our \ncountry less safe and less secure.\n  We can talk about a lot of things, but this afternoon I will talk \nabout a few. Let's talk about the prescription drug program. I support \na Medicare drug benefit, but this administration has botched the \nprogram so badly that relatively no one has signed up for it. The \nPresident, in his Saturday address, said 25 million Americans have \nsigned up for this program.\n  That is simply not true. Twenty of those twenty-five million, prior \nto this legislation passing, already had prescription drug benefits. \nAnd now, under this program, they have a lot less than they had before. \nSo after all this talk, there are a few million new people who have \nsigned up, and tens of millions of people are still left trying to \nfigure out what to do and how to do it.\n  Of the seniors currently in the program, millions are paying more for \ntheir drugs than they were under the previous coverage. This includes \nthousands of seniors in Nevada who face more restrictions and higher \ncosts. Millions more seniors were wrongly dropped from the system, \nleaving them without coverage for the life-saving drugs.\n  I had the opportunity, this morning, to meet with the Governors. They \nare terribly concerned because of this legislation being so poorly \nmanaged and, frankly, poorly written. The States have had to advance \ntheir hard-earned moneys to pay for the drug coverage of people who \nsimply are cut off. They want to know when they are going to be \nreimbursed.\n  What about the President's incompetence in the war on terror?\n  In 2002, Osama bin Laden was trapped in the mountains of Afghanistan.\n  But instead of redoubling our resources to capture him, the President \nshifted to Saddam Hussein, and bin Laden was left to fight another day. \nAs a result, the al-Qaida leader continues to plot and threaten us as \nwe speak.\n  Meanwhile, terrorist attacks across the globe are up sharply over the \nlast 5 years, and al-Qaida has morphed into a global terror franchise.\n  Government reform. What has the President done? President Bush \npromised to create a new tone in Washington. He has, but it hasn't been \na pleasant tone. His incompetence has created the biggest culture of \ncorruption our Nation has ever seen, with scandals in the House, the \nSenate, and the White House, and the country is paying a price for this \ncorruption: higher gas prices, higher health care costs, and deficits \nyear after year. Every Bush budget has broken a record of paying a \nhigher deficit than the year before. But the problem is that he keeps \nbreaking his own record.\n  It is difficult for me to comprehend how my friends on the other side \nof the aisle can allow this to go on. We were told by Alan Greenspan, \nwhen we were in the majority, that the deficit was the most important \nthing facing this country. So we did something about it--the Budget \nDeficit Reduction Act of 1993--and not a single Republican voted for it \nin the House or the Senate. Vice President Gore had to break the tie in \nthe Senate. In the last 3 years of the Clinton administration, less \nmoney was being spent than we were taking in. We retired the debt by \nabout a half trillion dollars. That certainly has not been the case \nduring the Bush years.\n  Whether we like it or not, President George W. Bush will be President \nfor the next 2\\1/2\\ years. We need him to govern competently. We cannot \nafford more of what we have seen since 2001. So today I offer three \nissues: The port security issue, Iraq, and Katrina--these are only \nthree--where President Bush can work with us in order to turn his \nrecord into a record of progress and competence.\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\n  First, our ports. Now, the President said he would not allow any \nlegislation to go forward; he would veto it. Of course, there has been \na change of tone because even Michael Savage--I was in Reno and I \nwanted to listen to the news, and I flipped it on about 10 to 9 or 8--I \ndon't remember the hour. Michael Savage was on. I never listen to him. \nI heard a lot about him, so listened. He spent that 10 minutes berating \nthe President. Michael Savage does not very often do that. It is not \nonly Michael Savage, but everybody in America is so upset about this \nport situation. Their decision to outsource our ports to Dubai shows \nthey still don't understand the realities that exist in this world.\n  How in the world was the decision made to give another country \ncontrol of our ports? It is not another company but another country \nthat will be taking care of our ports. That is a state-owned company. \nThe administration's decisionmaking process could not be more flawed. \nOn the one hand, we have Secretary of Treasury Snow, who I am told from \nhis CFX retirement got about $100 million, being asked to rule on this. \nPart of his CFX responsibility was CFX's involvement in ports. He was \nthe one who made the final signoff on this, not Chertoff. This was not \na security issue; it was a business issue. I am sorry to say that any \ntime in this administration when it is business versus security, \nbusiness wins.\n  No effort was made to brief Congress, relevant States, or the port \nauthorities. The decision seems to have ignored the truth about Dubai, \none of the seven city states of the United Arab Emirates. Of course, we \nare told now that the United Arab Emirates wants to be a friend of the \nUnited States. Everybody knows we need more friends in the world, that \nis for sure. But we cannot ignore the historical connection of the \nUnited Arab Emirates to terrorism and the proliferation of terrorism. \nThe United Arab Emirates was only one of three nations in the world to \nrecognize the government of the Taliban, the government which allowed \nOsama bin Laden and al-Qaida development.\n  The 9/11 Commission found that UAE represented a persistent counter-\nterrorism problem for the United States. Terrorism money has been \nlaundered through UAE, and 11 of the hijackers flew from Dubai to the \nUnited States in preparation for the attacks.\n  Bin Laden's operatives are said to have used Dubai as a logistical \nhub after 9/11. In 2004, it was exposed that Dubai was the center of \nthe world's largest nuclear weapons proliferation ring, as the AQ Khan \nnetwork used Dubai to traffic nuclear weapons technology to the highest \nbidders.\n  Finally, according to Freedom House, a nonpartisan and highly \nrespected organization often cited by the Bush administration, the \nUnited Arab Emirates is not free, not democratic, and has been found to \nengage in human trafficking and forced child labor. So, of course, we \nneed them to be our ally. I think they can be our ally on a range of \nissues, but right now we better stop and look at what we are doing.\n  There are significant national security considerations involved in \nthis deal that have never been considered by the President. They must \nbe considered in the post-9/11 world. That is what the law and our \nNation's security require. After fumbling this process so badly, the \nPresident decided yesterday to accept the company's 45-day \ninvestigation of the port sale.\n  While this is a good first step, the administration's consistent \ninvolvement in this, which has not been positive, makes me skeptical. \nThere is no indication that they will do better in 45 days than they \ndid in 14.\n  The lesson of 9/11 is that we cannot leave any stone unturned. So I \ncall upon this administration to take three steps concerning our ports \nand this sale, in particular. First, during the next 45 days, I urge \nthe President to take a hard look at the national security implications \nof this arrangement. He cannot leave this decision to under secretaries \nand deputies. He needs to get involved and provide leadership.\n  Second, he needs to work with Congress to fix the review process. We \nneed to make sure that all future sales of critical infrastructure go \nunder an automatic 45-day review, and that the President personally \nsigns off on deals such as this, and that Congress is kept informed \nthroughout the process.\n  Finally, there is something else the President needs to do with our \nports: Make a real commitment to port security. We have known for years \nhow vulnerable our ports are. Only 5 percent of the containers coming \ninto this country are inspected. For years, we have tried to make them \nmore secure. Unfortunately, every time we bring a measure to the floor, \nit is defeated on a party-line vote. They have fought us every step of \nthe way, going as far as eliminating grants to port security in next \nyear's budget.\n  If the President is serious about protecting our ports, he will \nreconsider this decision and join with Democrats to do everything we \ncan to keep our ports safe.\n  The President's second chance to turn incompetence into progress \ncomes in Iraq. To be successful in Iraq, there must be victory on three \nfronts: the security front, the political front, and the economic or \nreconstruction front. Unfortunately, on all three fronts there is only \nincompetence by the administration right now.\n  On the security front, we have gone from having one Iraqi battalion \ncapable of operating independently to zero. We have gone backward. Our \ntroops and our generals are performing bravely, doing their job with \nhonor every day. Unfortunately, they have been let down by our civilian \nleaders time and time again. The political leaders of this \nadministration didn't have a plan to win the peace. They sent our \ntroops into battle without the equipment they needed. According to Paul \nBremer, Provincial Governor of Iraq, in his book, this administration \ndenied the military's request to put more troops on the ground so we \ncould control Baghdad and Iraq's borders. We know that General Shinseki \nsaid we would need more than 200,000 troops. He was fired. We know \nLarry Lindsay, who was the President's chief economic adviser, said the \nwar would cost us $100 billion. He was fired.\n  The political front has been mired by similar incompetence. To \nachieve political victory, we need the Iraqi people to work together, \nbut the raging violence between the Shia and Sunnis last week shows how \nfar we are from that goal.\n  President Bush cannot fulfill his responsibilities simply by placing \na periodic phone call to the Iraqi leadership. He needs to be \npersonally involved. The job of bringing all the factions together has \nbeen delegated to our fine Ambassador on the ground. The Secretary of \nState was in the region last week, but she apparently didn't have time \nto stop in Iraq and impress upon the Iraqi leadership the importance of \ncoming together to form a government.\n  On the reconstruction front, things are just as bleak. The Iraqi \npeople still lack basic infrastructure. We don't know how many Iraqis \nare getting drinkable water. Their oil and electrical output continues \nto decline, and it is lower than before the war started. On \nreconstruction, only $3 billion has been delivered. The money has been \nspent, mired in fraud, with teams of Justice Department lawyers \ninvestigating contractor fraud and crimes by Americans running this \ncivil authority.\n  It is long past time for President Bush to come forward with a \nstrategy to complete the mission in Iraq. We are losing ground on the \nthree key fronts: economic, military, and political. The window of \nopportunity for the Iraqi people and this administration to get things \nright grows smaller every day.\n  If the President is serious about our security, he will identify a \nstrategy for achieving the remaining objectives that must be met in \nIraq. We will pay a real price if the incompetence continues in Iraq. \nAs the New York Times reported Friday, leaders across the Middle East \nfear that violence could spread from Iraq across the entire region. The \nPresident must get a handle on Iraq and do it now.\n  On these three issues and other issues, we reach out to the \nPresident. We are willing to work with the President, but he must \nunderstand that it cannot be only his way; we have to work together. If \nwe do this, we can have a better country.\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/27/senate-section/article/S1493-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1493-S1495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING THE ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about this \nadministration, the administration of George W. Bush. Unless there is a \nsignificant turnaround, this administration will not be remembered for \nits accomplishments. It, in fact, will be remembered for its \nincompetence. And this dangerous incompetence has made America less \nsecure.\n  From Social Security to border security, the American people know \nthat incompetence lies at the heart of this administration's failures. \nUltimately, this incompetence has come with a price. It has made our \ncountry less safe and less secure.\n  We can talk about a lot of things, but this afternoon I will talk \nabout a few. Let's talk about the prescription drug program. I support \na Medicare drug benefit, but this administration has botched the \nprogram so badly that relatively no one has signed up for it. The \nPresident, in his Saturday address, said 25 million Americans have \nsigned up for this program.\n  That is simply not true. Twenty of those twenty-five million, prior \nto this legislation passing, already had prescription drug benefits. \nAnd now, under this program, they have a lot less than they had before. \nSo after all this talk, there are a few million new people who have \nsigned up, and tens of millions of people are still left trying to \nfigure out what to do and how to do it.\n  Of the seniors currently in the program, millions are paying more for \ntheir drugs than they were under the previous coverage. This includes \nthousands of seniors in Nevada who face more restrictions and higher \ncosts. Millions more seniors were wrongly dropped from the system, \nleaving them without coverage for the life-saving drugs.\n  I had the opportunity, this morning, to meet with the Governors. They \nare terribly concerned because of this legislation being so poorly \nmanaged and, frankly, poorly written. The States have had to advance \ntheir hard-earned moneys to pay for the drug coverage of people who \nsimply are cut off.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2271, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2271) to clarify that individuals who receive \n     FISA orders can challenge nondisclosure requirements, that \n     individuals who receive national security letters are not \n     required to disclose the name of their attorney, that \n     libraries are not wire or electronic communication service \n     providers unless they provide specific services, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Frist amendment No. 2895, to establish the enactment date \n     of the Act.\n       Frist amendment No. 2896 (to amendment No. 2895), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, as we begin the debate and discussion \non the USA PATRIOT Act, I urge my colleagues to invoke cloture to cut \noff debate tomorrow when the vote is scheduled at 2:30, and then \nproceed to pass the PATRIOT Act.\n  The PATRIOT Act was passed by the Congress and signed into law by the \nPresident shortly after September 11, 2001, to provide additional tools \nfor law enforcement, and it was reviewed extensively by the Committee \non the Judiciary, which I chair, last year; and the Judiciary Committee \ncame out with a unanimous report, with all 18 members on the committee \nconcurring in the final product.\n  We considered this a unique, if not remarkable event, considering \nthat our Judiciary Committee has people at all positions on the \npolitical spectrum. So to have unanimous agreement was, we thought, \nquite an accomplishment. When the matter came to the floor of the \nSenate, it was passed by unanimous consent, which again was unique, if \nnot remarkable, in that on a matter as complex and controversial as the \nPATRIOT Act all of the Senators were in agreement that it should be \nenacted.\n  We then went to conference with the House of Representatives and, as \nexpected, the House had different views than what the Senate had in \nmind. But we worked through in a collegial way with Chairman \nSensenbrenner and others on the House side and came to a conference \nreport which we submitted to the Senate.\n  We fell short of having enough votes to impose cloture when \nobjections were reached to a number of provisions which had been \nincluded in the conference report.\n  There have since been some changes made in the legislation which is \npending before the Senate. I compliment my colleagues, Senator Sununu, \nSenator Craig, Senator Murkowski, who is presiding today, and Senator \nHagel, for a number of additions which led those four Republican \nSenators who had not voted for cloture to find the PATRIOT Act \nacceptable, taking the conference report and making these additions.\n  It is our expectation that there will be a number of Democrats, I \nthink most of whom oppose cloture, so we have an expectation of \nreceiving 60 votes tomorrow to be able to move the bill ahead.\n  The changes which were made as a result of these modifications \nprovide for explicit judicial review of a section 215 nondisclosure \norder, a provision to remove from the conference report the requirement \nthat a person inform the FBI of the identity of an attorney to whom \ndisclosure was made or will be made to obtain legal advice or legal \nassistance with respect to a national security letter, and an \nadditional provision to clarify current law that libraries that have \nbeen functioning in their traditional roles, including providing \nInternet access, are not subject to section 2709 national security \nletters.\n  These changes were, in my opinion, not major but helpful in the sense \nthey have satisfied a number of Senators, I think, and are very \nconstructive and enable us to move forward, which I expect will enable \nus to obtain cloture.\n  With the revised bill which is now before the Senate for a cloture \nvote tomorrow, it is my hope my colleagues will cut off debate, invoke \ncloture, and let us move ahead to the passage of the PATRIOT Act. It is \nnot a bill to my precise satisfaction, but in the Congress of the \nunited States, we reach accommodations and we reach compromises. My \npreference would have been to have the Senate bill enacted, but there \nwere significant concessions made on both sides, especially by the \nHouse of Representatives, in agreeing to a 4-year sunset provision.\n  What I intend to do tomorrow is to propose additional legislation in \nthis field which would take the current bill with the improvements made \nby Senator Sununu and his group and add a number of additional \nsafeguards on civil liberties which will improve the bill even further, \nin my opinion, and to consider that on additional legislation in the \nSenate.\n  In so doing, I fully realize we will have to go through the \nlegislative process. We will have hearings in the Judiciary Committee. \nWe will make this the subject of oversight on what the law enforcement \nofficials, specifically the FBI, will be doing, and we will ultimately, \nhopefully, report out of the Judiciary Committee a bill with the \nprovisions which I am now about to enumerate which will, if successful \nin conference and to be signed by the President into law, return the \nbill to its form which passed the Judiciary Committee unanimously last \nyear and passed the Senate unanimously.\n  The provisions in the bill which I will introduce tomorrow--I wanted \nto give my colleagues notice of what I intend to do--would be a \nprovision, first, on the notice on search warrants to require that the \ntarget receive notification of the execution of a delayed notice search \nwarrant within 7 days as the Senate-passed PATRIOT Act provided. The \nconference report provides for notice within 30 days, which was a \nsignificant compromise when the House of Representatives moved from 180 \ndays to 30 days and the Senate moved from 7 days to 30 days, but it \ncontinues to be my view that the 7-day requirement is the best \nrequirement.\n  The bill will further provide that section 215 will have the Senate-\npassed three-part test which will require a statement of facts \naccompanying an application to show that the records sought, first, \npertained to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, second, \nrelevant to the activities of a suspected agent of a foreign power who \nis the subject of an authorized investigation, or three, pertain to an \nindividual in contact with a suspected agent of a foreign power.\n  I will put in the Record a memo detailing the differences between the \nSenate bill and the House bill and the conference report.\n  This provision goes to the heart of strenuous objections raised by \npeople who filibustered the bill who objected to a fourth provision \nwhich gave the judge discretion to allow for a court order if there \nwere a terrorism investigation involved generally which did not have \none of this three-part test.\n  My view is that the three-part test is decisively preferable, \nalthough I do think in the spirit of compromise on our bicameral \nlegislation, having the discretion of the judge to authorize the order \nif he found it warranted in light of the terrorism investigation was \nacceptable. This is preferable, and this will be included in the new \nbill to be introduced.\n  A third change will provide for judicial review of national security \nletters to eliminate the conclusive presumption in the conference \nreport on the national security letter provision. The bill removes the \nability of the Government to prevent judicial review of the \nnondisclosure requirement if it certifies in good faith that \n``disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States or \ninterfere with diplomatic relations.''\n  This provision in the conference report was identical with what \npassed the Judiciary Committee unanimously and was adopted unanimously \nby the Senate. Those who have objected to this conclusive presumption \nsay it was overlooked and that on further consideration they objected \nto it.\n  Upon additional analysis, it is my view this conclusive presumption \nis better out of the report, which gives the court the discretion to \nallow for the judicial review of these national security letters.\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\n  A fourth provision involves judicial review of the section 215 order \nnondisclosure requirement and it eliminates the mandatory 1-year \nwaiting period for judicial review of nondisclosure requirement on 215 \norders. The additions by Senator Sununu and his colleagues provide for \na 1-year waiting period. My own view is it is preferable there not be a \nwaiting period at all, that the court have the discretion to enter the \norders immediately if it finds cause to do so.\n  The fifth provision of the legislation which I intend to introduce \ntomorrow adds a 4-year sunset to the national security letter with \nauthorities created in the conference report so that the bill provides \nthat on December 31, 2009, the law governing national security letters \nwill be returned to what it was in February of the year 2006.\n  Here again we have a situation where the PATRIOT Act did not deal \nwith national security letters, but this, again, is a tightening up of \nthe bill to provide additional safeguards for civil liberties.\n  So what we have here, in essence, is the Senate bill which passed the \ncommittee unanimously and the Senate unanimously was then modified by a \nconference report which, to repeat--I don't like to do it, but it is \nworth a summary--I found acceptable; not as good as the Senate bill but \nacceptable. Then we have these three provisions added by Senator Sununu \nand his group--again giving them credit--which has made it acceptable \nto those four Republican Senators and I believe enough Democrats to get \nthe 60 votes, perhaps additional votes, to be able to submit the bill \nto the House of Representatives for its consideration and, hopefully, \nultimate passage to be signed by the President, which is an acceptable \nbill; again, not as good as the Senate bill but acceptable.\n  I want my colleagues who oppose the bill in the form submitted for \ncloture tomorrow to know that if the issue is not concluded, I will be \nintroducing legislation which will bring back the original Senate bill \nwith some additional improvements, and between now and tomorrow, we \nwill be soliciting cosponsors to see if others will choose to support \nthis bill which, as I say, returns the essentials of the Senate bill \nwith some improvements. The commitment is made in my capacity as \nchairman that we will proceed to have oversight hearings, that the \nDirector of the FBI is due in on March 29. He will be questioned about \nthese specific provisions, asked for justification for the more \nrestrictive provisions which are in the conference report, plus the \nprovisions by Senator Sununu and his colleagues, and there will be \ncontinuing oversight in the interim.\n  We will have hearings on the legislation which I intend to introduce \ntomorrow, looking toward the prospect of ultimately passing it, if it \nis passed by the Senate and if it is submitted to the House in \nconference and that turns out to be the bicameral will of the two \nbodies.\n  I do believe that where we are now with the conference report and the \nadditions, we have an acceptable bill--not as good as it could be--and \nwe will attempt to perfect it even more as I have outlined.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation which I intend \nto introduce tomorrow be printed in the Record so my colleagues can see \nit, together with the memorandum which I described in the course of my \ndiscussion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. __\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The bill is based, in \n     part, on the amendments that Senator Feingold attempted to \n     introduce during the PATRIOT Act debates of the week of \n     February 13, 2006. Your bill will accomplish the following:\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\n       Delayed Notice Search Warrants: Requires that the target \n     receive notification of the execution of a delayed notice \n     search warrant within 7 days, as did the Senate passed \n     PATRIOT Act. The Conference Report provides for notice within \n     30 days as a compromise with the House, which passed an 180-\n     day delay in its bill.\n       Section 215: Implements the Senate-passed ``three-part \n     test'' to obtain a section 215 order. Thus, the bill will \n     require the statement of facts accompanying an application to \n     show that the records sought: (1) pertain to a foreign power \n     or an agent of a foreign power; (2) are relevant to the \n     activities of a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the \n     subject of an authorized investigation, or (3) pertain to an \n     individual in contact with a suspected agent of a foreign \n     power. A memo detailing the differences between the Senate \n     bill, the House bill, and the Conference Report is attached.\n       Judicial Review of National Security Letters: Eliminates \n     the ``conclusive presumption'' in the Conference Report's NSL \n     provision. The bill removes the ability of the government to \n     prevent judicial review of the nondisclosure requirement if \n     it certifies, in good faith, that ``disclosure may endanger \n     the national security of the United States or interfere with \n     diplomatic relations.''\n       Judicial Review of Section 215 order nondisclosure \n     requirement: Eliminates the conclusive presumption and the \n     mandatory one-year waiting period for judicial review of the \n     non-disclosure requirement on 215 orders.\n       Sunsets on National Security Letters: Adds a four-year \n     sunset to the National Security Letter authorities created in \n     the Conference Report. Thus, the bill provides that on \n     December 31, 2009, the law governing NSL's will be returned \n     to what it was in February 2006.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, in the absence of any Senator on the \nfloor seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor to comment on the \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act and to voice my support for the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  I also want to take a few moments to compliment my colleagues, \nSenator Sununu and Senator Craig, for their very hard work over the \ncourse of these last few weeks making these amendments possible.\n  I also want to recognize Senators Hagel, Durbin, Salazar, and \nFeingold for the bipartisan approach which we were able to take in \naddressing this issue.\n  I know the changes that were agreed to do not address all of the \nconcerns of the Senator from Wisconsin before we went on recess, nor do \nthey address all of my concerns. But I want to make sure that the \nSenator is aware of how much I appreciate his leadership on this issue.\n  There are a number of Members within this body who did not share our \nopposition to the conference report when it was first reported out, and \nthere are many, on the hand, who would have liked to have seen the \nconference report expand the powers granted to the executive branch \nunder the PATRIOT Act. That is certainly their prerogative and their \nright to advocate that position. It is not a position I agree with, \nunless we have adequate safeguards that can be put in place to provide \na reasonable level of judicial oversight.\n  I want to be clear on a couple of points regarding my earlier \nopposition to the conference report.\n  First, it is not my desire to repeal the PATRIOT Act in its entirety \nnor to allow the authorization provided in the 16 provisions we are \nconsidering to expire.\n  If that was my intent, if that is what I had hoped to do, it would \nhave been a pretty simple task to object to any language coming out of \nthe conference--to have objected to the language that unanimously \npassed the Senate in July. But that wasn't the case. Those of us who \nvoiced objection to the earlier draft of the conference report just \ndidn't say: No, we don't like it. We didn't say that. We didn't say \nthat we opposed it entirely. We said we offered up the specific \nexamples of changes to the conference report that we needed to see in \norder to support it. It was truly our desire to improve the conference \nreport--not to kill it.\n  I commend the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nSpecter, who was on the floor earlier, for his efforts to represent the \nviews which we had expressed in conference. The senior Senator from \nPennsylvania clearly hasn't had much time to take a breather lately, \nbut he was a tough negotiator. He was able to squeeze some additional \nchanges out of the conferees, most notably the shorter sunshine \ntimeframe for section 216, roving wiretaps, and the lone-wolf \nprovision.\n  Unfortunately, the House and the administration refused to consider \nour other concerns.\n  There have been some who have asked me: You got the sunset \nprovisions. Wasn't that the primary issue? Why the continued \nopposition?\n  For some, the sunset provisions were the primary issue. But that was \nnot necessarily the case for our group, and that was not necessarily my \nprimary concern.\n  When we introduced the SAFE Act last April--that is the legislation \nwhich was sponsored by Senators Craig and Durbin and cosponsored by \nmany of us--the SAFE Act did not contain any sunsets. We were prepared \nto make permanent each of the 16 provisions in question today.\n\n  What we were seeking, instead, was language that would create a level \nof judicial review and public disclosure that would head off any \npotential abuse and unnecessary infringement on individual freedoms.\n  Now, it has been said by some that those seeking changes to the \nPATRIOT Act have not been able to point to any case of abuse to support \ntheir cause. And that may be the case. But do we have to wait for that \nabuse to happen? I would prefer we put safeguards in place now, not \nafterwards, safeguards that continue to allow our law enforcement and \nintelligence officers to obtain the information they need for the \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  Now, in particular, I was, and I remain, concerned about the presumed \nrelevance standard under a section 215 order. With the increased power \nunder the PATRIOT Act to obtain ``any tangible item'' from any entity, \nit would also seem appropriate that the government have a greater \nresponsibility to demonstrate its rationale for seeking those terms. \nWhile the conference report improves upon the current statute py \nrequiring in most cases some connection or contact with a foreign power \nor an agent of a foreign power, I am concerned the presumed relevance \nlanguage significantly diminishes the judicial oversight the Senate-\npassed bill provided.\n  While I remain concerned about this standard, I am pleased that what \nhas been agreed to is the explicit judicial review of a section 215 gag \norder--a right that previously was not clearly available to recipients. \nNow, this does not address all of my section 215 concerns. I do have \nmore. But it does remain an improvement over the conference report and \nover current law.\n  I was also pleased that language was agreed to that permits a \nnational security letter to be served on a library only if that library \nis acting as a wire or electronic communications service provider. I \nhave noticed some have been critical of the language that is included \nin this amendments act, saying: Well, you still have the ability to go \nafter the libraries. But, again, I will stress, it permits a national \nsecurity letter to be served on a library only if that library is \nacting as a wire or electronic communications service provider. So the \nfact they may happen to offer their library patrons the use of the \nInternet does not make them a wire or electronic communications service \nprovider. This language that is incorporated in the amendments act was \npart of legislation I had introduced in 2003 in an effort to modify the \nPATRIOT Act. I believe it is an important protection for our Nation's \nlibraries.\n  I know this is not the last debate we will have on the PATRIOT Act, \nnor is it likely the last piece of legislation we will consider on the \nsubject. Some of the provisions we see--the continued sunset provisions \nfor section 215, the roving wiretaps, and the lone wolf provision--\nassure us of that. But earlier, about a half an hour ago, on the floor, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee came to the floor and spoke of \nlegislation he will be introducing tomorrow.\n  As I was listening to the chairman--and I obviously have not looked \nat the legislation as of yet, but I understand\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\nfrom his comments it is essentially his purpose with this legislation \nto go back to the language we had in that legislation that passed \nunanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and passed \nunanimously out of this body--provisions he has detailed as they relate \nto search warrants, the strengthening of section 215, a 4-year sunset \non NSLs, and NSL judicial review. So I will anxiously await the \nopportunity to review that legislation Chairman Specter has indicated \njust this afternoon will be available to us.\n  I am encouraged, once again, we will be able to look at those areas \nwhere I and others have been very concerned that we have not provided \nadequately for that balance between providing our law enforcement the \ntools they need while, at the same time, maintaining the individual \nliberties we as Americans expect and certainly deserve. So, as I \nindicated, I look forward to reviewing that legislation.\n  But the legislation we are considering today--the conference report--\nI believe has made improvements on the original product of the PATRIOT \nAct, and so with passage of the additional protections, it is my \nintention to vote for cloture on the PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Republican leadership has made a \nmistake and is abusing its power by choking off debate on this \nimportant bill. Regrettably the majority leader has chosen to prevent \nany effort to offer amendments to the bill and has effectively stifled \nopen debate. While I voted to proceed to consideration of the bill, I \ndo not condone the Republican leadership's current abuse.\n  I have filed an amendment that would improve the bill by correcting \none of the most egregious ``police state'' provisions regarding gag \norders. The Bush-Cheney administration used the last round of \ndiscussions with Republican Senators to make the gag order provisions \nworse, in my view, by forbidding any court challenge for 1 year. The \nconference report places no similar restriction on recipients of \nnational security letters, and there is no justification for its \ninclusion here.\n  In addition, the bill continues and cements into law procedures that, \nin my view, unfairly determine legitimate challenges to gag orders. It \nallows the Government to ensure itself of victory by certifying that, \nin its view, disclosure ``may'' endanger national security or ``may'' \ninterfere with diplomatic relations. Unless the Government is acting in \nbad faith, the court must accept the certification as conclusive and \nmust rule in favor of the Government.\n  This is the type of provision to which I have never agreed. The \nconference report uses identical language in connection with NSL gag \norders, and I resisted it in that context. I agreed with Senator \nSununu, who said in December that it would prevent meaningful judicial \nreview because NSL recipients would never be able to show bad faith on \nthe part of the Federal Government. Senator Specter has also been \ncritical of this provision.\n  My amendment would have corrected these unnecessary excesses. It \nstruck both the 1-year waiting period for challenging a gag order and \nthe ``conclusive presumption'' in favor of the Government. These \nchanges are simple but they are essential if we are to avoid creating \nrigged procedures where the Government always wins, regardless of the \nmerits.\n  By its abuse of the rules, the Republican leadership is preventing \nany opportunity to correct these matters. That is wrong. The Senate may \nhave accepted or rejected my effort to remove this un-American \nrestraint on meaningful judicial review of gag orders, but I should \nhave had the opportunity to offer it.\n  In the weeks following 9/11, some of us worked hard in cooperation \nwith the Bush-Cheney administration on what came to be the USA PATRIOT \nAct. I remind the current Republican leadership that even then, in \nthose extraordinary times, we allowed Senators to offer amendments. We \ntook difficult votes. I would have liked to have supported some of \nthose amendments but, in my role as the chair of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I felt that I could not at that time. But I did not and the \nmajority leader, Senator Daschle, did not fill the amendment ``tree'' \nwith sham amendments. Instead, we worked out an agreement to proceed \nwith amendments and votes on those amendments.\n\n  In 2001, I fought for time to provide some balance to Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft's demands that the Bush-Cheney administration's \nantiterrorism bill be enacted in a week. We worked hard for 6 weeks to \nmake that bill better and were able to include the sunset provisions \nthat contributed to reconsideration of several provisions over the last \nseveral months. Last year I worked with Chairman Specter and all the \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate to pass a \nreauthorization bill in July. As we proceeded in House-Senate \nconference on the measure, the Bush-Cheney administration and \ncongressional Republicans locked Democratic conferees out of their \ndeliberations and wrote the final bill. That was wrong.\n  Last December, working with a bipartisan group of Senators, we were \nable to urge reconsideration of that final bill. Senators Sununu and \nCraig were able to use that opportunity to make some improvements. I \ncommend them for what they were able to achieve and hope that my \nsupport for their efforts has been helpful. I wish that along the way \nthe Bush-Cheney administration had shown interest in working together \nto get to the best law we could for the American people.\n  Since the House-Senate conference was hijacked, I have tried to get \nthis measure back on the right track. We have been able to achieve some \nimprovements. I regret that this bill is not better and that the \nintransigence of the Bush-Cheney administration has prevented a better \nbalance and better protections for the American people. Just as I \nworked for an opportunity for Senator Sununu to seek improvements to \nthe conference report, I will now vote against these unfair efforts to \nforestall any amendments to this measure. I remain committed to working \nto provide the tools that we need to protect the American people. That \nincludes working to provide the oversight and checks needed on the uses \nof Government power and to improve the reauthorization of the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  In light of the abuse being perpetrated by the Republican leadership, \nI will vote against their stifling of meaningful debate and their \nobstruction of efforts to improve the bill, the conference report and \nthe PATRIOT Act. I will vote against cloture on the bill without any \nopportunity to offer amendments. I urge the Republican leadership to \nreconsider its actions and allow a few amendments to be offered to the \nbill so that we can seek to improve it before final passage by the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Today, I would like to take the opportunity to honor the \ncontributions of African Americans, particularly since this year marks \nthe 80th anniversary of historian and scholar Carter G. Woodson's \nlaunch of Negro History Week in 1926. Since then, the contributions of \nAfrican Americans to American history have been recognized and \ncelebrated, and February has been designated ``Black History Month.''\n  I especially want to pay tribute to Mrs. Rosa Parks and Mrs. Coretta \nScott King, the mother and the first lady, respectively, of the modern \ncivil rights movement, who inspired ordinary African Americans to \ndemand equal rights as American citizens. Their recent deaths remind \nus, during this month in particular, to take the time to reflect on the \nvital heritage and important contributions of African Americans.\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\n  This year also marks what would have been Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr.'s 77th birthday, and it is important that we continue to honor the \nvalues of faith, compassion, courage, truth, and justice that guided \nhis dream for America. We have made great progress, especially in the \narea of racial justice, but we still haven't reached the Promised Land. \nIf he were alive today, what would Dr. King, leader of the civil rights \nmovement and the Poor People's Campaign, say about the fact that one in \nfive American children are living in poverty today? What would he say \nabout the fact that here, in the wealthiest Nation on Earth, 45 million \npeople have no health insurance and millions more are underinsured?\n  What would Asa Philip Randolph, the labor leader who organized the \nPullman car porters and fought against discrimination and segregation \nin the Armed Forces, say about the growing income inequality in America \nand the fact that corporate profits have increased 50 percent in the \nlast 5 years--but low wage workers haven't had a raise in 7 years \nbecause the Congress of the United States refuses to raise the minimum \nwage? A parent who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year for minimum \nwage today doesn't even earn enough to lift herself and her child out \nof poverty. Would Asa Randolph call that progress? Would he call that \njustice?\n  What would Fannie Lou Hamer, a civil rights activist who fought for \nlow-income housing, school desegregation, and daycare, have said if she \nhad seen the pictures of people stranded on rooftops in New Orleans and \nleft homeless by Katrina in Biloxi, Pearl River, and so many other \ncommunities throughout the gulf coast? I suspect she would ask the same \nquestions we all asked: How could this happen in America? In 2005?\n  This year, America lost Rosa Parks, the mother of the civil rights \nmovement. Many others of those who marched and worked with her have \npassed on as well. How do those of us who believe in their dream keep \nit alive? We keep it alive by continuing the fight begun by them and by \nremembering and acting on what Dr. King said: America has no second- or \nthird-class citizens. We should all have an equal voice, and an equal \nchance to succeed.\n  Yes, we have made progress in some areas. I think Charles Hamilton \nHouston, civil rights attorney who as a faculty member at Howard \nUniversity prepared Thurgood Marshall to argue cases against \ndiscrimination, would be pleased to see my colleague from Illinois--the \nson of a Kenyan father and Kansan mother--serving in the U.S. Senate. I \nthink he would have smiled in sad approval as he saw Rosa Parks lay in \nhonor in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol--one of the highest honors we \ncan accord a person and one she so rightly deserved. I think Mr. \nHouston would be pleased that at least one of the murderers of James \nChaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman has finally been \nconvicted of that horrible deed. Dr. King would also approve of the \nfact that the U.S. Senate finally, finally last year, condemned \nlynching.\n  I think another civil rights leader, John Jones, the first African \nAmerican to hold elective office in Illinois, would also approve of the \nfact that 81 percent of African Americans aged 25 and older had at \nleast a high school diploma, an increase from less than 1 in 5 in the \n1950s. Today, African Americans own 1.2 million businesses that \ngenerate $69.8 billion or about $735,586 per firm. Mr. Jones would also \nbe proud to hear that 60 percent of African Americans age 18 and older \nvoted in the 2004 Presidential election, which equaled 14 million \nvoters.\n  Yes, African Americans have made great achievements, but Dr. King \nwould also remind us that we have further to go. One example is \nGeorgia's new voter-identification law, which was approved over the \nobjections of noncareer lawyers at the Department of Justice who warned \nthat the plan would unfairly disenfranchise minority voters. Therefore, \nin the spirit of Dr. King's message of equality and racial justice, we \nneed to reauthorize and strengthen the Voting Rights Act--with all of \nits sections--this year.\n  Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, those in the civil rights movement \nworked to secure basic civil rights and voting rights in statute. The \ncost for those in the movement was high: church burnings, bombings, \nshootings, and beatings. I walked in those same footsteps during my \nrecent pilgrimage with U.S. Representative John Lewis to Selma and \nMontgomery, AL. It is important that we recognize the contributions of \nthese extraordinary people because the legacy they left behind is an \nexpression of important American values--equality, nondiscrimination, \nfairness, and ensuring the full participation of everyone in our \nsociety. Therefore, I celebrate this month with pride and reflection, \nknowing that although we have come a long way, we still have a great \ndistance to go in order to fulfill our Nation's ideals of equality and \nequal opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/27/senate-section/article/S1499-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1499-S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REPORT ON FOREIGN TRAVEL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to report on a \ntrip I made to Europe and the Mideast during the holiday recess, \nDecember 22 to December 31, 2005. The trip included stops in Brussels, \nBelgium; Tallinn, Estonia; Amman, Jordan; Baghdad, Iraq; Tel Aviv, \nIsrael and Frankfurt, Germany.\n  This trip enabled me to learn about the important transformations \ncountries in Eastern and Western Europe are making as we enter the 20th \ncentury and away from the Cold War era. Additionally, my travels \nthrough the Mideast provided me tremendous insight into the evolving \npolitical structure of the region as well as the United States' \nprogress on the war on terror.\n  Prior to my departure many interesting and significant events \noccurred which helped shape the focus of my travels including: the \neventual extension of the PATRIOT Act, the successful elections in \nIraq, the New York Times disclosure of domestic eavesdropping and the \ntight fiscal budget constraints placed on the Fiscal Year 2006 \nappropriations process. The broader implications of these events were \nissues which I frequently encountered in my travels.\n  The first full day of my trip, December 23, 2005, began in Brussels, \nBelgium where I met with a number of members of two of the three U.S. \nMissions in Belgium: the U.S. Mission to the European Union, and \nofficials from the U.S. Embassy in Belgium. The briefing was provided \nby: Will Imbrie, DCM; Ted Andrews, POL; Mike McKinley, Deputy Head of \nthe U.S. Mission to the E.U.; Lee Litzenberger, Political Minister \nCounselor--U.S. Mission to the E.U.; and Dale Bendler, Special Adviser \nto the Ambassador. The discussions focused on a number of issues \nincluding the war on terror, war crimes, NATO and perceptions of \nPresident Bush by Belgians. Ambassador Korologus's staff briefed me on \nhis efforts to build a strong transatlantic relationship between the \nUnited States, the European Union, Belgium and NATO. I found it \ninteresting that Belgium is the 14th largest trade partner of the \nUnited States and that the country is making a substantial contribution \nto the war on terror financially. I support Ambassador Korologus's \nefforts and look forward to working with him and his staff in the \nfuture.\n  Mike McKinley informed me that Belgians are unhappy with the war in \nIraq and that they see a difference with the war waged in Afghanistan. \nIt is perceived that the United Nations support of the war in \nAfghanistan, as opposed to Iraq, is the reason the country has sent \ntroops to Afghanistan as well as the horrendous acts of terrorism on 9/\n11. Mr. McKinley also informed me that the European countries, through \nthe EU, will make significant contributions to the rebuilding of \nAfghanistan--5 billion euros over a 5-year period. Mr. Imbrie stated \nthat the perception of President Bush in Belgium has improved not as a \nresult of his most recent speeches, but because of the clear success of \nelections in Iraq.\n  Mr. McKinley also briefed me on the strong relationship the European \nUnion has with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with 19 members \nof the E.U. also a part of the 25 nations in NATO. Mr. Imbrie discussed \nthe transformation which is being attempted with NATO, forcing its \nmember countries to acknowledge that a threat within the NATO states is \nless likely than the threat of terrorism which exists from outside. The \ntransformation also asks countries to be postured in such a way that \ndeployment of support is quick and efficient. Mr. McKinley stated his \nstrong belief\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\nthat NATO is producing positive results and is essential as a vehicle \navailable to deploy resources throughout the region and the world.\n  A particular issue discussed relevant to my work on the Judiciary \nCommittee is that of a law recently changed in Belgium which enabled \nthe prosecution of war crimes committed anywhere in the world, at any \ntime. The law has been reformed now to state that the person bringing \nthe charge must be the offended individual and reside in Belgium. He \ncited two recent examples of the law's successful implementation.\n  Of particular interest to me were Mr. Bendler's descriptions of the \nexchange of information between Belgian officials and the U.S. He cited \na recent case where a Belgian citizen suspected of being a potential \nterrorist was tracked and later lost, only to be found again in Iraq. \nThe individual's intention was to be a suicide bomber and to harm U.S. \nforces. With the help of the information provided by Belgians, U.S. \nforces were able to prevent any loss of life to U.S. troops. I believe \nthis type of cooperation between nations is an important step forward \nin the war on terror.\n  On December 24, 2005, I headed to Tallinn, Estonia, my first trip to \nthe Baltic country. I was met by Jeff Goldstein, the Deputy Chief of \nthe Mission, and was briefed on the country's history and its future. \nEstonia is a small country of approximately 1.4 million people, with \nnearly 400,000 individuals living in Tallinn. Tallinn is a beautiful \ncity with much to offer both culturally and economically. Mr. Goldstein \naddressed a number of significant issues including the country's \ndeclining birthrate, its high tech economy, its AIDS epidemic, and the \nability of its residents to receive free schooling in European Union \ncountries.\n  The issue of a declining birthrate in Estonia is one of tremendous \nimportance. With a country of only 1.4 million people, the decline is \nbeing felt and the country is forced with the prospect of having to \nclose some of its schools. To address this problem the Estonian \ngovernment is seeking an aggressive strategy to reverse this decline. \nSpecifically, the government is offering parents 15 months of paid \nmaternity leave--a rate not to exceed three times the national average \nsalary. Additionally, the employer is required to hold the mother's \nposition open for up to three years. This aggressive strategy is \nexpected to result in nearly 300 more births from last year's total.\n  While in Estonia, I was fortunate to examine the country's rich \ncultural heritage. On December 25, 2005, I was provided a guided \nwalking tour of Tallinn by a local guide, Stanislav Lomunov. This \nnearly 2-hour tour included a stop in the Alexander Nevsky Russian \nOrthodox Church. Following the tour, I met with Rabbi E. Shmuel Kot, \nthe Chief Rabbi of Estonia, and participated in the Jewish communities \nlighting of the first Chanukah candle. This ceremony was followed by a \ntour of the local Jewish Community Center and site of a new temple \nalready under construction. I later spent the evening with the Rabbi \nand his family, including four beautiful children, for a candle \nlighting ceremony at his home accompanied with potato latkes made by \nhis wife.\n  One of the most interesting aspects of Estonia is its economy. Mr. \nGoldstein explained to me that the economy is very focused on the high-\ntech sector and is one of the original producers of software allowing \nconsumers to make phone calls over the internet, Kazza and internet \ngambling. The country has a tremendous tourism industry with nearly \n3,000 hotel rooms to be built by 2007. Additionally, the country serves \nas an exit port for much of Russia's oil. What I found most interesting \nis the country's implementation of a 22 percent flat tax since 1996.\n  I departed from Estonia for Jordan on December 26, 2005, arriving \nnearly 1 hour late due to snow in Estonia. I was met at the airport by \nU.S. Ambassador David Hale and immediately proceeded to a meeting with \nKing Abdullah at his private residence. Ambassador Hale described \nJordan's reaction to the recent bombings of hotels in the country, \nstating the Nation had never been more unified and that the terrorist \nattacks caused the country to review its security measures and civil \nliberties. The increased security was visible with armed guards and \nroadblocks at hotels throughout the city.\n  During my meeting with King Abdullah, the focus of our discussions \nwas on the future of Iraq and terrorism. The King expressed to me the \nneed for the Iraqi government to be moderate and not extremist. He \nbelieves a moderate government will provide the Iraqi people something \nto build upon and help provide a stable country.\n  Regarding Iran's progress towards acquiring nuclear capabilities, the \nKing expressed the view that the international community as a whole \nneeds develop a plan to address the issue.\n  I brought up the recent Judiciary Hearing I held to examine Saudi \nArabia's promotion of radical Islam. The King said that the difference \ncomes down to ideology and the he is trying to stamp out fear. The \nSaudi government is not addressing the issue of ideology, and an \ninterpretation of the Koran, that promotes the use violence. It was \nencouraging to learn, though, that the Saudi government is beginning to \nbase its educational model on that of Jordan's. He stated another way \nto promote reform is to hold the Saudis to task and require \ntransparency in their actions.\n  Immediately following my meeting with the King, I proceeded to the \noffice of Jordan's Prime Minister Maruf al-BAKHIT, who served in \nJordanian Army for 35 years and is former Jordanian National Security \nAdvisor. We began our discussion with the topic of Iraq. The Prime \nMinister believes that it would be disastrous for Iraq if the U.S. were \nto pull out. He is hopeful that soon the Iraqi forces will be able to \ndefend themselves. The elections went well in his opinion and hopefully \nthis is a positive sign that the process is moving forward.\n  We discussed Jordan's judicial system. He explained to me that the \ncountry's judicial system has moved away from military courts to a \ncivil court system with one mixed civil/military court. The system is \nnot a jury system but a inquisitorial system where the judge may call \nany consultant he/she desires. Judges go through a 2-year training \nprogram before they are selected to preside over a court. Currently, \nthe country is continuing a plan to upgrade the courts and expedite its \ncases. The Prime Minister believes that good progress has been made in \nthe last 2-3 years of this plan which includes new technology.\n  The following morning, Tuesday, December 27, I flew into Iraq. After \na 2-hour flight on a C-130 and a 10 minute flight on a helicopter, \nincluding 35 pounds of body armor and a helmet, I arrived in Baghdad. I \nimmediately proceeded to a meeting with MG Tim Donovan, chief of staff, \nMultinational Force-Iraq. General Donovan explained that U.S. forces in \nIraq had significantly hindered al-Qaida and other insurgents ability \nto operate in Iraq. Additionally, he described the hope that in 2006 \nthe United States will serve a more supporting role than it currently \ndoes. I asked him what the U.S.'s role will be as the Iraqi security \nforce continues to increase. General Donovan explained to me that the \nU.S. should serve a reduced role as Iraqi security forces increase and \nthat they are currently working on more U.S. reductions.\n  The general assesses the future of Iraq's democracy as developing and \nexpressed his view that Iraqis need to move beyond cultural divides. He \nemphasized that the country needs to develop a middle class to make \ndemocracy succeed.\n  I inquired about the status of Iraq's oil industry. He explained that \nthe industry is old and so is its infrastructure. Currently, they are \nable to export 3 million barrels a day. But in order for them to expand \nupon their capacity there will need to be an investment in technology \nand infrastructure.\n  Following my meeting with General Donovan, I proceeded to have lunch \nwith Brenda Zollinger, a Horsham, PA native. She described to me her \nwork in the Army over the last 8 years. What I took away most from our \nconversation is her belief that the military is doing a good job taking \ncare of our troops.\n  After lunch I met with officials involved in the Department of \nJustice's Regime Crime Liaison's Office, RCLO; Mr. Kevin Dooley, CAPT \nStephen\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nBurris, USN, and Mr. Eric Blinderman. The RCLO was created by a \nNational Security Presidential Directive in 2004, and serves to assist \nthe Iraqi High Tribunal and to provide security and support for the \nTribunal. In the briefing I learned that the judicial system is an \ninquisitorial system based on a five-judge panel which needs a simple \nmajority to adjudicate. Additionally, the court has no burden of proof \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n  I expressed the view that Saddam has committed so many atrocities \nthat the trial should be very simple if the evidence was put forward in \nan organized and methodical way. This can not be done with Saddam \ncontrolling the microphone to make speeches. I think it is a shame that \nthe trial could not have been held sooner.\n  Mr. Dooley and Captain Burris accompanied me to the courthouse and \nprovided me a tour of both Saddam's cell and the courtroom. I also \nviewed the security control room where all actions of the courthouse \nare monitored.\n  Following the tour, I proceeded to meet with members of Saddam's \ntrial including: the Presiding Judge Rizgar, the Chief Prosecutor \nJafaar and the Chief Investigating Judge Ra-id.\n  I asked Presiding Judge Rizgar how Saddam could be controlled. He \ngave me the answer that a doctor deals with the patient, not the \nindividual illness. He elaborated by stating that it is the job of \nevery judge to respect all parties in a case. Additionally, he voiced \nhis opinion that Iraq is on the doorstep of a new life and a careful \nimage of its judicial system must be projected. With respect, I stated \nmy concern to the Presiding Judge that Saddam is a vicious, evil man \nand that is not coming out in the trial. The Judge explained that he is \nfollowing Iraqi law and judicial procedures. He explained to me that \nthe court would decide Saddam's fate and that more testimony needed to \nbe heard.\n  The chief prosecutor explained to me his work on the case, stating \nthe prosecution of Saddam will be long and detailed. He believes that \ndocuments and evidence provided to the court and the judges should be \ngiven to the public for all to see.\n  I proceeded from the courthouse back to the U.S. Headquarters for a \nmeeting with LTG Martin Dempsey, Commander, Multinational Security \nTraining Corps--Iraq. Much of what we discussed was of a classified \nmatter, however I can share information about the goals of the \nMultinational Security Training Corps. First, they are working to build \nand sustain the Ministries of Interior and Defense's institutional \ncapabilities. Additionally, they are working to generate capable forces \nand develop those forces in a professional manner. Finally, they are \nworking on the transition and transformation of multinational units to \nIraqi security forces.\n  Lieutenant General Dempsey stressed to me the need for Iraqis to \ndemonstrate strong leadership because it is that leadership that will \nbe the key enabler to develop the security ministries. Currently, there \nare 223,000 Iraqis in their security services, 75,000 of which serve as \npolice officers in Iraq. The U.S. is currently assisting Iraq in \nproducing 3,500 qualified police officers a month. As of March 14, \n2005, 3 out of the 45 Iraqi battalions were leading the efforts to \nsecure their nation. Presently, there are 45 of the 100 Iraqi \nbattalions leading the efforts to secure their nation. This is a \ntremendous increase in only a 9-month period.\n  Lieutenant General Dempsey echoed the remarks of Major General \nDonovan in stating the Iraqis must achieve government unity by setting \naside their cultural differences and uniting as a country.\n  Before leaving Iraq, I met with the following U.S. Embassy Officials; \nDavid Litt, Major General Harris, James Yellin, RADMR Scott Van \nBuskirk, Tom Delare, John Smith, Michael Oreste, Don Allegro, Don \nBrady, Minnie Wright, Captain Stephen Burris, Kevin Dooley, Liz Colton \nand Eric Blinderman to discuss Iraq's future and how the Embassy was \nhelping to create a more stable society. It was stated that the odds \nare good for achieving a collective party in the Iraq elections. I was \ninformed that there are many criminal cases waiting for investigation \nand prosecution in the judicial system. However, the detention \nfacilities are not adequate and the police do not have enough room for \nthe criminals. On the economic front, the U.S. is working to set the \nstage for the International Monetary Fund agreement and is working to \ncreate a system which prevents corruption. The consensus view seems to \nbe that success of an Iraqi nation depends on the strength of the \nIraqis themselves.\n  The flight out of Iraq was identical to the flight in with the \nsignificant exception that the C-130 taking me back to Amman was once \nstationed at Willow Grove Air Base and was named the Spirit of \nPhiladelphia.\n  I arrived in Tel Aviv, Israel on December 28, 2005. My first meeting \nwas with Peter Vrollman, Gene Cretz, William Weinstein, Peter Hussee, \nJim Beaver, and William Clark of the U.S. Embassy. The discussion began \nwith an analysis of the state of play in Israeli politics. It is \nexpected that Sharon, whose health does not seem to be a major concern, \nwill win the March elections and work in some form of coalition \ngovernment with the Labor party. With respect to Hamas, it is thought \nthere is a possibility that it could win nearly 3 percent or even \noutright in the Palestinian elections creating complicated policy \nquestions for Israel. Hamas is described as a sophisticated, strategic \nand organized while Fattah is in some disarray nor do they have the \nresources necessary to get votes on certain demographics. One of the \nreasons that Hamas is doing so well in these elections is their \nmunicipality leaders are well respected members of the community and \nhave done good work for those communities. If Hamas does win and Israel \nis forced to deal with them there are actions that can hinder Hamas \neconomically such as revenue collected by Israel at the customs boarder \nwhich is provided to the Palestinian Authority.\n  It appears that the economy is improving in Israel and this may be a \nresult of the decline in terrorist events.\n  I met with Ehud Barak later that afternoon; I was honored to see a \ncopy of my book, ``Passion for Truth'' on his bookshelf. Barak told me \nthat Ariel Sharon has changed the political map of Israel in a positive \nway for Israelis and his decisions are slowly moving Israel in the \nright direction. Barak described the political landscape in Israel like \nmusical chairs, you can defeat people but everyone is still around, \nthey do not go away. Barak asked me about the situation in the United \nStates, particularly about NSA's wiretapping. I explained to him that \nthe Judiciary Committee plans to hold hearings on the issue. He also \nasked me about the visit to Iraq the day before and my outlook for the \ncountry. I explained to him that there are a number of highly qualified \nmen and women working there and that I am hopeful 2006 will be a year \nthe Iraqi's take on more responsibility .\n  Continuing our discussion on Iraq, Barak conveyed to me his opinion \nthat the United States should stay the course in Iraq, and not to would \ncause devastating consequences not only for Iraq, but also for the \nMiddle East and the World. He did state the view that the President \nmust continue to project a positive image because a compromised image \ncan create problems itself. Additionally, the U.S. must focus on \ntraining Iraq security services and reducing the visibility of its own \nunits.\n  Immediately following my meeting with Barak I proceeded to meet with \nShimon Peres. Accompanying Peres was his friend Rishon Lezion Mayor \nMeir Nitzan, who was there to describe the ever changing dynamic of \nIsraeli politics.\n  I asked Peres about the new party Kadima and he explained to me that \nthe new party would be the largest party and would control the \ngovernment. He went on to describe Israel's changing political dynamic \nby the demise of the right wing, an extremist wing. Additionally, he \ndescribed the Labor party's belief that the economy is writing policy. \nBut to him, a modern economy needs to be open to social change and not \nbe driven by economic factors.\n  We went on to discuss the Palestinian Authority and he said if Hamas \nwere to win it would be a wasted victory because Hamas is a religious \nbased group and therefore there is no room to compromise.\n  Peres also believes President Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq \nwas the\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nright thing to do and that the President was the victim of an \nintelligence mistake. This marks the third leader to support President \nBush's decision to seek a regime change in Iraq. He added that Saddam \naccepted the U.N. resolutions following the first Gulf War but chose to \nignore them.\n  Before the meeting ended I asked Peres if he was really smiling the \nin picture where he is shaking hands with Yasser Arafat. He recalled \nthe moment and stated that without Arafat there would have been no \nagreement but with Arafat the agreement would never be fulfilled.\n  After an overnight rest stop in Frankfurt, Germany, we returned to \nthe United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/27/senate-section/article/S1502-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JOHN BACHMAN\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate \nNewberry College and its founder, Dr. John Bachman, on the occasion of \nthe school's 150th anniversary. Since its establishment in 1856, \nNewberry College has become one of South Carolina's leading institutes \nof higher education. I am proud to recognize Newberry and honor Dr. \nBachman.\n  Dr. Bachman originally came to South Carolina from New York in 1815. \nSettling in Charleston, he became pastor of St. John's Lutheran Church, \nwhere he served faithfully and honorably for 56 years. Dr. Bachman \nquickly became a pillar of the Charleston community. He baptized \nhundreds of locals into membership at St. John's during his tenure and \nis even known to have educated slaves as well as freemen of African \ndescent. He helped found and served twice as president of the South \nCarolina Lutheran Synod from 1824 to 1833 and again from 1839 to 1840. \nAs Synod president, Dr. Bachman took action that led to establishment \nin 1831 of a school to train Lutheran ministers, now known as the \nLutheran Theological Southern Seminary of Columbia, SC.\n  A seminal and active member of the ``Circle of Naturalists,'' Dr. \nBachman had a keen interest in the natural history of South Carolina's \nLowcountry. He is known to have discovered or described many birds and \nmammals previously unknown to science and frequently published letters \nand short articles about his natural history observations in local and \nregional publications including the South Carolina Medical Journal.\n  In December 1856, Dr. Bachman helped found Newberry College as a \nLutheran-based liberal arts institution north of Columbia at Newberry. \nDr. Bachman served as first president of the Newberry College Board of \nTrustees beginning in January 1857. During his tenure, he took many \nactions to assure the high quality of secular and religious education \nthat has existed for 150 years.\n  Dr. Bachman was a true academic, devoted to his church and to God, to \nscience and natural history, to his community and country, and to \nsecular and religious education. He died at the age of 84 in February \n1874, but Dr. Bachman's legacy is alive and well at Newberry College. \nOn April 20, 2006, the Newberry Alumni Association will begin the \nschool's Sesquicentennial Celebration with a major 4-day symposium \nentitled ``Nature, God, and Social Reform in the Old South: The Life \nand Work of the Rev. John Bachman.''\n  It is with great respect that I commemorate the life's work of Dr. \nJohn Bachman and recognize the rich history he inaugurated at Newberry \nCollege.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/27/senate-section/article/S1502-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ERIC NAMESNIK\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I, along with my colleague Senator \nStabenow, would like to take this opportunity to bring our colleagues' \nattention to a tragic event that took place last month in Pittsfield \nTownship, MI. On January 11, 2006, Eric Namesnik, a two-time Olympic \nsilver medalist and University of Michigan swimming standout, died from \ninjuries sustained during a traffic accident on January 7. Eric was \nbest known in the swimming community for his discipline, toughness, \ntremendous dedication, and many accomplishments, most notably in the \n1992 and 1996 Olympic Games. During his career, Eric broke the American \n400-meter Individual medley, IM, record four times. Eric, \naffectionately known by many as ``Snik,'' was remembered by his family, \nfriends and the community in a celebration of his life at Canham \nNatatorium at the University of Michigan on January 17.\n  Eric was born in Butler, PA, on August 7, 1970, and enrolled at the \nUniversity of Michigan in 1988. As a Wolverine, Snik helped lead the \nmen's swim team to four straight Big Ten Championships and enjoyed the \ndistinction of finishing in the top six nationally during all 4 of his \nyears at Michigan. In 1991 and 1993, Eric earned the No. 1 world \nranking in the 400-meter IM. Eric won silver in the 400-meter IM in the \n1992 Olympics in Barcelona and in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Eric \nalso won two silver medals at the 1991 world championships and a bronze \nmedal at the 1994 world championships.\n  To give you a sense of Eric as a person, Chuck Wielgus, executive \ndirector of USA Swimming, offered these words. ``The loss of Eric \nNamesnik is shocking for the entire swimming community. Snik \nrepresented everything great about the Olympic movement. His work \nethic, toughness and dedication were the embodiment of an Olympian, and \nthey made him one of the most admired competitors the sport of swimming \nhas seen.'' His long-time coach at Michigan, Jon Urbanchek, said of \nEric, ``What he did for Michigan is immeasurable. It's not just how \nfast he swam, but the good person he was, the character. He had his \nlife in perspective and knew that his family was at the center of his \nlife. Eric was an unbelievable human being.''\n  After Eric's competitive swimming career ended, he accepted a \nposition as an assistant swim coach at the University of Michigan. From \n1997 to 2004, he helped coach 11 Olympians, and the Wolverines won \nthree Big Ten titles. After coaching at Michigan for 7 years, Eric \nbecame the head coach of the Wolverine Aquatics Swim Club in Ann Arbor \nand an assistant men's swimming coach at Eastern Michigan University.\n  Eric's love for swimming was evidenced not only by his many \naccomplishments throughout his long and distinguished career in the \npool, but also by his efforts to help shape the lives of many young \npeople learning the sport. At Wolverine Aquatics, Eric served as an \ninspirational role model for hundreds of up-and-coming swimmers. Today, \nhis swimmers are wearing blue wristbands inscribed ``Swim 4 Snik'' in \nhis honor and swim caps with the words ``Snik'' and one of Eric's \nmantras: ``D3,'' which stands for desire, determination and dedication.\n  In keeping with the kind of person Eric was, his last act was to give \nlife to others through the gift of organ donation. He is survived by \nhis wife Kirsten, their two young children, Austin and Madison, his \nmother and father, Kay and John, and his sister Leesa. Mr. President, \nEric Namesnik's medals may have been silver but his heart was pure \ngold. He will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/27/senate-section/article/S1502-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1502-S1503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE MEMORY OF CURT GOWDY\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlife and memory of Curtis Edward Gowdy. Sadly, Curt passed away on \nFebruary 20, at the age of 86.\n  Curt was born on July 31, 1919, in Green River, WY. Curt's passion \nfor sports began early in life. He grew up in Laramie, WY, hunting and \nfishing in some of America's most beautiful country. When Curt began \nplaying basketball in high school, he became Wyoming's leading high \nschool scorer, standing only 5 feet 9 inches tall. After high school \ngraduation, Curt enrolled at the University of Wyoming, where he played \nas a forward on the Cowboy basketball team, earning three varsity \nletters. He also lettered three times in tennis before graduating from \nthe University in 1942 with a degree in business statistics.\n  With college behind him, Curt joined the Army Air Forces to serve his \ncountry as a fighter pilot in World War II. However, a ruptured disk \nfrom an earlier sports injury disqualified him from service, and he was \nmedically discharged. While recuperating from a spinal operation in \nCheyenne, a radio station asked him to announce for the eastern Wyoming \nhigh school football\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\nchampionship game in November of 1943. And so began the career of one \nof the greatest play-by-play sports announcers our country has ever \nknown.\n  Soon after covering the Wyoming high school football championship, \nCurt was hired by a CBS radio affiliate in Oklahoma City to call \nUniversity of Oklahoma football games. In 1949, he joined Mel Allen to \nbroadcast New York Yankee games, and 2 years later, he became the No. 1 \nbroadcaster for the Boston Red Sox. He remained the radio voice of the \nRed Sox for 15 years. As Dick Vitale stated, ``Gowdy had a love affair \nwith the microphone and his fans had a love affair with him.'' During \nthis time, Curt also began television broadcasting, covering college \nand American Football League games in addition to baseball.\n  When NBC picked up the AFL games in 1966, Curt Gowdy became the \nleading personality of NBC Sports. He covered World Series, Super \nBowls, NCAA final four championships, Olympic Games and somehow found \ntime for his ``Game of the Week'' broadcast. Curt also remained the \nhost and producer of ABC's ``The American Sportsman'' for nearly 20 \nyears.\n  In later years, Curt was the host and producer of the public \ntelevision series, ``The Way It Was,'' reminiscing of great games with \na panel of players who had participated in them. Gowdy also provided \nhistoric commentary for the HBO Sports program ``Inside the NFL.'' In \n2003, Gowdy returned to Fenway Park to call a Red Sox game against the \nYankees as part of an ESPN promotion that brought back great \nbroadcasters. He also coauthored two books, ``Cowboy at the Mike'' and \n``Seasons to Remember: The Way It Was in American Sports.''\n  For his outstanding work, Curt was recognized in many ways. In 1970, \nhe was the first sportscaster to be awarded the Peabody Award for \nOutstanding Journalistic Achievement. He was named the National \nSportscaster of the Year seven times, and he received several Emmy \nawards for his work in television, including a lifetime achievement \nEmmy in 1992.\n  Curt was also inducted into numerous sports halls of fame. These \ninclude the broadcast wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame, the Sports \nWriters and Broadcasters Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma Sports Hall of \nFame, the American Sportscasters Hall of Fame, the International \nFishing Hall of Fame, the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame, the Boston Red Sox \nHall of Fame, the Wyoming Sports Hall of Fame, the Wyoming Outdoor Hall \nof Fame, and the University of Wyoming Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1993, \nhe received the Pro Football Hall of Fame Pete Rozelle Award for \nlongtime exceptional contributions to radio and television in \nprofessional football. In addition, the Basketball Hall of Fame media \naward was named in honor of Curt, who served as president of the \nBasketball Hall of Fame for seven consecutive 1-year terms.\n  Wyoming swells with pride for our native son. Our State declared \nMarch 27, 1972, ``Curt Gowdy Day,'' and held a large celebration in his \nhonor. During the festivities, the University of Wyoming awarded Curt \nan honorary law degree, and the State named an 11,000-acre State park \nafter him. Most recently, Curt was selected as a Wyoming Citizen of the \nCentury Sports Finalist.\n  Mr. President, Curt made a point to get back to his home State \nregularly. He once referred to Wyoming fondly as the place ``where I \ngrew up with a fly rod in one hand and, a little later, a radio mike in \nthe other.'' Those of us who had the pleasure of knowing Curt remember \nhim that way. He will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/27/senate-section/article/S1503-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1503-S1504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO PRESTON ROBERT TISCH\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to pay my respects to \nsomeone I knew very well, Preston Robert Tisch, who passed away last \nmonth of brain cancer. He was a distinguished American who, along with \nhis brother, Laurence, built a giant financial enterprise. Bob was \neminently successful at everything he did, particularly in his role as \na husband, father, and grandfather.\n  I, like all who had contact with Bob Tisch, treasure my times with \nhim. I send my deepest condolences to his wife and family. I ask to \nhave printed in the Record a statement released by the New York Giants \norganization that so perfectly describes the life and accomplishments \nof Bob Tisch.\n  He will be long remembered for his productive life and his legacy of \nimportant leadership in all of his endeavors. We are all better off for \nBob Tisch's contributions to our country.\n  The material follows.\n\n                    Preston Robert Tisch (1926-2005)\n\n       Preston Robert ``Bob'' Tisch, the Giants'' Chairman and Co-\n     Chief Executive Officer, one of the nation's most respected \n     and successful businessmen, a former United States Postmaster \n     General, and an extremely generous philanthropist, died \n     Tuesday night.\n       Tisch passed away trom inoperable brain cancer, which was \n     first diagnosed in the summer of 2004. He was 79. His death \n     comes just three weeks after the passing of his fellow owner, \n     Wellington Mara, who died of cancer on October 25 at the age \n     of 89.\n       Tisch realized a longtime dream in 1991 when he completed \n     negotiations with Wellington Mara's nephew, Tim Mara, and his \n     family and paid $75 million for a 50 percent interest in the \n     Giants.\n       ``I was very fortunate,'' Tisch said in a 2002 interview. \n     ``I got a call trom (former Cleveland and Baltimore owner) \n     Art Modell telling me that Tim Mara wanted to sell his half \n     of the team and asking me if I would be interested in \n     purchasing it. I met with Wellington Mara and John Mara and \n     said I'd be very interested. There were no problems with \n     them, and then I bought my share of the team from Tim Mara. \n     It's been a great relationship and a great boon to me. I'm \n     very happy to be the 50 percent owner of the New York \n     Giants.''\n       Tisch played an active role in the organization. As a \n     member of the National Football League's Finance and Super \n     Bowl Policy Committees, he attained a prominence in the \n     sports arena equal to his position in the world of business.\n       Owning the Giants was one of many careers Tisch pursued \n     simultaneously. Forbes magazine ranks him 56th on its list of \n     the country's 400 wealthiest people and estimates his net \n     worth to be about $3.9 billion.\n       He was the Chairman and Director of the Loews Corporation, \n     one of the country's most successful financial companies. The \n     company, with a 2004 net income of $1.2 billion and assets \n     exceeding $74 billion, owns and operates 91 percent of CNA \n     Financial Corporation; 100 percent of Lorillard; 100 percent \n     of Boardwalk Pipelines, which consists of Texas Gas \n     Transmission and Gulf South Pipelines; 52 percent of Diamond \n     Offshore Drilling; 100 percent of Loews Hotels and 100 \n     percent of Bulova.\n       Tisch served as Postmaster General of the United States \n     from August 1986 until returning to New York in March 1988. \n     Prior to his appointment as Postmaster, he served as \n     President and Chief Operating Officer of Loews Corporation \n     and its corporate predecessor, Loews Theaters, Inc., a \n     position held from 1960 until his appointment as Co-Chairman \n     and Co-CEO.\n       Tisch also served as Chairman of the New York Convention & \n     Visitors Bureau for 19 years and currently serves as the \n     Bureau's (now called NYC & Co.) Chairman Emeritus. He was \n     also founding Chairman of the New York City Convention and \n     Exhibition Center Corporation and Chairman of the Citizens \n     Committee for the Democratic National Conventions held in New \n     York City in 1976 and 1980.\n       In May 1990, Mayor David Dinkins appointed Tisch as New \n     York City's Ambassador to Washington, D.C. Through 1993, he \n     served as a liaison between the City of New York and his \n     friends and colleagues in both the national government in \n     Washington, D.C. and the business community in New York City.\n       From 1990-1993, Tisch served as Chairman of the New York \n     City Partnership, Inc. and the New York Chamber of Commerce \n     and Industry, where he was instrumental in developing a \n     campaign to enhance New York's position as an international \n     business center. After completing his stint as chairman, \n     Tisch remained on the Board of Directors of both \n     organizations, now merged.\n       Tisch was also a Trustee of New York University.\n       The Giants, however, were truly a labor of love for Tisch, \n     a lifelong sports fan. He attended every Giants game, home \n     and away, and spent as much time working in his stadium \n     office as possible. His two sons are now important members of \n     the organization: Steven as executive vice president and Jon \n     as treasurer.\n       The process of going from fan to owner took at least three \n     decades for Tisch.\n       ``I came to New York in 1960, and a couple of propitious \n     things happened,'' he said. ``Our company owned a radio \n     station at that time, WHN. During the 1950s they broadcast \n     Giants games. The president of the radio station had ten 50-\n     yard-line tickets at Yankee Stadium. When we sold the radio \n     station he decided he wanted to stay with us, so he came over \n     to Loews Theaters to become the controller. So for about \n     seven or eight years, I had the use of these tickets.\n       ``Also, when we came to New York we moved to Scarsdale, and \n     I got to know Allie Sherman, who was then coach of the \n     Giants. Actually, Allie's son Randy and my son Jon were born \n     one day apart. So we got to know the Sherman family. Then in \n     1975 or '76, Pete Rozelle moved to Harrison. We lived in the \n     city, but we have a house in Harrison, which\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\n     was a mile away from where Pete Rozelle and his family \n     resided. We became very friendly with Pete Rozelle. So I have \n     a history in the last 40-some odd years of being involved. I \n     went to most of the owners meetings and all the Super Bowls \n     with Pete Rozelle. I was chairman of a group of his friends \n     called Rozelle's Raiders--I was responsible for getting him \n     to the right place at the right time. He finally gave me a \n     whistle and a sign that said `Rozelle's Raiders.' I've been \n     very lucky. In my own mind, I've been involved in football \n     since 1960.''\n       It was about that time that Tisch first began to consider \n     buying a professional team.\n       ``I had tried several times before (purchasing his interest \n     in the Giants),'' he said. ``Steve Ross, who ended up as CEO \n     of Time-Warner, Inc. and I tried to buy the Jets in about \n     1967 or '68 and it didn't work out. I looked at other things. \n     In 1988, when I came out of the Postal Service, I decided I \n     would try to buy a sports team. I looked at many of them, \n     both in football and basketball. I looked at the Dallas \n     Cowboys and a couple of other teams. But I made up my mind I \n     was never going to buy a team that was more than one hour \n     from New York. I was interested in becoming owner of the new \n     franchise that was in Baltimore. We were putting together a \n     group when the opportunity came about to become the 50 \n     percent owner of the New York Giants, which I jumped at and \n     dropped everything else.''\n       He completed the negotiations with Tim Mara just a few \n     months after the Giants won Super Bowl XXV.\n       Tisch's business success was but a small part of his life's \n     achievements. His generosity and commitment to civic and \n     charitable causes was legendary. Tisch was a tireless and \n     influential participant in civic affairs throughout his adult \n     life.\n       In February 2000, he helped found Take the Field, Inc., a \n     non-profit organization dedicated to renovating and \n     rebuilding the athletic fields at New York City's public high \n     schools. Tisch, a product of those schools who graduated from \n     Erasmus Hall High in Brooklyn, was Chairman of Take the \n     Field, Inc. He launched the organization with a $1 million \n     donation, and as of earlier this year had raised more than \n     $147 million in public and private dollars.\n       Tisch and two partners in Take the Field, Tony Kiser and \n     Richard Kahan, believed the private sector had to play a \n     leading role in repairing sports fields at schools throughout \n     the city that had been slowly destroyed by more than two \n     decades of neglect. Tisch approached then-mayor Rudy Giuliani \n     with his idea. The city agreed to match every dollar raised \n     by Take the Field with three of its own, and the mission was \n     to re-do every athletic field in the city that was classified \n     as ``needy.''\n       ``Take the Field is one of the most innovative and \n     wonderful ideas of my life in the city,'' said New York Mets \n     owner Fred Wilpon, one of Tisch's best friends. ``And it \n     doesn't happen without Bob. At a time in his life when he \n     could have just sat back and enjoyed everything he had \n     accomplished, he went to work.''\n       That's what Tisch did throughout his life. He was a \n     founding Co-Chairman of Citymeals-on-Wheels, President of the \n     Board of Directors from 1993 to 2002, and later served on the \n     Board as Honorary Chairman. He also served as chairman of \n     Public Private Initiative, a public private partnership that \n     raises funds for important community programs, from 1997 to \n     1998.\n       Tisch's philanthropy continued even after he became gravely \n     ill. His family picked a physician at the Duke University \n     Medical Center to supervise his treatment for the brain \n     cancer. Tisch and his family recently donated $10 million to \n     the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center and the school's Brain \n     Tumor Center.\n       The gift accounted for the majority of a $16.3 million \n     package of subsidies that Duke will use to support research \n     into the treatment of brain tumors.\n       ``I was very, very impressed by the program at Duke, and \n     very taken by more than just its medical approach,'' said \n     Steve Tisch. ``For me, there was the intangible that became \n     so important, of the spiritual and emotional commitment that \n     these programs and their doctors have.''\n       Duke officials have pledged to use $5 million from the \n     Tisch family to underwrite the hiring of additional \n     researchers. The medical center is matching that with $5 \n     million of its own money. Another $2.5 million from the Tisch \n     family will finance the screening of drugs that might be \n     useful in treating brain tumors. Duke officials are now \n     calling the treatment center the Preston Robert Tisch Brain \n     Tumor Center.\n       Given his many accomplishments and interesting ventures, \n     Tisch was asked in that 2002 interview what was most \n     rewarding to him.\n       ``My brother (Laurence, who died of cancer at age 80 two \n     years ago today on November 15, 2003) and I took the Loews \n     Corporation from a corporation that did about $20 million \n     worth of business and built it up to a $13 billion company, \n     which is now run by the next generation,'' Tisch said. \n     ``Building the company and seeing it grow has been extremely \n     gratifying. I also enjoyed my time at the Postal Service when \n     I was appointed Postmaster General. People said, `How can you \n     stand a job like that?' I loved it. I made one mistake--I \n     stayed two years when I should have stayed three years.\n       ``Then, of course, my involvement with the New York Giants \n     has been very rewarding. I've been very, very lucky in my \n     life and what I've been able to achieve.''\n       Everyone who knew him, worked with him or were touched by \n     his generosity were just as fortunate.\n       Preston Robert Tisch was born on April 29, 1926 in New York \n     City. He attended Bucknell University before entering the \n     Army in 1944.

A bill to require an investigation under the Defense \nProduction Act of 1950 of the acquisition by Dubai Ports World of the \nPeninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber today first to \nannounce introduction of legislation, S. 2333, which would deal with \nthe Dubai Ports issue. The legislation is bipartisan. It has five \nDemocratic and five Republican sponsors, although the number is \ngrowing. The lead Republican sponsor is my friend from Minnesota, Mr. \nColeman, who had hoped to be here today, but I believe his flight was \ndelayed, and he is just arriving about now.\n  First, I would like to speak about the recent developments in Dubai \nPorts World's takeover of several major ports. I believe the bipartisan \nlegislation which I and others will introduce today is the path forward \nwith respect to this deal and securing our Nation's ports and making \nsure that homeland security is the No. 1 priority.\n  As we know, the administration and DP World executives reached an \nagreement yesterday to allow for a 45-day investigation of security \nconcerns raised by this deal. That is good news. I salute the \nadministration and President Bush for doing so.\n  The bottom line is that many of us have called for this 45-day \ninvestigation--many of us from both parties over the last week and a \nhalf--and the fact that the President is doing it is very good news. To \ndig in one's heels doesn't make much sense, particularly when it comes \nto homeland security. So the new agreement is a major step forward, and \nit is a key part of what many of us have been asking for in recent \nweeks. But there are still some outstanding questions. That is why we \nwill be introducing our legislation this afternoon. The devil is in the \ndetails. It is plain and simple.\n  Here are some of the questions that have yet be to answered.\n  First, we must make sure that the CFIUS Committee conducts a full, \nthorough, and independent investigation. We can ask for no less, given \nthat the security of our homeland is at stake. Reports that I and \nothers have received have been that the previous investigation was \ncursory, was casual, was not as thorough as it might be. There are \nreports, for instance, that people simply looked in the record books to \nsee if there was something wrong that DP World had done. That is not \nthe kind of investigation you need when for the first time they are \ngoing to operate the ports here in the United States. And because the \ncommittee has already taken a position, even if it is in a casual and \ncursory way, we have to make sure they are able to approach this with \nan open mind. We need real independence here.\n  Make no mistake about it; the CFIUS Committee in the past has too \noften made economic and diplomatic considerations at a greater level \nthan homeland security consideration. That is buttressed by the fact \nthat there are reports in the newspapers that the homeland security \nrepresentative on the committee first objected and then withdrew his \nobjection.\n  Again, we have to make sure there is a broader question; that is, \nwhether the CFIUS Committee is the right committee to begin with to do \nthis. Are they structured properly in a post-9/ll world?\n  When they were first set up more than 20 years ago, part of the \npurpose was almost to provide a security justification for economic \ndeals that had to go through. But even in the confines of present law, \nwe have to make sure that the investigation is thorough, complete, and \nindependent.\n\n  Let me mention one point in this regard. I had been very perturbed \nwhen I learned that the Port Authority of New York/New Jersey, in \ncharge of our ports, was not even consulted about this deal. Had they \nbeen consulted, they would have talked about all kinds of problems that \nthey saw, and as a result they are now suing to block the deal. But how \nthorough could an investigation be if the governmental agency in charge \nof running the ports, in charge of security in the ports, in our \nlargest port on the east coast, was not even consulted?\n  So the first question is, will the investigation be thorough, will it \nbe complete, and will it be independent? Will those who have already \nbrushed aside any complaints or worries be able now to have an open \nmind? I hope so. I am not prejudging, but it is a question that has to \nbe asked as the investigation proceeds.\n  The second question is, what will happen with the report once it is \ncompleted? If the report is kept secret and only given to the \nPresident, then what good was the new 45-day investigation? After all, \nthe President has already said he is for this, and I would like to hear \nthe President say that if new concerns are brought up by the report, he \nwould reconsider his support of this merger. We have not heard that \nyet. So at that point, we are sort of in a position where it is almost \nlike Alice in Wonderland, where you first have the verdict and then the \ntrial. For this 45-day investigation to have real merit, since it does \ngo to the President by law and he gets the right to say ``yes'' or \n``no,'' it would help with the American people to say he has an open \nmind as well; he is not locked into a position.\n  My belief is this: I think the report should be made available to the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\nand the House, to any Member of the Senate and House who wishes to see \nit, and should be made public, at least the nonclassified parts of the \nreport. It can be done on a redacted basis.\n  Why? First of all, we do need independent judgment. Again, because \nthe President has come out so firmly for this proposal, to allow the \nHouse and Senate to see the full report makes a great deal of sense and \nbecause the American people have so many concerns. Go to any street \ncorner in any city or town or suburb in this country and you will hear \nquestions asked about this. Every time I have been on an airplane--and \nI have been on airplanes in various parts of the country--people \nactually get out of their seats and come over to me and say: What is \ngoing on here? So making the report public, at least in a redacted way, \nso the classified parts are not obviously exposed, makes a great deal \nof sense. So that is our second question.\n  The third question is evaluation. It seems to me that in this \nparticular area where there has been such concern, there ought to be, \nin a constitutionally and legislatively proper way, an ability for this \nbody and the other body to disapprove the deal. And that is what our \nlegislation calls for. It calls for a 30-day period after the report is \nissued before any merger is consummated so that Congress can disapprove \nthe deal. As you know, Mr. President, there are strict laws on how \nCongress can approve and disapprove administrative actions, and we have \nconsulted those documents and our disapproval is in keeping with the \nway you should structure such a disapproval.\n\n  So those are the three major questions that our legislation asks. The \nlegislation, S. 2333, which 10 of us, 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans, \nare introducing this afternoon, deals not only with the 45-day review \nwhich the President has already agreed to but the giving of the final \nreport to the House and Senate and to the public in a nonclassified way \nand gives the Congress the 30-day right for disapproval.\n  Now, there is one other question not engaged by our legislation that \nhas to be answered and that is this: Because this is a voluntary \nagreement between the administration and DP World, I have concerns \nabout, because the merger is going to go forward, how securely walled \noff is the American part of this new enterprise from the rest. If you \nread the document that has been made public, it is sort of \ncontradictory, in a certain sense. We want to make sure that those \nwalls are thick, that nobody in the Dubai Ports World organization can \ninfluence decisions made here, at least while the investigation is \ngoing forward. These will be other questions that I think we should \nask.\n  Now, what is the status, what will we do with this legislation? Well, \nthe President's agreeing to a 45-day investigation obviates the need to \nask for a vote in this Chamber immediately, although I am confident \nthat if the legislation were brought to the floor, it would receive an \noverwhe1ming vote, probably a veto-proof majority. However, we will \nkeep this legislation at the ready as we follow the investigation. If \nthe investigation should falter or it should not be made public, then \nthe legislation might well be brought to the floor again. The bottom \nline is, those of us who have great concern about this deal are in a \nperiod of watchful waiting. We are hopeful that the bipartisan \ncompromise we have put together will sort of spread. We are hopeful \nthat the President's going along with the 45-day investigation is an \nindication that we can continue to work together. None of us relishes \nthe occasion to bring this legislation to the floor. It would be much \nbetter if the President would agree to all of its terms. But at the \nmoment, we will carefully watch and wait, doing our best to make sure \nthat the investigation is complete, thorough, and independent, doing \nour best to make sure that Members of Congress and the public can see \nall the appropriate parts of the investigation and then, should the \nneed arise, have an opportunity to disapprove of this merger.\n  One other point, larger point. Whatever happens with this merger, in \nterms of its effect on the United States and its ports, there is one \nbit of good that can come out of this sorry mess; namely, that this \nCongress, that this administration focus much more on port security. \nThere is no question that we have not done enough in terms of port \nsecurity. In the air, we have done a pretty good job. We have spent \nabout $8 billion, and while not all of it was spent perfectly, we are a \nlot safer from terrorism in the air than we were before. But in our \nports, which are perhaps more vulnerable and wide open, we haven't done \nenough. Amendment after amendment after amendment that I and others \nhave brought up over the last 4 years has been defeated, oftentimes on \nparty-line votes. There is a need to do many things. There is a need to \nmake sure that every container that comes into this country can be \ninspected, can be done mechanically for nuclear material. There is a \nneed to make sure that those containers do not contain biological or \nchemical weapons. There is a need to make sure that the containers are \nfar more tamperproof than they are today--not all of them are; far too \nmany are not--so that there can't be something slipped into that \ncontainer while it is on board ship or has already been loaded or \nchecked out at the port of embarkation. There is a need to make sure \nthat personnel both on our side of the ocean and on the other side of \neither ocean have been thoroughly checked out, in terms of their \nbackground, so that terrorist organizations cannot infiltrate because \nwe all know in terrorism handbook 101, infiltration is probably the \nbest way to smuggle some terrible weapons onto our shores.\n\n  We also have to make sure that we have greater personnel, greater \nmachinery, greater computers and technology so that a higher percentage \nof containers, not just the 1 in 20, can be inspected; 1 in 20 is too \ngreat a gamble and too great a risk.\n  As we move forward, I hope that these will happen. And one other \nthing that ought to be done. We ought to take a look at the CFIUS \ncommittee, which in the past has too often taken the path of least \nresistance and doesn't give foreign takeovers the critical national \nsecurity review they deserve.\n  According to a 2005 report, ``The manner in which the Committee on \nForeign Investment in the United States implements Exon-Florio may \nlimit its effectiveness. For example, Treasury in its role as Chair and \nsome others narrowly define what constitutes a threat to national \nsecurity.''\n  This week, the Banking Committee will hold hearings on CFIUS reform, \nand I look forward to working with Chairman Shelby and Senator Sarbanes \nto carefully examine the CFIUS process, something I have had trouble \nwith in the past.\n  In conclusion, the last 2 weeks have been extraordinary. Rarely do we \nsee these days a bipartisan, bicameral unity to ensure our Nation is \nprotected, and those of us who worked hard at this, I say to my \ncolleagues, can be proud that we have already seen some major progress. \nThe 45-day investigation will commence. We must keep our vigilance and \nmake sure the rest of the process is done fairly and carefully and \nindependently because the security of our country depends upon it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2333\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 32. A joint resolution disapproving the results of the \nreview conducted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United \nStates (CFIUS) into the purchase of Peninsular and Oriental Steam \nNavigation (P) by Dubai Ports World (DP World); to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a joint resolution \ndisapproving the conclusion of the Committee on Foreign Investment in \nthe United States, CFIUS, to allow Dubai Ports World, DP World, to take \nover certain port operations in the United States. My colleague and \ngood friend, Congresswoman Jane Harman, will be introducing this \nresolution in the House of Representatives.\n  This resolution would do the following: 1. Disapprove the CFIUS \nreview of the transaction; 2. direct the CFIUS to conduct a 45-day \ninvestigation in order to ensure that the sale will not have an adverse \neffect on national security; and 3. direct CFIUS to brief Members of \nCongress on the findings of its investigation before the transaction is \nallowed to proceed if the Committee maintains that it should go forth.\n  The pending sale raises potential maritime security concerns. The \nsale would transfer control of Peninsular & Oriental, P, Ports North \nAmerica to DP World, a foreign government-owned entity. P Ports has \nextensive terminal and stevedoring operations along the eastern \nseaboard and on the gulf coast. It encompasses not only terminal \nfacility leases in six major U.S. ports, as has been reported widely in \nthe media, but also stevedoring and terminal operations in a total of \n21 U.S. ports, including my home State in Portland, ME.\n  We have long acknowledged the vulnerability of our ports--both as a \npotential target and as a conduit through which terrorists, their \nweapons or other contraband may enter the U.S. coming from a State with \nthree international cargo ports, I am keenly aware of the importance of \nour seaports to our national economy and to the communities in which \nthey are located. In addition to our ports' economic significance, the \nlink between maritime security and our national security is evident.\n  The attacks of 9/11 have forced us to reassess and rebuild our entire \napproach to security. Against an enemy determined to cause maximum harm \nto both the American people and the American economy, we are building a \nstructure that, in great part, relies upon private-public partnerships. \nNowhere is this more apparent than in our ports--where terminal \noperators, longshoremen, port authorities, importers, carriers, and \nothers have worked with the United States Coast Guard, Customs and \nBorder Protection, and state and local law enforcement to put security \nplans in place.\n  The foreign government in question, that owns DP World, is the \ngovernment of Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates, UAE. While UAE \nis an ally in the war on terrorism, it also has been used as a base of \nterrorist operations and financing. In fact, the 9/11 Commission \nreported that UAE was ``both a valued counterterrorism ally of the \nUnited States and a persistent counterterrorism problem.'' The attacks \nof 9/11 were planned in part in the UAE, and much of the financing for \nthose operations was funneled through the UAE banking system. The facts \nwarrant a thorough 45-day investigation by CFIUS, not a cursory review.\n  This incident has revealed significant shortcomings in the CFIUS \nprocess. It is not adequately transparent and does not provide for \nsufficient oversight reporting to appropriate committees and the \nleadership of Congress. The Exon-Florio provision of the Defense \nProduction Act gives the President the authority to suspend or prohibit \nany foreign acquisition, merger or takeover of a U.S. corporation that \nis determined to threaten the national security of the U.S. Through \nExecutive order, the President established the CFIUS to review \ntransactions pursuant to Exon-Florio and make a recommendation \nregarding the exercise of his authority. It may be appropriate for the \nreviews, which may involve proprietary data and classified information, \nto be held confidential. However, once a decision has been reached by \nthe CFIUS, it is wholly appropriate, and even necessary, that Members \nof Congress be briefed on the findings of the review and the basis for \nthe decision.\n  I am truly troubled by the review process that was followed with \nrespect to this purchase. The more I learn, the more questions are \nraised. The law requires a 45-day investigation in cases where an \nacquirer is controlled by a foreign government, as in the case of DP \nWorld, and the acquisition could affect the national security of the \nU.S.\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\nHowever, the CFIUS did not conduct an investigation, as the plain \nlanguage of the statute would demand.\n  I am pleased that, in a recent development, the administration has \nagreed to undertake a 45-day investigation as a result of discussions \nwith DP World and congressional leadership. Perhaps its recommendation, \nonce briefed to Congress, will allay concerns that have been raised. \nPerhaps the national security implications, apparent on the face of the \ndeal, will be adequately addressed through a more rigorous process. \nGiven the remaining uncertainties, however, I felt it was important to \nproceed with the introduction of this resolution, in conjunction with \nmy colleague in the House, Congresswoman Harman.\n  The silver lining of recent events is that they have served to \nhighlight the critical importance of port security to our Nation. Last \nNovember, Senator Murray and I introduced the GreenLane Maritime Cargo \nSecurity Act of 2005. This comprehensive legislation authorizes $835 \nmillion annually for programs and initiatives to better secure our \nNation's ports.\n  It would help build a coordinated approach to maritime and port \nsecurity across all levels of government and with our overseas trading \npartners, improving our Nation's security as it expedites trade with \nthose governments and businesses that join in this goal.\n  The bill addresses the problem of uncoordinated supply-chain security \nefforts, directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a \nstrategic plan to enhance security for all modes of transportation by \nwhich containers arrive in, depart from, or move through seaports of \nthe United States. The strategic plan also must include protocols for \nthe resumption of trade in the case of an incident.\n  This legislation recognizes that America's ports, large and small, \nare our partners in keeping our Nation safe and our economy strong.\n  I seek my colleagues support both for this resolution and for the \nGreenLane bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/27/senate-section/article/S1509-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
