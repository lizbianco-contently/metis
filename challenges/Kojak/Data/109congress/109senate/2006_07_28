Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart \nconcerning the violence taking place in Israel and Lebanon. On July 12, \nHezbollah committed a reckless act of aggression against Israel by \nkilling eight soldiers and kidnapping two others.\n  Following this outrageous act, I joined with all of my colleagues in \nthe Senate to support a resolution reaffirming Israel's rights to \ndefend itself. I stand by that commitment, because Hezbollah and its \nlarge cache of arms is a threat to Israel and to America.\n  But I also watched the last 2 weeks, and those last 2 weeks have \nbrought bloodshed on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border--innocent \npeople dying, families being torn apart, communities being destroyed. \nIt has gone on too long, and it must stop.\n  I am proud to represent the great State of Michigan. When you come \nfrom Michigan, violence in the Middle East isn't just a news story. It \nisn't just ``over there.'' It is here, and it affects thousands of \npeople--friends of mine, people whom I know and respect. In the case of \nLebanon and Israel, this\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\nviolence affects mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, children, and \nwhole communities on both sides.\n  Some people call Bint Jubail a Hezbollah stronghold--and I understand \nthat. But 15,000 of my constituents call it their hometown. In fact, \nDearborn, MI is home to the Bint Jubail Cultural Center that provides \nsort of a home away from home for many families.\n  Tragically, many Michigan families, their relatives, and their loved \nones are trapped in Bint Jubail at this moment. They are caught in \nheavy fighting between Hezbollah and Israel, and people are dying on \nboth sides. Today I pray for them and grieve with their families.\n  The lucky ones were able to get out--such as Rania Horani from \nDearborn who was vacationing with her family in Bint Jubail when the \nfighting broke out. Fortunately, Rania was evacuated, but she spoke to \nthe Associated Press about this terrifying experience. She said:\n\n       You're waiting, you're scared, you don't know if you are \n     going to die. But you have to get out because you're going to \n     die either from starvation, fear, stress, or a bomb. Thank \n     God we're [in Cyprus].\n\n  We share that sentiment.\n  But the tragedy continues for hundreds of others stuck in Bint Jubail \nright now. The State Department must not stop the evacuations until \nevery American and their family is safely out of Lebanon.\n  Last evening I spoke with one of the assistant Secretaries of State \nabout American citizens and their family members who are still there. \nAnd I appreciate the attention of the assistant Secretary and of the \nEmbassy, but we can not stop the ships.\n  We can not stop the rescue missions until all Americans and their \nfamilies can come home. Too many people are still stuck there.\n  On the Israeli side, there is also too much destruction and loss of \nlife. I understand how they must feel. Thousands of Americans fear for \ntheir families. Thousands of people in Michigan, friends of mine, \nhundreds of Michigan teenagers were evacuated in the middle of a summer \ntrip to Israel because they were close to Hezbollah rocket attacks. I \nknow their families and the fear of their moms and dads about whether \ntheir children would come home safely from a summer trip.\n  Brandon Lebowitz, a student at West Bloomfield High School, was a few \nmiles away from the bombings in Tiberius. He talked about his harrowing \nexperience:\n\n       We saw the missiles hitting the city and the smoke and we \n     heard them from across the sea. We were pretty close to the \n     missiles exploding.\n\n  I know how I would feel if that were my son.\n  Innocent Americans from both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border \nhave fled to Michigan, have come back home to escape the violence, \nwatch the news every day, waiting to see what will happen to their \nfamilies.\n  Unfortunately, many civilians did not escape the violence. Over 400 \nIsraelis and Lebanese have died in the fighting. This has got to stop. \nThe U.S. Government must push hard to stop the hostilities and the \nviolence against innocent citizens. Innocent citizens are being killed \nin Lebanon and in Israel. I believe it is our responsibility to stand \nup and do everything possible to bring that violence to an end. That is \nwhy I am pleased to be a cosponsor of a resolution with Senator Dodd, \nmy colleague, Senator Levin, and Senator Sununu that expresses support \nto attain a cessation in hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. We \nknow this is not easy, but we know innocent people--families, \nAmericans--are counting on us to show leadership.\n  Regrettably, over the last 5 years our Government has not played the \nleadership role so critical in the Middle East, the leadership role \nplayed by every other administration, whether Democrat or Republican. \nIt is time to assert our leadership and put a stop to the violence as \nsoon as possible. The innocent people of Lebanon and Israel have had \nenough of the violence and bloodshed. It is time for them to be able to \nlive their lives in peace.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, today, I sent a letter to President Bush. \nIn it I urged him to cease and desist from what has become an abuse of \nPresidential signing statements. I first began drawing attention to \nthese matters 4 years ago, in 2002. I hoped they would end at that \ntime; instead, the abuses have mounted. Outstanding reporters, such as \nCharles Savage of the Boston Globe, have taken note of this important \nmatter. They have reported on particular examples of egregious signing \nstatements by which the President attempts to rewrite our laws. \nEditorial boards across the country have become increasingly critical, \nand I would say increasingly alarmed.\n  This week, a distinguished bipartisan task force of the American Bar \nAssociation, made up of Republicans and Democrats, all across the \npolitical spectrum, released a unanimous report that was highly \ncritical of the President's practice as ``contrary to the rule of law \nand our constitutional system of separation of powers.''\n  With my letter today, I am trying to point the President to a better \nway. I urge him to raise any constitutional concerns he has with \nlegislation with those of us in Congress while the legislation is \npending and early in the process. If we agree with his analysis, we \nwill work together to fix it. But, ultimately, under the Constitution, \nCongress writes the laws, not the President. Article I of the \nConstitution gives Congress the powers to write the laws. Article II of \nthe Constitution requires the President to faithfully execute those \nlaws. His oath of office very specifically says he will faithfully \nexecute the laws, not make them.\n  I speak on this topic again today because of its immediate importance \nto the reauthorization and revitalization of the Voting Rights Act that \nwe unanimously passed last week. The President signed it into law \nyesterday. It was 98 to 0 in the Senate. It was passed by an \noverwhelming bipartisan margin in the other body. I felt privileged to \nbe there when the President signed that law. I talked with him prior to \nthe signing and again after he signed. I complimented him for the words \nhe used in the ceremony when he signed the law. He sounded like a man \nfully on board and supportive of the findings, purposes and provisions \nof the law. I said after the signing, while I was there at the White \nHouse, that what really struck me the most was the President's saying \nhis administration would ``vigorously enforce the provisions of this \nlaw and we will defend it in court.'' I praised President Bush for this \nstatement. I did so again yesterday when the Judiciary Committee met.\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\n  I am told that next week the President will issue a Presidential \nsigning statement on the Voting Rights Act reauthorization. I am urging \nthat this not be one of those infamous signing statements where he says \nsomething else, seeks to undercut the law, reinterpret it or in any way \nreduce his responsibility for fully and vigorously enforcing the law \nand defending and upholding its provisions in legal challenges--the \nVoting Rights Act especially. This act is something we don't just do \nfor our generation, we do it for our children and our grandchildren in \nall parts of this country.\n  What greater right do we have as Americans than the right to vote? We \nfought a revolution to have that right. We praise other nations when \nthey toss off the shackles of dictatorship and can now vote. Yet in \nthis country, for many decades, generations, large groups of people, \nbecause of the color of their skin, were not allowed to vote. \nArtificial obstructions were placed in the way so they could not vote. \nWe came together, Republicans and Democrats, to say these people would \nbe allowed to vote. The color of their skin will not make a difference. \nTheir ethnic background will not make a difference. They will be able \nto vote. That is what was signed yesterday on the lawn of the White \nHouse.\n  The Constitution places the lawmaking power, ``All Legislative \nPowers,'' in the Congress. That is an Article I power. I believe our \nFounders made article I to, first and foremost, put the Congress first; \nthe President came next.\n  We are at a pivotal moment in our Nation's history, where Americans \nare faced with a President who makes sweeping claims for almost \nunchecked Executive power.\n  This administration is now routinely using signing statements to \nproclaim which parts of the law the President will follow, which parts \nhe will ignore, and which he will reinterpret. This is what I have \ncalled ``cherry picking.'' It is wrong.\n\n  This President also used signing statements to challenge laws banning \ntorture, laws on affirmative action, and laws that prohibit the \ncensorship of scientific data. In fact, time and time again, this \nPresident has stood before the American people and signed laws enacted \nby their representatives in Congress, while all along crossing his \nfingers behind his back. I don't want the Voting Rights Act to fall \ninto this area.\n  Under our constitutional system of Government, when Congress passes a \nbill and the President signs it into law, that should be the end of the \nstory. At that moment, the President's constitutional duty is to ``take \ncare that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' In fact, that is his duty, \nwhich he acknowledged yesterday with respect to the Voting Rights Act. \nI commend him for that because his article II power, Executive power, \nis to execute the laws. He doesn't have a legislative power.\n  I remind the President and this administration of this--and I have \nbeen here with six Presidents, Democrats, and Republicans, and I have \nnever seen anything like this in my 32 years in the Senate. I have \nnever seen such a case where an administration has a sense that it is a \nunitary executive. It is not a unitary executive. The legislative power \nis vested in the Congress. The judicial power is vested in the \njudiciary. The power to execute the laws is in the administration. But \nthe Constitution and the President's oath of office say I ``shall \nfaithfully execute.''\n  When the President uses signing statements to unilaterally rewrite \nthe laws enacted by the people's Representatives in Congress, he \nundermines the rule of law and our constitutional checks and balances \ndesigned to protect the rights of the American people.\n  These signing statements are a diabolical device, but this President \nwill continue to use and abuse them if the Republican-controlled \nCongress lets him. So far, the Congress has done exactly that.\n  I say this with all due respect to my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle. The Republican-controlled Congress has become a rubberstamp. \nIt does not show the checks and balances that it should. Actually, the \nPresident has not been helped because he is falling into the trap of \nassuming that whatever he does is going to be rubberstamped by the \nRepublican-controlled Congress. I think America can do better. I think \nAmerica should have a choice. I think America should have a voice. I \ndon't think America should have a rubberstamp for a Congress because \nwhether it is torture, warrantless eavesdropping on American citizens, \nor the unlawful treatment of military prisoners, the Republican-led \nCongress has been willing to turn a blind eye and rubberstamp the \nquestionable actions of this administration, regardless of the \nconsequences to our Constitution and civil liberties.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned that this issue of signing statements is \nsomething that has concerned me since 2002. That was also the year that \nthe Bush-Cheney administration was writing secret legal memoranda \nseeking to justify another form of lawlessness by postulating an \nunfounded and unconstitutional Commander in Chief override to our laws, \nand they did this to justify the use of torture.\n  When that memorandum was exposed to the light of day, not by the \nrubberstamp Congress, but by the press, the administration had to \nwithdraw it. But we read in a front-page story in the Washington Post \ntoday of another ominous development. Apparently, the Bush-Cheney \nadministration lawyers are meeting with Republicans and the Republican-\ncontrolled Congress to write immunities and amnesties into the law and \nto renege on this country's commitment to human rights and the Geneva \nConvention.\n  Mr. President, I say, for shame. To think that you can use a \nrubberstamp Congress to renege on this country's proud commitment to \nhuman rights is another aspect of the lawlessness of this \nadministration. But it will succeed if the Republican-led Congress \ncontinues to act as a wholly owned subsidiary of the White House, \ninstead of fulfilling its responsibility as a separate and independent \nbranch of Government intended by the Founders and established by the \nConstitution to serve as a check on the Executive. I helped write the \nwar crimes law that the Bush-Cheney administration is trying to \nundermine. In 1996 and 1997, we acted with the support of the \nDepartment of Defense to include expressly in our laws culpability for \nviolating human rights in the Geneva Conventions. The United States did \nthat so we could serve as a world leader and as a moral leader.\n\n  We have set standards for conduct that we demand others around the \nworld follow. We cannot credibly ask others to meet standards we are \nunwilling to meet ourselves. Why diminish the moral leadership of the \nUnited States by trying to quietly carve out an exception for us, \ntelling the rest of the world to do this but then saying we won't? We \nhave insisted on human rights and the rights of Americans, civilian and \nmilitary, throughout the world. Let's not tell the rest of the world: \nIt is do as we say, not as we do. More recently, we have seen Abu \nGhraib reported detainee abuses, investigations into the deaths of \ndetainees and civilians in war zones, and indictments of American \nservice personnel and contractors. These have all combined to stain \nAmerica's reputation and role. We must not retreat from the fight for \nhuman rights. We must not ``cut and run'' from our responsibilities as \nthe world leader and the world's only superpower.\n  The American military men and women are the finest in the world. They \nhave been trained to respect human rights, and they do so. They need \nnot fear laws against brutality and inhumanity. We, the United States, \nhelped develop and then endorse the Geneva Conventions to set standards \nto protect our own troops. To walk away from these protections would be \nto ``cut and run'' and walk away from our men and women in uniform. \nPulling a thread from this cloak of protection risks beginning a \nprocess of unraveling the entire fabric to the detriment of our troops \nand to the great shame of the United States.\n  It is disheartening to read that the highest law enforcement officer \nin the country is leading an effort to undercut the rule of law. Rather \nthan enforce the law as he is sworn to do, he is reportedly seeking to \nundermine it. Instead of ignoring the laws we have long honored, our \nleaders should be obeying them, not obfuscating or creating loopholes \nin them. They should be saying nobody, not even the President of the \nUnited States, is above the law. The Attorney General of the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\nis not an in-house counsel to the President or consigliere to the Vice \nPresident and Secretary of Defense. His constitutional responsibility \nis to enforce the law. They seem to have forgotten this, and I am \nspeaking today to remind them of their sworn duty.\n  Mr. President, before yielding the floor, I ask that a series of \nitems be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 2006.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: This week a distinguished Task Force \n     on Presidential Signing Statements and the Separation of \n     Powers Doctrine of the American Bar Association reported. The \n     Task Force unanimously opposed a President's issuance of \n     signing statements to claim the authority to state the \n     intention to disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a \n     law he has signed, or to interpret such a law in a manner \n     inconsistent with the clear intent of Congress as ``contrary \n     to the rule of law and our constitutional system of \n     separation of powers.'' The Senate Judiciary Committee held a \n     hearing on the matter last month. I have spoken to the issue \n     on a number of occasions, including this week on the floor of \n     the Senate.\n       You have produced more signing statements containing \n     challenges to bills you have signed into law than all prior \n     Presidents in our history combined. I understand that you \n     have produced more than 800 challenges to the bills you have \n     signed into law, including many challenges related to your \n     theory of the ``unitary executive.''\n       I write to urge you to cease and desist from this practice. \n     I urge you to recognize that our Constitution vests ``All \n     legislative Powers'' in the Congress and that the President's \n     constitutional responsibility is to ``take Care that the Laws \n     be faithfully executed.''\n       I offer the following constructive suggestion. Rather than \n     wait until a bill is passed, why not provide those of us \n     elected to Congress with any constitutional concerns you may \n     have regarding pending legislation at the earliest \n     opportunity. That would allow legislators to consider your \n     concerns during the legislative process.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Democratic Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 5, 2006]\n\n                        Veto? Who Needs a Veto?\n\n       One of the abiding curiosities of the Bush administration \n     is that after more than five years in office, the president \n     has yet to issue a veto. No one since Thomas Jefferson has \n     stayed in the White House this long without rejecting a \n     single act of Congress. Some people attribute this to the \n     Republicans' control of the House and the Senate, and others \n     to Mr. Bush's reluctance to expend political capital on \n     anything but tax cuts for the wealthy and the war in Iraq. \n     Now, thanks to a recent article in The Boston Globe, we have \n     a better answer.\n       President Bush doesn't bother with vetoes; he simply \n     declares his intention not to enforce anything he dislikes. \n     Charlie Savage at The Globe reported recently that Mr. Bush \n     had issued more than 750 ``presidential signing statements'' \n     declaring he wouldn't do what the laws required. Perhaps the \n     most infamous was the one in which he stated that he did not \n     really feel bound by the Congressional ban on the torture of \n     prisoners.\n       In this area, as in so many others, Mr. Bush has decided \n     not to take the open, forthright constitutional path. He \n     signed some of the laws in question with great fanfare, then \n     quietly registered his intention to ignore them. He placed \n     his imperial vision of the presidency over the will of \n     America's elected lawmakers. And as usual, the Republican \n     majority in Congress simply looked the other way. Many of the \n     signing statements reject efforts to curb Mr. Bush's out-of-\n     control sense of his powers in combating terrorism. In March, \n     after frequent pious declarations of his commitment to \n     protecting civil liberties, Mr. Bush issued a signing \n     statement that said he would not obey a new law requiring the \n     Justice Department to report on how the F.B.I. is using the \n     Patriot Act to search homes and secretly seize papers if he \n     decided that such reporting could impair national security or \n     executive branch operations.\n       In another case, the president said he would not instruct \n     the military to follow a law barring it from storing \n     illegally obtained intelligence about Americans. Now we know, \n     of course, that Mr. Bush had already authorized the National \n     Security Agency, which is run by the Pentagon, to violate the \n     law by eavesdropping on Americans' conversations and \n     reading Americans' e-mail without getting warrants.\n       We know from this sort of bitter experience that the \n     president is not simply expressing philosophical reservations \n     about how a particular law may affect the war on terror. The \n     signing statements are not even all about national security. \n     Mr. Bush is not willing to enforce a law protecting employees \n     of nuclear-related agencies if they report misdeeds to \n     Congress. In another case, he said he would not turn over \n     scientific information ``uncensored and without delay'' when \n     Congress needed it. (Remember the altered environmental \n     reports?) Mr. Bush also demurred from following a law \n     forbidding the Defense Department to censor the legal advice \n     of military lawyers. (Remember the ones who objected to the \n     torture-is-legal policy?) Instead, his signing statement said \n     military lawyers are bound to agree with political appointees \n     at the Justice Department and the Pentagon.\n       The founding fathers never conceived of anything like a \n     signing statement. The idea was cooked up by Edwin Meese III, \n     when he was the attorney general for Ronald Reagan, to expand \n     presidential powers. He was helped by a young lawyer who was \n     a true believer in the unitary presidency, a euphemism for an \n     autocratic executive branch that ignores Congress and the \n     courts. Unhappily, that lawyer, Samuel Alito Jr., is now on \n     the Supreme Court.\n       Since the Reagan era, other presidents have issued signing \n     statements to explain how they interpreted a law for the \n     purpose of enforcing it, or to register narrow constitutional \n     concerns. But none have done it as profligately as Mr. Bush. \n     (His father issued about 232 in four years, and Bill Clinton \n     140 in eight years.) And none have used it so clearly to make \n     the president the interpreter of a law's intent, instead of \n     Congress, and the arbiter of constitutionality, instead of \n     the courts.\n       Like many of Mr. Bush's other imperial excesses, this one \n     serves no legitimate purpose. Congress is run by a solid and \n     iron-fisted Republican majority. And there is actually a \n     system for the president to object to a law: he vetoes it, \n     and Congress then has a chance to override the veto with a \n     two-thirds majority. That process was good enough for 42 \n     other presidents. But it has the disadvantage of leaving the \n     chief executive bound by his oath of office to abide by the \n     result. This president seems determined not to play by any \n     rules other than the ones of his own making. And that \n     includes the Constitution.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Tennessean.com, July 3, 2006]\n\n              President Can't Ignore Laws He Doesn't Like\n\n       When children lie or make promises they have no intention \n     of keeping, they cross their fingers behind their back in a \n     gesture that means ``not really.''\n       The signing statement is President Bush's equivalent of \n     crossed fingers. He signs bills passed by Congress, then \n     attaches his own language saying how and whether he intends \n     to enforce them.\n       Last week, members of Congress from both sides of the aisle \n     took after the president for his use of signing statements. \n     The Bush administration defends the practice, saying \n     presidents as far back as James Monroe have used signing \n     statements. That is technically correct but woefully \n     misleading.\n       Signing statements began as a way for presidents to signal \n     their interpretation of legislation. But President Bush has \n     issued signing statements affecting 750 statutes--more than \n     all other presidents combined. And his statements can only be \n     read as signaling his intention to ignore provisions in the \n     laws. He attached signing statements to a bill banning \n     torture, a measure requiring the administration to supply \n     data on the use of the Patriot Act and a bill governing \n     affirmative action.\n       Lawmakers were particularly irked that Mr. Bush, who hasn't \n     vetoed a single bill in six years, seems to be using signing \n     statements instead of vetoes. If he vetoed legislation he \n     opposed, the bill would return to Congress for further debate \n     and an attempted override vote. Congress would get a chance \n     to fight the president's position. With a signing statement, \n     there is no debate, no second vote and no fight.\n       There is just government by fiat.\n       The irony in the signing statement issue is that the Bush \n     administration has gotten virtually everything it has sought \n     from Congress. With few exceptions--the torture ban being \n     one--President Bush could have persuaded Republican lawmakers \n     to include or omit certain provisions, crafting legislation \n     to his liking on the front end.\n       But such a public and candid approach would have required \n     some degree of congressional debate and public discussion. \n     That may not be this president's style, but it is the \n     democratic way. Congress should not let him get away with \n     this power grab.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe July 25, 2006]\n\n                        Ending Back-Door Vetoes\n\n       Over the last five years, congressional leaders have barely \n     squawked as President Bush signed bills and then quietly but \n     explicitly declared his intention to discount key provisions \n     of them. He has attached such statements to more than 800 \n     laws, at last count. Left unchallenged, the president's so- \n     called ``signing statements'' would represent a unilateral \n     change to the structure of the U.S. government, a change that \n     no one outside the White House played any role in enacting.\n       Yesterday, a bipartisan task force of the American Bar \n     Association concluded that these statements violate the \n     constitutional separation of powers. And the panel called for \n     federal legislation that would allow for judicial review of \n     any statement in which the president claims the authority to \n     disregard all or part of a law.\n       The bar association's House of Delegates has yet to vote on \n     the recommendations, but\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\n     endorsing them should be virtually automatic for a group of \n     lawyers. Whether the White House or congressional leaders \n     will act on the proposal is another story. For decades, \n     presidents asked the bar association, which represents the \n     nation's lawyers, to evaluate the credentials of judicial \n     nominees, but the current President Bush put an end to that \n     practice. His administration treats the bar association as \n     just another interest group, to be humored or ignored as he \n     pleases.\n       But the task force has a point. Bush has employed signing \n     statements more often and more aggressively than any of his \n     predecessors, as the Globe's Charlie Savage documented in a \n     series of articles this spring. The laws in question touch on \n     fundamental values, such as whether U.S. military \n     interrogators should be allowed to torture detainees.\n       The administration's defenders say the president is merely \n     objecting to unconstitutional provisions specifically, ones \n     that infringe on the rightful powers of the executive within \n     otherwise desirable legislation. But even if the Bush \n     administration were correct on that point, back-door vetoes \n     only relieve Congress of its obligation to make laws that are \n     constitutional. The task force notes that deciding \n     constitutionality is up to the federal courts. ``The \n     Constitution is not what the President says it is,'' the \n     panel's report declares.\n       Congress was right to prohibit the use of torture by \n     American interrogators. If the president opposed that ban, he \n     had the right to veto it. That, of course, would have looked \n     bad, both at home and around the world. But while a veto-by-\n     signing-statement might have been more convenient \n     politically, no part of the Constitution gives the president \n     the right to have it both ways to enforce parts of laws that \n     magnify the power of the executive branch and then ignore the \n     rest.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, May 30, 2006]\n\n                          Equal Power Failure\n\n       No congressional dander was raised when the Bush Pentagon \n     incarcerated hundreds of uncharged men at Guantanamo Bay, \n     Cuba. Spaniel-like, the lawmakers hustled up legislation that \n     attempted to legitimize some of the illegal jailings long \n     after the fact.\n       Did electronic surveillance of American citizens, in direct \n     violation of the law Congress passed in 1978 setting clear \n     guidelines for such activity, provoke outrage on Capitol \n     Hill? No problem, said the leaders. We will allow the \n     attorney general to duck questions on it, and promote the \n     general who implemented it.\n       How about the shameful torture and humiliation of prisoners \n     in Iraq? Congress barely worked up enough gumption to express \n     its disapproval. And then, when President Bush attached a \n     ``signing statement'' to the anti-torture legislation, saying \n     he really wasn't buying it, Congress yawned.\n       And when the Globe's Charlie Savage reported that Bush had \n     added such statements to more than 750 bills, claiming the \n     right to disobey their mandates, Congress tucked in its tail \n     and went to sleep.\n       Or so it seemed.\n       Now it is clear that the lawmakers simply viewed these \n     actions as trifling infringements of their prerogatives. They \n     were just waiting for the right issue to come along so that \n     they could assert boldly and forcefully the co-equality of \n     the legislative branch. They were looking for something they \n     considered big. And they found it.\n       One of their own, Representative William J. Jefferson, \n     Democrat of Louisiana, was accused of taking a $100,000 \n     bribe, $90,000 of which was found in his freezer. When the \n     response to FBI subpoenas was slow, agents got a warrant and \n     raided his Capitol office. Republican and Democratic leaders \n     howled in unison, but for what reason?\n       First, it is pretty clear that Congress has no immunity \n     from criminal searches. The Constitution does say members are \n     ``privileged from arrest during their attendance at the \n     session,'' but not in cases of ``treason, felony, and breach \n     of the peace.'' Floor debate is protected; bribery is not.\n       Second, the chorus of objections to the FBI raid was a \n     bipartisan public relations blunder. The public has a low \n     enough opinion of the skulduggery that goes on all over \n     Washington without Congress officially declaring Capitol Hill \n     a cop-free zone.\n       Most frustrating is Congress's choice of irritants. Many \n     Americans will cheer if Congress stands up on two feet and \n     defends its constitutionally sacrosanct right to legislate. \n     This right is under serious attack, but the attack is coming \n     from the president of the United States, not from a few FBI \n     gumshoes.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Washingtonpost.com, Friday July 28, 2006]\n\n                              Signing Off\n\n       Across a wide range of areas, President Bush has asserted a \n     grandiose vision of presidential power, one to which Congress \n     has largely acquiesced. From domestic surveillance to holding \n     detainees in the war on terrorism, the administration has \n     generally ignored the legislature, brushed aside inconvenient \n     statutes and proceeded unilaterally. All of this, as we have \n     argued many times, warrants grave concern and a strenuous \n     response. But it is worth separating that issue from the \n     ongoing controversy over the president's aggressive use of \n     what are called ``signing statements''--those formal \n     documents that accompany the signing of a bill into law.\n       Ever since the Boston Globe reported this year that the \n     president had used such statements to question the \n     constitutionality of more than 750 provisions of law, critics \n     across the political spectrum have been up in arms. The \n     Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings, and this week a \n     task force of the American Bar Association issued a report \n     accusing the president of usurping legislative powers.\n       President Bush brought this skirmish on himself. He has \n     used signing statements--which indicate that he will \n     interpret new laws so as to avoid the constitutional problems \n     he has flagged within them--far more frequently than other \n     presidents. In some areas, he has used them to articulate \n     deeply troubling views of presidential authority. Most \n     infamously, in signing the amendment by Sen. John McCain (R-\n     Ariz.) banning American personnel from using ``cruel, inhuman \n     or degrading'' treatment on detainees, he stated that his \n     administration would interpret the new law ``in a manner \n     consistent with the constitutional authority of the President \n     to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in \n     Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on \n     the judicial power''--apparently reserving for himself the \n     power to override the prohibition.\n       Still, it is important not to let Mr. Bush's ugly signing \n     statements bring the presidential practice into disrepute. \n     Signing statements are actually a useful device for \n     transparent and open government.\n       Presidents have long used signing statements to identify \n     particular provisions of law as potentially unconstitutional. \n     They have just as long declined to enforce provisions of law \n     they regarded as unconstitutional. Particularly since the \n     Carter and Reagan administrations, the use of signing \n     statements has been on the upswing, and that's generally a \n     good thing. These statements give the public and Congress \n     fair warning about which laws the president intends to ignore \n     or limit through interpretation. They thereby permit \n     criticism and more vibrant debate. And they have no legal \n     consequences over and above the president's powers to \n     instruct the executive branch as to how to interpret a law--\n     which he could do privately in any case.\n       While Mr. Bush has been particularly aggressive about \n     issuing signing statements, a great many break no new ground \n     but merely articulate constitutional views that the executive \n     branch has held across many administrations. The problem is \n     not that Mr. Bush reserves the right to state his views; it \n     is the dangerous substance of the views he sometimes states.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I rise this morning first to commend the \nSecretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, for her efforts to negotiate a \ncease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah and to engage other countries \nin helping to make and keep peace there. I salute her for her expressed \nwillingness to return to that region as soon as it is practical to \nachieve her goals.\n  I am appalled, as all civilized people are, by the terrorists' \ndestruction and the maiming and loss of human life in Israel, in \nLebanon, and in Gaza. That is why I found it so disturbing that the \nLebanese Prime Minister, Fuad Siniora, and his Speaker rejected \nSecretary Rice's proposals before she had even left their country and \nwas on her way to Israel.\n  The Lebanese Government and the Lebanese people cannot have it both \nways. They cannot want an immediate cease-fire on the one hand, yet \ncontinue to support Hezbollah as it kidnaps Israeli soldiers inside \nIsrael to start this war and then rain destruction on Israel's cities \nand civilians. As long as Hezbollah keeps those kidnapped Israeli \nsoldiers and continues to fire its rockets into Israel, there can be no \ncease-fire and there can be no peace for Lebanon. As long as the \nLebanese people and their Government house terrorists who have sworn \nthe total destruction and the elimination of the\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\ndemocratic State of Israel, support the terrorist acts in that country \nand against Israeli citizens, and allow their own country to be used as \na staging area for those terrorist acts, there can be no peace for \nLebanon.\n  Just as the Lebanese Government and people must stand up for their \ncountry and themselves and demand that those who want to continue the \nacts of violence and the repercussions for their fellow Lebanese \ncitizens must cease and desist or leave their country, so must the \nGovernment and people of Iraq stand up for their own country and for \ntheir own future.\n  Earlier this week, just as Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki was engaged \nin a public relations tour of Washington, DC, President Bush announced \nthe redeployment of American troops back into Baghdad because of the \nfailure of the Iraqi Government to run even its own capital city, much \nless its own country, and the failure of the Iraqi security forces to \nprotect that city, in addition to other significant areas of Iraq. \nThere are further reports that the U.S. military command had to replace \nthe supposedly top Iraqi units because of their failure to stand up \neffectively against the insurgents. I submit the only cutting and \nrunning in Iraq is by the Iraqis and that President Bush's plan of \n``stand up, stand down'' is failing miserably. It has become: Iraqis \nstand down and U.S. stay.\n  I voted just a couple of weeks ago against this body establishing \narbitrary timelines and deadlines for the redeployment of U.S. forces \nfrom Iraq because I respect that our military commanders and our \nsoldiers there have terribly dangerous and difficult missions to \nperform. I believe it is imperative that we give them what they say \nthey need in order to carry out those missions. But the fact that they \nneed more troops, or at least no fewer American troops, is further \nevidence of the miserable failure of this administration's policies and \nplans for Iraq. After all, the U.S. forces there are carrying out the \nmission that has been assigned them by their Commander in Chief, the \nPresident of the United States. It is a mission that is defined by his \npolicy, and that policy is failing.\n  It is past time that we admit that failure, that the administration, \nstarting with the President, admits that failure and tells us how he \nproposes to correct it. It is time we send an emphatic message to the \nPrime Minister and the Government of Iraq: Quit your dickering, your \nsquabbling, your posturing, and get down to the business of running \nyour own country and running it successfully. Stop opining about \nothers' actions elsewhere in the Middle East, condemning Israel and \nfanning the flames there, which is counterproductive to Secretary \nRice's efforts to negotiate a cease-fire there. Take note of the fact \nthat a country such as Israel, located in the same region of the world, \nwith the same kind of barren terrain, without even the oil resources \nIraq enjoys, is able to run its own country, provide prosperity and, \nmost of the time, peace for its own citizens, defend its borders, and \nprovide for the internal security within its country. That is a model \nwhich the Government of Iraq as well as the Government of Lebanon \nshould be following and trying to respect and build upon rather than \ndenigrate.\n  I don't know what the future holds for Iraq. But I do know that it \nhas become one where their lack of effort--or at least the lack of \nsuccess--seems to be condoned and enabled by this administration's \npolicy. As long as the Iraqis know they have carte blanche, as long as \nthey know our forces will be there to back up their efforts, to correct \ntheir mistakes, to stand up as they are standing down, I don't see how \nthat country--its government and its security forces--are going to make \nthe progress necessary for them to become an independent and viable \nnation.\n  I do know it is their responsibility. We have been there for almost \n3\\1/2\\ years, since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's evil regime. We \nhave given them more than enough time. We have shed more than enough \nAmerican blood--lives lost forever, lives maimed and altered forever.\n  All this administration is telling us is to stay the course, stay the \ncourse, stay the course. I submit that to stay the course only makes \nsense when there is an end to that course. It only makes sense when it \nis part of a successful stand up/stand down strategy. But it is so \nclearly demonstrated now that that strategy not only is not working but \nit is going in the wrong direction, that it is time for this \nadministration to tell the American people what it intends to do and \nhow it intends to reverse that failed course, and what ``stay the \ncourse'' is going to mean absent that turnaround, and what we must do \nto achieve it.\n  We need to enlist the rest of the world, as Secretary Rice, to her \ncredit, is attempting to do in the situation involving Israel and \nHezbollah. We need to admit that we need the active assistance of the \nUnited Nations, of other nations that have stood back because of the \ncavalier way in which the Bush administration went into this war, \nrejecting any common effort. It is understandable they don't want to \nput their troops, their own citizens--sons and daughters--into those \nperilous conditions that are the creation of this administration and \nthat persist as a result of its failure to correct them. But we must \nenlist their help. We must enlist the help of everyone in the world \nnecessary to bring about true peace in Iraq and the rest of the Middle \nEast.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Res. 544) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 544\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as ADHD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological disorder \n     that affects both children and adults, and can significantly \n     interfere with the ability of an individual to regulate \n     activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to tasks in \n     developmentally appropriate ways;\n       Whereas ADHD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the criminal justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas ADHD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 to 7 percent (4,000,000) \n     of young school-age children and an estimated 4 percent \n     (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and socio-\n     economic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies indicate that between 10 and 35 \n     percent of children with ADHD have a first-degree relative \n     with past or present ADHD, and that approximately one-half of \n     parents who had ADHD have a child with the disorder, \n     suggesting that ADHD runs in families and inheritance is an \n     important risk factor;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with \n     ADHD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults \n     with the disorder are diagnosed and less than half of \n     children and adults with the disorder receive treatment and, \n     furthermore, poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by ADHD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the \n     American Psychological Association, the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     and\n\n[[Page S8409]]\n\n     the National Institutes of Mental Health, among others, \n     recognize the need for proper diagnosis, education, and \n     treatment of ADHD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of ADHD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes as an obstacle for diagnosis and treatment;\n       Whereas lack of knowledge combined with issues of stigma \n     have a particularly detrimental effect on the diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n       Whereas there is a need for education of health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of ADHD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life can be \n     improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 20, 2006 as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (ADHD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all Americans to find out more about ADHD, \n     support ADHD mental health services, and seek the appropriate \n     treatment and support, if necessary;\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about ADHD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access and quality \n     of mental health services dedicated to improving the quality \n     of life of children and adults with ADHD; and\n       (5) calls on Federal, State, and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/28/senate-section/article/S8409-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DESIGNATING AUGUST 16, 2006, AS ``NATIONAL AIRBORNE DAY''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 405\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the United States Armed \n     Forces have a long and honorable history as units of \n     adventuresome, hardy, and fierce warriors who, for the \n     national security of the United States and the defense of \n     freedom and peace, project the effective ground combat power \n     of the United States by Air Force air transport to the far \n     reaches of the battle area and, indeed, to the far corners of \n     the world;\n       Whereas August 16, 2006, marks the anniversary of the first \n     official validation of the innovative concept of inserting \n     United States ground combat forces behind the battle line by \n     means of a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the United States Department \n     of War, and was launched when 48 volunteers began training in \n     July of 1940;\n       Whereas the Parachute Test Platoon performed the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n     days immediately preceding the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that, since then, have served with \n     distinction and repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those units are the former 11th, 13th, and \n     17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Battalions, and the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II provided a basis of evolution into a diversified \n     force of parachute and air assault units that, over the \n     years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the \n     Persian Gulf Region, and Somalia, and have engaged in \n     peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula, the \n     Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment which, together with other units, \n     comprise the quick reaction force of the Army's XVIII \n     Airborne Corps when not operating separately under a regional \n     combatant commander;\n       Whereas that modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, Air \n     Force combat control teams, all or most of which comprise the \n     forces of the United States Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) \n     and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, together with other units of \n     the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war against \n     terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting civil \n     affair missions, and assisting in establishing democracy in \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are and will continue to be at \n     the ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism \n     is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States combat airborne forces, all have achieved distinction \n     by earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operation forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops; and\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the American people as the airborne community celebrates \n     August 16, 2006, as the 66th anniversary of the first \n     official jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2006, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on Federal, State, and local administrators and the \n     people of the United States to observe ``National

Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague from \nColorado, Senator Salazar, to inform\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\nour colleagues of our efforts to expand the availability of alternative \nfuel infrastructure to assist American consumers who are increasingly \nlooking to buy automobiles that can run on alternative fuels such as \nbiodiesel, E-85 ethanol, natural gas, and other such fuels.\n  American automakers--Ford, GM, Daimler Chrysler--alternative energy \ngroups, and environmental organizations have all expressed to Congress \nthat the leading hurdle to allowing consumers greater access to \nvehicles that run on alternative fuels is the fact that there just \naren't enough refueling stations across the country.\n  For instance, while there are over 6 million flex-fuel vehicles \nnationwide that can run on either gasoline or E-85 ethanol, less than 1 \npercent of all gas stations provide consumers with the option of \nfueling up with an alternative fuel that is American made, cleaner for \nthe environment, and reduces our Nation's overreliance on foreign \nsources of oil.\n  On Monday of this week, the House of Representatives, by a vote of \n355 to 9, overwhelmingly passed a bill by Congressman Mike Rogers from \nMichigan--H.R. 5534--that authorizes grants up to $30,000 for gas \nstations, and other eligible entities under the Clean Cities Program at \nthe Department of Energy--including Government entities--that place in \nservice alternative fuel infrastructure.\n  Subject to annual appropriations, Congressman Rogers' bill authorizes \nthe use of penalties that are collected annually from foreign \nautomakers who violate the CAFE standard for fuel efficiency.\n  This House-passed bill is currently being held at the Senate desk and \nSenator Salazar and I, along with Senators Talent and Hagel, have a \nsubstitute amendment that has the support of the majority leader and \nhas been cleared by the chairman of the Commerce Committee. Again, I \nreiterate that this is simply an authorization and has no mandatory \nspending.\n  Our goal is to pass this substitute proposal by unanimous consent and \nsend it back to the House of Representatives--which has indicated that \nthey are prepared to pass the modified proposal so it can be enacted \ninto law.\n  Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, while the Senate \nis currently debating a bill to expand the availability of oil and \nnatural gas that is located off the coast of the U.S., we shouldn't \nmiss the opportunity to pass a modified version of the alternative fuel \ngrant legislation that the House overwhelmingly passed earlier this \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/28/senate-section/article/S8410-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RAILROAD RETIREMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to have introduced the \nRailroad Retirement Technical Improvement Act that would ensure that \nthe Department of the Treasury continues to distribute retirement \nbenefits rather than a nongovernmental disbursing agent. This \nlegislation is similar to a bill that was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman \nDon Young of Alaska. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, \nwhich will continue to allow our Nation's retired railroad employees to \nsecurely receive the benefits for which they have worked so hard.\n  The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 calls \nfor a nongovernmental financial institution to replace the Treasury \nDepartment as the disbursing agent of retirement benefits. While I have \nconsistently supported greater efficiency in government by allowing the \nprivate sector a greater role in providing some services, I believe \nthat further analysis of this issue has shown that the Treasury \nDepartment is the most efficient and secure conduit to distribute these \nimportant benefits.\n  While the Treasury Department has a long track record of disbursing \nchecks on a massive scale, very few private disbursing agents would \nhave the ability to handle this load at the same costs incurred by the \nTreasury. It has been estimated that the average cost of using a \nnongovernmental benefit disbursing agent would total $2.9 million each \nyear. In contrast, having the Treasury maintain its role as disbursing \nagent would only cost $800,000 annually, a $2.1 million annual savings.\n  In addition to the fiscal concerns that have arisen regarding \ntransferring disbursing responsibilities for benefits, identity theft \nis a looming threat because of the need to transfer personal \ninformation of private individuals from the Treasury Department to the \nprivate sector. The specter of this threat is growing, and I do not \nbelieve our Nation's retirees should be concerned with who may have \naccess to their personal information.\n  A benefit in addition to cost savings and security is that unlike a \nprivate vendor, the Treasury Department has the ability to use debt \ncollection tools such as withholding tax refunds that are not available \nto the private sector. The Treasury Department's ability to make \ncollections on overpaid benefits is easier, cheaper, and more efficient \nthan having a private sector agent make the same collections.\n  The advantages of securing benefits for our retired railroad workers \nand saving taxpayer dollars are obvious. The maintenance of these \nbenefits under the realm of the Treasury Department is a cost-efficient \nand secure means of distributing benefits, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/28/senate-section/article/S8410-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8410-S8411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT OF COLONEL BRUCE W. SUDDUTH\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor \nthe retirement of Col. Bruce W. Sudduth from the U.S. Air Force.\n  A father, a husband, a teacher, and a decorated Air Force colonel--on \nJuly 28, 2006, Colonel Sudduth will retire from the Air Force after \nhonorably serving for 25 years. During that time, he has earned the \nDefense Superior Service Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, \nthe Meritorious Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Air \nForce Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, and the Combat \nReadiness Medal.\n  Colonel Sudduth began his illustrious military career in 1981 when he \nentered the Air Force through Officer Training School. His first \nassignment was as an intercontinental ballistic missile launch officer \nat Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, where he earned wing \nresponsibilities as a weapon system instructor, standardization \nevaluation, and flight commander. In 1985, he was selected for project \nTOP HAND at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. In 1988, he was \nselected for the last ASTRA class and was assigned to Air Force Studies \nand Analysis; later he was assigned to the Air Force Chief of Staff's \nstaff group.\n  In 1990, Colonel Sudduth attended the last class of Armed Forces \nStaff College at Norfolk, VA. He was then assigned to the Joint \nStrategic Target Planning Staff, JSTPS, Future Concepts Branch at \nOffutt Air Force Base, NE. Upon the elimination of JSTPS and the \ncreation of the United States Strategic Command, USSTRATCOM, he was \nassigned to the Strategy and Policy Division. In 1993, Colonel Sudduth \nwas assigned as the 341st field missile maintenance supervisor at \nMalmstrom Air Force Base, MT. In 1994, he assumed command of the 490th \nMissile Squadron at Malmstrom AFB. Under his direction, the 490th \nparticipated in combat operations after 3 years of noncombat duty. He \nwas selected in 1996 to attend the Naval War College at Newport, RI. In \n1997, he was assigned to the USSTRATCOM Strategy and Policy Division as \nthe chief of the Strategy Branch. Upon selection for colonel, he served \nas USSTRATCOM senior controller, standardization evaluation chief. That \nsame year, in addition to his duties as colonel, he earned a master's \ndegree in national security studies from the Naval War College.\n  In April 2001, Colonel Sudduth assumed command of the 91st Operations \nGroup, Minot Air Force Base, ND. In April 2003, he was assigned as the \nsenior special assistant to the commander, USSTRATCOM. Colonel Sudduth \nbecame the executive director of the Strategic Advisory Group in June \n2004.\n  Colonel Sudduth graduated from Southeastern Oklahoma State University \nin 1973, earning a bachelor of science in education. He received a \nmaster of education in administration and supervision at Central \nMissouri State University in 1983. Prior to joining the Air Force, in \nanother service to\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\nour Nation, he taught high school math and science for 7 years in \nOklahoma.\n  I would like to congratulate Col. Bruce W. Sudduth; his wife, Rita; \nand his two sons, Todd and Paul, on this day of his retirement. Colonel \nSudduth's noble, dedicated service to the United States of America has \ngreatly contributed to the safety and well-being of all Americans, and \nis to be respected and appreciated by all. I wish him and his family \nthe best as they embark on their new adventures in life, and I thank \nhim again for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/28/senate-section/article/S8411-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO LEONARD H. ROBINSON, JR.\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I take this opportunity today to \nhonor the memory of a good friend, Leonard H. Robinson, Jr., president \nand CEO of the Africa Society of the National Summit on Africa, who \ndied suddenly on Tuesday here in Washington.\n  Leonard's remarkable achievements have been recognized across America \nand the world. Throughout his nearly 40-year career, Leonard \ndistinguished himself in many roles. He brought knowledge, commitment, \nand experience to his work at the State Department, the African \nDevelopment Foundation, and the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment. For many years, he devoted his abundant energy to \npromoting understanding and opportunities in Africa. It all started, \nhowever, as a Peace Corps volunteer in India from 1964-1967. He \nsurprised one of my staff members recently by conversing in fluent \nHindi, one of many languages Leonard had taken the time to master.\n  Leonard Robinson was also a visiting professor and lecturer at \nseveral universities including Boston University and the University of \nVirginia, where he was the university's first diplomat-in-residence. \nThrough his membership on a variety of commissions and councils, \nincluding the Council on Foreign Relations, he gave clear voice to \nimportant issues, and others responded in kind. He had the ability to \nbring together broad coalitions of partners, including businesses, \nNGOs, academics, and civil society groups, who otherwise might not have \nrecognized their mutual interests. He influenced numerous individuals \nin America and around the world to see the potential of Africa.\n  Leonard Robinson's work on African affairs was always based on the \nconviction that it was important to correct the frequently negative \nperceptions about Africa that inhibited genuine interaction with that \ncontinent. His tireless efforts to educate all Americans on the rich \nhistory and diversity of Africa and its people culminated in the \nestablishment of the Africa Society, of which he was a founder, \npresident, and CEO.\n  There will be a memorial service in honor of Leonard Robinson at \n10:30 a.m. on Tuesday August 15, 2006, at the Washington National \nCathedral where his friends and colleagues will recognize his \naccomplishments and celebrate his legacy.

A bill to amend the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act \nof 1973 to assist the neediest of senior citizens by modifying the \neligibility criteria for supplemental foods provided under the \ncommodity supplemental food program to take into account the \nextraordinarily high out-of-pocket medical expenses that senior \ncitizens pay, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Senior \nNutrition Act, which will make needed improvements to the Commodity \nSupplemental Food Program to prevent our seniors from having to make \nthe difficult choice between food and medicine as they try to balance \ntheir budgets.\n  I am pleased to have the support of my friend, Senator Domenici of \nNew Mexico, who has been one of the Senate's strongest supporters of \nCSFP. Also I am pleased to have the support of Senators Johnson and \nDurbin.\n  Nationally, 32 States and the District of Columbia participate in \nCSFP, which works to improve the health of both women with children and \nseniors by supplementing their diets with nutritious USDA commodity \nfoods. According to USDA, more than half a million people each month \nparticipated in CSFP during fiscal year 2005, with the overwhelming \nmajority being seniors.\n  My State of Michigan has one of the largest and oldest CSFP network \nin the Nation. Last year, over 80,000 people in Michigan benefited from \nthis important program.\n  The bill I am introducing today will make the following important \nchanges to CSFP.\n  First, categorical eligibility is granted for seniors for CSFP if the \nindividual participates or is eligible to participate in the Food Stamp \nProgram. No further verification of income would be necessary in such \ncases. The Food Stamp Program provides a medical expense deduction, \nwhich seniors may use to account for their high prescription drug \ncosts.\n  Second, this bill says that the same income standard that is \ncurrently used to determine eligibility for women, infants, and \nchildren in CSFP--185 percent of the poverty income guidelines--would \nbe applied to seniors as well. The current income eligibility standard \nfor seniors has been capped at just 130 percent. Under the current \nFederal poverty guidelines, a single senior cannot earn more than \n$12,740 per year to qualify. By raising the standard to 185 percent of \npoverty, the same senior can earn as much as $18,130 to qualify for \nfood. This will make a major difference in the lives of so many seniors \nwho are struggling with the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the National CSFP Association as well \nas several national and Michigan senior advocacy and faith-based \ngroups. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of these support letters be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National CSFP Association,\n\n                                  Farmington, NM, August 17, 2005.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: Thank you for your continuing \n     support of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \n     which provides an important buffer for our vulnerable \n     children and seniors each month. Your support has made a \n     difference and we appreciate your tireless efforts.\n       The National CSFP Association strongly supports your \n     efforts to re-introduce and pass the Senior Nutrition Act and \n     will work diligently to see that it happens this year. As you \n     know nearly 90% of our recipients are now seniors living \n     below 130% of Federal Poverty Level. For a household of one, \n     this is a maximum of $1,037 per month. While some changes \n     have been made in Medicare to help seniors buy prescriptions, \n     the rising fuel costs are still of great concern to those on \n     fixed incomes and many of those seniors qualifying for food \n     stamps due to medical cost deductions will lose the \n     deductions to income and subsequently the food stamps. By \n     amending the eligibility criteria for seniors served by CSFP \n     through the Senior Nutrition Act, the neediest of seniors \n     will continue to receive nutrition assistance, which is \n     crucial if they are to remain in good health.\n       Again, thank you for championing our nation's children and \n     seniors.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Vicki Metheny,\n\n                             ECHO, Inc., Food Programs Supervisor,\n                             President, National CSFP Association.\n\n[[Page S8413]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                              Michigan Association\n\n\n                                               of United Ways,\n\n                                  Lansing, MI, September 28, 2005.\n     Re commodity foods for seniors legislation.\n\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: The Michigan Association of United \n     Ways enthusiastically supports your efforts to introduce \n     legislation to make it easier for seniors to receive \n     commodity foods. Your legislation will enable seniors to \n     receive assistance from the Commodity Supplemental Food \n     Program if seniors receive Food Stamps or have income up to \n     185 percent of poverty.\n       On August 30, 2005 the U.S. Census released its annual \n     report on income, poverty, and health insurance coverage in \n     the United States. The statistics are alarming. 1.1 million \n     more people fell into poverty, bringing the ranks of poor \n     Americans to 37 million. This is 12.7 percent of the \n     population in 2004, compared to 35.9 million (12.5 percent) \n     in 2003.\n       The 63 United Ways in Michigan help to meet the basics \n     needs of vulnerable people of all ages. United Ways must \n     partner with government to protect the social safety net for \n     seniors. United Ways are well aware that many low-income \n     seniors run out of money before the end of the month and need \n     help. Your legislation will help insure that low-income \n     seniors receive the support that they deserve.\n       Thank you for your continuing concerns for all low-income \n     families in Michigan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Parks,\n     Director of Membership Services.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Elder Law of Michigan, Inc.,\n\n                                  Lansing, MI, September 28, 2005.\n     Senator Debbie Stabenow,\n     133 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of Elder Law of Michigan, \n     Inc. I want to voice our strong support for the re-\n     introduction of Senate bill 486 to increase the eligibility \n     for free commodity food for seniors from 130% of the poverty \n     level to 185% of the poverty level. In our public law \n     practice, we see thousands of Michigan seniors each year who \n     are going without food to pay for their other living and \n     health care expenses. We anticipate that rising automobile/\n     gas and home heating costs will dramatically erode older \n     citizens' ability to pay for their basic needs of food, \n     shelter, and medicine.\n       Increasingly we see seniors face the pressure to \n     financially support children and grandchildren in our state. \n     The pressure on these families due to the economic conditions \n     in our state and limited job opportunities set the stage for \n     financial exploitation and elder abuse. Providing additional \n     access to commodity food can alleviate some of the pressure \n     these low-income, multigenerational families experience.\n       Food is a basic human right. Thank you for your leadership \n     on this issue. Please contact me if I can provide any \n     additional support on this or other issues to improve the \n     well being of seniors in Michigan and the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Kate Birnbryer White,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Center for Civil Justice,\n\n                                  Saginaw, MI, September 21, 2005.\n     Re legislation to help seniors access commodities.\n\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: The Center for Civil Justice was \n     pleased to hear that you will be co-sponsoring a new version \n     of S. 468 (from the 108th Congress). The proposed legislation \n     will enable seniors to receive help from the Commodity \n     Supplemental Food Program (CFSP) if the seniors receive Food \n     Stamps or have income up to 185% of poverty.\n       I am writing to express our support for this initiative. \n     The Center for Civil Justice assists thousands of people each \n     year who call our Food and Nutrition Program Helpline for \n     information about federal food programs. We also work with \n     community organizations throughout Michigan who provide \n     emergency food and services to those in need. Through this \n     work, we are well aware that there are many seniors who need \n     help with food and who could benefit from the commodities \n     program.\n       In Michigan, seniors comprise approximately 17% of the Food \n     Stamp households. We know from talking to the seniors who \n     call our Food and Nutrition Helpline that many of these \n     households are struggling to pay for medical care and higher \n     gas bills. These expenses reduce the money they have \n     available to buy food. These seniors will benefit from \n     increased access to supplemental food commodities as a result \n     of the legislation.\n       Thank you for your continuing concern with assuring \n     adequate food for Michigan's most vulnerable households.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Terri L.

Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: NETWORK, a National Catholic Social \n     Justice Lobby, is pleased to learn that you are introducing a \n     senior nutrition bill. We strongly support the bill we have \n     seen in draft. We understand that the bill will increase to \n     185% of the poverty threshold, the level at which a senior \n     will be eligible for commodity supplemental food program. \n     There are many seniors in this nation who struggle with \n     decisions concerning purchase of food and medication, or \n     payment of household utilities. A program supporting a \n     greater number to benefit from supplemental nutritious foods \n     seems critical.\n       The U.S. Census Bureau report: Income, Poverty, and Health \n     Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2004, states that \n     nearly 3.5 million seniors lived at or below the poverty \n     threshold of $8,825 (individual) or $11,122 (couple) in 2004. \n     The current level of 130% of the poverty threshold ($11,472 \n     or $14,458) severely limits what a person/couple is able to \n     purchase. The proposed level of 185% ($16,326 or $20,575) \n     seems far more acceptable for ensuring that more seniors \n     receive food supplements which supply a more nutritious diet.\n       NETWORK is anxious to assist you in gaining passage of this \n     bill. Those who have gone before us, cared for us and raised \n     the present younger generations deserve to live in dignity, \n     without question of meeting basic needs. We hearken back to \n     the words of Leviticus, ``You shall rise up before the gray \n     haired and defer to one who is elder'' (19:32), and of \n     Matthew, ``Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the \n     least of these who are members of my family, you did it to \n     me.'' (25:40). Catholic Social Teaching further specifies \n     that, ``the poor have the single most urgent economic claim \n     on the conscience of the nation'' (Economic Justice for All).\n       When the bill is dropped, we will elicit the support of our \n     membership toward its passage. Please, let us know anything \n     else we can do to further assist in the passage of this bill.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                  Simone Campbell,\n                                             National Coordinator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 3762. A bill to designate segments of Fossil Creek, a tributary to \nthe Verde River in the State of Arizona, as wild and scenic rivers; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Kyl, in introducing a bill to designate Fossil Creek as a \n``wild and scenic river.'' A companion measure is being introduced \ntoday by Congressman Renzi and other members of the Arizona \ncongressional delegation.\n  Fossil Creek it is a thing of beauty. With its picturesque scenery, \nlush riparian ecosystem, unique geological features, and deep \niridescent blue pools and waterfalls, this tributary to the Wild and \nScenic Verde River and Lower Colorado River Watershed stretches 14 \nmiles through east central Arizona. It is home to a wide variety of \nwildlife, some of which are threatened or endangered species. Over 100 \nbird species inhabit the Fossil Creek area and use it to migrate \nbetween the range lowlands and the Mogollon-Colorado Plateau highlands. \nFossil Creek also supports a variety of aquatic species and is one of \nthe few perennial streams in Arizona with multiple native fish.\n  Fossil Creek was named in the 1800s when early explorers described \nthe fossil-like appearance of creek-side rocks and vegetation coated \nwith calcium carbonate deposits from the creek's water. In the early \n1900s, pioneers recognized the potential for hydroelectric power \ngeneration in the creek's constant and abundant spring-fed base-flow. \nThey claimed the channel's water rights and built a dam system and \ngenerating facilities known as the Childs-Irving hydro-project. Over \ntime, the project was acquired by Arizona Public Service, APS, one of \nthe State's largest eclectic utility providers serving more than a \nmillion Arizonans. Because Childs-Irving produced less then half of 1 \npercent of the total power generated by APS, the decision was made \nultimately to decommission the aging dam and restore Fossil Creek to \nits presettlement conditions.\n  APS has partnered with various environmental groups, Federal land \nmanagers, and State, tribal, and local governments to safely remove the \nChilds-Irving power generating facilities and restore the riparian \necosystem. In 2005, APS removed the dam system and returned full flows \nto Fossil Creek. Researchers predict Fossil Creek will soon become a \nfully regenerated Southwest native fishery providing a most valuable \nopportunity to reintroduce at least six threatened and endangered \nnative fish species as well as rebuild the native populations presently \nliving in the creek.\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\n  There is a growing need to provide additional protection and adequate \nstaffing and management at Fossil Creek. Recreational visitation to the \nriverbed is expected to increase dramatically, and by the Forest \nService's own admission, they aren't able to manage current levels of \nvisitation or the pressures of increased use. While responsible \nrecreation and other activities at Fossil Creek are to be encouraged, \nwe must also ensure the long-term success of the ongoing restoration \nefforts. Designation under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act would help to \nensure the appropriate level of protection and resources are devoted to \nFossil Creek. Already, Fossil Creek has been found eligible for ``wild \nand scenic'' designation by the Forest Service and the proposal has \nwidespread support from surrounding communities. All of the lands \npotentially affected by a designation are owned and managed by the \nForest Service and will not affect private property owners.\n  Mr. President, Fossil Creek is a unique Arizona treasure and would \nbenefit greatly from the protection and recognition offered through \n``wild and scenic'' designation. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/28/senate-section/article/S8414-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 544--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 20, 2006, AS ``NATIONAL \n               ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 544\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as ADHD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological disorder \n     that affects both children and adults, and can significantly \n     interfere with the ability of an individual to regulate \n     activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to tasks in \n     developmentally appropriate ways;\n       Whereas ADHD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the criminal justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas ADHD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 to 7 percent (4,000,000) \n     of young school-age children and an estimated 4 percent \n     (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and socio-\n     economic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies indicate that between 10 and 35 \n     percent of children with ADHD have a first-degree relative \n     with past or present ADHD, and that approximately one-half of \n     parents who had ADHD have a child with the disorder, \n     suggesting that ADHD runs in families and inheritance is an \n     important risk factor;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with \n     ADHD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults \n     with the disorder are diagnosed and less than half of \n     children and adults with the disorder receive treatment and, \n     furthermore, poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by ADHD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the \n     American Psychological Association, the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     and the National Institutes of Mental Health, among others, \n     recognize the need for proper diagnosis, education, and \n     treatment of ADHD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of ADHD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes as an obstacle for diagnosis and treatment;\n       Whereas lack of knowledge combined with issues of stigma \n     have a particularly detrimental effect on the diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n       Whereas there is a need for education of health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of ADHD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life can be \n     improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 20, 2006 as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (ADHD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all Americans to find out more about ADHD, \n     support ADHD mental health services, and seek the appropriate \n     treatment and support, if necessary;\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about ADHD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access and quality \n     of mental health services dedicated to improving the quality \n     of life of children and adults with ADHD; and\n       (5) calls on Federal, State, and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/28/senate-section/article/S8414-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4739.
