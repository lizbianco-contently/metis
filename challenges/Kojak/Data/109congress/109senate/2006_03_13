Mr. President, this morning we are starting consideration \nof the budget resolution which was reported out of the Committee on the \nBudget on Thursday. The chairman and ranking member are here and we \nwill open the debate this morning.\n  The Budget Act provides for up to 50 hours of debate. Therefore, I \nhope Senators will come to the Senate today and use that time for their \nopening statements.\n  This week will be quite busy as we consider the budget resolution \neach day and night as that clock ticks. We will finish the resolution \nthis week, and that will normally require full sessions with votes, \nwhich I expect. We would like to minimize the so-called vote-a-rama at \nthe end of the process. I know the two managers have been talking, are \ntalking, and will be working together in an effort to avoid that, if at \nall possible.\n  This week we will also complete the extension of the debt limit. The \nDemocratic leader and I are working on an agreement for the \nconsideration of that bill. I hope we can reach a reasonable period for \nthe debate on that must-do legislation. Needless to say, there is a lot \nof work to be done prior to the adjournment. We will stay in session as \nnecessary to give the managers the best opportunity to complete our \nbusiness.\n  This week we will complete action on the budget. And we will complete \naction on the debt limit. On Wednesday of this week, we will have a \njoint meeting with the House to hear an address by President Ellen \nJohnson Sirleaf of Liberia. That address will begin at 2 p.m.; \ntherefore, Senators should gather in the Senate Chamber at 1:30 so we \ncan proceed at 1:40 to the Hall of the House of Representatives.\n  Lastly, I remind my colleagues we have a rollcall vote scheduled for \n5:30 this evening. That vote will be on the confirmation of Leo Gordon \nto be a judge for the U.S. Court of International Trade. That will be \nthe first vote of the day.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the call of the quorum be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S1987-7", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1987-S1996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                                  2007\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consideration of the budget resolution, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Con. Res. 83) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2007, and including the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2006 and 2008 through 2011.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time until \n11:30 a.m. shall be equally divided.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now proceeding to the budget?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct. The budget is before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. GREGG. I begin by thanking the committee, the committee staff, \nboth the majority and Democratic side, for the assistance in getting us \nto this point. We had a markup last Thursday which was done very \nprofessionally. A lot of issues were raised. A lot of votes were taken. \nWe were able to complete the budget on a timely schedule pursuant to \nthe rules of the Senate.\n  Now we are in the Senate. As everyone knows, under the rules of the \nSenate, we have 50 hours on the bill. Then we have what is known as the \nvote-arama. The Senator from North Dakota and I have been talking. We \nhope\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nwe can coordinate things so that Members will be comfortable getting \ntheir amendments up and have adequate time and have certainty as to \nwhen their amendments are coming up, and in doing that, hopefully, \nactually reduce the vote-arama at the end. And cooperation would be \nhelpful.\n\n  Right off the bat, I thank the Senator from North Dakota and his \nstaff. They have been extraordinarily cooperative as we moved forward \nthroughout this process.\n  Let me ask Members, if Members have an amendment, all on our side, \ntell us about it so we can get you a time slot.\n  On the substance of the bill, the purpose of a budget, of course, is \nto be a blueprint for how the Government will spend its money in the \ncoming year. The year for our Government begins on October 1, 2006. We \nare already into the 2006 year, so this is the budget for 2007. It is \nimportant, when we are doing a budget, of course, to be reasonably \nrealistic about what the opportunities are, the demands are, what the \nneeds are for saving money, what the tax structure will be in the \ncountry. We have attempted to do that in this budget.\n  We began, basically, with the President's proposal. He sent up a \nbudget. Ironically, under the rules of the Congress, the President's \nbudget has no actual impact on the substance of the process. In fact, \nthe budget of the Congress is never signed by the President. It is a \ndocument entirely within the Congress. Clearly, the President gives his \nthoughts and his guidelines. He is in charge of the executive branch. \nWe take it seriously.\n  We have looked at the President's budget and used it as a template \nfor much of what we have done in this budget, although we have departed \nin a few significant ways. I congratulate the President for sending up \na budget that is responsible. He controlled spending on the \ndiscretionary side and the non-Defense accounts. He did make proposals \nin the area of entitlement spending which were significant and which \nwould bring about some restraint in the rate of growth, for example, of \nthe biggest entitlement, which is Medicare and pensions, and even in \nthe agricultural area he made some proposals. His budget is a \nlegitimate and effective document talking about how we should, as a \nGovernment, go forward relative to the spending which we are going to \nundertake in the year 2007.\n  We have, however, marked up the budget a little differently. Our \npurpose, honestly, my purpose is to reduce the deficit of the United \nStates. That is critical. We have a situation facing us as a people and \nas a Nation which is unique in our history in that we have this large \ngeneration called the baby boom generation. It is the largest \ngeneration in our history, with 70 million people, about twice the size \nof any other generation.\n  The baby boom generation is headed toward retirement. As they retire, \nit will put a huge strain on the operation of the fiscal house of the \nUnited States. That retirement begins in earnest in about the year 2008 \nand accelerates and peaks in the year 2030. At that point, we have \nserious issues relative to how we control our budget, and we should be \nfocusing on those concerns.\n  But in the short run, there are things we can do to bring the deficit \nunder control, and we should do this. This budget attempts to do that. \nIn fact, this budget will reduce the deficit of the United States in \nhalf over the next 4 years. That is a fairly significant step forward. \nAs a percentage of gross national product, by the year 2010, we will \nactually be down to about 1 percent of gross national product, which \nwill be well below the historical norm of deficits in this country.\n  Our deficit in the coming year, however, will be higher, and I will \nget into that discussion in a few minutes, but let me go back to this \nentitlement question because it is important as we start the discussion \nthat we frame it in the context of the issues that concern me the most.\n  We have outstanding at the Federal level, as a result of the coming \nretirement of the baby boom generation, an obligation of the Federal \nGovernment which amounts to $65 trillion. That is trillion, with a \n``T.'' It is hard to understand what a trillion is. I don't know what \nit is. I have heard all sorts of different explanations. I will try to \nput it in perspective. If you take all the taxes paid into the Federal \nGovernment since our country was founded, since we began to have taxes \nas a Federal Government in 1789, it represents $40 trillion. That is \nall taxes ever paid into the Federal Government. If we take the net \nworth of everyone in this country--their cars, their houses, their \nstock, whatever they own that is an asset, and we add it all up--the \nnet worth of the American people is $51 trillion. That is the second \nblue chart.\n  The total outstanding debt, therefore, of three major programs--\nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid--represents $65 trillion. So it \nis more than what has been paid in taxes since the beginning of time, \nas far as this country is concerned, and it is more than the net worth \nof our Nation. It is a staggering figure. That is a 75-year figure. And \nit is all driven by the fact that this baby boom generation is so \nlarge, and when it retires it will demand so much in the way of \nservices.\n  What is the issue? The issue is, if we have this type of an outyear \nliability, we need to do things today to try to structure our house and \nget it under control. In the last budget cycle, for the first time in 8 \nyears, we stepped forward as Republicans--I think we had two Democratic \nvotes--we stepped forward as Republicans and passed what was known as \nthe reconciliation bill to reduce entitlement spending by $39 billion \nover 5 years. Anyone would have thought we were scorching the earth in \npassing that bill from the outcry from the other side of the aisle, \nthat all poor people, all people of need were being thrown out the door \nas a result of that reduction. Well, to try to put it in perspective, \nit was $39 billion. Actually, within that, the most significant item \nwas the Medicaid item, which was $5 billion over 5 years, or in that \nperiod of 5 years, the Medicaid system was going to spend $1.2 \ntrillion.\n\n  So $5 billion and $1.2 trillion would have meant that Medicaid--which \nwas going to grow at 40 percent over that 5-year period, after this \nscorched-earth policy which we put in place, according to the folks on \nthe other side of the aisle--Medicaid would still grow at 40 percent \nover that 5-year period.\n  We did not even move it a percentage point. We moved it a fraction of \na percentage point in the rate of growth of Medicaid. But it was a \ndifficult exercise to get that through this Congress because we got no \nDemocratic votes--well, we got two, I am sorry. And we had to pass it \nhere with the Vice President voting for it.\n  Well, we are now in an election year, and the President sent up a \nbudget which, in an almost heroic way, he said, even though it is an \nelection year, we should address some of these entitlement accounts, \nwith Medicare being the biggest. He suggested $35 billion in savings in \nMedicare over the 5-year period. Medicare will spend $2.2 billion over \nthat period, and it would mean the rate of growth of Medicare, instead \nof being 38 percent, would be 35 percent. I believe those are the \nnumbers. I am not sure of those two numbers, but I think those are the \nnumbers.\n  In any event, it became very clear from statements made by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle they were opposed to that. In \nfact, immediately--as soon as the President sent it up--they started \nsaying Medicare was going to be slashed--of course, it was still going \nto grow at 35 percent--and that senior citizens would be harmed. That \ndrumbeat immediately met it, as it did when the President suggested we \nshould do something about Social Security. So no progress was made on \nthat side with that, and, unfortunately, on our side of the aisle there \nwas also a fair amount of hesitancy on that issue.\n  I went to the chairmen of the various committees that the President \nsuggested do these entitlement changes, and they all said they could \nnot get the votes on their own committees to pass them out because the \ncommittees are ratioed in a way that means if you have one Republican \nwho opposes it, you cannot pass out these types of things, and in each \ncommittee there was at least one Republican, unfortunately, who opposed \nit.\n  So it became fairly clear to me, regrettably, that a major \nreconciliation bill this year, on the side of entitlements--because it \nis an election year--was not going to accomplish much\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nother than to give people who were not willing to be constructive on \nthe issue, and wanted to create a political issue, a sort of free shot \nat people who were trying to be constructive on the issues, \nspecifically the President. So we did not put reconciliation \ninstructions in this bill. But we still are aggressive in the accounts \nwhich we think are important and which will lead to getting us back to \nreducing the deficit in half.\n  What are some of the other structures of this bill that I think are \npositive? Well, specifically, in the entitlement accounts--well, let me \nstep back. In the area of discretionary spending, the President sent up \na number, which was $30 billion over last year's spending. Last year, \nwe spent about $843 billion on discretionary accounts. Now, \ndiscretionary accounts--for those of you listening who don't understand \nthese arcane terms we use around here--discretionary accounts are for \nspending we do every year which we do not have to do, but we do it \nbecause it involves the necessity obligations of the Government. But it \ncan be adjusted each year.\n  Entitlement accounts, which I was talking about before--Medicaid, \nMedicare, Social Security--those accounts spend automatically. They do \nnot adjust every year. If you meet certain conditions of income, of \neconomic well-being, of health, of experience, you have a right to \ncertain payments. Those are called entitlements. To control those, you \nhave to change the law. That is why you have to have a reconciliation \nbill.\n  To control spending, you have to reduce or adjust the spending in \nwhat is known as an appropriations bill as it comes through the \nCongress every year. So the Congress has its most significant impact on \ndiscretionary spending in that the budget can set a limit on how much \nmoney can be spent by the Federal Government under these discretionary \naccounts.\n  Now, discretionary accounts would be things such as national defense, \neducation, and laying out roads in some instances--although that is \npretty much off-budget now--environmental concerns, some health care \naccounts.\n  The President sent up this number, which was $30 billion above last \nyear. Last year, we spent $843 billion. This year, the President's \nnumber was $870 billion. It was rescored by CBO to be $873 billion.\n  So we said that is a reasonable number. We are going to hold that \nnumber. That is called the top-line discretionary cap. So all \ndiscretionary spending in the Federal Government will be held at $873 \nbillion under this cap.\n\n  What does that mean? That means, essentially, if anybody wants to \ncome to the floor and spend more money than that, they are going to \nhave to get 60 votes to do it because they will be violating the budget \ndiscretionary cap. That is an enforcement mechanism we have around \nhere, and sometimes the 60 votes are here and it gets waived, but, \nhopefully, people will be aggressive in protecting this number.\n  With that number, defense spending goes up, under the President's \nproposal, about $28 billion of the $30 billion. And social spending, or \nnondefense spending--not all social spending--basically is held flat. \nIn fact, in some accounts it actually goes down.\n  We have aligned ourselves with the President's top-line number in our \nbill and recognize we need to make some adjustments in the way it was \nallocated, although our committee does not do allocations. That is done \nby the Appropriations Committee. We have suggested different \nallocations than what the President might have used. We put, for \nexample, an additional $1.5 billion into education. We put an \nadditional $1.5 billion into health care. We put an additional $2 \nbillion into border security.\n  If we were the appropriating committee, that is what we would do. But \nwe do not have control over this. This is entirely a decision made by \nthe Appropriations Committee. But it is a statement of what the Budget \nCommittee believed was a good allocation because we are required by law \nto allocate, but our allocations have no force of law. The only \nallocation that has force of law is, of course, that done by the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran of \nMississippi.\n  So within the discretionary caps we have moved money around. There \nwill be a lot of amendments that come to this floor over the next week \nas we debate this bill that will try to move the money around again. I \nwould simply note that most of them will be statements of what people \nwant but will have virtually no impact, even if they are successful in \nwhat people get because, once again, the budget does not control the \nallocations. The Appropriations Committee controls the allocations. \nEven if the cap were to be lifted, it would be entirely up to the \nAppropriations Committee as to where the extra money would go.\n  But we feel strongly, or at least I feel strongly, and the \nRepublicans on the Budget Committee--this was reported out of committee \non a party-line vote, as it has been the last few years--we feel \nstrongly that rationing, controlling, being aggressive in controlling \nthe discretionary accounts is critical.\n  Now, that brings me to the second topic. There is a lot of resistance \nto that, by the way. You would think that when you are running these \ntypes of deficits that people would be willing to be fiscally \nresponsible around here, but, believe me, there is a lot of resistance \nbecause in general terms people are always willing to be fiscally \nresponsible, but when they get specific, they have programs they want \nto see increased, which is human nature, I guess.\n  Within the budget we have an allocation for defense. But what has \nhappened recently--and this is an issue I have some concerns about--is \nthat since the war on terrorism has begun, a war we did not ask for but \nwhich we are prosecuting aggressively, and I strongly support the \nPresident's efforts to fight terrorism--we have felt the need--it is an \nabsolute need, and I do not think it is argued on either side of the \naisle--to make sure we fully support our military in a way that is \nappropriate, and especially in a way that those men and women in the \nfield in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places have the things they need \nto fight effectively.\n  So what has happened is we have created this new budget process \naround here. We have the basic budget process, which is the core, which \ncomes under the discretionary account, which I have been talking about, \nthe $873 billion number, of which approximately half will be defense \nmoney. That is shown in green on the chart. That is what we call the \ncore defense budget, national defense budget. That operates the \nnational defense system.\n  But on top of that, as part of the warfighting effort, there has been \nan emergency funding bill every year now for 4 years in a row, which \nhas been very significant. Traditionally, emergencies used to run \nabout--we would have emergency spending in the Federal Government of \nabout $16 billion, on the average, throughout the 1990s. They \nrepresented usually disasters that had to be dealt with. Many of them \nwere farm disasters. Some of them were floods.\n  Now we are seeing basically a process where emergency spending has \nbecome what I call a shadow budget, but at a minimum, it is an \nalternative budgeting process where you essentially have two budgets \naround here. You have the budget, which is fairly aggressively \ndisciplined through points of order, many of which I have put in place, \nsome of which were put in place with the cooperation of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, some of which were put in place by my predecessor, \nSenator Nickles, and some of which were put in place by Senator \nDomenici, the predecessor of Senator Nickles.\n\n  But budget points of order lie in order to discipline us on the floor \nso the core spending of the Defense Department and other discretionary \naccounts is reviewed. It goes to the authorizing committees. It comes \nout of the authorizing committees. It comes to the floor and gets \nreviewed. If certain things are not appropriate, in some instances a \nbudget point of order lies against it.\n  This second budget which we now have around here--and it is an \nentirely separate budget. In fact, the average amount spent annually is \nabout $90 billion, which would run the State of New Hampshire for about \n20 years--one emergency budget. So it is a pretty big budget. That \nbudget has no controls at all. Essentially, that comes up here as an \nemergency. It does not go through the authorizing committee. It goes\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\nthrough the appropriating committee, which is very effectively led by \nthe President pro tempore, who is now presiding.\n  But the fact is, it does not have any of the controls that have \ntraditionally gone with regular budgeting, and it has become basically \na fact of life. We are not going to get around it. We are going to be \nin this war for a while. It is going to be expensive.\n  So I feel, and there are others who feel--I think the Senator from \nNorth Dakota agrees with me on this--we have to do something to make \nsure there is some review of this that puts it more in the camp of \nbeing a traditional budget rather than an extraordinary emergency \nbudget which has no discipline to it at all.\n  So in this bill, we essentially pick a number, $90 billion. Now, \nhistorically, the White House was not sending up any number for these \nemergencies. In fact, in the years 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 they sent \nup zero. They assumed no emergency at all. That was a bit of \ngamesmanship, in my humble opinion, to be kind.\n  Last year, we, as a Budget Committee, put in a figure of $50 billion. \nSo this year they assumed $50 billion. And when I asked the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense why they put in $50 billion, they said they did \nnot put it in. It was in there only because last year the Congress put \nit in, and they felt they needed to have it in there in order to \nreflect what the Congress wanted last year and they didn't think it had \nany relevance at all.\n  That being the case, what we decided to do this year is take the \naverage of the last 4 years and put that in as the number because I \nwant to get a reasonably accurate number so we have some truth in \nbudgeting. So we put in a number of $90 billion for emergencies that we \nare assuming, which is why--if you go back to the first chart--in our \nbudget the deficit actually exceeds the President's deficit because the \nPresident, in his budget submission, did not have the full cost of the \nemergencies which we know are coming up. I believed we should have it \nin there, so our budget deficit is projected as higher.\n  My hope--and I think it is a reasonable hope--is that this will not \ngo on forever. We are, hopefully, going to start drawing down troops, \nin Iraq especially, soon. And the cost of that war will recede. \nObviously, the cost of Katrina, which was a big part of the cost last \nyear, is already in place. That is pretty well spent out, or has been \nput in place--over $100 billion for the Gulf States.\n  So, hopefully, this number will come down. But we are assuming next \nyear, to the extent it comes down, it will be about $90 billion. In \nthat $90 billion we are assuming a budget deficit that is about $40 \nbillion higher than the President's, based on the additional money we \nput in for the emergencies.\n  Now, in order to put a little discipline into this exercise, we also \nput in a new point of order. I want to be very forthright about this. \nIf we go over that $90 billion, there will be a point of order that \nwill be put in against emergencies. They really should not be called \nemergencies because they are known commodities that are coming up here. \nThey should be called extra budgeting for the war on terrorism.\n  What we have done is put in a point of order which says if you go \nover the $90 billion, there has to be a more serious justification of \nwhy that money is spent, considering the average is $90 billion over \nthe last 5 years, and it can be raised with a 60-vote point of order to \ntry to get that discussion going around here. It is a minor attempt--\nnot a very big one--to try to put some discipline into this exercise.\n  In addition, because of the fact that I still believe entitlements \nare the biggest issue the Federal Government has to face and \nrecognizing that I was not successful in convincing my colleagues to do \nreconciliation this year, if you look at this chart, you will see the \ncost of entitlements going through the roof, especially Medicare. If \nyou take Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security and combine them, we \nwill spend more in 2030 than we spend today on the entire Federal \nGovernment. They keep going up. Basically we would have to radically \nincrease taxes on working Americans beginning in about 2015 and ratchet \nup dramatically by the year 2030 to remain solvent, well over \nhistorical norms, if we are not going to do something about \nentitlements before then.\n  In order to address that, I have asked for a new point of order. I \ndidn't ask for it. This idea came from Mr. Leavitt, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. He suggested we put in place a tree which \nessentially says that if Medicare, which is supposed to be an insurance \nprogram, everybody goes to work and they get a Medicare insurance tax, \nit is supposed to accumulate and you are supposed to be able to pay for \nyour retirement health care through the insurance tax. Parts of \nMedicare don't have the insurance. Part B, Part D are a little \ndifferent, but the basic Part A is supposed to be fully insured by \nthen. If the Medicare accounts dip into the general fund--and they \nshouldn't be dipping into the general fund at all--for more than 45 \npercent of the cost of Medicare so they are basically not an insurance \naccount anymore, they are basically a general fund account, which means \nthat the general taxpayer is paying them twice--they are paying at the \nworkplace, and then they are paying them out of the general fund--then \nat that point, if the Medicare trustees tell us that is going to happen \nfor 2 years in a row, it is going to be more than 45 percent in 1 year \nand more than 45 percent the next year, then a point of order arises \nwhich says we need 60 votes to spend money on these entitlements, new \nmoney. The idea is to simply generate the discussion necessary to get \nsome constructive activity around here on the issue of how we control \nspending in light of projected deficits caused by the baby boom \ngeneration retirement.\n  There is going to be a lot of discussion today about tax policy. It \nis important to understand our view of tax policy. Obviously, there are \ntwo ways you address the deficit. You address it through spending and \nthrough revenues. I take the basic view that we are not an undertaxed \nsociety. I think Americans pay a lot of taxes. Whether they get what \nthey deserve for what they pay in taxes, I am not so sure, but they \ncertainly pay a lot of taxes. We will see charts from the other side of \nthe aisle--I can't count how many times I have seen these charts, but \nwe will see charts coming from the other side of the aisle which will \nsay that revenues have dropped precipitously since President Clinton \nwas President and that they have only started to recover incrementally \nin the last few years. The representation will be made that the \nmajority of this drop is a function of cutting taxes which was put in \nplace by President Bush in the first 2 years of his Presidency.\n  Let me say that I disagree with that representation. We were in the \nbiggest bubble in the history of the world. It was a bigger bubble than \nthe tulip bubble, bigger than the south seas bubble. It was the \nInternet bubble of the 1990s when people were speculating and creating \npaper money without anything behind it through speculation on stocks \nrelative to Internet assets. That bubble generated tremendous revenues \nas people sold stock and bought stock. But when it collapsed, which it \ninevitably would and did--and interestingly enough, there is a great \nhistory of these bubbles, all these bubbles collapsed, and they were \nall driven by the same philosophy: Somebody had the belief that the \nbasic economics had changed and something had been invented which was \ngoing to circumvent the business cycle and there would be no more \nbusiness cycles. It is a concept which people believed in in the late \n1990s. They generally believed that the technology advantages were \ngoing to cause us to expand revenues that would allow them to invest \nand speculate at rates which were massive and historical proportions \nnever seen before.\n  When that bubble collapsed, it generated a recession which obviously \ncontracted Federal revenues. On top of that recession, we had the \nattack of \n9/11 which generated even a larger recession. The economic damage done \nby \n9/11 was massive. The reallocation of resources that had to occur, the \nbasic grinding to a halt and hiatus taken relative to investment for a \nwhile as a result of Wall Street being in chaos for a period of time, \nall of this led to an even more severe recession or potentially more \nsevere. However, prior to that event, the President had put in his \nfirst tax cut. Then after that event, he put in the second tax cut. \nThose two tax\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\ncuts together were the perfect relief, the perfect formula for \nbasically curing a recession and making it a more shallow recession \nthan one might have expected. We are fortunate that we didn't actually \nfall into a deep and severe recession during that period. The primary \nreason we did not was because of the tax cuts.\n  Another factor of these tax cuts was that they were oriented toward \nthe productive side of our economy so that they created an incentive \nfor entrepreneurs to invest. As a result of that investment, they \ncreated an incentive for people to generate economic activity. What \ncomes from that? Jobs. We have had a massive economic expansion in \njobs. We have had a massive expansion as a result of the incentives \ncreated in the tax law.\n  Another thing was created by that. When people have more jobs, when \nthere is more economic activity, we get more revenue. This chart \nreflects that dramatically. We see revenues jumping here. In fact, in \n2005, we had the largest increase in revenues in our history. If you go \nbefore 2005, you will see revenues coming up. But they are coming up \ndramatically, 6 percent, 7 percent. About an average of 6.5 percent is \nthe projected revenue increase. It is a function of the fact that we \nhave in place incentives today such as the capital gains and dividends \nrates that basically create an atmosphere where people are willing to \ngo out and invest. As a result of those investments, they generate \ncapital activity, which creates jobs, which creates taxable events and \ncreates income to the Federal Government. In fact, as we can see from \nthis chart, the historical level of receipts for the country is about \n18.4 percent of gross national product. Yes, we dropped down \ndramatically, but now we are seeing that line come up dramatically. We \nwill reach a historical level of revenues fairly soon--if not next \nyear, certainly the year after--and receipts will be back to what they \nshould be as a percentage of gross national product because we will \nhave put in place an economic engine to generate revenues, called a tax \ncode, which creates an incentive for people to be productive and take \nrisks and create jobs. That is what we wanted.\n\n  The other side is going to hold up chart after chart which says, the \ntax cut was this big for this group, this big for this group, implying \nthat what they want to do is raise those taxes. We don't happen to \nthink raising taxes is the way you keep this economic activity going. \nWe think the way you keep the economic activity going is to continue to \ndrive the incentive for people to invest, take risk and, as a result, \ncreate jobs which creates economic activity and basically creates \nrevenues.\n  Another thing this chart shows that I believe is true is that you \ncan't close this gap between expenditures and receipts on the revenue \nside unless you are willing to significantly increase the historic tax \nburden on the American people. You can't do it. You have to address the \nspending side of the ledger. You have to be willing to slow the rate of \ngrowth on discretionary accounts and hopefully soon on the entitlement \naccounts of the Federal Government, but you can't get there on the \nrevenue side. And you certainly can't get there on the revenue side \nonce the baby boom generation starts to retire because the numbers are \ntoo staggering. You would basically tax the young people, the working \nAmericans, out of an existence, out of the capacity to have an \nexistence of a high quality of life which we should be passing on to \nthem, not taking from them, by creating a burden that is so high in the \nFederal Government that they can't afford it.\n  So the issue is, generate revenues but don't do it by raising taxes. \nGenerate revenues by creating an atmosphere where people are willing to \ntake risk, be entrepreneurs, create jobs and, as a result, create \neconomic activity.\n  We have a fundamental disagreement between the two sides of the \naisle. That has been obvious for a long time. If you listened to \nSenator Kerry when he ran for President, the theme of his campaign was: \nIf we hadn't had those tax cuts, things would be great in this country. \nI take the opposite view. The tax cuts were what gave us less of a \nrecession and what is giving us a recovery which is continuous and has \ncreated jobs. I think the last job numbers were something like 243,000 \nnew jobs, which is staggering, or a drop in unemployment claims or \nsomething. It was a huge number. We are seeing an economic continuation \nof economic activity which has been historic in its robustness and \ncontinuation. It is a function of the fact that we now have a tax code \nwhich to some degree--it isn't a great tax code--addresses what \ngenerates revenue which is that you give people an incentive to go out \nthere and be risk takers and create jobs.\n  On another issue of revenue where the Senator from North Dakota and I \ndo agree--and we have accepted language which he suggested or we are \ngoing to before we finish--we believe strongly there are a lot of taxes \nwhich should be paid the Federal Government that are not being paid. We \nhad testimony on this before our committee. I am not talking about drug \nmoney; I am talking about people underreporting. The Senator from North \nDakota has been aggressive in pointing this out, and correctly so. We \ncan collect more money. We don't get the score for that, unfortunately. \nEven though we are going to increase significantly the amount of money \nthat will flow to the general revenue services for the purposes of \naudits--and they tell us that is going to generate between 10 and 40, \nmaybe even $50 billion of revenue we are not getting today--we don't \nget the score for that. CBO won't score it. Still it is what we should \ndo. So on the revenue side we are going to do that.\n  That brings me to my conclusion so that we can hear from the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. We have an obligation to do a budget. We as a nation \nshould not go forward without a budget in place; it is not appropriate \nto running a fiscal house. A lot of people can disagree with this \nbudget--and just about everybody who comes up to me seems to--but the \nfact is, it is a budget which has made decisions. You can disagree or \nagree with them. Over the next 50 hours you can offer amendments to try \nand change it. But at the end of the day, a government that is spending \n$2.8 trillion needs to have some guideposts as to how it will be spent. \nThere needs to be a blueprint. There needs to be definition. Every \nAmerican who runs a household works off a budget, and it would be \ntotally irresponsible if we did not have a budget.\n  I hope the other side of the aisle will offer a budget as their \nalternative. There have been some rumblings that they may. In committee \nthey offered a series of amendments which would have significantly \nraised spending and significantly raised taxes. If that is their \nbudget, fine. But put a budget on the table. We have put our budget on \nthe table. We think it is reasonable. There are things I would have \ndone. I would have gone further in accounts if I had had the ability to \npull it off. But independent of that, this budget is a responsible \nbudget. It addresses spending in a responsible way, and it puts in \nplace enforcement mechanisms which allow us as a Congress to put at \nleast warning signs in the road when we start to get off the road of \nfiscal responsibility.\n  I yield the floor and appreciate the courtesy of the Senator.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, for his many courtesies during the budget process and \nthe budget hearings. There has been full consultation with respect to \nthe operations of the committee, the hearings that we have held, the \nway we have conducted the markup, the way we will proceed here on the \nfloor. I thank him very much for that set of courtesies. I also thank \nhim for his professionalism. There are many places he and I agree. I \nthink both of us would be the first to acknowledge that we are on an \nunsustainable course and that the country is going to have to face up \nto these growing deficits and debt. And the sooner we do it, the \nbetter.\n\n  With that said, I do disagree with this budget. I don't think it \nmeets the needs of our time. I don't think it faces up to this rapidly \ngrowing debt. I don't think it has the right priorities for the \nAmerican people. And I don't think it has the right balance.\n  If there is one message I would want to communicate, it is this: The \ndebt is the threat. We hear a lot of talk about deficits, but really \nthe threat to our country is the growing indebtedness of our country, \nan indebtedness that is increasingly being financed by foreigners.\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\n  How did we get into this mess? We can go back to 2001 when the \nPresident told us that if we would adopt his financial plan, everything \nwould go well. He told us:\n\n       [W]e can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  That is what he told us back in 2001. Now we are able to check the \nrecord and see, was the President right? This chart shows very clearly \nthe President was wrong. We had a $236 billion surplus in the year \nbefore he took office, and this is the fiscal record since. The \nPresident's plan has plunged us into deep deficit, the largest deficits \nin our country's history.\n  The next year, 2002, the President revised his position and said:\n\n        . . . Our budget will run a deficit that will be small and \n     short-term. . . .\n\n  He retreated from the assertion that we were not going to have \ndeficits because obviously that proved wrong. Then he said the deficits \nare going to be small and short term. That was the next year. Now we \nare able to check that statement and see if that was right.\n  Once again, the President was simply wrong. The deficits have not \nbeen small and short term; they have been large and long term. In fact, \nvirtually every year, the deficits have gotten worse. In the first year \nunder the President's plan, we had a $158 billion deficit. In 2003, \nthat exploded to $378 billion. It increased even more in 2004 to $413 \nbillion. Then we had some improvement in 2005 with $319 billion. In \n2006, we are now forecasting once again the deficit going up.\n  Far more serious than the deficit is the increase in the debt because \nthe debt is increasing much more rapidly than the size of the deficits. \nI indicated for 2006, we are anticipating a deficit now of $371 \nbillion, but the debt is going to increase by $654 billion.\n  I find very often people are confused on this point. They think the \ndeficit is the amount by which the debt increases, and that is not the \ncase. The biggest difference is Social Security funds that are in \ntemporary surplus that are being used under the President's plan to pay \nfor other things--to pay for tax cuts, to pay other bills. And when you \nadd up the deficit and the amount being taken from Social Security, \nwhich has to be paid back, and other trust funds that are also being \ndiverted and being used for other purposes, what we find is the debt in \nthis year will increase not by $371 billion, the amount of the deficit, \nbut instead by $654 billion. That is why I say the debt is the threat.\n  The next year after 2002, the President, in 2003, no longer made the \nargument that the deficits were going to be small and short term \nbecause that was clearly not going to be the case. Now he revised his \nargument for the second time when he said:\n\n       Our budget gap is small by historical standards.\n\n  That is not really right, either, because here is the record with \nrespect to the deficits in comparison to back in 1970, 36 years of \ncomparisons. We can see the deficit under the President's plan has been \nthe largest in dollar terms in our history. In fact, he is in first, \nsecond, and third place. He has the top three deficits in our country's \nhistory.\n  There is a new report out that says the deficits as reported are \nthemselves understated. Not only is the debt going up more rapidly than \nthe deficits, but this is a report about what would happen if we were \nunder the kind of accounting system virtually every company in America \nis under, accrual accounting. Here is what it says. This is a Gannett \nNews Service report from March 3 of this year:\n\n       If the United States kept its books like General Motors and \n     nearly every other business in the country, the 2005 budget \n     deficit would be $760 billion and rising, not $319 billion \n     and falling, as is commonly reported. . . .\n\n  They go on to ask the question:\n\n       How can two reports on the same budget be so different? \n     It's a matter of what's counted. The budget figures usually \n     bandied about in Washington are the amounts the Government \n     takes in and spends each year. The financial report, which \n     has been an annual requirement since the mid-1990s, does what \n     businesses are required to do: include the cost of promised \n     benefits.\n\n  If that were done, the deficit for 2005 would not have been $319 \nbillion, the deficit would have been $760 billion.\n  I am increasingly persuaded that the language we use in Washington \nmisleads people. I go back to when President Bush came in and we were \ntold we were going to have $5.6 trillion surpluses. It was never true. \nMuch of that money was Social Security money. There wasn't much of a \nsurplus at all. It was a temporary surplus, but every dollar of that \nmoney was going to be needed.\n  This shows that if we were on an accrual basis such as virtually \nevery other institution in this country operates on, we would not have \nhad a deficit of $319 billion in 2005, we would have had a deficit of \n$760 billion.\n\n  Then in 2004, the President changed his argument once again. He went \nfrom there are going to be no deficits, to they are going to be small \nand short term, to they are small by historical standards. When all of \nthose proved wrong, then the President said: I am going to cut the \ndeficit in half over the next 5 years. This is what he said in August \nof 2004:\n\n       So I can say to you that the deficit will be cut in half \n     over the next five years. . . .\n\n  I think the President will be proved wrong once again. Why? Because \nin reaching that calculation, the President simply left out things. He \nleft out any war costs past 2007. He left out all the costs of fixing \nthe alternative minimum tax, which will cost $1 trillion to fix. He \ndidn't put any money in his budget for it past this year.\n  When we add back in the items the President has left out and we go \nbeyond the 5 years in his budget to capture the full effect of his \nproposed tax cuts, what we see is some modest improvement during the 5 \nyears in terms of the deficit--that is not true of the debt, by the \nway; it is true of the deficit--but past the 5 years, things get much \nworse as the full effects of the President's tax cuts take effect. Here \nis why.\n  This chart shows the full effect of the President's proposed tax \ncuts. The President's budget only goes to this dotted line. But look \nwhat happens beyond the dotted line in terms of the cost of his tax \ncut. It absolutely explodes. Of course, not all this is captured in his \nbudget.\n  Similarly, none of the costs beyond fiscal year 2006 are in his \nbudget for fixing the alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum \ntax, the old millionaire's tax, is rapidly becoming a middle-class tax \ntrap. It costs $1 trillion to fix over 10 years. The President doesn't \nhave a dime in his budget to do it beyond 2006.\n  The President has what I would call a rosy scenario. He says he is \ngoing to cut the deficit in half, but it is largely based on a fiction. \nIt is not really a budget at all.\n  On the alternative minimum tax, again the President has nothing in \nhis budget past 2006 to deal with it. Mr. President, 3.6 million \ntaxpayers were affected in 2005. By 2010, there will be 29 million \ntaxpayers affected. And the President does nothing to address this \nneed. There is no money in his budget past 2006 to face up to it.\n  But that is not the only place the President has understated the \ncosts. With respect to the war, in 2006 and 2007, the supplementals he \nhas provided, he has $118 billion budgeted. The CBO says $312 billion \nis needed.\n  Once again, the President is badly understating the true cost to the \ncountry and, as a result, winds up with a misleading budget result.\n  When I say the debt is the threat--and I hope, if people take nothing \nelse away from my discussion today, they will begin to understand that \nthe great threat to this country is the burgeoning debt of our Nation. \nThe debt is the threat.\n  As I have indicated, the President has funded the war with a series \nof supplementals. The chairman of the committee had this chart up as \nwell. In 2006, $118 billion; in 2007, he is only asking for $50 billion \nat this point. Really, is that what the war is likely to cost? Is all \nof a sudden the need for these additional funds going to be cut more \nthan 50 percent? Or is the President playing hide the ball from us in \nterms of these costs?\n  When I talk about the debt, the President early on acknowledged how \nimportant it is to face up to the debt. This is what he said in 2001:\n\n       . . . My budget pays down a record amount of national debt. \n     We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. \n     That will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever.\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\n     Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money that \n     we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to our \n     children and grandchildren.\n\n  The President was exactly right. I agree with every one of these \nwords in terms of the need to pay down the debt and we should not be \nshuffling this responsibility off on our children and grandchildren. \nThat is what the President said. He said he would have maximum paydown \nof the debt.\n  Let's look and see what has actually happened because, once again, \nthe President was simply wrong. There has been no paydown of the debt. \nThis is what the debt was at the end of his first year. We don't hold \nhim responsible for what happened the first year because he is \noperating under the previous administration's budget.\n  At the end of the first year, the debt was $5.8 trillion. At the end \nof this year, the debt will be $8.6 trillion. The President said he \nwould have maximum paydown of debt. There is no paydown of debt here. \nThe debt has exploded. And if the President's budget or the budget that \nis offered on the floor is adopted, at the end of the next 5 years, the \ndebt will be $11.8 trillion--a national debt that will have more than \ndoubled since the end of the President's first year in office, all of \nthis before the baby boom generation retires.\n  This President has racked up already more debt than any President in \nhistory and by a large measure. The debt limit has already increased \nover $3 trillion: $450 billion in 2002 was added to the debt limit; in \n2003, $984 billion; in 2004, $800 billion; now this week, they are \nasking for another almost $800 billion increase in the debt limit. That \nis why I say the debt is the threat.\n\n  And what are the ramifications? Here is one that I find most \nstunning. It has taken 42 Presidents--all of these Presidents pictured \nhere going back to the time of George Washington, through every \nPresident, including the President's father, and then President \nClinton--it took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 trillion of \nexternal debt, our debt held by foreigners. This President has more \nthan doubled that amount in 5 years.\n  This is an utterly unsustainable course. It is an absolutely \nunsustainable course. Unfortunately, in this budget, nothing is being \ndone about it except to make it much worse.\n  The result of these extraordinary debts being held by foreigners--and \nthere was a recent article in the Washington Post that indicates now \nthat foreigners hold almost 50 percent of the U.S. debt. It used to be \nthat we would borrow from ourselves to finance this debt. Not any more. \nNow we are borrowing from every country all around the world. We have \nborrowed over $680 billion from the Japanese. We have borrowed more \nthan $250 billion from the Chinese. We have borrowed more than $230 \nbillion from the United Kingdom and, my favorite, we have borrowed more \nthan $100 billion from the Caribbean Banking Centers. Why, we have even \nborrowed $60 billion, more than $60 billion, from South Korea.\n  This is a course that is utterly unsustainable. Chairman Greenspan \nhas said it. The Comptroller General of the United States has said it. \nThe head of the Congressional Budget Office has said it.\n  Now we have this budget on the floor, and this budget basically is a \nstay-the-course budget. It keeps running up the debt. It keeps running \nup the debt, and in record amounts.\n  If that is what you want to support, I would say to my colleagues, \nvote for this budget. If you think the appropriate course for the \ncountry is record additions to our debt, then vote for this budget. \nBecause in this budget, they have left out 10-year numbers, so they \nhide the effect of the tax cut proposals of the President. They don't \nhave funding for the ongoing war costs beyond 2007. They don't fund the \nalternative minimum tax reform beyond 2006. They have left out entirely \nthe President's Social Security privatization proposal.\n  If we put back some of those things that have been left out, instead \nof the chart that the chairman showed with these red blocks with the \nbudget deficit going down or appearing to go down, if you add back the \nomitted costs and you add back the money that is being taken from \nSocial Security that adds to the debt--all of it has to be paid back--\nand you add the associated interest costs, what you find is the debt is \ngoing up each and every year of this budget proposal by more than $600 \nbillion.\n  In 2007, the debt is going to go up $680 billion. In 2008, it is \ngoing to go up $656 billion. In 2009, it is going to go up $635 \nbillion. In 2010, it is going to go up $622 billion. In 2011, it is \ngoing to go up $662 billion.\n  Now, unless somebody thinks I am just imagining these numbers, making \nthem up, let's look at what is in the budget offered by our colleagues, \ntheir calculation, their calculation of how much the debt is going to \ngo up during this period. And, remember, they have left out war costs \npast September 7, 2007. They have left out the need to fix the \nalternative minimum tax. They have left out the associated interest \ncosts. But even their calculations--even their calculations--show the \ndebt going up this year, 2007, by $663 billion; in 2008, $577 billion; \nin 2009, $536 billion; in 2010, $513 billion; in 2011, $539 billion. \nThis debt is running out of control.\n  If we look at what are the causes, it is very simple. We are spending \nmore money than we are raising in revenue. That is why we have \nexplosions of deficit and debt. We are spending more than we are \nraising, and our colleagues on the other side don't want to reduce \ntheir spending to the amount of revenue they are able to provide, nor \nare they willing to raise the revenue to meet their spending. The \nresult is an explosion of deficit and debt.\n  This shows the relationship between spending and revenue going back \nto 1980. The red line is the spending line. You can see during the \nprevious administration, spending as a share of gross domestic product \ncame down each and every year. Why do we use gross domestic product? It \nis because economists say that is the way to take out the effects of \ninflation and real growth, so that you are comparing apples to apples.\n  With the new President, President Bush, spending went up. Why did it \ngo up? Overwhelmingly, it went up because of the need for more spending \nfor national defense and homeland security, and to rebuild New York. \nThose are increases in spending that all of us supported on a \nbipartisan basis, and that took the spending up to something over 20 \npercent of GDP. But look what happened to the revenue side of the \nequation. The revenue side of the equation went from a record level in \nPresident Bush's first year, and the revenue side of the equation \ncollapsed. Part of it, as the chairman rightly describes, is as a \nresult of economic slowdown, but about half of the reduction is because \nof tax cuts. Now we can see the revenue in 2004 was actually the lowest \nas a share of GDP since 1959--the lowest since 1959.\n  We have seen a bump-up as we have seen economic recovery. The \nchairman is absolutely right; economic recovery does lead to revenue. \nAbsolutely. The place where we disagree is the notion that some on that \nside of the aisle have that tax cuts generate more revenue. I have \nheard this so often from the other side: Tax cuts generate more \nrevenue.\n  Let's check the facts. What the chairman showed was projections. He \nshowed what he forecasts or somebody forecasts is going to happen in \nthe future. Let's not rely on future projections. Let's look at what \nhas actually happened in the real world to revenue after the massive \ntax cuts of this administration. Did we get more revenue? That is a \npretty simple question to ask and a pretty simple question to answer. \nThe answer is no, we didn't. In 2000, before the big tax cuts, we had \nover $2 trillion of revenue. Then we had the massive tax cuts of 2001, \nand look what happened to revenue: It went down in 2002. It went down \nin 2003. In 2004, it still was well below where it had been in 2000. We \ndidn't get back to the revenue base that we had in 2000 until the year \n2005.\n\n  At what point are we going to dispel the myth that tax cuts create \nmore revenue? They didn't, they haven't, and they won't.\n  That is not my view. I am taking my view from what has actually \nhappened in the real world, instead of some ideological belief and \nhope. Let's go on facts. Let's go on what has happened. Here is what \nChairman Greenspan says:\n\n       It is very rare and very few economists believe that you \n     can cut taxes and you will get the same amount of revenues.\n\n  This is not based on just what Chairman Greenspan says added to the \nfacts\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\nof what happened since 2001; here is what an Economy.com report says on \nthe U.S. macroeconomy:\n\n       Economists find no support for the claim that tax cuts pay \n     for themselves. Four years after income taxes were first cut \n     and nearly four years after the recession ended, Federal \n     revenues are still slightly below their early 2001 peak on a \n     nominal basis; on a real basis, adjusted for inflation, \n     revenues are down 11 percent from their all-time high. \n     Therefore there is no support for the Laffer Curve effect: \n     the view that a tax cut can actually boost government \n     revenues as workers and entrepreneurs respond with large \n     increases in effort.\n\n  From that, I don't make the argument that the answer to our problem \nis tax increases at this point. I do believe revenue has got to be part \nof the solution.\n  Our friends on the other side and the chairman have said it has to be \ndone on the spending side. Absolutely, the spending side has to be a \nvery significant part of addressing this problem. But revenue also has \nto be a part of addressing this problem, and the first place we ought \nto look for revenue is not a tax increase. The first place we ought to \nlook for revenue is the tax gap, the difference between what is owed \nand what is being paid.\n  The revenue department says the tax gap is now $350 billion a year. \nLet me repeat that. The tax gap, the difference between what is owed \nand what is being paid, the revenue commissioner tells us, is now $350 \nbillion a year. If we were to just collect revenue due under the \ncurrent revenue table, we would virtually eliminate the deficit. We \nwould still have a problem with the debt because, as I have indicated, \nthe debt is going up much faster than our deficits. But if we could \ncollect the amount of money that is actually due, we would make \nmeaningful inroads into this incredible abyss of deficits and debt, and \nwe ought to do it.\n  Also, as the chairman has said--and this is a place I agree--we are \ngoing to have to deal with the entitlements. Entitlements are growing \nmuch more rapidly than the size of the economy, and they are going to \nbe added to by the baby boom generation. The baby boom generation is \ngoing to change all of this very dramatically. So at some point, we are \ngoing to have to face up to that.\n  I think it is increasingly clear that the only way this is going to \nbe faced up to is if we do it together. Republicans can't do it alone; \nDemocrats can't do it alone. It is going to require Democrats and \nRepublicans working together to face this challenge of a burgeoning \ndebt, and the sooner we do it, the better.\n  On the assertions that the economy is doing great, here is what the \nComptroller General said about our current fiscal path before the \nSenate Budget Committee last month:\n\n       Continuing on this unsustainable fiscal path will gradually \n     erode, if not suddenly damage, our economy, our standard of \n     living, and ultimately our national security. Is anyone \n     listening? Is anyone listening? Here is the Comptroller \n     General of the United States telling us we can't stay on this \n     course, that it threatens our economy and even our national \n     security.\n\n  For those who say the economy is doing fine, I present an alternative \nview. Here is what has happened to real median household income. It has \ndeclined for 4 straight years. Median household income has declined for \n4 straight years. We have looked at previous recoveries since World War \nII. There have been nine economic recoveries from recessions since \nWorld War II. We have compared this recovery to the previous \nrecoveries. Here is what we found. Growth of the economy lags behind \nthe typical recovery. On average in the previous 9 recoveries, GDP has \naveraged 3.2 percent; in this recovery, it is averaging 2.8 percent.\n\n  It is not just economic growth, it is also business investment. Here \nis the average. This dotted red line is the average of the nine \nprevious business cycles in terms of business investment. Here, the \nblack line is this recovery. Business investment is lagging the average \nof the nine previous recoveries by 62 percent. What is wrong here? \nSomething is wrong. Something has changed from our previous economic \nrecoveries.\n  It is not just growth of GDP, it is not just business investment, it \nis also job creation. This red line is the average of the nine previous \nrecoveries from recessions since World War II. The black line is this \nrecovery. We are running 6.6 million private sector jobs behind the \ntypical recovery. At this very same period in the cycle, this very same \ntime period, we are 6.6 million private sector jobs behind the average \nrecovery since World War II.\n  We have to face up to what is happening: burgeoning deficits and \ndebt; a recovery that is not producing the same economic growth, the \nsame business investment, the same job creation we have seen in other \nrecoveries since World War II; and then we have a budget that I believe \nis also wrong on priorities. This budget says that in 2007, the tax \ncuts going to those who earn on average over $1 million a year will \ncost $41 billion for the year. Let me repeat that. Under the budget \nthat is presented here and the budget of the President, the tax cuts \ngoing to those who on average earn over $1 million a year, the tax cuts \nfor 1 year alone will be $41 billion. Meanwhile, the President says cut \neducation $2.2 billion, the biggest cut education has ever been asked \nto take. I don't believe that is the right priority for the country.\n  It is not just with respect to education. Veterans are being asked to \ntake reductions such that it would cost $800 million--$795 million to \nrestore those reductions, those cuts, in terms of what they receive. \nActually, this $800 million is the $250 annual enrollment fee the \nPresident is asking for and the increase in their drug copayments that \nhe is asking for--$800 million to eliminate those increased fees and \ncosts to veterans. But the President's budget says: No, it is 50 times \nmore important to provide tax cuts to those earning over $1 million a \nyear. Those are his priorities. I don't think those are the priorities \nof the American people.\n  When I look at law enforcement, I see the same thing. It would cost \nabout $400 million to restore the COPS Program. The President cuts the \nCOPS Program that puts police officers on the street. He cuts it about \n$400 million, which is one one-hundredth as much as is going to tax \ncuts for those who earn over $1 million a year. Are those really the \npriorities of the American people? Is it 100 times more important to \ngive tax cuts to those earning over $1 million a year than it is to put \npolice on the street? I don't think so.\n  It doesn't end there. This budget, the President's budget, on local \nlaw enforcement grants, they don't just cut those, they eliminate them. \nThe Byrne Justice Assistance grants, Safe and Drug-Free Schools--they \neliminate them. They don't just cut them, they eliminate them. \nVocational education--they don't just cut it, they eliminate it. The \nCOPS Program, as I indicated, is cut 78 percent; firefighter grants, \ncut 55 percent; essential air service, cut 54 percent.\n  I am not talking Washington-talk about cuts. I am not talking about \nrestricting the rate of growth. I am talking about cutting from what \nwas provided last year. Weatherization grants are cut 2 percent, Amtrak \nis cut 32 percent, community development block grants are cut 20 \npercent, and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program is cut 17 \npercent.\n  This is a budget that I believe is just wrong. I believe it is wrong \nfor the American people. It is wrong because it explodes deficits and \ndebt. It is wrong on its priorities. Let me just sum up with what the \nNational Catholic Reporter wrote on February 17 of this year:\n\n       But what has become clear during five years of the Bush \n     administration is now glaringly apparent in the easily \n     discerned outlines of its proposed 2007 budget: Cuts in vital \n     programs that benefit the poor and middle class, continuing \n     tax relief for the very wealthy.\n       If budgets are, as some contend and we would agree, moral \n     documents, then this one suggests we have abandoned a basic \n     sense of right and wrong and any notion that we are at our \n     best when we strive to make life better for all, not just \n     those who manage to accumulate wealth.\n\n  I want to end as I began. I believe the fundamental threat of our \ntime is the growth of the debt. The debt is the threat. This budget \nabsolutely fails to face up to that growing and burgeoning debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just to briefly respond because obviously \nthe Senator has made numerous points\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\nhere, I agree with some, and with some I disagree. But I think this \nfocus on the debt is an interesting approach and one which I can \ncertainly be sympathetic to, and I would be more sympathetic to it if \nduring the markup on this bill we had amendments offered from the other \nside that would have significantly reduced the debt. That is not what \nwe had. We had amendments which would increase the spending of the \nFederal Government by about $150 billion in entitlement accounts, about \n$16 billion approximately on discretionary accounts for this coming \nyear, and then they raise taxes or proposed raising taxes in order to \nmeet those new spending initiatives.\n  If you are going to reduce the debt, you can do it, of course, by \nraising taxes. The last group of charts the Senator highlighted would \nbe one way, and maybe the alternative they could seek on their side of \nthe aisle would be where they would raise taxes by $41 billion on one \nsegment of Americans, or they can raise taxes across the board, or they \ncan raise taxes on specific groups. All of that is possible to reduce \nthe debt, but that is not what they offered in committee. What they \noffered in committee was to increase spending on all sorts of \ninitiatives and then raise taxes to cover the spending, which does \nnothing significant to reduce the debt.\n  You can also reduce the debt by reducing the deficit because every \ndeficit dollar is added to the debt. That is what we have attempted to \ndo in this bill. We will attempt and we intend to reduce the deficit in \nhalf over 4 years on this bill, and we do it by aggressively addressing \ndiscretionary spending.\n  The Senator is suggesting there are other places not mentioned in \nthis bill, such as the AMT. Yes, we do not address the AMT. I believe \nthe AMT, if it is going to be addressed, should be addressed in the \ncontext of tax reform where it is a revenue-neutral event. I would also \npoint out the vast majority of AMT is paid for by people in high \nincomes; 75 percent of the AMT tax, I believe, comes from people with \nincomes over $100,000.\n  First they put up a chart that says high-income individuals should \nhave their taxes increased, and then they put up a chart that says we \ndon't account for cutting taxes on high-income individuals. There is a \nlittle bit of inconsistency there, in my opinion. But the AMT fix \nshould not be done in a vacuum. It should not be a hit on the Treasury \nto the tune of almost $1 trillion. It should be done in the context of \nmajor revenue reform, which allows us to adjust it so if low-income \npeople or moderate-income people--there are no low-income people \ncovered by AMT, but if moderate-income people find themselves falling \nin the AMT, the tax laws will be adjusted so they will be taken out of \nthat, but at the same time we adjust in other areas to make the laws \nmore fair and maintain the revenue base. That is the way to address \nthat. You don't just unilaterally act on that. So I don't find that to \nbe a compelling case they are making.\n  They make the case on Social Security. We would have been happy to \nput Social Security in here if the other side of the aisle had not shot \nthe idea down of any Social Security reform--which we really need, we \nneed Social Security reform--shot it down before it even got up to the \nCongress.\n  The President went around the country talking about a variety of \nideas. He put everything on the table, and the other side of the aisle \njust started attacking him for even addressing the issue of Social \nSecurity. We know Social Security is a serious problem. We know it. But \nthere is no point in moving forward on it if the other side of the \naisle has an attitude that we are not going to do anything, we are just \ngoing to use it as a political club, which was exactly the approach \nthat was taken when the President addressed it. So that is hard to \naccept as a valid thing that should be in this budget, Social Security.\n  This budget does not assume the present tax increases after the \nbudget window, which is different from the President's budget, so it is \na different approach we have taken in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. How could my time possibly expire? I think I have 25 \nhours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 11:30 was evenly divided. So it \nis out before 11:30.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is only 11:25.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the \nremainder of the time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy--maybe we can make an adjustment here, so \nthe Senator can finish his thoughts and then I would have a brief time \nto respond.\n  Mr. GREGG. That sounds good to me. Why don't we extend this for 15 \nminutes? Divide the time equally?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could we do it for 12?\n  Mr. GREGG. Whichever. Twelve is fine to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We can split the time so the Senator has a chance to \nconclude his thoughts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. The context of my comments are basically directed to the \nissue of debt. I believe debt should be reduced. I believe the way you \nreduce debt is to begin by reducing the deficit, which is what the \nbudget does. But the presentation that this budget uniquely aggravates \nthe debt is really not viable in the context of the solutions which are \nbeing offered by the other side because none of the solutions being \noffered by the other side would reduce the debt, either. They are \nbasically offering--or at least they did in committee--amendments which \nincrease spending and increase taxes, thus taking resources which \nlogically the other side would want to use to reduce the debt but \nisn't, and spending the money. In the end, that doesn't reduce the debt \nat all.\n  I didn't see in the markup at all any proposals that would reduce the \ndebt coming from the other side. We look forward to them offering a \nbudget which accomplishes that. I would be most interested in such a \nbudget because I do think it is important we do that. We tried to do it \nin our bill by reducing the deficit in half over the next 4 years, \nwhich does take money and reduce the debt because any time you reduce \nthe deficit, you reduce the debt. You are not adding to the debt.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the use of calculators be \npermitted on the floor Senate during consideration of the budget \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following staff \nmembers from my staff and from Senator Conrad's staff be given all-\naccess floor passes for the Senate floor during consideration of the \nbudget resolution.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I go back to where I started. The debt is \nthe threat. This budget before us increases the debt $600 billion a \nyear, each and every year of its term. That is the reality. That is the \nbudget we have before us. It is the obligation of the majority to offer \na budget, and they have\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\ndone so. It is our obligation to comment and critique their budget, \nwhich we have done.\n  The most important critique that I offered is that this budget \nexplodes the debt. It is undeniable. It is clear. Their own numbers \nshow that it explodes the debt.\n  Beyond that, the chairman references what happened in the committee. \nI believe he didn't mention our first amendment--it will be our first \namendment on the floor--which is a pay-go amendment to restore budget \ndiscipline to require that if you want to have more mandatory spending, \nyou have to pay for it. And if you want to have more tax cuts, you have \nto pay for them. But they defeated that budget discipline. They \ndefeated that budget discipline, and they proposed this budget that \nexplodes the debt.\n  In addition, every one of our amendments--I don't know where the \nchairman got his number--that cost $128 billion in committee, we \nprovided $134 billion of funding for those amendments.\n  We reduced the buildup of deficit and debt by $6 billion. But that is \nnot the point. The point is, what needs to be done--and I think the \nchairman might agree with this--is to take on this debt threat. The \nonly way it is going to happen is if we do it together. Your budget \ndoesn't do it. We are not going to offer a budget that is going to do \nit because if you offer one on your own, you couldn't pass another one. \nIf we offered one on our own, we couldn't pass it on our own--certainly \nnot in the minority.\n  I have come to the conclusion--I have talked to colleagues over the \nweekend, and I believe the chairman may share this view--that the only \nway we are going to take on this debt is to march together. It has \nbecome so serious and so big that neither party can do it alone. That \nis the truth.\n  Again, we didn't offer tax increases in the Budget Committee. We did \noffer to more aggressively close the tax gap to pay for these measures. \nAnd the biggest spending measure that we offered--in fact, nearly all \nthe increase in the spending, or a significant majority of it--was in \none amendment, and that was to take veterans' benefits from the \ndiscretionary side of the budget to the mandatory side of the budget. \nWe do not believe veterans' benefits should be considered \ndiscretionary. It is not discretionary. It is mandatory that we provide \nfor these veterans. That amendment cost $104 billion. But we paid for \nit.\n  Unless anybody wonders if there are tax loopholes out there to close, \nlet me tell you about one of the most recent scams which was uncovered \nwhere companies in the United States are buying sewer systems of \nEuropean cities, depreciating them on their books in the United States, \nand then leasing the facilities back to European cities.\n  Is that a tax increase to take away that scam? I don't think so. Is \nit a tax increase to take away the scam that allows a five-story \nbuilding in the Cayman Islands to be home to 12,500 companies which \nclaim they are doing business in the Cayman Islands? They have a five-\nstory building down there that is the home to 12,500 companies. Is it a \ntax increase to end that scam because there are no taxes in the Cayman \nIslands and that is where those companies want to show their profits?\n  Shame on those companies, shame on the Cayman Islands, shame on us \nfor allowing that to happen, and shame on us for not collecting the \nrevenue that is due under the current system. The vast majority of us \npay what we owe. The vast majority of companies pay what they owe. But \nwe have an increasing number of individuals and an increasing number of \ncompanies that aren't, and we ought to go after them. It is $350 \nbillion a year. The revenue commissioner said we could get at least $50 \nbillion to $100 billion of that amount without fundamentally changing \nthe relationship of the revenue service to the taxpayers of the \ncompany.\n  Social Security reform: What the President proposed is not what I \nwould consider Social Security reform. Once again he was going to \nborrow the money. He was going to borrow hundreds of billions of \ndollars to change the Social Security system. Of course we opposed \nthat. Not only was he going to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars, \nbut he himself was going to cut benefits. We oppose that. I am proud to \nhave opposed that.\n  I am not for any more of these plans that explode the debt of the \ncountry. We have had enough of that. The debt does represent an \nenormous threat to the economic security of America. I believe that.\n  Could I be advised of the time remaining, how it is divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 50 seconds, and the \nSenator from New Hampshire has 3 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, at this point, would the Senator join me \nin yielding that time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Take it off the bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We yield the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand this is fiscal \nresponsibility week on the Democratic side of the aisle. It is a good \ntime to talk about that and to talk about the strength of the American \neconomy. It is certainly no secret to any in Congress or to the \nAmerican people that when the President came to office we had a \nterrorist attack, we have had corporate accounting scandals, a bursting \nstock bubble, and, of course, our share of natural disasters.\n  In spite of all that, our economy is in extraordinarily good shape. \nIt is very strong, and it is not by accident. It is a direct result of \nthe policies of the President of the United States and of the \nRepublican Congress.\n  Since the enactment of the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, more \nAmericans are working than ever before. Five million new jobs have been \ncreated since May 2003 alone. Unemployment is at 4.8 percent. That is \nlower than the average of the 1970s, the 1980s, and even the boom 1990s \nthat our good friends on the other side of the aisle claim is the best \nthe economy could ever do. Current unemployment is lower than the \naverage of the 1990s.\n  Home ownership, the American dream, has reached an all-time high and \nremains near that high today. The stock market, a good way to measure \nprosperity, is up more than 2,500 points since May 1, of 2003. That is \nnearly a 30-percent increase in the stock market since we passed the \nJobs and Growth Act of 2003.\n  Americans have more money in their pockets. Aftertax income is up 7.9 \npercent since President Bush took office. We cut the capital gains tax \nrate. I remember all the comments on the other side of the aisle about \nhow this was a tax cut for the rich and how it was going to cost the \nGovernment all kinds of revenue. The results are in. By cutting the \ncapital gains tax rate, we increased the revenues to the Federal \nGovernment by $20 billion. In other words, the receipts from capital \ngains went from $58 billion, when we had a higher rate, to $78 billion \nwith a lower rate, exactly as the occupant of the chair, myself, and \nthese in the Bush administration predicted. Cutting capital gains tax \nproduces more revenue for the Government. Now we have proven that to be \nthe case.\n  We are taking more important steps to put our fiscal house in order. \nThe deficit reduction bill which the President signed within the last \nmonth actually reduces the deficit by $40 billion for the first time \nsince the late 1990s. It is an actual deficit reduction bill, a \nreduction in the entitlement spending, one of the hardest things to do \naround here. We did not pass it by a landslide, but we got it done.\n  What is this all about? It is all about the American people. The \nGovernment does not create jobs and opportunity; the private sector \ndoes. The policies of the President and the Republican Congress have \nstimulated the private sector, allowed our country to work its way \nthrough some of the most dramatic setbacks imaginable, from the first \nbig terrorist attack--hopefully the last one on our soil--corporate \nscandals, the stock market bubble bursting, all of that, and yet our \neconomy is roaring.\n  What do our good friends on the other side of the aisle think the \nprescription is in the wake of this riproaring economy and all of this \nsuccess? We saw some of it in the Committee on the Budget last week. \nFirst, they want to increase the discretionary cap on this budget we \nare now considering, increase that by $19 billion. In other words, have \nsome more spending over and above what the President has recommended \nand what the budget that came out of the Committee on the Budget \nrecommends, $873 billion. They want to increase that by $19 billion. \nThey also would have mandatory spending increases of $109 billion. The \nPresident just got through signing, after Congress passed, a deficit \nreduction bill to reduce mandatory spending by $40 billion over the \nnext 5 years and the Democrats on the Committee on the Budget want to \nincrease it by $109 billion. That will wipe out all those savings and \nadd another $50 billion or so on top of it.\n  Our Democratic friends also proposed tax increases of $134 billion in \nthe committee last week. It strikes me that their solution in the wake \nof this stunningly robust economy we find ourselves with is to tax and \nspend, the old formula.\n  I hope we will not go down that road as we move toward passing the \nbudget this week. We have an opportunity to demonstrate that we are \nwilling to restrain ourselves, that we are willing to cap the rate of \ndiscretionary spending. We will have that vote at the end of the week. \nI hope it will be successful.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S1997-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 1:30 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of the budget \nresolution, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 83), setting forth \n     the congressional budgets of the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2007 and including the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2006 and 2008 through 2011.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I listened to the very able Senator from \nKentucky. His description of this budget does not quite fit the budget \nI have seen, both in the Senate and in the committee. He talks about \ndeficit reduction. There is no deficit reduction here. Let's be clear \nwith people. There is no deficit reduction.\n  He talks about the deficit reduction bill offered last year by the \nRepublicans. They called it ``deficit reduction,'' but there was no \ndeficit reduction. They cut taxes $70 billion, cut spending $40 \nbillion. Do the math. That did not reduce the deficit. It increased the \ndeficit. Is the deficit going to be lower this year after their deficit \nreduction bill? Or is it going to be higher? It is going to be higher. \nThere is more deficit after their deficit reduction bill of last year. \nNot only is there more deficit, but there is a whole lot more debt.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, here is what is happening under our \ncolleagues' fiscal plan. Here is what is happening to the debt of the \ncountry. When President Bush came in at the end of his first year--we \ndo not hold him responsible for the first year because that is \noperating under the previous year's Presidency--at the end of his first \nyear the debt was $5.8 trillion. At the end of this year, the debt will \nbe $8.6 trillion. If this budget is adopted, this 5-year budget, at the \nend of the 5 years the debt will be $11.8 trillion. And they are \ntalking about deficit reduction? Where? Where is it? Show me. Show me \nwhere they are reducing the deficit. This is the debt of the country. \nThe debt is skyrocketing under their plans.\n  Now the Senator talks about their deficit reduction plan of last \nyear. This is last year. The deficit was $319 billion, one of the \nbiggest ever. In fact, in the 5 years of this Presidency, he has had--\ncount them--four, when this year is complete, four of the biggest \ndeficits in the history of the country. In dollar terms, the four \nbiggest.\n  Last year, the deficit was $319 billion. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says if this budget is agreed to, this year the budget will be \n$371 billion based on the President's proposal. Actually, the proposal \nin the Senate is a little worse, at $371 billion. Is $371 billion more \nof a deficit than $319 billion or less? This is after their big deficit \nreduction plan. There is no deficit reduction.\n  What about going forward? What will happen going forward? Here is \nwhat will happen, going forward, to the debt of the country. They say \nthe deficit will go down each and every year of this budget. Well, not \nquite. The last year they say it blips up a little. They claim the \ndeficit will be going down. But, of course, they have left out some \npretty big things. They have left out any war costs past 2007. They \nhave left out any cost to fix the alternative minimum tax passed this \nyear. Over 10 years, that costs $1 trillion to fix. That is a big item. \nThey have left out the associated interest costs of those items,\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\nwhich is ``other'' on the chart. They have also left out the money they \nare taking from Social Security each and every year of this budget, all \nof which gets added to the debt, all of which has to be paid back.\n  So when we add it all up, here is how much the debt is going to grow \nunder the plan before the Senate: In 2007, it will go up $680 billion. \nNot the deficit they are talking about of $319 billion; the debt will \ngo up $680 billion. The next year it will go up $656 billion; the next \nyear it will go up $635 billion; the next year it will go up $622 \nbillion; the next year it is going up to $662 billion.\n  Is there any improvement here? They are talking about deficit \nreduction, they are talking about their improving the fiscal picture of \nthe country. No, they are not. The debt is going to grow every year by \nmore than $600 billion. The result is going to be at the end of this \nperiod, the debt of our Nation will reach $11.8 trillion. Now I project \nat the end of this year it will be $8.6 trillion. By the way, they are \ngetting ready to increase the debt limit by almost $800 billion in 1 \nyear. We are going to have that vote this week.\n\n  So when they say they are reducing the deficit, it is just talk. \nThere is no reduction in the deficit going on here. In the deficit \nreduction package they say they had last year, the deficit went up, and \nthe deficit is going up under their deficit reduction package. So let's \nbe straight with people.\n  Now, my colleague called the economy ``stunningly robust.'' No, the \neconomy is not stunningly robust. In fact, the unemployment rate just \nwent up. The unemployment rate just went up from 4.7 to 4.8 percent. \nThat is not good news. That is going the wrong way.\n  But I think of more concern is, if you compare this recovery to the \nnine previous recoveries since World War II, what you see is this one \nis far weaker than the average of the nine previous recoveries.\n  Let's look at what the numbers show. Here is real median household \nincome, as shown on this chart. Now, this would tell us whether the \neconomy is doing well. If this is such a robust economy, why isn't \nhousehold income going up? It is not going up. It is going down. Real \nmedian household income has declined 4 years in a row.\n  To try to determine what is happening with this economy, we went and \nlooked at all the recoveries since World War II. Here is what we found. \nOn average, at this stage of recovery, the economy would be growing at \n3.2 percent a year. That is what we have seen in the previous \nrecoveries: 3.2 percent growth; this recovery: 2.8 percent. It is \nweaker than the average of the nine previous recoveries.\n  That is not the only indicator that things are not going as well as \nwe have seen in other recoveries. For the nine other recoveries since \nWorld War II, this dotted line on the chart shows business investment. \nThe black line shows this recovery. It is 62 percent behind the average \nof the nine previous recoveries.\n  My colleague just talked about how strong job growth has been. No, \njob growth has not been strong. We went and looked at the nine previous \nrecoveries since World War II. This dotted red line on the chart shows \nthe average. This black line shows this recovery. And, look, we are 6.6 \nmillion private sector jobs short of the typical recovery. So when they \nsay things are going great, that is not what any serious analysis \nreveals.\n  What any serious analysis reveals is that this recovery is lagging in \na substantial way behind the nine recoveries since World War II. It is \nlagging in business investment by 62 percent. It is lagging in economic \ngrowth--3.2 percent is the average of the nine previous recoveries, and \nin this period, 2.8 percent. On job creation, we are 6.6 million \nprivate sector jobs behind the average of the nine other recoveries \nsince World War II.\n  But I said this morning the debt is the threat. And here it is, as \nshown on this chart. Our friends on the other side have been in charge \nsince 2001. This is their record. This is what has happened under their \nfiscal plan.\n  The President told us if we adopted his fiscal plan, he would have \nmaximum paydown of the debt. Remember? He was going to virtually \neliminate the debt. It has not worked out that way. Not only has there \nbeen no reduction in the debt, the debt has skyrocketed, and the debt \nhas gone up approaching--well, with this latest increase that is being \nsought that they want to vote on this week--the debt under this \nPresident will have gone up $3 trillion. If we adopt this plan, it is \ngoing to go up another $3 trillion.\n  That is the hard reality of what we see before us. If you love debt, \nyou are going to love this budget plan. Our friends on the other side \naccuse us of tax and spend. They are guilty of spend and borrow. Borrow \nand spend, borrow and spend, spend and borrow, borrow and spend, spend \nand borrow--that is their policy, to drive us deep into debt.\n  As I showed on the Senate floor, one of the most alarming things is, \nincreasingly, this debt is financed by foreigners. About half of our \ndebt now is held abroad. This morning I showed what an incredible \nlegacy this President is going to leave because it took 42 Presidents \n224 years to run up $1 trillion of external debt, debt held by \nforeigners. This President has more than doubled that in 5 years. That \nis truly stunning.\n  Let me repeat, it took 42 Presidents 224 years--in fact, here is the \nchart I used this morning that shows it--it took all these Presidents, \nfrom George Washington to Bill Clinton--42 Presidents--224 years. Some \nof them were sons of Virginia. The occupant of the chair is a proud \nrepresentative of Virginia. They were much more careful with public \nmoney than this President. It took all these Presidents--42 of them--\n224 years to run up $1 trillion of external debt. This President has \nmore than doubled it, in fact, substantially more than doubled it, in \njust 5 years.\n  Now, as a result of this, we owe Japan over $700 billion. We owe \nChina over $250 billion. Here it is, as shown on this chart: Japan; \nChina; the United Kingdom, my favorite; the Caribbean banking centers. \nWe owe the Caribbean banking centers $111 billion. I sometimes ask \naudiences back home: Are any of you doing your banking in the \nCaribbean? I get very few takers on that. Somebody is doing their \nbanking in the Caribbean, and we are borrowing huge amounts of money \nfrom them. We owe Taiwan over $70 billion. We owe South Korea over $66 \nbillion.\n  Now, whatever else is going on, No. 1, this fiscal plan is not \nworking as advertised. The President said, very clearly, he was going \nto have maximum paydown of the debt. The debt is skyrocketing, and when \nour friends come out here and say, well, they have a deficit-reduction \nplan, where is it? It certainly is not in this budget that is going to \nincrease the debt over $3 trillion over the next 5 years.\n  This year, the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nis going to be bigger than the deficit last year, after our friends \ncame out here and said they had a deficit reduction plan. In fact, they \npassed it and they labeled it ``deficit reduction,'' but the deficit is \ngoing up, not down. So their deficit reduction plan, like all these \nother plans they have come out with, has not worked.\n  The President said he was going to have maximum paydown of the debt. \nThe debt is increasing. They say they have a deficit reduction plan. \nThe deficit is increasing, not being reduced.\n  And talk about economic recoveries, this is one of the weakest \neconomic recoveries of the nine we have had since World War II. \nSomething is not working. I believe one of the things that is not \nworking is that this pileup of debt is creating an enormous weight on \nour country. At some point we have to take this on. This budget does \nnot do it. My own belief is, the only way we are going to take this on \nis to do it together, Democrats and Republicans. Democrats certainly \ncannot do it. We are in the minority. I do not think Republicans can do \nit alone because they have proven they are not going to do it. And if \nthey wanted to do it, I do not believe they could do it on their own. I \nthink this is going to take us working together. And the sooner we get \ntogether and the sooner we face up to this, the better off our country \nwill be.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join in the desire of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota to move forward in a bipartisan way.\n  We could start by approving this budget in a bipartisan way. But \nindependent of that, I agree, we--and we\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\nhave talked about this; actually I think we are the only two people \ntalking about this, but we have talked about trying to develop a \nframework where we could actually address this issue.\n  But that is a global settlement. I would like to see it done. It is \ngoing to have to address Medicare. It is going to have to address \nMedicaid. It is going to have to address Social Security. It is going \nto have to address revenues. And it needs to be done sooner rather than \nlater. But it is such a large idea that it is not going to occur this \nweek.\n  This week, what is going to occur, hopefully, is a step forward in \nthe exercise of disciplining ourselves through budget processing, \nsetting out a blueprint which defines where the Federal Government is \ngoing to spend money, how it is going to spend money, and constrains \nthe Federal Government, especially on the discretionary side of the \nledger. I would like to have constrained the Federal Government a \nlittle bit in its rate of growth on the entitlement side of the ledger, \nbut that is not possible, primarily because I get no votes from the \nother side of the aisle.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has made a point of talking about \neconomic statistics relative to what the Bush administration and the \nRepublican leadership have done relative to this economy. His structure \nand definition of this is, it is sort of dire, this economy. Well, that \nis hard to accept on its face. This is not a dire economy. In fact, it \nis a fairly robust economy that has gone through very significant \ngrowth now for 5 years.\n  We have had 17 consecutive quarters of expansion of this economy. \nThat is big, 17 consecutive quarters. We came out of one of the most \ndifficult times, from an economic standpoint, in the history of this \ncountry, probably the most difficult time in the postdepression period, \nwhen we had the largest bubble in history, the Internet bubble \ncollapse, and when we were attacked and America was at war and found \nthe essence of our economy--Wall Street--basically destroyed in the \nWorld Trade attack.\n  So they were double blows to our economy, and yet we have responded \nas a government the right way. We cut taxes. We gave people an \nincentive to go out there and be productive and create jobs. The \nresponse has been that people have gone out, risked their capital, \ntaken risks, been entrepreneurs, created small business, and created \njobs.\n  We have had 17 consecutive quarters of expansion of this economy, \nwhich is a lot of growth. We had a 3.5-percent rate of growth in 2005. \nThat is higher, as an average, than the 20-year average of the prior 20 \nyears. We are growing at a rate faster than the average over the last \n20 years.\n  Just last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced we created \n243,000 new jobs. That is a huge jump in new jobs when you put it in \nthe context of the fact that for 30 straight months we have been \ncreating new jobs in this economy. Literally, 5 million new jobs have \nbeen created in this economy since 2003. It is a result, in large part, \nof the economic engine created by giving people the right to be \ninvestors and entrepreneurs and capitalists and market-oriented, taking \nrisks and creating jobs--5 million new jobs. Do you know how many jobs \nthat is? That is more jobs than was created in Japan and Europe \ncombined. I would point out that Japan and Europe combined have a \npopulation which is about half, again, larger than the United States.\n  So we have had 17 quarters of consecutive growth. We have had 3.5 \npercent GDP growth, which is above the economic average for the last 20 \nyears. We have had 5 million new jobs created. Just last month, we \nadded 243,000 jobs. Those are pretty good numbers.\n  Let's put it in the context of the Bush administration versus the \nClinton administration.\n  Real disposable income--which is basically the essence of what you \nreally look at when you are talking about how people's lives are \ngetting better or worse--has increased $1,905 since President Bush has \nbeen in office, which has been for about 5 years, 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  Under President Clinton, what was the increase? For the last term of \nhis office, the last 4 years when he was in office, during this period, \nwhen we were going through this economic bubble, real disposable income \nonly went up $1,500.\n  So this President has exceeded the rate of growth, in real disposable \nincome, of the Clinton final 4 years, for which we hear so much about \nwhat a great job President Clinton did on the economy. And except for \nthe fact he did not control the bubble, the fact is, the economy did \npretty well during his administration.\n  Real hourly compensation has gone up 8.9 percent during this same \nperiod, whereas if you compare it to President Clinton's second term, \nreal hourly wage growth went up only three-tenths of 1 percent.\n  The rate of growth of a person's actual wages has jumped dramatically \nin comparison to the Bush years versus the last 4 years of President \nClinton. This is true economic growth. It is hard to deny that. You can \ndeny it, you can be pessimistic about it, but the fact is the economy \nis doing very well, especially in the context of the fact that we are \nfighting a war on terrorism in the middle of all this, which has been a \nfairly significant stress on our economy, and that we had the largest \nnatural disaster in the history of our Nation--exceeding even the San \nFrancisco earthquake of 1906--in the Katrina and Rita storms in the \nGulf States which essentially wiped out one of the great engines of our \neconomy, the Gulf States, especially in the area of energy production. \nStill the economy grows.\n  In fact, interest rates--I remember the Senator from North Dakota \nmaking a statement, I think it was last year, maybe the year before, \nsaying that interest rates were going to have to go up because the \nFederal Government was crowding out borrowing--haven't gone up. \nInterest rates continue basically to be affordable in the context of \nhistorical interest rates. Yes, they are off a historic low, but they \nare still well below what is the historic mean for interest rates.\n  So the economy is not only not dire, it is rather robust. It is \nrobust in large part because of the fact that we made the right \ndecisions at the beginning of this administration on the issue of tax \npolicy. We gave people an incentive to be productive, an incentive to \ninvest, to take risks, all of which translates into jobs, and jobs \ntranslate into more revenue for the Federal Government.\n  We have gone through the charts of how much the revenue to the \nFederal Government is jumping as a result of this economic activity. It \nis a consistent statement made by the Senator from North Dakota that \nthe economy is terrible, but I don't think it is a correct statement.\n  Furthermore, this budget is obviously not a magic wand. It doesn't \nhave the capacity to say: Eliminate the debt or eliminate the growth of \nthe debt as we fight this war and we face issues of financial pressure. \nBut without this budget, the debt will be significantly larger. In \nfact, as has been said before, spending will go up if the Democratic \nproposals that came out of committee are allowed to pass. Taxes will \nalso go up because they propose tax increases. But that will have no \nimpact on the debt. That is a wash, according to their representation. \nThey spend $120 billion, and they raise taxes $125 billion or something \nlike that, so they may have gotten $5 billion over 5 years back for \ndeficit reduction. We usually underestimate the spending in those \nprograms and we usually overestimate the revenue, especially when you \nare talking about loophole closing. That definitely usually \noverestimates revenue. So I suspect we would have found the debt would \nhave increased, too.\n  But giving them the benefit of the doubt, there is no initiative here \non the floor--and there was no initiative in committee--which \nsignificantly addresses the debt other than the budget that is before \nus which puts a hard freeze on nondefense discretionary spending. That \naddresses the debt. That means that next year you will add less to the \ndeficit than you would have if you didn't have that hard freeze. It is \nnot a big number in the context of the overall issue, but it is a big \nnumber by New Hampshire standards. It represents billions of dollars \nwhich will not be added to the deficit and therefore not added to the \ndebt. That is a positive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire has very\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\nably used the oldest debate tactic known to man, which is the straw man \nargument. He suggested I have said that the economy is terrible. Those \nare not my words. I have not described the economy as terrible. I have \ndescribed the economy as not performing as well as it has in other \nrecoveries since World War II.\n  Let me repeat: Real median household income has declined 4 straight \nyears. That is not a sign of economic strength; that is a sign of \neconomic weakness. The economic growth in this recovery has \nsubstantially lagged the economic growth we saw in the other nine \nrecoveries since World War II. In the other recoveries since World War \nII, economic growth averaged 3.2 percent. In this recovery, it is \naveraging 2.8 percent.\n  On business investment, this dotted line is the average of nine \nprevious recessions. This recovery is the black line. It is 62 percent \nbehind what we have seen in the other nine recoveries since World War \nII. That is also true of job creation. The red dotted line is job \ncreation and the average of nine recessions since World War II. The \nblack line is this recovery, 6.6 million private sector jobs behind.\n  The most dramatic result is this: This is how our friends have \npropped up the economy. They have done it by running up the biggest \ndebt in the history of America. Their proposal in this budget is to \nkeep on doing it, more debt on top of debt that is already at record \nlevels. When this President came in, at the end of his first year the \ndebt was $5.8 trillion. At the end of this year, it will be $8.6 \ntrillion, headed for $11.8 trillion if this budget is adopted. That is \nthe wrong course for America. It is a mistake, and we will regret it \ndeeply if we allow this to go forward. That is why this budget ought to \nbe defeated. Only if this budget is defeated are we going to have a \nchance to change course and get America on a firmer fiscal footing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3002\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To make technical and conforming amendments)\n\n       On page 3, line 11, strike ``$1,694,445,000,000'' and \n     insert ``$1,694,455,000,000''.\n       On page 3, line 23, strike ``reduced'' and insert \n     ``changed''.\n       On page 21, line 3, strike ``$441,150,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$411,150,000,000''.\n       On page 28, line 15, after ``000'' insert ``,000''.\n       On page 28, line 16, after ``000'' insert ``,000''.\n       On page 29, line 18, strike ``by $0 for fiscal year 2007 \n     and''.\n       On page 42, strike beginning with line 11 and all that \n     follows through page 43, line 4, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 311. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR CHRONIC CARE CASE \n                   MANAGEMENT.\n\n       If the Senate Committee on Finance reports a bill or joint \n     resolution, or an amendment is offered thereto or a \n     conference report is submitted thereon, that would provide \n     $1,750,000,000 to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services (CMS) to create a demonstration project or program \n     that assigns a case manager to coordinate the care of \n     chronically-ill and other high-cost Medicare beneficiaries in \n     traditional fee-for-service Medicare, the Chairman of the \n     Senate Committee on the Budget may revise the allocations, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in this \n     resolution by the amount provided in such measure for that \n     purpose, provided that such legislation would not increase \n     the deficit for the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. This is an amendment to make corrections to the resolution \nso it conforms to the resolution as ordered reported by the committee. \nIt has been agreed to by both sides. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I certainly \nwill not object--this is something both sides are in complete agreement \non. I ask my colleagues to understand that this is a technical matter \nto make certain that the resolution conforms to what was done in \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3002.\n  The amendment (No. 3002) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I see the Senator from Massachusetts seeking recognition. \nI yield the Senator 20 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota for his leadership on this issue. I hope that those who \nhave had the chance to listen to opening debate will pay close \nattention over the next 4 days. This is an enormously important \ndocument we are debating. It is an indication of a nation's priorities. \nIt is important that we listen with care to the discussion.\n  Money isn't everything, but it is a measure of a nation's priorities. \nBudgets are moral documents. They represent who we are and what we \nvalue. Just 6 weeks ago, the President delivered a State of the Union \nAddress that gave hope to many of us in Congress for a budget that \nmeets the needs of the American people. The President told us that \nnight that a hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in \ntimes of suffering and emergency and stays at it until they are back on \ntheir feet. But the budget before us tells a different story. It fails \nto meet the security needs of Americans who are looking for real \nsecurity in the face of terrorism.\n  We have seen the failed response to Hurricane Katrina, the failure in \nIraq, a failing grade from the 9/11 Commission, failure on the security \nof our ports, failure in curbing nuclear power in Iran and North Korea, \nfailure after failure when it comes to our national security. But you \nwould never know it from this budget. Does it prepare us for the next \ndisaster? Does it support a winning strategy in Iraq? Does it fully \ninvest in the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission? Does it secure \nour ports and inspect every shipping container crossing our shore? When \nit comes to nuclear weapons, does it provide the resources needed for \nreal nonproliferation? The answer to each one of these questions is no. \nThe administration and the Republicans may talk about national \nsecurity, but the real record is one of mistake and failure.\n  This budget is a failure, too, when it comes to meeting the needs of \nour families here at home. When it comes to healing the sick, feeding \nthe hungry, caring for the poor, the elderly, or the disabled, this \nbudget falls short. When it comes to strengthening our economy, opening \nthe doors of opportunity, creating new jobs, and equipping America to \ncompete in the global economy, this budget again falls short. Instead, \nit cuts vital programs on which people rely and offers even more tax \ncuts to the wealthy.\n  Franklin Roosevelt had it right: The test of our progress is not \nwhether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is \nwhether we provide enough for those who have too little. This budget \ndoes none of that. Countless families are facing serious problems. They \nare being hit on all sides with higher health costs, higher heating \ncosts, higher college costs, higher gas prices. Their jobs and pensions \nare in danger. Their savings are at an all-time low. They are caught in \na prescription drug nightmare because of a bill that put the drug \nindustry and the insurance industry ahead of patients.\n  These are hard-working men and women who play by the rules and take \ncare of their families, but this budget lets them down. Instead of \ninvesting in education, it cuts school programs. Instead of helping the \nelderly with their heating bills, it slashes funding for low-income \nheating programs. Instead of training workers for new jobs, it \neliminates job training and vocational education programs. Instead of \nhelping\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\nour young people afford college, it cuts college aid. But it provides \nfor $1.7 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. Those are the wrong \npriorities for America. Compare that to the recent cuts to Medicaid. \nCompare that with the $379 million cut in heating assistance for the \npoor. Compare that with the cuts to education. Compare that with the \n$456 million needed to help disadvantaged high school students reach \ncollege under the TRIO, Upward Bound, or Talent Search Programs.\n  Yes, a budget is a statement of priorities, and we have seen where \nthis administration's priorities are on health. The Medicaid Program is \nkey to promoting a real culture of life in America. Medicaid provides \ncare to a third of all mothers giving birth, including the prenatal, \npediatric care their children need to be healthy.\n  Mere hours after the President declared in the State of the Union \nAddress that the Government would meet its responsibility to provide \nhealth care for the poor and elderly, the President signed a bill to \nimpose draconian cuts on the Medicaid Program. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, that bill will cause 45,000 poor Americans \nto lose coverage over the next 5 years, and 65,000 will lose coverage \nwithin 10 years, and 60 percent of those losing coverage will be \nchildren.\n  In Maryland, a quarter of families subject to increased premiums \ndisenrolled. In Oregon, higher costs caused disenrollment, and 67 \npercent of those who disenrolled became uninsured. Because of these \nMedicaid cuts, 13 million Medicaid beneficiaries will have to pay more \nfor their prescriptions over the next 5 years, and 20 million will have \nto pay more over the next 10 years.\n  When copayments rise for the poorest patients, health declines. A \nstudy in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that \nincreased copayments for medications for poor families caused an 88-\npercent increase in adverse events, such as heart attacks and strokes, \nand caused a 78-percent increase in emergency room visits.\n  This is what happens. If you cut back on providing assistance with \ncopays for individuals who otherwise would be eligible, we are finding \nout, you end up paying a great deal more out of the health care budget, \nin addition to increasing the pain, anxiety and difficulties these \nfamilies are facing.\n  A single mother with two children who makes $8 an hour currently pays \n$3 when she visits the doctor and does not have any cost sharing when \nher children go to the pediatrician. Under the new law, when her child \ngoes to the pediatrician with an ear infection, she may be charged $20. \nWhen she goes to a doctor for treatment and a test for diabetes, she \nwill pay $50. She may have to pay as much as $832 a year.\n  A single mother with two children earning $25,000 now pays no \npremiums or cost sharing for a child's medical care and pays $3 \ncopayments for herself. Under the new law, she will now be charged \nmonthly premiums for Medicaid coverage for herself and her children. \nEven if she manages to pay the premiums, she may have to pay $40 for a \nvisit to the pediatrician, and she will have to pay as much as $1,250 a \nyear for Medicaid.\n  Do you know what happens? Those parents, when they have that sick \nchild who has the ear infection or has that cough, are thinking: Is \nthis child $40 sick or $50 sick? Or if I go to the emergency room, is \nthis child $125 sick? Is my child $125 sick? I think I will wait \ntonight. Sure, they are coughing, and sure they are in pain, sure they \nare suffering, but I am working at a low paying job, and I have to make \nthe decision about whether I can afford care.\n  For a single mother of two earning the minimum wage, the new Medicaid \nlaw imposes additional cost sharing on her children. They would now \nface copayments for certain prescription drugs, and these copayments \nwould, for the first time, be indexed to the rate of medical inflation, \nwhich is higher than the general inflation. And on minimum wage, her \nincome would not even keep up with general inflation since the minimum \nwage has not been increased since 1997.\n  To add to these damaging reductions, the President's budget proposes \nanother $14 billion in reductions to Medicaid. The Senate budget \nresolution has not adopted these serious cuts, but time and again, we \nhave seen how the House-Senate conferees follow the administration's \nproposal rather than the Senate's measure.\n  The President's budget proposes $36 billion in Medicare cuts over the \nnext 5 years and $105 billion over the next 10 years. This means higher \npremiums for seniors and the disabled and will result in reductions of \nquality of care at hospitals and home health agencies.\n  In Massachusetts, President Bush's Medicare proposal will mean that \nour hospitals will have to cut their budgets by more than $400 million, \nhome health agencies by $50 million, and nursing homes by $150 million.\n  Again, the Senate resolution has not adopted these reductions, but we \nknow where the conference report is likely to end up.\n  In addition, the budget resolution includes a deeply troubling \nprocedural barrier to fixing the problems in the Medicare drug program. \nThe Republican budget effectively torpedoes any sensible measure to \nimprove the benefit provided to seniors by requiring any such \nimprovements to overcome a point of order.\n  The budget resolution has adopted major reductions to public health \nprograms. Under these reductions, Massachusetts would lose millions of \ndollars for programs that protect the health and safety of our people. \nThat cut means 17 rape crisis centers across our State will face \nsignificant financial hardship, and our programs on violence prevention \nand suicide would effectively be eliminated.\n  The cuts mean that programs to keep our children healthy would be \neliminated. Programs to screen newborns as early as possible for \nhearing loss would be eliminated and so would our State oral health \nprogram. That means 59,000 children would not get basic dental \nscreening, and over 35 programs that train health care providers to \ndeliver care in underserved areas and support diversity and proficiency \nin health care would be eliminated.\n  Although we are living with the threat of natural and manmade \ndisasters, the proposed cuts would compromise our emergency medical \nservices and impair the system's ability to function as a safety net \nfor catastrophe.\n  Under the chairman's budget, NIH funding will barely keep up with \ninflation. Last year's budget was cut so our medical research programs \nare still suffering setbacks. Over the last 2 years, the NIH budget has \nincreased by an average of 1 percent per year. Not since 1970 has the \nNIH been so consistently underfunded. If the NIH budget were simply to \nkeep up with inflation since 2005, we will have to increase the budget \nby another $1.8 billion.\n  This chart indicates the Bush administration cuts to vital NIH \nresearch. We see the important increases during early 2000, 2001, 2002, \nand 2003. Then we see dramatic reductions. Under the President's \nbudget, the NIH budget would be flat for the second year in a row. That \nhasn't happened in more than half a century.\n\n  This is the century of the life sciences. With all that we know about \nthe slicing of the gene, DNA, and all the possibilities of stem cell \nresearch, most researchers believe that the opportunities to make \nenormous progress on the diseases which affect every family, whether it \nis cancer, Alzheimer's, or heart disease, are immeasurable. But we are \nnot going to have those promises fulfilled if we see the kinds of \nreductions that we have seen in this budget.\n  We hear a great deal about the challenges we are facing to compete \ninternationally. We are told we need to be an innovative society, and \nan innovative society needs innovative life sciences. That is certainly \nan area of enormous possibility if we are going to provide resources \nfor the basic research. But, no, we are cutting back in these extremely \nimportant areas. These are the areas in which we are cutting back: We \nhave seen reductions in the Cancer Institute, a reduction in the Heart, \nLung, and Blood Institute, reductions in research in diabetes and \nkidney diseases. We know that $1 out of $4 spent under Medicare are \nspent on diabetics; $1 out of $10 in the general health area are spent \non diabetics.\n  When we make breakthroughs in the diabetes treatments, we are going \nto see an enormous change for the people who are affected by this \ndisease, and\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\nwe are going to have an enormous impact in terms of total health care \ncosts. But we are cutting back on those areas of research and we are \ncutting back on mental health and cutting back on child health and \ndevelopment. 18 of the 19 NIH institutes will suffer cuts compared to \nthe rate of inflation, which means that NIH will fall behind in the \nrace for new cures.\n  I don't believe those are America's priorities, but they are the \npriorities of this President, and we are going to find out if they are \nthe priorities of this Senate.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to address the issue of education. \nThis budget also fails to make education a priority. In this shrinking \nworld, education is an even greater priority than ever before, and our \nbudget should reflect that.\n  As a nation, we must invest in Americans by ensuring access to the \nhighest quality educational opportunities. We need to have the best \neducated, the best trained, the most sophisticated individuals, and we \nneed to nourish the capacities of every person in the Nation.\n  Yet the President's budget has proposed the biggest cut to education \nin the 26-year history of the Department of Education.\n  Here is what we have seen on the No Child Left Behind Act--I will \nhave an opportunity in the debate to go through this in greater \ndetail--but the commitment to No Child Left Behind, an Act signed into \nlaw by the President, is to take every child who is not up to \nproficiency and to make sure they are going to have the support systems \nto get them up to proficiency--smaller class sizes, better trained \nteachers, supplementary services, and greater involvement of parents in \nthese various programs.\n  However, what we have seen is that we are not living up to that \ncommitment--instead, we are leaving children behind because of \ninadequate funding. This year alone, 3.5 million to 4 million of the \nnation's students will be left behind.\n  We are seeing now under the current program that 29 States are going \nto lose Title I funding, which are funds for the schools in greatest \nneed. Under this budget, there are going to be some 29 States, \nincluding the State of Virginia, that are going to lose funding.\n  Many of the programs that the President has slated for elimination--\nGEAR UP, TRIO Upward Bound and Talent Search--have been incredibly \nsuccessful in terms of providing students who might not have had the \nopportunity to continue their education with the support they need to \ndo so. In the TRIO Upward Bound program we find that when measured \nagainst students of similar backgrounds, nearly 70 percent of the \nstudents who participate in these programs go on to higher education. \nIf we take a similar review of the students who don't participate, only \nabout 54 percent of them attend college.\n  Now let's look at what is happening in higher education. This chart \nshows the cost of attendance at a 4-year public college versus the \nmaximum Pell grant. In 2001, we look at the gap between the cost of \ngoing to a 4-year public college, and we look at it today, and we see \nhow this gap has grown to about 8,000 dollars. We have about 400,000 \nyoung Americans who would be able to go to college and who want go to \ncollege, who have the intellectual ability to go to college, but who \njust cannot afford it. And those numbers are increasing dramatically \nover time.\n  At an appropriate time, I intend to offer an amendment, hopefully \nwith my colleague Senator Menendez and others, that will increase the \nmaximum Pell grant from $4,050 to $4,500, restore the eliminations of \nTRIO, GEAR UP, the LEAP program, and Perkins loans, and further \nincreases the funding for all student aid programs, including what they \ncall the SEOG, work study and graduate education, and restores cuts in \nvocational education and job training programs.\n  The cuts in the job training program make no sense whatsoever. We \nhave 73,000 jobs that are going begging in my State of Massachusetts. \nWe have 156,000 people who are looking for jobs. What is missing is the \nconnection between the training of those people who want the jobs and \nthe jobs that are there, and in this particular budget, we are cutting \nthose training programs, cutting the education programs, cutting the \ntraining programs, and even reducing the title I programs that are so \nessential.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much additional time does the Senator \nneed?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. An additional 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts on the resolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, please let me know when I have 30 seconds \nleft.\n  At some time, we will have an opportunity to see the Senate vote for \nan increase in the areas of education, offset by closing a loophole \nthat has been accepted here in the Senate by 80 votes or more that are \navailable out there at the present time.\n  As many of us have seen, in a recent report, it was stated that about \n650,000 engineers will graduate from China this year. There will be \n330,000 engineers graduating from India, and 72,000 engineers from the \nUnited States--and half of those are foreign students. We are falling \nfurther and further behind. We are not talking just about outsourcing, \nwe are talking about outsourcing basic research. When we find IBM \nopening up their new research centers in Bangalore, Intel opening up \ntheir new research centers abroad, hiring 2,500 engineers over there, \nwe have to ask: Where are we here in the United States? Are we giving \nthe appropriate kinds of support for students to continue their \neducation?\n  We have seen the request and the statements that have been made in a \nbipartisan way by Senator Alexander and Senator Bingaman, the reports \nof the Academy of Engineers, the National Academy of Sciences, all of \nwhich say that we need to respond here in the United States the way we \nresponded at the time the Russians sent up Sputnik, and that is to have \na major investment in the young people of this country.\n  Yes, we can give focus and attention just narrowly to math and \nscience, and certainly we ought to provide that, but in order to really \nmeet the challenge we are facing because of globalization, we have to \nmake sure we have the best trained, best educated young people and that \nthey are ready to meet these challenges. We need to equip every single \nAmerican with the ability to compete and succeed, and we need to equip \nour country to be able to deal with globalization and ensure that we \nare well-educated, that we will be an innovative economy, and that we \nwill provide innovative research. And when we have an innovative \neconomy, we will have an innovative defense.\n  This is a matter of national security. This is a matter of national \nsecurity and national defense, making sure that we are going to be at \nthe cutting edge of all of the research that is possible over a period \nof years. That is going to be the issue in question on which we will \nhave an opportunity to vote during the course of this debate and \ndiscussion, and I look forward to the opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to colleagues on our side of the \naisle, what we are attempting to do is change\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\nthe way we handle the budget debate this year and to do it in a way \nthat will have more of the votes occur before the vote-athon on \nThursday night. That is what Senator Gregg and I are attempting to \naccomplish. It is going to take cooperation.\n  What we are doing with our colleagues now, we have agreed on the \nfirst six amendments to be debated and the time for each. What we are \nasking our colleagues to do is agree to exchange time for certainty--\ncertainty of when their amendment would be considered, certainty for \nthe amount of time they would have but less time than they could have \nunder the rules. People can disagree and they can say: No, we won't \nagree to that. If they don't agree, we are going to be right back in \nthe soup, and we will be here until the wee hours Thursday. We don't \nthink that is the best way to debate this issue. We don't think that is \nthe best way for colleagues, all of our colleagues, to have the best \nchance of having their amendments considered.\n  So I am sending this message out to colleagues: If we work together, \nI think we can improve this budget debate process and have a whole \nseries of votes tomorrow afternoon that we won't then have to have \nThursday and do it again the next day and do it again the next day. \nThat is what we are asking colleagues to do.\n  Mr. President, would 20 minutes be sufficient for the Senator from \nNorth Dakota?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Twenty minutes, yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have enjoyed the debate, the discussions \ntoday, and I have watched some of it from my office. The budget is a \ndiscussion about this country's value systems. It is very simple. I \nhave mentioned many times on the floor the proposition that if someone \nasked you to write an obituary for someone you had never met but who \nhad died and the only information you had about that person was their \ncheck register, what would you write? Well, you would write a little \nsomething about what that person felt were his priorities in life, what \nwas his or her value system. What did they invest in? What did they \nspend money on? That would represent their value system. That is what \nyou would tell about that deceased person you never met.\n  One hundred years from now, we will all be dead. Historians will be \nable to look back at this moment and say: What were our values? What \nwas our value system? By looking at the Federal budget, they will say: \nHere is what the United States held dear; here is what they invested \nin; here is what their priorities and their values were.\n  Now, because this budget represents a set of priorities and values, \nit is important to take a look at the first step in the budget process, \nand that is the budget sent to us by President.\n  I recall, in the year 2001, the debate on the floor of the Senate \nabout the President's fiscal policy. This President came to town at the \ntime when we had a very large budget surplus for the first time in many \ndecades, and were predicting surpluses in future years.\n  This President said: Let's give away this future surplus. This money \ndoesn't belong to the Government; it belongs to the taxpayers.\n  Some of us said: Well, we don't have that surplus yet. Yes, the year \nthat we are in is a surplus, but we don't have the next 10 years as a \nsurplus. What if something should happen? Maybe we should be a little \nconservative.\n  The President said: No, don't worry about being conservative. Let's \ngive back money we don't have but are expected to have because experts \ntell us we will have a big surplus during the next 10 years.\n  So the President got his way and gave very large tax cuts. The most \nsignificant amount went to the wealthiest Americans. And those large \ntax cuts which now eat quite a hole in our revenue stream for this \nGovernment turned out to be tax cuts, cutting revenue at the time when \nwe hit a recession some months later, the 9/11 attacks in 2005, about 9 \nmonths, 8 months later; then we had the war on terrorism, the war in \nIraq. So these large budget surpluses turned into very large budget \ndeficits.\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad, has described with this chart where \nthis administration will take us. This doesn't take an advanced degree \nfrom Wharton School of Economics to understand. All you have to do is \nlook at this red ink and evaluate where this fiscal policy is taking \nAmerica.\n  I believe both political parties have contributed mightily to this \ncountry. These are political parties, Democrats and Republicans, that \nhave a grand tradition of offering good ideas to America.\n  One of the things you used to be able to count on the Republicans for \nwas fiscal policy. The caricature was that they wore wire-rimmed \nglasses and gray suits, they looked like they just swallowed a lemon, \nand you could always count on them saying: We demand a balanced budget; \nwe demand a fiscal policy that adds up for the good and for the wealth \nand for this country's future. There is no such thing as those \nconservative Republicans anymore. There is a Republican in the White \nHouse, and Republicans in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate who have a \ncompletely different fiscal policy. It is a fiscal policy that steps us \nup year after year after year after year toward greater debt.\n  I told you, things didn't turn out quite the way the President \nsuggested. He got his way here in the Congress because he had the votes \nto get his way. So we have a fiscal policy that cut taxes mostly for \nthe wealthy--a few crumbs for the rest but mostly tax cuts for the \nwealthy--and increased spending, especially relating to the aftermath \nof 9/11 and the war in Iraq. We had the Emergency Terrorism Response \nSupplemental Appropriations Act and DOD Appropriations Act, $17.6 \nbillion added to that as an emergency in the fiscal year 2002; \nemergency supplemental, $13.6 billion, 2002; emergency supplemental, \n$65.9 billion, 2003; emergency supplemental, $85 billion, 2004. I could \ngo on and on. Over $400 billion sent to us by this President as an \nemergency request passed by the Congress, none of it paid for, all of \nit piled right on our children's debt which they will pay for at some \npoint in the future.\n  Now, did Congress vote for this? Sure. Is anybody going to say: Let's \nsend our troops, but let's not provide the equipment they need? No, I \ndon't think so. I think most of us have the same view on that. You send \ntroops to go into harm's way, then you have a responsibility to provide \nthe things they need to do their job. But shouldn't there be some \nrequests of the rest of the American people--not just the troops but \nthe rest of the American people--to weigh in here and to help pay for \nsome of these things? If we are going to ask that it be spent in \nsupport of the troops, shouldn't we ask that it also be paid for?\n  As I said, we have a fiscal policy that is out of balance, out of \ncontrol, and we need to put it back on track. Let me describe what is \nhappening with some of this emergency money. It is the case that we \nhave been hit with a lot of things: a recession back in 2001--and no, \nPresident Bush didn't inherit a recession. Let's set the facts \nstraight, if we can. The recession that began on this President's \nwatch, then 9/11, and then a series of others things, including \nHurricane Katrina.\n  Not only do we have a fiscal policy that is completely and thoroughly \nout of whack, adding debt after debt after debt to our children year \nafter year, we also have a sea of incompetence almost never before \nseen. Let me describe that with respect to Hurricane Katrina.\n  This is a picture of Paul Mullinax. Do you see Paul there? He has a \nportable radio, he has a couple of bottles of water, it looks like \nmaybe he has some chips, and I think this is a little stove.\n  Paul is a really interesting guy. I met him, actually. He is an \nindependent truck driver from Florida. As you see, he is sitting out in \nfront of his truck. This is Paul's truck. He was sitting with a long \nline of trucks, and that picture was taken on a base, Maxwell Air Force \nbase in Montgomery, AL. There were 100 refrigerated trucks at \nMontgomery, AL.\n  Mr. Mullinax was instructed by FEMA, in the post-Katrina Hurricane \nperiod, to take a truckload of ice from Newburgh, NY, to Montgomery, \nAL. Actually they said take it to Carthage, MO, first so he picked up \nthe ice at Newburgh, NY, and then he went to Carthage, MO, and the \nminute he got there they told him you need to go to\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\nMaxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, AL, so he got there.\n  Then Mr. Mullinax sat there in front of his refrigerator truck for 12 \ndays with 100 other refrigerator trucks that were also hauling ice. The \nvictims of Katrina desperately needed this ice, but it just sat there \nat an Air Force base in Alabama.\n  So here was Paul, a Florida trucker who hauled the ice to Missouri, \nthen was told you need to go to Alabama, and with 100 other truckers, \nPaul sat in front of his truck for 12 days. Then he was told by FEMA, \nyou need to take this ice to Massachusetts. You think I am kidding. I \nhear someone giggling about that. The folks who were the victims of \nKatrina needed the ice but he was told by FEMA to deliver it to \nGloucester, MA, and so he did. I don't know what happened to the other \ntrucks. There were 100 trucks lined up there.\n  It cost $15,000 to have the American taxpayers have Paul pick up ice \nin New York and deliver it to Massachusetts by way of Carthage, MO, and \nMaxwell Air Force Base, AL. In the meantime, the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina could not get any ice. So Paul sat. Then he went to \nMassachusetts to offload his ice. One load of ice, and there were \nhundreds and hundreds of such trucks--and just one load of ice cost \n$15,000, and was hauled from New York ultimately to Massachusetts.\n  A Mississippi sheriff, in the middle of all this, got so frustrated \nwith the ice truck fiasco that he ended up commandeering 2 trucks full \nof ice and sending them directly to the relief centers for Hurricane \nKatrina. Sheriff Billy McGee saw trucks sitting at a staging area in \nCamp Shelby, MS, so he ordered two of the trucks to be sent to Brooklyn \nand Sheeplow, MS, and a National Guard man tried to stop the sheriff \nfrom rerouting these two trucks. The sheriff had the guardsman arrested \nand got the trucks where they were to be offloaded for the victims, and \nnow the sheriff is being prosecuted for a misdemeanor.\n  Why do I tell you all this? Because we are spending a massive amount \nof money with parts of a Government that are fundamentally incompetent.\n  It is almost unbelievable to see the way some of this money is \nwasted. I think a lot of people take a look at the Federal Government \nand they say there is a lot of waste, and I agree with that. We ought \nto tighten our belts. We ought to get rid of some of this waste.\n  But there are lots of programs that are vitally important, and that \ndeserve funding. This includes, for instance, health programs for \npeople who live in rural areas of America. The President doesn't \ndistinguish between good spending and bad spending. The President \ndoesn't do that. He says my biggest priority is to preserve a 15-\npercent tax rate on capital gains and, oh, by the way, everything else \ncan go by the wayside to pay for it.\n  So the community service block grant--it doesn't matter, we can get \nrid of that if we want to. Rural health, we can get rid of that. All \nthese issues are less important to this administration than the issue \nof preserving the 15-percent tax rate on capital gains. That is a fact.\n  I have worked with Senator Conrad for many years. We both come from \nthe same State. There is nobody better prepared on the floor of the \nSenate to make the case on thoughtful and solid budgeting than Senator \nConrad. He understands common sense, understands the numbers.\n  I see another of my colleagues volunteering for recognition here--and \nI will say that the chairman of the committee and the ranking member of \nthe committee have had an impossible job.\n  Trying to make sense of the budget sent to us by this administration \nis like trying to connect two ends of two plates of spaghetti. It is \nimpossible. It cannot work because this is a budget that does not add \nup under any set of circumstances.\n  Social services, that is the money that goes in grants and direct \nappropriations to both agencies and nonprofits to help people around \nthis country--they are the ones that take a hit in many of these areas. \nI held a meeting with social service groups and nonprofits in North \nDakota and asked them about this budget. They told me about the people \nwho are going to get hurt as a result of this. None of those people \nserve here in this Chamber. They are just people who try to make a \nliving every day or try to exist in retirement with little income.\n  One of the stories that was interesting to me was a nonprofit group \nwhich the day before had an 81-year-old woman show up applying for a \njob. This is a group that helps people get work. The 81-year-old woman \nwanted a job. Why? Because she lost her last job. What was her last \njob, at 81 years old? Cleaning office buildings at 1 a.m. Go in at 1 in \nthe morning and clean office buildings at age 81. The company downsized \na little bit and she lost her job and now she wants another job. Why? \nBecause her payment under Social Security was $170 a month. That is \nwhat she was left with. So she has to work at 81.\n  Should this budget reflect the needs of this woman who is cleaning \nbuildings at 1 in the morning at age 81? Sure it should. There are a \nlot of people in this country who are vulnerable, who are in \ndifficulty, who understand they need some help. A good budget, a \nthoughtful budget reaches out to those folks to say here is a helping \nhand. We want to help you up. This budget doesn't do that.\n  This budget offers a helping hand only to the rich. In fact, every \nbudget since 2001 has been a budget that says let's give a helping \nhand--to those who have much. That is the way the budget has been \nworking. It is unbelievable.\n  I want to put up another picture. I have used this a fair number of \ntimes. I do it because a budget is about how much revenue do you have \nand how much spending are you going to have. Let me tell you why we \ndon't have enough revenue, and why the President wants to cut funding \nfor key programs, especially program cuts that will hurt the most \nvulnerable in our country.\n\n  This is a nice picture of something called the Ugland House. It is a \nfive-story white building on Church Street in the Cayman Islands. \nAccording to David Evans, an enterprising reporter who did the story \nabout this building, this building houses 12,748 companies. The \ncompanies are not all there in person. I am not suggesting that. But \nthis is the official home in the Cayman Islands, on Church Street, for \n12,748 companies.\n  Do you know why? It is their mailing address. They need a formal \nmailing address in a tax haven country so they can run their income \nthrough a tax haven country and avoid paying the taxes they would owe \nto the United States of America.\n  This goes on, getting worse. Is anybody talking about cutting that? \nNo, not really. In fact, this issue of cutting taxes for those who are \nthe most well off in America is not abating at all. This administration \nbelieves its highest priority is to retain that 15 percent.\n  Interestingly enough, we don't have enough money for community \ndevelopment block grants, rural health, the Byrne grants and so on, but \nlast year there was enough money in this Chamber to decide that these \ncompanies and many more should get a 5.25-percent tax rate. That is \nright, 5.25-percent tax rate on money they repatriate from abroad. The \nexpectation was they were going to pay a 35-percent tax rate. That was \nthe statutory rate. But we said--I didn't vote for it--but we said as a \nCongress, we want to be generous so all of those big companies with \nstandard brands out there you would recognize, they want to repatriate \n$30 billion worth of income, bring it back to this country. Did they \npay 10-percent income taxes on it as most people would at the lowest \nincome Americans? No, they didn't. Fifteen percent or 25 percent or 30? \nNo, they didn't pay any of that. They paid 5.25 percent. They saved \n$102 to $104 billion.\n  This Senate had enough resources to decide we want to give the \nbiggest interests of this country a $102 billion tax break by allowing \nthem to pay a 5.25-percent tax rate but now we say we are out of money, \nwe can't afford to deal with those ends of the spending side that \naffect the most vulnerable in our country.\n  I think those are very strange priorities. There is much to be said \nabout this budget. I am mindful, also, that it is easier to criticize \nthan it is to propose. I think it was Mark Twain who was once asked if \nhe would be engaged in a debate and said, Of course, as long as I can \ntake the negative side. They said, We haven't told you the subject. He \nsaid, It doesn't matter, the negative side takes no preparation.\n\n[[Page S2005]]\n\n  This takes even less than no preparation, to look at this budget and \nlook at what this is doing to America and understand that this is to \nfiscal policy like mud wrestling is to the performing arts. This is an \nabysmal failure that is dragging this country down, down, down into \ndeeper debt. The question I think most people would ask--they certainly \nask those who propose this from the White House, and those who \nconstruct it here, is do you believe adding additional debt is a move \ntoward greater sensibility in fiscal policy?\n  The answer has to be no.\n  I have a whole series of recommendations on where we should cut \nfunding. I will not go over them at the moment and I will be happy to \ncome back at some point. I would start with programs such as TV Marti. \nWe actually spend money--we bought a new airplane last year to send \ntelevision signals to Cubans that they can't see. We have spent close \nto $200 million on that program. It ought to be shut off immediately, \nbut we can't do it because too many of the Members of the Senate keep \nvoting for it. Why? Because of Florida. Why? Because of politics.\n  That is for another day. I have a whole series of recommendations. \nThese are areas where we can and should cut Federal spending. I think \nwe ought to. We ought to begin collecting revenues from companies that \nhave been generously provided tax breaks from the Senate and our \ncolleagues in the House, pushed by this President. We ought to get our \nfiscal house in order.\n  As I started, I said I watched some of this debate today. This is \nvery important. This establishes some of the priorities for this \nCongress and I hope finally this year we might get them right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, for his comments and for his insights. I especially like \nhis picture of the building in the Cayman Islands that is the home to \nmore than 12,700 companies. Why is it their home? Because they are \nengaged in a giant tax dodge, that is why. What they are doing is \nacting as though they are doing business in the Cayman Islands so they \ncan show their profits in the Cayman Islands, because the Cayman \nIslands do not have any taxes. What these companies are doing, many of \nthem are operating in the United States where they earn their money, \nbut they don't show their profits here. They have a series of \nsubsidiaries and they show the profits of the subsidiaries in the \nCayman Islands so they avoid their taxes here. That is what is going \non. It is a giant scam. That is not the only scam. There are all kinds \nof scams going on.\n  One of perhaps the most remarkable scams is that companies in the \nUnited States are buying sewer systems of cities in Europe and \ndepreciating them on their books in the United States to reduce their \ntax burden here. Then they lease back the sewer systems to the cities \nin Europe that are actually using them. If that isn't an outrageous \nscam, I don't know what is. They are not just doing it with sewer \nsystems, they are doing it with metro systems, they are doing it with \nall kinds of public infrastructure. That should not be permitted. Some \nsay if you shut that down you are increasing taxes. I don't think so. I \nthink you are collecting taxes that were legitimately owed in the first \nplace and you are stopping a scam. That is what we did in the Budget \nCommittee. When we offered additional spending--and we did, we offered \n$126 billion of additional spending and $104 billion of it was one \namendment.\n  Some might say, there the Democrats go again, spending money. What \nwere we spending money on? What was that amendment about? I will tell \nyou what it was about. It was to make the assistance for veterans in \nthis country mandatory, not discretionary. I think people will be \nsurprised to find out that the way our budget is devised, support for \nour veterans is considered discretionary. Medicare is considered \nmandatory, Social Security is considered mandatory, but aid to our \nNation's veterans is considered to be discretionary.\n  We thought that was not right so we proposed switching aid to \nveterans from discretionary accounts to mandatory accounts because we \nthink that is what the American people intend. I don't think they think \nit is a discretionary matter, to provide assistance to young men and \nwomen who have been fighting for us in Afghanistan and Iraq. So we \nproposed putting that on the mandatory side of the budget. That shows \nup as a cost--$104 billion. We offset it by proposing closing tax \nloopholes in the tax gap.\n  The tax gap is now running at $350 billion a year. The difference \nbetween what is owed and what is being paid is $350 billion a year, \naccording to the testimony of the Revenue Commissioner of this \nadministration. He said it before the Senate Budget Committee, and he \nsaid we could capture $50 billion to $100 billion a year without \nfundamentally changing the relationship of taxpayers to the Revenue \nService. We should do that.\n  Some say that is a tax increase. I don't think that is a tax \nincrease; I think that is collecting taxes that are already due and \nowed but aren't being paid. If we are not going to start insisting that \neverybody pays, we are just going to run a system where some pay, then \nshame on us, shame on the system. That is unfair to the vast majority \nof people who are paying what they owe. The vast majority of people and \nthe vast majority of companies pay what they owe, but unfortunately we \nhave an increasing number of people and an increasing number of \ncompanies that aren't. That is unfair to all the rest of us, and it is \ndramatically increasing the debt of our country at the worst possible \ntime.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are two other issues that relate to \na tax hike, because a budget is about how much revenue you have coming \nin and how much you are preparing to spend. I mentioned this little \nChristmas gift--it is not really little--$102 billion given by the \nCongress to companies that had parked income overseas but were \nanticipating having to repatriate to this country and pay a 35-percent \ncorporate tax rate. This Congress and the President felt: Gee, we \nprobably should--maybe I should not include the President so much; it \nwas more the Congress decided that we really ought to give those \ncorporations a 5\\1/4\\-percent tax rate or a $102 billion tax break. So \nthe Congress did, and not with Senator Conrad's vote nor my vote, but \nnonetheless the Congress did that. About $330 billion was repatriated.\n  Very quickly, we learned that the pharmaceutical industry repatriated \nat the early stages--I am not sure what the final stage was--$75 \nbillion which they earned abroad. The interesting thing was the \npharmaceutical industry said: We charge the highest prices to American \nconsumers because we don't make money elsewhere. We have to charge \nlower prices in other countries because we are prevented from charging \nhigher prices. Now we discover they were making a lot of money overseas \nbecause given the chance to pay a 5\\1/4\\-percent tax rate, when they \nrepatriated it, they repatriated a bunch of money they earned overseas \nat lower prices for the same prescription drugs. We not only saw the \ntaxpayers short shrifted by the highest prices in the world, but now we \nsee the drug companies getting $75 billion of their income being taxed \nat 5\\1/4\\ percent.\n  If I might make one additional point, we also have a provision in tax \nlaw which says to companies: Shut down your plant in America, fire your \nworkers, move it to China, and we will give you a tax cut. And by the \nway, the Joint Tax Committee says that is worth $1.2 billion a year or \n$12 billion in 10 years. So we will spend $12 billion in the next 10 \nyears giving tax cuts to companies that shut their American plants, \nfire their American workers, and move their jobs overseas. If there is \nany perversity in this Congress, it is those who refuse to be willing \nto shut down that kind of a tax break. We have had four votes on it. I \nhave offered it four times. We have lost all four times. And on four \noccasions, people stood up here in the Senate and supported a tax break \nto companies that would ship their jobs overseas. It is almost \nunbelievable.\n  The reason I mention this is that in the case of putting together a \nbudget,\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\nyou ought to be able to at least shut down those drains on the revenue \nside that run against the public interest in this country. Is it in the \npublic interest to pay those companies to shut down their American \nplants and fire their workers? I don't think so. Certainly it is not. \nIt is just nuts for the Congress to be saying: Let us reward that \nbehavior. And that is exactly what is happening this year to the tune \nof $1.2 billion.\n  I say to my colleague from North Dakota that there are many areas in \nrevenue where we would try to plug a drain on our revenue, and the \nother side will say: You are increasing taxes. Yes. I am increasing \ntaxes for those who aren't paying, for God's sake.\n  Maybe somebody camped out in the Ugland House, an official address in \nthe Cayman Islands, with a lawyer camped out, so they can move their \njobs to China, sell their products in America, and run their income \nthrough a house in the Cayman Islands and avoid paying taxes. Do we \nwant to increase their taxes? Darned right. Why? Because they are not \npaying their fair share. Everybody else does. What about them? Yet the \nmajority party keeps saying that if you are going to plug these \nloopholes, you are increasing taxes. That is a strange viewpoint, and I \nthink one we need to fix. We need to solve these problems.\n  I appreciate the work of Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I don't consider it a \ntax increase to actually collect the taxes that individuals or \ncompanies already owe which they are not paying. That is not a tax \nincrease. No tax rate is increased. That is not creating a new tax; \nthat is collecting the taxes that are already owed.\n  The Revenue Commissioner testified before the Senate Budget Committee \nthat the tax gain--the difference between what is owed and what is \nactually being paid--is $350 billion a year. The deficit is going to be \n$371 billion, and we are not collecting $350 billion of revenue that is \nowed. I don't consider that a tax increase. I think that is simply \nenforcing the laws that already exist.\n  I want to again alert colleagues. We are trying to change the way the \nbudget debate occurs. The chairman and I are trying very hard. We have \nheard the complaints of our colleagues about vote-aramas. A vote-arama \ntypically occurs because time runs out before the amendment that has \nbeen offered has a chance to be voted on under the rules of the Senate. \nWe are trying to make sure that the people have a chance to debate \nthose amendments and get a vote and dispense with some of these votes \nbefore we get to Thursday night.\n  I hope very much that colleagues are going to agree to the timeframe \nthat we have set out in order to accomplish that purpose. If people \nresist that, then we are going to be right back in a vote-arama \nThursday night and voting until the wee hours of the morning. If people \nwant a reform of the way we do business here, we need them to cooperate \nand help us.\n  Perhaps the chairman could review what the order of business is going \nto be for the rest of the afternoon and this evening in terms of the \nopportunities that are going to exist for colleagues to come to the \nfloor tonight and talk about their amendments and make their opening \nstatements. We are going to be in business to the extent that people \ntake advantage of the time that is available.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I \nagree with him and thank him for encouraging our membership to \nparticipate actively early in the debate.\n  As he mentioned, we hope to reduce the exercise known as vote-arama \nso we are not here until the wee hours of Friday morning or Thursday \nnight, and one way to do that is to get these amendments up and get \nthem offered.\n  What we are going to do this evening is reach an agreement for the \nfirst six amendments, which we will begin debating tomorrow in \nsequence, and then we will vote them tomorrow, with the vote time \ncoming off the bill. This evening, we are going to have a vote at 5:30. \nI hope Members will come down between now and 5:30 and talk about the \nbill or talk about their amendments. Then, after the vote at 5:30, the \nfloor will be open for Members to come forward and talk about their \namendments--not to offer them at that time because we are going to set \nup this sequence. If Members have amendments they wish to offer, get in \ntouch with us, and we will get them in debating order.\n  That is the game plan at the moment. I appreciate the efforts of the \nSenator from North Dakota in making that happen.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have Members who are now on their way \nto the floor to speak on the budget.\n  I again implore colleagues, if they want to make an opening \nstatement, tonight is the opportunity to do so. If they want to talk \nabout an amendment and not offer it tonight but talk about it, tonight \nis the opportunity.\n  As we get into tomorrow, the time is going to be very scheduled in a \nvery disciplined way so that we can make maximum progress. It is going \nto be that way Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday until we finish. \nTonight is the opportunity to make opening statements. Tonight is the \nnight to talk about amendments that you might otherwise not get time to \ntalk about. Again, this won't be the time to actually offer amendments, \nbut you can describe it, you can debate it, and you can discuss it. \nPlease. We are giving colleagues this opportunity tonight so that \ntomorrow we can get amendments up and vote on amendments and get the \nwork of the Senate concluded.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I talked earlier about the $12 billion \nexpenditure, $1.2 billion a year over the next 10 years, according to \nthe Joint Tax Committee, that we use to reward companies that move \ntheir jobs overseas by giving them a tax break for such activity.\n  I have previously offered this on four occasions. I have lost it on \nfour occasions in the Senate. I can't believe there is anyone left in \nthe Senate who, having thoughtfully evaluated this, would believe we \nshould continue to give tax breaks to those who ship jobs overseas.\n  In the hope that other of my colleagues have seen the light or felt \nthe heat or some way or other found an epiphany about this subject, I \nanticipate offering this again and consider my previous statement to be \nan opening statement when I would offer such an amendment, so I \nwouldn't require any particular time on it. I have already spoken on \nit, and perhaps my two colleagues would consider at an appropriate \npoint accepting the amendment. It is infused with such wildly common, \ncommon sense my hope would be that my colleagues would decide to simply \naccept the amendment on this fifth occasion on the floor of offering \nthe amendment, especially inasmuch, I might say, as Ford Motor \nannounces that they are going to close plants and get rid of 30,000 \nworkers, General Motors is going to get rid of 25,000 to 30,000 \nworkers--and the list goes on. By the way, not only get rid of their \nworkers but cut their pensions and run them through with health care \nproblems and payment of corporate health care accounts.\n  Given all that news, my guess is that perhaps the sentiment would \nhave changed, believing maybe now is the appropriate time to shut down \nthis perverse tax incentive that rewards companies that fire their \nAmerican workers and move their jobs overseas.\n  At some appropriate point, I will consider offering it. I would not \nneed time to debate it.\n  Again, I say to my two colleagues that my hope and expectation would \nbe that you would just accept the amendment at some appropriate time. \nAnd this would stand as some future discussion, if I offer that \namendment at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I may have already asked, but let me renew \nthis unanimous consent request that for the duration of the budget \ndebate, when there is a quorum call, the time be deemed to be running \nagainst both sides equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                          water infrastructure\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished chairman \nin a colloquy.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I wish to express my appreciation for your efforts to put \ntogether a well-crafted fiscal year 2007 budget resolution that \nbalances the\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\nneed for critical Government programs while taking a strong stand \nagainst our budget deficit. \n  As the committee works to address these critical needs, one area of \nthe administration's request in particular needs special mention--the \nproposal to reduce funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, \nCWSRF, and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, DWSRF. Although the \nadministration's budget submission makes a number of difficult choices, \nthe recommendation to reduce funding to the CWSRF and the DWSRF \nrepresents a tremendous hardship for communities throughout the \ncountry.\n  Recent studies show that our Nation's water and wastewater \ninfrastructure needs severely exceed the availability of resources at \nthe local and State level to meet them. So many towns and cities across \nour country have exhausted their abilities to raise utility rates and \nissue bonds to pay for needed improvements. At the same time, \nincreasing Federal water quality and drinking water standards force \nutility managers to upgrade systems or fall into noncompliance.\n  No community or customer wants to be served by a failing water or \nwastewater facility, but the Federal Government's commitment to \naddressing these regulatory mandates must be mated with its assistance. \nWithout this commitment, communities can be left with nowhere to turn \nfor help. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2002 that the \nUnited States has between $132 billion and $388 billion in clean water \ninfrastructure needs alone over the next 20 years and the spending gap \nover that time will reach $70 to 360 billion. Similar figures affect \nthe Nation's drinking water infrastructure.\n  Idaho, a small State by population and infrastructure needs, still \nonly receives about $15 million annually, but its aggregate water and \nwastewater needs over the next 20 years will approach $1 billion by \nsome estimates. For instance, the rural city of Castleford, ID, has \nbecome out of compliance with the EPA's arsenic standard for drinking \nwater. In order to conform with the rule, the town, with a population \nof less than 200, will have to expend more than its entire annual \noperating budget to update the water infrastructure system.\n  The principal means for assisting utilities are the SRFs, which \nprovide a loan pool for State agencies to work with distressed \ncommunities. The SRF assistance help finance infrastructure projects at \nthe local level, and those communities in turn repay those loans so \nthat the State might aid other communities in need.\n  That is why I believe it is so problematic to see a continuing \ndecline in funding for the CWSRF and DWSRF. As recently as 2 years ago, \nfunding was $1.35 billion and $850 million, respectively. \nUnfortunately, budget pressure has forced the CWSRF down to $900 \nmillion in the current fiscal year, and the President has proposed to \nreduce that to $688 million for the next year. While the DWSRF is \nproposed at only an $8 million reduction, a fateful and disturbing \ntrend is developing.\n  As the past chairman of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee \non Fisheries, Wildlife, and Water, I led efforts in two successive \nCongresses to update and increase the authorization for the CWSRF and \nDWSRF. Although those legislative initiatives never made it to the \nSenate floor, I remain committed to helping communities in Idaho and \nthroughout the country address their water and wastewater needs.\n  During the debate on this budget resolution in the Budget Committee, \nan amendment was offered to condemn the President's call for reductions \nin those important accounts. I opposed that amendment because I want to \nfocus effort where it counts, by working with my distinguished chairman \nand the Appropriations Committee to restore funding for the two SRFs to \nthe best of our abilities.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask that you join me in working through the balance \nof the budget resolution process, as well as during your service on the \nAppropriations Committee, to help restore these vital funds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you, Senator Crapo. I agree with your comments about \nthe importance of these resources, and I applaud your leadership in \nthis area. While the President's request for these accounts is lower \nthan many would like, I believe that during the appropriations process, \nCongress will try to remedy this problem. As you know, historically, \nthe President tends to request lower funding levels for these accounts, \nand Congress usually pluses them up through the appropriations process, \noften quite significantly. For example, in 2004, 2005, and 2006, \nCongress provided considerably more for the Clean Water SRF Program \nthan the President requested, +492 million, +291 million, and +$157 \nmillion, respectively. As Congress works to finalize the fiscal year \n2007 budget resolution, I will continue to work with you on these \nissues.\n  Additionally, in my role as a member of the Appropriations Committee, \nI will certainly be cognizant of the funding needs for SRF Programs.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nvote scheduled for 5:30 today the Senate resume consideration of the \nbudget resolution for debate only this evening; provided further that \nwhen the Senate resumes debate on the resolution on Tuesday, the Senate \nbegin consideration of the following amendments in the order listed \nbelow under the listed times for debate: Conrad amendment, the Conrad-\nFeingold amendment on pay-go for an hour, equally divided; the Talent \namendment on defense for an hour, equally divided; the Kennedy \namendment on education for an hour, equally divided; the Chafee \namendment on IDEA special education, an hour equally divided; the Byrd \namendment on veterans, equally divided; the Akaka veterans amendment, \nequally divided.\n  I further ask consent the votes occur in relationship to the \namendments beginning at approximately 3 p.m. on Tuesday, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order prior to the votes in relationship to \nthe amendments. I ask consent that the vote time consumed under this \nagreement count equally against the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for working this \nout. It is a good start to this bill. It gives us an opportunity to get \nout of the box with a series of amendments, get them voted on and \nhopefully reduce the vote-arama at the end of the bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for working this out, \nas well. I thank our colleagues for their willingness to cooperate and \nto say to other colleagues that this sets a good example. I hope very \nmuch other colleagues and their staff are listening and that they \nunderstand if we continue on this course, we could have a much better \nbudget debate and not wind up in that vote-arama, voting four times an \nhour with very little discussion or debate intervening. I hope very \nmuch colleagues are listening and that they will continue to cooperate.\n  I am especially grateful to the six colleagues who have already \nagreed in this order to these time limits, at these times.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I take it the parliamentary situation is \nsuch that it is in order for me to now be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, at the very outset, let me say I have closely followed \nSenator Conrad's remarks on the budget. It is something I have done \neach year he has\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\nserved as the ranking member on the Budget Committee. As always, I \nfound his presentation to be both clear and insightful. For anyone who \ncares deeply about fiscal responsibility, as he does, the picture he \nhas painted of America's fiscal condition is deeply troubling. I \nexpress my own deep appreciation to Senator Conrad, as I think people \nall across the country should do, for seeking to focus attention on \nthis important problem.\n  Day by day, we have different issues which grab the headlines and the \npublic's attention, but, meanwhile, this deteriorating situation of \nAmerica moving further and further down into a fiscal box goes on. The \nimplications of that are very far reaching.\n  Senator Conrad has sought to call our attention to that, to focus our \nattention upon it, and to make us come to grips with this challenge. I \ncommend him for what I think has been a very important public service.\n  As we set out to consider the budget for fiscal year 2007, I think it \nis necessary for all of us to recognize the budget resolution is, in a \nvery basic sense, the most important document we will deal with in this \nCongress.\n  The budget contains within it literally hundreds and hundreds of \ndecisions that are critical to our national life. Each time it comes \nbefore us, it puts to us the questions: What are our values? What are \nour priorities? What are we trying to accomplish as a society?\n  It is within the budget that we set our priorities. We make these \njudgments: how much of our resources to commit, how much to raise \nthrough the taxing system, how large a deficit to run. All of these are \nvery basic questions, and the priorities set among these programs \ndetermine the direction of our national life.\n  Now, I think in order to judge the current budget and to develop some \ninformed and responsible answers, we need to place that budget in the \nfiscal and economic context in which the Nation now finds itself.\n  You do not need a very long memory to recall that a few short years \nago, under President Clinton, as he was moving through his second term, \nafter we, the President and the majority in Congress, had made some \nvery hard choices on taxes and spending, restraining spending and \nraising some taxes, primarily on upper-income people--we were able to \nturn around the Nation's fiscal status.\n  In 1998, the Federal Government reported its first surplus in the \nbudget since the 1960s. When President Bush took office, we were in our \nthird straight year of a surplus in the Federal budget, and we were \nprojecting surpluses over the next 10 years of $5.6 trillion--five and \na half trillion dollars in surpluses projected over a 10-year period.\n  Obviously, this was a pretty healthy position to be in. It would \nhave, of course, allowed the Nation to pay down the large national debt \nthat had been accumulated as we moved through the 1980s and into the \n1990s. But in what I predict history will write as a gross \nirresponsibility, President Bush, in effect, squandered the projected \nsurpluses by instituting irresponsible and reckless tax cuts--tax cuts \nwhose overwhelming beneficiaries were those at the very top of the \nincome and wealth scale. These were not broad-based tax cuts. These \nwere tax cuts whose benefits, upon analysis, were seen to be focused \nvery much on the top few percent of the income scale.\n  When the President submitted his first budget proposal, he asserted:\n\n       We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  ``We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget deficits, \neven if the economy softens.''\n  The following year, with a budget already in deficit, the President \nadvocated for yet another tax cut--yet another--promising that ``our \nbudget will run a deficit that will be small and short term.'' In fact, \nthe President's budget that year, 2002, stated the deficits would be so \nshort term that today--as he was looking ahead--the Government would be \nback in surplus.\n  Now, let's look at what has happened. Exactly the opposite of what \nthe President predicted has happened. Under the irresponsible fiscal \npolicy that this President has pursued, we have run deficits each and \nevery year since 2001.\n  In 2002, the deficit was $158 billion. President Bush inherited a \nsurplus in 2001 of $128 billion. The three previous years had had \nsurpluses as well, and then there was a $158 billion deficit in 2002. \nThe deficit rose to $378 billion in 2003, rose again in 2004 to $413 \nbillion, fell slightly in 2005 to $319 billion, and is now projected to \ngo back up again in 2006 to $371 billion. Far from being small and \nshort term, these deficits are at record levels.\n  This chart shows the deterioration in the Nation's fiscal position \nover the last 35 years. As we see, the budget went into the red more \nand more and more. In fact, in 1992, we had the previous record deficit \nof $289 billion. Then there were the years I referred to when we came \nout of deficit and ran a surplus. Now we have dived back into deficit, \nthanks primarily to the excessive tax cut and other factors, including \nthe slowing of the economy and the involvement in Iraq. We ran a record \ndeficit in 2004 of $413 billion. What an extraordinary deterioration in \nfiscal position to go from here to there.\n  The deficits would be even larger if we were not using the Social \nSecurity trust fund each year to mask the cost of the President's \npolicies. When we do a unified budget, we include in it any surplus or \ndeficit in the Social Security trust fund, and the Social Security \ntrust fund has been running a positive balance. That offsets the \npicture of the deficits, but it is not a totally accurate picture.\n  The President has submitted a budget this year that would cause our \nNation's fiscal health to continue to deteriorate. Regrettably, the \nPresident's budget does not even tell the whole story. It fails to \naccount for very significant and substantial obligations overseas and \nfor significant and substantial obligations at home. I want to give two \nexamples of that. There are others. We could develop a longer list. But \nfor purposes of illustration in terms of dealing with a budget that is \nnot fully transparent and fully accountable, I will give two examples.\n  From the very start of the war in Iraq, the administration has not \nreflected its true cost in the budget and in the budget submissions. In \nretrospect, one is given pause by the fact that the very day the \nbombing started on Baghdad in March of 2003, we were debating the \nbudget resolution on the floor of the Senate--3 years ago.\n  Of course, since the war had just started at that time, the budget \nresolution before us did not contain funding for that war. Instead, the \nPresident came along and submitted a request for an emergency \nsupplemental appropriation to cover the initial war cost. That is not \nout of the ordinary. The budget had been submitted. The war had not \nbeen started. The money was not included for the war. I noted at the \ntime that the money requested in the emergency supplemental \nappropriations was clearly only a downpayment and that much more would \nbe needed to cover the full cost of the war and of the reconstruction. \nI am frank to say to my colleagues, I fully expected that the President \nwould include those costs in his next budget submission. In other \nwords, I expected that, having now become involved, the costs of that \ninvolvement would be reflected in subsequent budget submissions, and \nyet the President's budgets in fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006 \ndid not include a single cent for the ongoing cost of operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Instead, the President continued to ask for \nfunding for Iraq and Afghanistan outside of the regular budget process.\n  This year the President has included a placeholder of $50 billion in \nhis budget. Even for the administration, after 2 years of not \nrecognizing these costs, it finally hit home that they had to do \nsomething. So they put, as it were, a placeholder of $50 billion in the \nbudget that was submitted, when everyone knows that significantly more \nthan that figure will be needed. This is not responsible budgeting. The \nPresident is refusing to own up to the true cost of his policies.\n  Let me turn to a domestic issue which is not fully reflected in the \nbudget but, again, as we know, is going to happen. That is the cost of \nfixing the alternative minimum tax. This tax was put in place as part \nof our Tax Code in order to require that very wealthy people, who are \nusing various exemptions and deductions in the Tax Code to avoid paying \nany taxes at all, would\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n\npay at least a certain amount of tax. It was an effort to assure some \nequity and fairness in the workings of the tax system. What has \nhappened is that the threshold levels of the alternative minimum tax \nhave not been adjusted for inflation. As a consequence, this tax is \nbeginning to affect middle-class Americans to whom it was never \nintended to apply. We have adjusted it in previous years. It is clear \nit will need to be adjusted again at a significant cost. But those \ncosts are not reflected in the budget the President has submitted to \nus.\n  When these two items are taken into account, plus the deficits the \nPresident is projecting on the basis of his revenue and spending \nprograms, we are now projecting a 10-year deficit of $3.5 trillion. \nThink about that. When the President came into office we were \nprojecting a surplus over 10 years of $5.6 trillion. Now we are \nprojecting a $3.5 trillion deficit. This is a deterioration in fiscal \nposition of over $9 trillion. Because of these annual budget deficits, \nwhich we are running and are projected to continue to run, the debt of \nthe country is projected to explode. It is now projected to rise to \n$11.8 trillion, almost $12 trillion, in gross Federal debt by the year \n2011.\n  Look at this incredible runup in debt that has happened since 2001. \nWe have moved up in an escalating way. We are at $8.6 trillion in 2006. \nWe are projected to go to almost $12 trillion by 2011. Net interest \npayments on this debt are expected to consume more than $1 trillion \nover the next 5 years. These are just the interest payments on the \ndebt. Each dollar that we pay in interest is one less dollar that we \ncan invest in key areas that will help to keep our economy competitive \nin the future. We face a global competition. Other nations are \ninvesting in workforce training, physical infrastructure, \ntransportation networks, research and development. If we fail to rise \nto that competitive challenge, we are going to fall behind, not move \nahead.\n  These debt figures, some say, are just numbers. It is hard to get \nyour imagination around $12 trillion in debt. But these numbers all \nreflect real obligations. These will have to be paid off by the next \ngeneration and the generation after them through higher taxes and a \nreduced standard of living. As the New York Times put it in an \neditorial entitled ``The Pain That is Yet to Come'':\n\n       America cannot escape the consequences of its debt \n     indefinitely. The effects may be sudden or gradual, but \n     either way they mean a weaker economy than would otherwise be \n     the case.\n\n  This debt has another troubling aspect to it as well. We are \nfinancing this deficit by mortgaging our financial future to foreign \nlenders. The United States, in roughly a quarter of a century, has gone \nfrom being the world's largest creditor nation to being the world's \nlargest debtor nation. In my view, there is a basic contradiction \nbetween being the world's largest debtor nation and asserting a role as \nthe world's leading nation.\n  Our international deficit, called our current account deficit, was \nnearly $800 billion last year, over 7 percent of our Nation's gross \ndomestic product. In effect, we rely on over $2 billion of foreign \ninflow into the country each and every day. Warren Buffett was recently \nquoted as saying:\n\n       Right now the rest of the world owns 3 trillion more of us \n     than we own of them. In my view it will create political \n     turmoil at some point. Pretty soon I think there will be a \n     big adjustment.\n\n  This large adjustment could come in the form of higher interest rates \nhere at home, a sudden crash in the value of the dollar or a sharp drop \nin our stock and bond markets. We don't know exactly what will happen \nbecause we are not in control of our own economy. Much of that control \nis in the hands of others overseas.\n  As Blanche DuBois said in Tennessee Williams' play, ``A Streetcar \nNamed Desire'':\n\n       We have become utterly dependent on the kindness of \n     strangers.\n\n  ``Utterly dependent on the kindness of strangers.'' Obviously, this \nsituation should raise serious concerns about our ability to conduct \nour foreign policy in the future if we are constrained and limited by \nthe need to keep our creditors willing to lend us money.\n  Regrettably, in the budget plan submitted this year, the President \noffers no solution to bringing this national debt under control. In \nfact, the President is calling for the permanent extension of his tax \ncuts for the wealthy at a cost of trillions of dollars.\n  I didn't agree with the President's tax plan in the days in which we \nhad a budget surplus. I felt then it was too large, too heavily \nweighted toward the wealthy. Some argued--and I thought it had some \nlogic to it--for a short-term targeted tax cut aimed primarily to \nmiddle- and working-class Americans and, at the same time, using the \nsurplus to pay down our debt. In other words, to do a combination of \nthose things.\n  What I opposed and did not understand was the very excessive tax cuts \nthe President put forward then and his continued support today for tax \ncuts in times of war and enormous budget deficits.\n  We keep moving along year to year in this way, and we make these \nbudget decisions, and then we go on to other business, but all the time \nthese policies are working to drive us deeper into debt. As I said, \nmuch of this debt is held by foreign lenders, and that amount is \ngrowing all the time.\n  At the end of fiscal year 2001, 31 percent of the outstanding Federal \nGovernment debt was held by foreign lenders. Over the succeeding 4 \nyears, borrowing from abroad accounted for more than 80 percent of the \nincrease in our Government debt. So we have seen the debt rise and the \nportion of the debt held by foreign lenders, in percentage terms, rise \nat a much more rapid rate.\n  If foreign lenders continue to buy 80 percent of new Federal debt, \nthe Federal Government will owe more than half of the debt to foreign \nlenders by 2011. That is equivalent to almost 25 percent of our \nexpected gross domestic product. Think of the leverage we are placing \nin the hands of foreign lenders. And a shift has also occurred from \nprivate to Government lenders with respect to where those funds are \ncoming from.\n  Regrettably, the President's budget also cuts substantially a number \nof programs designed to help working and middle-income people in this \ncountry. For example, Federal education funding has been cut by the \nlargest amount in the 26-year history of the Department of Education. \nThese cuts come at a time when tuition and fee increases have placed \ncollege education out of reach for many students. Since 2000, tuition \nand fees have increased almost 60 percent for public 4-year colleges \nand 32 percent for private 4-year colleges.\n  The budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development is, \nonce again, marked by cuts in programs that provide housing services \nand a healthy home environment for millions of American households. The \nPresident has proposed a 20-percent cut in community development block \ngrants, a 25-percent cut in elderly housing, a 50-percent cut in \nhousing for the disabled, and despite everyone's recognition of the \nessential services provided by our police and firefighters--everyone \nwaxes eloquently about our first responders--the budget proposes to cut \nfunding for community police by close to $400 million and to cut the \nfire programs by more than half.\n\n  Let me try to put this in a little bit of context in terms of the \nchoices being made with respect to priorities.\n  In fiscal year 2007, the benefit of the President's tax cuts for \nmillionaires, those with incomes over $1 million, will total $41.3 \nbillion. That is the benefit for millionaires resulting from those tax \ncuts.\n  I mentioned cuts in education, housing, police, and fire. We could \nfund all of those programs that I listed--in other words, bring them \nback up to the current levels--for less than 10 percent of the benefits \nflowing from that tax cut for millionaires--less than 10 percent. I am \nnot supportive of the bulk of that tax cut. I think it was giving much \nto those who already had more when we had other pressing needs facing \nus. But just 10 percent of it would bring education, housing, fire, and \npolice back up to current base levels.\n  What does it say about our priorities as a nation that we are placing \nthese tax cuts for people at the very top ahead of investments in these \nprograms?\n  What is said, of course, is: We can't do the programs because we have \na deficit. The public needs to ask: Why do we have this deficit? And \nthe reason we\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\nhave it is because of the tax cuts. So in terms of setting priorities, \nthe tax cuts were given a higher priority than investments in education \nor in housing or in stronger police and fire, and I could go through \nthe rest of the budget reflecting the same decisions and the same \nchoice in terms of priorities.\n  I could develop that list at some length, but let me conclude with \none last point. I think the American people have a strong sense of \nfairness and equity. There have been a number of events during the \ncourse of this administration which have underscored the necessity to \ncome together as a nation with this sense of fairness and equity--the \nattacks of 9/11, the war in Afghanistan and then in Iraq, the \ndevastation of Hurricane Katrina, most prominent among them. But to \nmove ahead, we must share the burden, and, unfortunately, the \nPresident's budget continues to favor the very wealthy. They are not \ncarrying the burden. In fact, they are being relieved of some of the \nburden through the tax cuts while leaving the majority of Americans to \ncarry the burden.\n  So as we move forward with this budget process, we need to ask \nourselves: What are our priorities as a nation? In my judgment, the \nPresident's budget does not reflect the values of the American people. \nIt is neither fair nor responsible. While some changes were made in the \nBudget Committee, I still think it basically reflects the policies \nsubmitted to us by the President which I think are not fair, not \nresponsible, and I urge my colleagues to reject the budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator Feingold is here on the floor and would \nlike to be recognized for up to 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object, I have a short statement to \nmake, and then I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Wisconsin \nor have the ranking member yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. FRIST. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I am obviously \ndisturbed--I know what the Senator from Wisconsin will be presenting \nshortly. I expect him to offer a resolution to censure the President of \nthe United States--he made those intentions clear yesterday, and I \nexpect him to do that shortly--a censure of the President for defending \nthe United States of America and protecting our homeland security.\n  As I implied in some statements I made publicly yesterday, I do \nbelieve this is a political stunt, a political stunt that is addressed \nat attacking the President of the United States of America when we are \nat war, when the President is leading us with a program that is lawful, \nthat is constitutional, and that is vital to the safety and security of \nthe American people. It is being offered at a time--with really an \nattack on what the President is doing--at the same time we have \nterrorists right now intending to attack Western civilization and, \nindeed, the people of our homeland.\n  With that being my feeling and the intention being so apparent to me, \nI do want to make it clear that if that is the case, and if this \nresolution is offered tonight, we will be ready to vote on that censure \nresolution tonight.\n  That being the case, then I will offer a unanimous consent request at \nthis juncture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately after the \n5:30 vote this evening, the Senate proceed to a vote on the resolution \nof censure to be submitted by the Senator from Wisconsin, without \nfurther intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I understand this has not been discussed \nwith the minority leader, this proposal for a vote, and I would \ntherefore object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The unanimous consent \nrequest is not agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would respectfully request of the leader that he \nshould have a discussion with the minority leader before seeking to set \nthe agenda.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I then ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately following the budget vote scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration and an immediate vote on the \nresolution of censure that will be submitted by the Senator from \nWisconsin without any further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I object for the same reason. I think \nthe majority leader should have a responsible discussion with the \nminority leader before setting the agenda of the Senate. It should be \nan elemental courtesy in the conduct of the Senate's business.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I heard the objection. I just wanted to \ndiscuss our willingness on what is an important issue. We are talking \nabout the censure of the President of the United States, and we are \nready to vote on that this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, does the Senator from Maryland yield me \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 25 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand, Mr. President, this is off the \nresolution; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin asked to speak as \nin morning business. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think an agreement was reached that it would be off \nthe resolution and count toward the time on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that stipulation?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is our understanding that 25 minutes \nwould count on the underlying bill.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, is there a unanimous consent \nrequest pending?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Only that the 25 minutes that Senator Feingold is going \nto use will come off the resolution.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I understand I have been recognized for 25 minutes as \nin morning business; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection has been heard to the unanimous \nconsent request of the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thought that was the second unanimous \nconsent. I simply asked originally for 25 minutes in morning business, \nand I believe that was approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Wisconsin to speak as in morning business for 25 minutes?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, we are perfectly willing to have the Senator speak but have the \n25 minutes count to the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what we need here in the Senate is more \ndebate, not less debate. I certainly have no problem with the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin speaking for as long as he wishes, and if the managers \nof the bill wish to yield time off the resolution to him, it is fine \nwith me. I do want to say this, however: For the majority leader--and \nhe has the right, I don't dispute that at all--to come to the floor \nwithout notice to his counterpart and offer a unanimous consent request \nis something that I never tried to do. I always tried to give him the \nbenefit of my telling him what I plan to do, and I think that is the \nright thing to do. I am sure\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nthere was nothing willful in what he did; I am sure it was just an \noversight.\n  To try to limit debate on this most important matter that Senator \nFeingold is going to put before the Senate is not appropriate. I have \nno problem with arranging a time to finish debate on the Feingold \nproposal, but it seems to me what is happening in the Senate is there \nis no time to debate much. And we are under a statute, and that is why \nwe are here today with the budget resolution, with 50 hours on this.\n  But if we look at what we have facing us in the future, in the \nimmediate future, the Secretary of the Treasury has asked us to \nincrease the national debt from $8.2 trillion to $9 trillion. Now, if \nthere were ever an opportunity for the American people to hear the \ndifferences between the two parties, I think it would be on that \ndebate. Or, even if that weren't the case, something where we are being \nasked to increase the national debt by $800 billion, shouldn't there be \na debate on that?\n  To show our willingness to cooperate on something this important, I \nagreed with the distinguished majority leader that we would have 5 \nhours of debate on the national debt and three amendments that we would \noffer. We would have a half hour on each of ours, an hour and a half \ntime is all we wanted. When we are going to be asked to increase the \nnational debt by approximately $800 billion, I think it is fair that we \ncould have a few hours to talk about that.\n  But it appears at this stage that is not going to happen. It appears \nthere will be the 50 hours on this matter that is now before the Senate \nwhich will be completed sometime Thursday, and there will be a mad rush \nto get out of here for the week break that we have. Of course, offering \namendments after the matter is brought to the attention of the Senate, \nI mean we can't do that because we may shut down the Government. And \nthat is why the majority has waited so long, even though Secretary Snow \nadvised us in December that there was going to be a problem with \nthe national debt ceiling.\n\n  So I have no problem with the Senator from Wisconsin being yielded \ntime off the resolution by the distinguished ranking member of our \nBanking Committee who is now managing this bill for Senator Conrad, but \nI want the record to be spread with the fact that this is an issue that \ndeserves more debate, not less debate. I don't care if the time is used \noff the budget resolution.\n  So I would ask the distinguished Presiding Officer to read, or \nrecall, at least, the unanimous consent request that was made by the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request of the majority \nleader?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. It was my understanding the request was that the \nSenator from----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin would be recognized \nfor 25 minutes as in morning business.\n  Mr. REID. But the time would be used off the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I yield \nfirst to the majority leader to comment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a lot is happening very quickly now. In a \nvery few minutes, we are going to get to the Senator from Wisconsin who \nhas appropriately requested 25 minutes, and the unanimous consent \nrequest will be that the time would come off the bill and it will be as \nin morning business.\n  Just to clarify, he has said his intentions representing the other \nside of the aisle to offer a resolution to censure the President of the \nUnited States for a program that I have said and will restate is a \nlawful program, is a program that is constitutional, and is a program \nthat is vital to the safety and security of the American people. My \nresponse to that unanimous consent request was if that is the case and \nif that is the position of the Democratic Party, that we are ready to \nvote at 5:30 or after our 5:30 vote today. That unanimous consent \nrequest was objected to by the other side of the aisle.\n  Then the second unanimous consent request that I propounded was that \nwe would vote after a series of stacked votes tomorrow on the \nresolution to censure. There was an objection from the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  When we are talking about censure of the President of the United \nStates, at a time of war when this President is out defending the \nAmerican people with a very good, lawful, constitutional program, it is \nserious business. And if it is an issue that the other side of the \naisle wants to debate or debate through the night, I guess we are \nwilling to do that as well. But the censure of the President is \nimportant, and if they want to make an issue of it, we are willing to \ndo just that.\n  I have no objection to the unanimous consent request that has been \nmade.\n  Mr. REID. There is no unanimous consent request now pending; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. You reserved the right to object, but \nthere is only one pending before the Senate at this time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask that the unanimous consent request \ngiving Senator Feingold 25 minutes be expanded to give this Senator 25 \nminutes, with the time running off the bill.\n  Mr. REID. So now we have Senator Feingold speaking for 25 minutes, \nthat would be yielded off the budget resolution, and Senator Specter \nspeaking for 25 minutes, that being yielded off the resolution; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending request. Is there \nobjection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, and there is no other unanimous consent \nrequest before the Senate at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                         Resolution of Censure\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, when the President of the United States \nbreaks the law, he must be held accountable. That is why today I am \nsubmitting a resolution to censure President George W. Bush.\n  The President authorized an illegal program to spy on American \ncitizens on American soil, and then misled Congress and the public----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Wisconsin yield for \na question? May we have a copy of your resolution?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will be introducing it at the conclusion of my \nremarks. I will be happy to supply the Senator with a copy of the \nresolution, but I do intend to introduce it at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Senator from Wisconsin would let \nthis Senator have a copy of it now.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I just said I would be happy to give the \nSenator a copy of the resolution right now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time be started over \nagain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, when the President of the United States breaks the \nlaw, he must be held accountable. That is why today I am submitting a \nresolution to censure President George W. Bush. The President \nauthorized an illegal program to spy on American citizens on American \nsoil, and then misled the Congress and the public about the existence \nand the legality of that program. It is up to this body to reaffirm the \nrule of law by condemning the President's action.\n  All of us in this body took an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States and bear true allegiance to the same. \nFulfilling that oath requires us to speak clearly and forcefully when \nthe President violates the law. This resolution allows us to send a \nclear message that the President's conduct was wrong.\n  And we must do that. The President's actions demand a formal judgment \nfrom Congress.\n  At moments like this in our history, we are reminded why the Founders \nbalanced the powers of the different branches of Government so \ncarefully in the Constitution. At the very heart of our system of \ngovernment lies the recognition that some leaders will do wrong and \nthat others in the Government will then bear the responsibility to do \nright.\n  This President has done wrong. This body can do right by condemning \nhis\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\nconduct and showing the people of this Nation that his actions will not \nbe allowed to stand unchallenged.\n  To date, Members of Congress have responded in very different ways to \nthe President's conduct. Some are responding by defending his conduct, \nceding him the power he claims, and even seeking to grant him expanded \nstatutory authorization powers to make his conduct legal. While we know \nhe is breaking the law, we do not know details of what the President \nhas authorized or whether there is any need to change the law to allow \nit. Yet some want to give him carte blanche to continue his illegal \nconduct. To approve the President's actions now without demanding a \nfull inquiry into this program, a detailed explanation for why the \nPresident authorized it, and accountability for his illegal actions \nwould be irresponsible. It would be to abandon the duty of the \nlegislative branch under our constitutional system of separation of \npowers while the President recklessly grabs for power and ignores the \nrule of law.\n\n  Others in Congress have taken important steps to check the President. \nSenator Specter has held hearings on the wiretapping program in the \nJudiciary Committee. He has even suggested that Congress may need to \nuse the power of the purse to get some answers out of the \nadministration. Senator Byrd has proposed that Congress establish an \nindependent commission to investigate this program.\n  As we move forward, Congress will need to consider a range of \npossible actions, including investigations, independent commissions, \nlegislation, or even impeachment. But at a minimum Congress should \ncensure a President who has so plainly broken the law.\n  Mr. President, our Founders anticipated that these kinds of abuses \nwould occur. Federalist Paper No. 51 speaks of the Constitution's \nsystem of checks and balances. It says:\n\n       It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices \n     should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But \n     what is government itself, but the greatest of all \n     reflections of human nature? If men were angels, no \n     government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, \n     neither external nor internal controls on government would be \n     necessary. In framing a government which is to be \n     administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in \n     this: You must first enable the government to control the \n     governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.\n\n  We are faced with an executive branch that places itself above the \nlaw. The Founders understood that the branches must check each other to \ncontrol abuses of Government power. The President's actions are such an \nabuse. His actions must be checked and he should be censured.\n  This President exploited the climate of anxiety after September 11, \n2001, both to push for overly intrusive powers in the PATRIOT Act and \nto take us into a war in Iraq that has been a tragic diversion from the \ncritical fight against al-Qaida and its affiliates. In both of these \ninstances, however, Congress gave its approval to the President's \naction, however mistaken the approval may have been.\n  Here is the difference, Mr. President: This was not the case with the \nillegal domestic wiretapping program authorized by the President \nshortly after September 11. The President violated the law, ignored the \nConstitution and the other two branches of Government, and disregarded \nthe rights and freedoms upon which our country was founded. No one \nquestions--no one questions--whether the Government should wiretap \nsuspected terrorists. Of course we should and we can under current law. \nIf there were a demonstrated need to change the law, of course, \nCongress should consider that step. But instead, the President is \nrefusing to follow the law while offering the flimsiest of arguments to \njustify his misconduct. He must be held accountable for his actions.\n  The facts are pretty straightforward. Congress passed the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA, nearly 30 years ago to \nensure that as we wiretap suspected terrorists and spies, we also \nprotect innocent Americans from unjustified Government intrusion. FISA \nmakes it a crime to wiretap Americans on U.S. soil without the \nrequisite warrants, and the President has ordered warrantless wiretaps \nof Americans on U.S. soil. So it is pretty simple. The President has \nbroken that law and that alone is unacceptable.\n  But the President did much more than that. Not only did the President \nbreak the law, he also actively misled Congress and the American people \nabout his actions and then, when the program was made public, about the \nlegality of the NSA program. He has fundamentally violated the trust of \nthe American people. The President's own words show just how seriously \nhe has violated that trust.\n  We now know that the NSA wiretapping program began not long after \nSeptember 11. Before the existence of this program was revealed, the \nPresident went out of his way, he went out of his way in several \nspeeches to assure the public that the Government was getting court \norders to wiretap Americans in the United States, something he now \nadmits was not the case.\n  On April 20, 2004, for example, the President told an audience in \nBuffalo, ``Any time you hear the United States government talking about \nwiretaps it requires a court order. Nothing has changed, by the way.''\n  In fact, a lot had changed. But the President wasn't upfront with the \nAmerican people. Just months later, on July 14, 2004, in my own State \nof Wisconsin, the President said, ``Any action that takes place by law \nenforcement requires a court order. In other words, the government \ncan't move on wiretaps or roving wiretaps without getting a court \norder.''\n  And then, Mr. President, last summer on June 9, 2005, the President \nspoke in Columbus, OH, and again insisted that his administration was \nabiding by the laws governing wiretaps. ``Law enforcement officers need \na federal judge's permission to wiretap a foreign terrorist's phone, a \nfederal judge's permission to search his property. Officers must meet \nstrict standards to use any of these tools. And these standards are \nfully consistent with the Constitution of the U.S.''\n  Now, Mr. President, in all of these cases the President knew that he \nwasn't telling the complete story. But engaged in tough political \nbattle during the Presidential campaign and later over the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization, he wanted to convince the public that a system of \nchecks and balances was in place to protect innocent people from \nGovernment snooping. He knew when he gave those reassurances that he \nhad authorized the NSA to bypass the very system of checks and balances \nthat he was using as a shield against criticisms of the PATRIOT Act and \nhis administration's performance.\n  This conduct is unacceptable. The President has a duty to play it \nstraight with the American people. But for political purposes, he just \nignored that duty.\n  After a New York Times story exposed the NSA program in December of \nlast year, the White House launched an intensive effort to mislead the \nAmerican people yet again. No one would come to testify before Congress \nuntil February, but the President's surrogates held press conferences \nand made speeches to try to convince the public that he had acted \nlawfully.\n\n  Most troubling of all, the President himself participated in this \ndisinformation campaign. In the State of the Union Address he implied \nthat the program was necessary because otherwise, the Government would \nbe unable to wiretap terrorists at all.\n  Now, Mr. President, that is simply untrue. In fact, nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. You don't need a warrant to wiretap terrorists \noverseas, period. It is clear. You do need a warrant to wiretap \nAmericans on American soil, and Congress passed FISA specifically to \nlay out the rule for these types of domestic wiretaps.\n  FISA created a secret court made up of judges who develop national \nsecurity expertise to issue warrants for surveillance of suspected \nterrorists and spies. These are the judges from whom the Bush \nadministration has obtained thousands of warrants since 9/11. They are \nthe judges who review applications for business records orders and \nwiretapping authority under the PATRIOT Act. The administration has \nalmost never had a warrant request rejected by these judges. It has \nused the FISA Court thousands of times, but at the same time it asserts \nthat FISA is an ``old law'' or ``out of date'' in this age of \nterrorism, that it can't be complied with. Clearly the administration \ncan\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nand does comply with it except when it doesn't. Then it just \narbitrarily decides to go around these judges and around the law.\n  The administration has said that it ignored FISA because it takes too \nlong to get a warrant under that law. But we know that in an emergency \nwhere the Attorney General believes that surveillance must begin before \na court order can be obtained, FISA permits the wiretap to be executed \nimmediately as long as the Government goes to the court within 72 \nhours. Now, the Attorney General has complained that the emergency \nprovision does not give him enough flexibility; he has complained that \ngetting a FISA application together, of getting the necessary \napprovals, takes too long. What the Attorney General is actually \ntalking about, the problems he has cited, are bureaucratic barriers \nthat the executive branch put in place. They are not mandated by \nCongress. They are not mandated under FISA. These were put into place \nby the Justice Department, the executive branch itself, and they could \nbe removed if they wanted.\n  FISA permits the Attorney General to authorize unlimited warrantless \nelectronic surveillance in the United States--unlimited--during the 15 \ndays following a declaration of war to allow time to consider any \namendments to FISA required by a wartime emergency. This is the time \nperiod that Congress specified very clearly. Yet the President thinks \nhe is above the law. He thinks that he can just ignore that 15-day \nperiod and do this indefinitely. The President has argued that Congress \ngave him authority to wiretap Americans on U.S. soil without a warrant \nwhen it passed the authorization for use of military force after \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  That is ridiculous. Members of Congress did not pass this resolution \nto give the President blanket authority to order warrantless wiretaps. \nWe all know that. Anyone in this body who tells you otherwise either \nwas not there at the time or isn't telling the truth. We authorized the \nPresident to use military force in Afghanistan, a necessary and \njustified response to September 11. We did not authorize him to wiretap \nAmerican citizens on American soil without going through the process \nthat was set up nearly three decades ago precisely to facilitate the \ndomestic surveillance of terrorists with the approval of a judge. That \nis why--and I have heard them do this very clearly--many Senators, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, have come forward to question this bogus \ntheory.\n  This particular claim is further undermined by congressional approval \nof the PATRIOT Act just a few weeks after we passed the authorization \nfor use of military force. The PATRIOT Act made it easier for law \nenforcement to conduct surveillance on suspected terrorists and spies \nwhile maintaining FISA's baseline requirement of judicial approval of \nwiretaps of Americans in the U.S. It is also ridiculous to think that \nCongress would have negotiated and enacted all the changes to FISA in \nthe PATRIOT Act if it thought it had just authorized the President to \nignore FISA in the AUMF.\n  In addition, in the intelligence authorization bill passed in \nDecember 2001, we extended the emergency authority in FISA at the \nadministration's request from 24 hours to 72 hours. Why did we do that? \nWhy do that if the President has some kind of inherent power or power \nunder the authorization of force resolution to just ignore FISA? That \nmakes no sense at all.\n  The President has also said that his inherent executive power gives \nhim the power to approve this program, but here the President of the \nUnited States is acting in direct violation of a criminal statute. That \nmeans his power is, as Justice Jackson said in the steel seizure cases \na half century ago, ``at its lowest ebb.'' A letter from a group of law \nprofessors and former executive branch officials points out, ``Every \ntime the Supreme Court has confronted a statute limiting the Commander-\nin-Chief's authority, it has upheld the statute.'' The Senate reports \nissued when FISA was enacted confirm the understanding that FISA \noverrode any preexisting inherent authority of the President. As a 1978 \nSenate Judiciary Committee report stated, FISA ``recognizes no inherent \npower of the President in this area.'' And ``Congress has declared that \nthis statute, not any claimed Presidential power, controls.'' So \ncontrary to what the President told the country in this year's State of \nthe Union, no court has ever approved warrantless surveillance in \nviolation of FISA.\n  The President's claims of inherent executive authority and his \nassertions that the courts have approved this type of activity are \nbaseless. But it is one thing to make a legal argument that has no real \nsupport in the law; it is much worse to do what the President has done, \nwhich is to make misleading statements about what prior Presidents have \ndone and what courts have approved to try to somehow make the public \nbelieve that his legal arguments are much stronger than they really \nare.\n  For example, in the State of the Union, the President argued that \nFederal courts have approved the use of Presidential authority that he \nwas invoking. I asked the Attorney General about this when he came \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, and he could point me to no court--not \nthe Supreme Court or any other court--that has considered whether, \nafter FISA was enacted, the President nonetheless had the authority to \nbypass it and authorize warrantless wiretaps. Not one court. The \nadministration's effort to find support for what it has done in \nsnippets of other court decisions would be laughable if this issue were \nnot so serious.\n  In the same speech, the President referred to other Presidents in \nAmerican history who cited executive authority to order warrantless \nsurveillance. But of course, those past Presidents--like Wilson and \nRoosevelt--were acting long before the Supreme Court decided in 1967 \nthat our communications are protected by the fourth amendment, and \nbefore Congress decided in 1978 that the executive branch could no \nlonger unilaterally decide which Americans to wiretap. I asked the \nAttorney General about this issue when he testified before the \nJudiciary Committee. And neither he nor anyone in the administration \nhas been able to come up with a single prior example of wiretapping \ninside the United States since 1978 that was conducted outside FISA's \nauthorization.\n  So again the President's arguments in the State of the Union were \nbaseless, and it is unacceptable that the President of the United \nStates would so obviously mislead the Congress and American public.\n  The President also has argued that periodic internal executive branch \nreview provides an adequate check on the program. He has even \ncharacterized this periodic review as a safeguard for civil liberties. \nBut we don't know what this check involves. And we do know that \nCongress explicitly rejected this idea of unilateral executive \ndecisionmaking in this area when it passed FISA.\n  Finally, the President has tried to claim that informing a handful of \ncongressional leaders, the so-called Gang of 8, somehow excuses \nbreaking the law. Of course, several of these members said they weren't \ngiven the full story. And all of them were prohibited from discussing \nwhat they were told. So the fact that they were informed under these \nextraordinary circumstances does not constitute congressional \noversight, and it most certainly does not constitute congressional \napproval of the program.\n  In fact, it doesn't even comply with the National Security Act, which \nrequires the entire memberships of the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittee to be ``fully and currently informed of the intelligence \nactivities of the United States.'' Nor does the latest agreement to \nallow a seven-member subcommittee to review the program comply with the \nlaw. Granting a minority of the committee access to information is \ninadequate and still does not comply with the law requiring that the \nfull committee be kept fully informed.\n  In addition, we now know that some of the Gang of 8 expressed concern \nabout the program. The administration ignored their protests. One of \nthe eight members of Congress who has been briefed about the program, \nCongresswoman Jane Harman, ranking member of the House Intelligence \nCommittee, has said she sees no reason why the administration cannot \naccomplish its goals within the law as currently written.\n  None of the President's arguments explains or excuses his conduct, or \nthe\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\nNSA's domestic spying program. Not one. It is hard to believe that the \nPresident has the audacity to claim that they do.\n  And perhaps that is what is most troubling here. Even more troubling \nthan the arguments the President has made is what he relies on to make \nthem convincing--the credibility of the Office of the President itself. \nHe essentially argues that the American people should trust him simply \nbecause of the office he holds.\n  But Presidents don't serve our country by just asking for trust, they \nmust earn that trust, and they must tell the truth.\n  This President hides behind flawed legal arguments, and even behind \nthe office he holds, but he cannot hide from what he has created: \nnothing short of a constitutional crisis. The President has violated \nthe law, and Congress must respond. Congress must investigate and \ndemand answers. Congress should also determine whether current law is \ninadequate and address that deficiency if it is demonstrated. But \nbefore doing so, Congress should ensure that there is accountability \nfor authorizing illegal conduct.\n  A formal censure by Congress is an appropriate and responsible first \nstep to assure the public that when the President thinks he can violate \nthe law without consequences, Congress has the will to hold him \naccountable. If Congress does not reaffirm the rule of law, we will \ncreate another failure of leadership, and deal another blow to the \npublic's trust.\n  The President's wrongdoing demands a response. And not just a \nresponse that prevents wrongdoing in the future but a response that \npasses judgment on what has happened. We in the Congress bear the \nresponsibility to check a President who has violated the law, who \ncontinues to violate the law, and who has not been held accountable for \nhis actions.\n  We are hearing people say that somehow this censure resolution sends \na terrible signal to the terrorists who want to do us harm. I tell you \nwhat is a terrible signal, that we are so meek in response to this \nterrorist threat that we are going to let the President of the United \nStates break the law of this Nation and not do anything about it. Now \nthat is a victory for the terrorists if we won't even stand up for our \nsystem of Government because everybody has to be afraid to mention that \nthis President broke the law.\n  Passing a resolution to censure the President is a way to hold this \nPresident accountable. A resolution of censure is a time-honored means \nfor the Congress to express the most serious disapproval possible, \nshort of impeachment, of the Executive's conduct. It is different than \npassing a law to make clear that certain conduct is impermissible or to \ncut off funding for certain activities.\n  He should be censured.\n  The Founders anticipated abuses of Executive power by creating a \nbalance of powers in the Constitution. Supporting and defending the \nConstitution, as we have taken an oath to do, requires us to preserve \nthat balance and to have the will to act. We must meet a serious \ntransgression by the President with a serious response. We must work, \nas the Founders urged in Federalist 51, to control the abuses of \nGovernment.\n  The Constitution looks to the Congress to right the balance of power. \nThe American people look to us to take action, to speak out with one \nclear voice, against wrongdoing by the President of the United States.\n  To conclude, in our system of government, no one, not even the \nPresident, is above the law.\n  I send the resolution to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized for 25 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from Wisconsin to \nstay on the floor?\n  Mr. President, I think this subject matter is worthy of debate, but \nnotwithstanding my experience of debating, I don't think I can debate \nwithout someone to debate with. I tried to attract the attention of the \nSenator from Wisconsin before he departed the Chamber. I think I got in \nright as he was on the way out the door.\n  But let me ask his staffers if they would invite the Senator from \nWisconsin to return to the floor. Having listened to his long \nsoliloquy, I would appreciate the benefit of his presence so we can \ndeal with these issues in some substantive detail.\n  At the outset, I say that I agree with a number of things which the \nSenator from Wisconsin said and items which are in his resolution.\n  When he comes to the resolve clause and speaks about censure and \ncondemnation of President Bush, I think he is vastly excessive. Call it \nover the top, call it beyond the pale, the facts recited in this \nresolution simply do not support that kind of conclusion.\n  Going right to the heart of the issue, the Senator from Wisconsin \nsays in the fourth ``whereas'' clause on page 2 that the President does \nnot have the inherent constitutional authority to act in distinction \nand difference from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  That is what you call a naked assertion unsupported by any statement \nof law, unsupported by any rationale.\n  The Judiciary Committee, of which the Senator from Wisconsin is a \nmember, has held two hearings on the authority of the President to \nconduct electronic surveillance. And there has been a great deal of \ntestimony from reputable sources saying that the President does have \ninherent authority under article II of the Constitution.\n  If that legal conclusion is correct, then constitutional authority \ntrumps a statute.\n  The Congress cannot legislate in derogation of the President's \nconstitutional authority.\n  We cannot enact laws which take away authority prescribed to the \nPresident under the Constitution, just as we cannot legislate to take \naway authority that the Supreme Court has under the Constitution. Just \nas we cannot delegate our authority which the Constitution gives to the \nCongress, we cannot delegate our authority in derogation of our \nconstitutional responsibilities and authorities.\n  Those are very basic principles of law.\n  I am sorry that the Senator from Wisconsin saw fit to condemn and \nexcoriate the President for 25 minutes but doesn't have time to come to \nthis floor to answer a simple question. And that simple question is, \nDoesn't the Constitution trump statute?\n  A subordinate part of that question is if the President has inherent \nauthority under article II, isn't it incorrect to say that the \nPresident has violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which \nwould be superseded or trumped by the President's constitutional \nauthority?\n  We are going to have some more hearings before the Judiciary \nCommittee. If I don't have an opportunity to confront the Senator from \nWisconsin this afternoon, I will find another opportunity to do so.\n  But I think the Record should be plain that in the hearing last month \na number of academicians testified that the President does have \ninherent authority under article II to supersede the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. And the Attorney General testified at \nlength that the President has inherent authority under article II, \nwhich would lead to the conclusion that if Attorney General Gonzalez is \ncorrect, as a matter of law, then there is no violation of law by the \nPresident. Admittedly he is taking the President's side, but that is \nthe job of Attorney General as a generalization. He also represents the \nAmerican people, and he has to discharge his oath consistent with his \nduties to the American people.\n  There are a number of points, as I have said earlier, where I think \nthe Senator from Wisconsin makes a valid argument.\n  I think on his third ``whereas'' clause on page 1 of the resolution, \nwhere he says that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the \nexclusive statutory authority for electronic surveillance, he is \ncorrect. That doesn't rule out the Constitution superseding the \nstatute, however.\n  When the Senator from Wisconsin says on his third ``whereas'' clause \non page 2 that the resolution authorizing the use of military force did \nnot change the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, I think the \nSenator from Wisconsin is correct. But the correctness\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nof those two propositions do not supersede the inherent article II \nauthority of the President. And that is the issue which has yet to be \nresolved.\n  The majority leader spoke very briefly this afternoon before the \nSenator from Wisconsin presented his resolution. Senator Frist said \nthat we are dealing with a lawful program. Senator Frist is in the \nposition to make an evaluation on that subject because Senator Frist is \none of the so-called Gang of 8, which has had access to the program. He \nhas been briefed on the program.\n  I believe the Senator from Wisconsin is correct in the body of his \nresolution when he raises an issue that the statute requires all \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee to be briefed. That is the \napplicable law. It may be that there are good reasons for not briefing \nall the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and all members of \nthe House Intelligence Committee. Perhaps because members of the \nCongress leak. But if good reasons do exist, then the President ought \nto come to the Congress and ask it to change the law. I agree with him \nthat the Congress leaks. I have to say, in the same breath, that the \nWhite House also leaks. That is not a very good record for either the \nCongress or the White House.\n  That is why I have prepared legislation which would submit the NSA \nelectronic surveillance program to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court. That court now passes on applications for search-\nand-seizure warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \nThey apply the standard, which is different than the standard for a \nsearch-and-seizure warrant in a criminal case. They have expertise in \nthe field. They also have an exemplary record for keeping secrets.\n  That is the way to deal with this issue. There must be a \ndetermination on constitutionality. It is not possible, in my legal \njudgment, to make a determination as to whether the President's \ninherent article II powers authorize this kind of a program, without \nknowing what the program is. I don't know what the program is. The \nAttorney General would not tell us what it is when he testified last \nmonth. I understood his reasons for not telling us, even though we \ncould have gone into a closed session. But the Judiciary Committee was \nlooking at the legalities of the program. We were in a position to \nrender a judgment on whether the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nwas the exclusive remedy, and whether the resolution to authorize the \nuse of force changed the FISA act. But it is a matter for the \nIntelligence Committee to get into the details of the program which, \nuntil last week, the administration has been unwilling to do.\n  I have great respect for my colleague Senator DeWine, and have talked \nto him extensively about this issue. He and I serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee together. I like his idea about getting the administration to \nsubmit the program to, at least, the eight members of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee who, according to the press accounts, were \nbriefed about it last week. I do not think it is adequate, as other \nparts of the DeWine legislation propose, to allow the surveillance to \ngo on for 45 days, and at the end of that 45-day period to then give \nthe administration the option of going to the FISA Court or to the \nSenate subcommittee. The subcommittee does not grant authorization for \nwarrants. The subcommittee function is oversight. It is not a \nreplacement for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n  A way is at hand to deal with this issue. The majority leader, \nSenator Frist, said we have a lawful program. That opinion has weight, \nsubstantial weight in my mind, but it is not conclusive. Senator Frist \nis not a judicial official. It may be that a more detailed analysis is \nnecessary than has been presented to the Gang of 8. I don't know, \nbecause I don't know what they heard or what they learned.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, but I will at the conclusion of my presentation.\n  We ought to focus for a few moments on the importance of judicial \nreview on the fourth amendment issues of search and seizure.\n  With the limited time I have left, I have only a few references, but \nI begin with a famous case in 1761 where a Boston lawyer defended \nBoston merchants who had been searched by customs house officials. \nJames Otis gave a stirring 5-hour speech, charging the customs officers \n``break locks, bars, and everything in their way; and whether they \nbreak through malice or revenge, no man, no court may inquire.'' Very \nweighty words in 1761. Maybe if James Otis had seen this program, we \ncould take his word on its constitutionality.\n  John Adams described this case as the spark of the American \nRevolution. He stated:\n\n       Then and there was the child Independence born.\n\n  Then in the Declaration of Independence in 1776, it is stated that \none of the key reasons for the American Revolution involved the King \nallowing his officers to violate the rights of Americans and then \nprotecting them ``by a mock trial, from punishment,'' for the injuries \nthat they had committed.\n  And then we have the fourth amendment. We need to go back to the \nbasics of this amendment, which prohibit unreasonable searches and \nseizures. That is the question in this matter.\n  In 1916, in the Weeks case, the Supreme Court of the United States \nruled that evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment could \nnot be used in a criminal trial. In 1961, in Mapp v. Ohio, the Supreme \nCourt of the United States ruled that the due process clause of the \n14th amendment prohibited States and State criminal prosecutions from \nusing evidence obtained as a result of an unreasonable search and \nseizure.\n  We have had the Supreme Court of the United States intervene, even in \ntime of war, to limit the President's authority. During the Korean \nwar, President Truman cited ``the existence of a national emergency'' \nto ``be able to repel any and all threats against our national \nsecurity.''\n\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in Youngstown Sheet v. \nSawyer, said the President did not have that authority. They said it \nexceeded his authority.\n  In the Hamdi case, 2004, 18 or 20 months ago, the Supreme Court \nstated:\n\n       We have long since made it clear that a state of war is not \n     a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights \n     of the Nation's citizens.\n\n  And the Court went on to say:\n\n       . . . whatever power the United States Constitution \n     envisions for the Executive in its exchanges with other \n     nations or with enemy organizations in times of conflict, it \n     most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches when \n     individual liberties were at stake.\n\n  We have a way through this maze. The way through the maze is for the \nCongress to give jurisdiction to the FISA Court. That is our job, to \ngive jurisdiction to Federal courts. We have dealt with the issue as to \nwhether there is a case or a controversy. There is one. Without going \ninto details here, it is not an advisory opinion.\n  But this resolution calling for the condemnation and the censure of \nthe President is out of line and out of bounds. In listening to the \nSenator from Wisconsin, I did not hear, at any time, him say the \nPresident has acted in bad faith. The President may be wrong, but he \nhas not acted in bad faith. I think all would concede that the \nPresident was diligently doing the best job he can. And I agree with \nhim. I think the President's best job is satisfactory, and that no one \nhas ever accused him of bad faith.\n  In the absence of any showing of bad faith, who has standing to \ncensure and condemn the President and then not stay in the Chamber to \ndebate the issue? I do hope this matter is referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee, and not to the Rules Committee. We have already had two \nhearings on matters relating to this subject. I especially want to see \nthis resolution referred to the Judiciary Committee because if it is in \nthe Judiciary Committee, I can debate Senator Feingold. If it goes to \nthe Rules Committee, I cannot debate Senator Feingold. Now, isn't that \na powerful jurisdictional argument for the Judiciary Committee?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, through the Chair, I commend the Senator from \nPennsylvania. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has \nshown\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\nextraordinary leadership in convening two separate hearings on this \nquestion of the wiretap issue, the first with Attorney General Gonzales \nwhich I attended and thought to be one of the more challenging and \ninteresting committee hearings I have ever attended--it went on for a \nwhole day--the second, sadly, was in conflict with another meeting, a \nRules Committee on ethics reform and I did not attend it, but he \ninvited constitutional scholars to come and speak to the same issue. \nMany on Capitol Hill may shy away from controversial issues, \nparticularly if they involve an administration of the same party. I \ncommend the Senator from Pennsylvania for being an exception to the \nrule on this issue and for speaking up and standing up.\n  I wish to ask a question. After listening to Attorney General \nGonzales' testimony before our committee, it appears that the thrust of \nthe constitutional argument justifying the wiretap goes back to a vote \nthat we share, a vote we both cast in favor of authorizing the use of \nmilitary force on September 18, 2001. I ask the Senator from \nPennsylvania if he believed that in casting his vote for that \nresolution authorizing force to pursue those responsible for September \n11 that he was giving the President authority to wiretap American \ncitizens without obtaining a court order required by the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The next question I wish to ask the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and I appreciate his forthright response, the majority \nleader, Senator Frist, came to the Senate a few moments ago and said he \nbelieved the wiretap program of President Bush was constitutional and \nlegal. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania agree with that conclusion?\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I neither agree nor disagree. I do not know. As I said \nmore extensively in the body of my comments, I do not have any basis \nfor knowing, because I do not know what the program does. I think it \nmay be that the program could be structured as going after only al-\nQaida conversations. And I would like to see some proof of that. Quite \nfrankly, I would like to see some proof that they have reasonable \ngrounds to think one party or the other is al-Qaida. That is in the \nbody of Senator Feingold's whereas clauses.\n  It may be that they have been able to take a limited amount of \ninformation, destroying the rest, and that it has produced very \nimportant results with a minimal incursion. I do not know the answers \nto those questions. But I certainly think you ought not castigate the \nPresident as a criminal until you do know the answers to those \nquestions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do. And I want to thank you for being here in Senator \nFeingold's stead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, I am standing here----\n  Mr. SPECTER. You are a little tougher to debate than he, but I thank \nyou for coming.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Pennsylvania one \nlast question.\n  When you referred to the suggestions of our colleague, Senator \nDeWine, on the Judiciary Committee, and other proposals to change the \nlaw that might accommodate what we are now seeing in this wiretap \nprogram, is that not an admission that what is going on now is \nviolative of law or at least outside the bounds of the laws as written \nwhich authorize wiretaps?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, I do not think it is an admission because, like \nconsent, it has to be informed. And I do not think he is informed. I do \nnot think anybody is informed. I do not think Senator DeWine intends to \nmake an admission. I think Senator DeWine, in good faith--very good \nfaith--is searching for a way out. And I think he made a significant \nstep forward when his actions resulted in seven members of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee being briefed. The reason I say ``I think'' is \nbecause I do not know what they were told. But I think that is a \nsignificant step.\n  Senator DeWine's proposal of legislation to allow the program to go \non for 45 days is no concession. It is going on anyway. His idea to \nbypass the FISA Court and allow the Administration instead to go to the \nIntelligence Subcommittee, I think, is not appropriate because the \nIntelligence Subcommittee does not have the function of a court.\n  So I think he is doing the best he can. But right now we are flying \nblind on a great deal of this, and we have to accept very limited \nrepresentations by the Gang of 8, and now the new Gang of 7. And no \nmatter what, it does not amount to judicial review.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an important announcement to make.\n  Will my friend yield to me?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nexpired. The Senator does not control time.\n  The Senate minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                         Death of Maggie Inouye\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at 4 o'clock this afternoon, an hour and 15 \nminutes ago, Maggie Inouye died. I had the good fortune of being able \nto visit with the Inouyes Friday night.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate, I extend condolences to Senator \nInouye and his son Daniel Jr. This wonderful couple had been married 57 \nyears. They were married in 1949. Senator Inouye proposed to Maggie on \ntheir second date. Daniel Jr. goes by the name of Ken. He has been at \nhis mother's side, as has Senator Inouye, for many days.\n  She was a wonderful woman. She formerly taught at the University of \nHawaii. She was such a steadfast supporter of her husband in everything \nthat he stood for.\n  Anyone who has spent any time at all with them knows how much they \ncared for each other, loved each other. Her death brings sadness to the \nentire Chamber because it is a loss for the entire Senate family.\n  Senator Inouye is a very nonpublic person. He holds everything very \nclose to his vest, and he was not someone who came to luncheons or \nmeetings with us and talked about his wife's illness. That was a \npersonal thing for him.\n  But she needed the support of her family. She had a very difficult \ntime. She will now have peace, and to a certain extent so will Senator \nInouye because he has suffered with her.\n  Senator Inouye is such a wonderful human being. In my visit with him \nand Ken on Friday,--his wife was there but in another room--we talked \nabout a lot of things. We laughed a little bit. We cried a little bit. \nHere is a man who is a true American patriot. We throw those words \naround a lot, but we are not throwing this word around. Dan Inouye is a \ntrue American patriot who served with distinction and valor during \nWorld War II, and that is an understatement. He was awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor for courage above and beyond the call of \nduty.\n  Senator Inouye will be away from the Senate for a while. He is going \nto take Maggie back to Hawaii. But I wish my words were adequate to \nconvey my personal affection for Senator Inouye and that of the entire \nSenate, but they are not. So the Record will have to stand on that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid for bringing this sad \nnews to the attention of the Senate family. There are many things that \ndivide us, but there are things that unite us. We are united when \nMembers of our Senate go through personal tragedy. Senator Reid knows \nbetter than anyone on our side of the aisle the personal sacrifices \nSenator Inouye has made over the last months and years as his wife has \ngone through this serious illness.\n  It is clear, from what he has given of his life, he took his vow very \nseriously to stand by her in sickness and in health. It is a tribute to \nthis man, his devotion, and to their love which sustained them for 57 \nyears.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for bringing this to our attention. \nWe all join in expressing our sadness at her loss and will stand by \nSenator Inouye and his family to ask them to try to remember, at this \ntime of loss, those good memories of times together. We hope those \nmemories will sustain their family.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it has already been announced that \nSenator Inouye's wife Maggie has passed away.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement made by my great friend \nabout his wife be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement by U.S. Senator Daniel K. Inouye on the Passing of His Wife, \n                             Maggie Inouye\n\n       Washington.--I am saddened to report that my dear and \n     lovely wife of nearly 57 years, Margaret Awamura Inouye, \n     passed away today at 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time at Walter \n     Reed Army Medical Center. She was 81, and her death was due \n     to complications resulting from colon cancer.\n       ``Maggie was recently hospitalized because an examination \n     found small blood clots and some fluid in her right lung, and \n     she had been undergoing a process of draining out the fluid \n     and dissolving the blood clots.\n       ``This most recent medical challenge came after Maggie \n     underwent surgery in November 2004 to remove a cancerous \n     growth from her large intestine. Her surgeons had pronounced \n     that operation a success.\n       ``As she has done throughout her life, Maggie handled her \n     difficult situation without complaint, and with dignity and \n     grace. Although her chemotherapy treatments would leave her \n     drained, she always had a smile for you and she retained her \n     optimistic outlook.\n       ``It was a most special blessing to have had Maggie in my \n     life for 58 years. She was my inspiration, and all that I \n     have accomplished could not have been done without her at my \n     side. We were a team. She always supported me, listened to my \n     ideas, and many times offered invaluable suggestions that \n     always proved she was capable of achieving as much on her own \n     right, given her intelligence and education. Instead, she \n     chose to join me on a special journey that took us to \n     Washington, and gave us the privilege of serving the people \n     of Hawaii.\n       ``On the campaign trail, she was invaluable. During my \n     first race for the U.S. Senate in 1962, legislative work in \n     the U.S. House permitted me to make only short trips back to \n     Hawaii. I was facing a formidable opponent, the son of the \n     wealthiest man in Hawaii. Both Time and Newsweek magazines \n     didn't think much of my chances of winning. But Maggie put \n     some magic into my campaign. She returned to Hawaii that \n     June, and spent seven days a week visiting every island and \n     making . hundreds of speeches on my behalf. When I finally \n     did get back in October, my campaign manager met me at the \n     airport and said, `We're glad to have you, but Maggie's been \n     doing great.' I won, and I won big. In my heart, I know that \n     without her I could not have won that pivotal race that put \n     me on the path to become a United States Senator.\n       ``I first met Maggie in the autumn of 1947, a week before \n     Thanksgiving, when we were introduced to each other. She was \n     already known as a poised, graceful, articulate, and gentle \n     lady from a good family who was very much ahead of her time. \n     Back then, few women went to college. But Maggie not only \n     earned her undergraduate degree in education from the \n     University of Hawaii, she went on to earn a master's in \n     education from Columbia University in New York City. With her \n     graduate degree, she returned home to Hawaii, and began her \n     career as a speech instructor at UH.\n       ``I, too, had returned home--from the war and from my \n     injury rehabilitation regimen that I had undergone on the \n     mainland. I was enrolled at the University of Hawaii, and was \n     still trying to chart my future. However, I was certain of \n     one thing almost immediately after I met Maggie: I was going \n     to marry her. I don't think the possibility of marriage had \n     ever occurred to me before that moment, but afterward it \n     never left my mind. Everything I had and wanted to have \n     suddenly became absolutely meaningless unless Margaret \n     Awamura would share it with me.\n       ``On our second date on December 6, 1947, I asked her to \n     marry me. Without hesitation, she said, `Yes.' Her answer \n     made me feel like I was in heaven. She was willing to have as \n     her lifelong partner a man who at that time was nothing \n     more than a combat veteran on the GI Bill whose future was \n     still uncertain. Her numerous other suitors had much more \n     to offer, as they were already professional men.\n       ``During the 18 months before our marriage on June 12, \n     1949, we were an unusual couple on the UH campus. She was an \n     instructor; I was an underclassman. Of course, it was \n     Maggie's salary as a teacher at the university that saw us \n     through those first years of our marriage.\n       ``In the early 1950s when I was studying at George \n     Washington to earn my law degree, Maggie was the breadwinner, \n     while I contributed what I received from my GI education \n     benefits and my pension as a retired Army Captain. While I \n     was in class, she was working at the Department of the Navy's \n     Bureau of Yards and Docks, first as a file clerk and soon she \n     was promoted to administrative secretary.\n       When we returned to Hawaii, I went to work for the City and \n     County of Honolulu as a Deputy Public Prosecutor, while \n     Maggie returned to the University of Hawaii as an instructor \n     in education. It was a position she would hold for six years.\n       ``In 1964, five years after she left UH, Maggie gave birth \n     to our son, Daniel K. Inouye, Jr. That was a most special \n     day, perhaps because we became parents at a rather late stage \n     in our lives.\n       ``Kenny and I--as well as the people of Hawaii--were \n     blessed to have had Maggie in our lives. She was a most \n     special woman, and she will always be in my heart.''\n       In addition to Senator Inouye and Daniel K. Inouye, Jr., \n     Mrs. Inouye is survived by five sisters, Edith Satow of \n     Carmarillo, California; Grace Murakami of Honolulu; Betty \n     Higashino of Orinda, California; Shirley Nozoe of Honolulu; \n     and Patricia Tyler of Sudbury, Massachusetts. Funeral \n     arrangements are pending.\n\n\n                  MARGARET AWAMURA INOUYE AT A GLANCE\n\n     Personal\n       Born on June 23, 1924, in Wailuku, Maui.\n       Married Daniel K.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair for this time.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of my wife Millie and my entire family, I \nrise to express our sincere sympathies, our deepest condolences, and \nour warmest aloha to my dear friend and my colleague, Senator Daniel K. \nInouye, for the loss of his lovely wife Maggie, who passed away this \nafternoon.\n  Over the past year, whenever I spoke to Senator Inouye, I would ask \nhim about Maggie, and his reply to me was: She is a trooper. She is \ndoing the best she can. And that really sums up it so well about \nMaggie.\n  Maggie was definitely a trooper. She was a wonderful, wonderful lady \nwho served our country as a Senate spouse for the past 40-plus years. \nMaggie was a classy woman who was well respected everywhere she went. \nShe had a heart of gold and will definitely be missed by the people of \nHawaii and the families here in Washington, DC. My thoughts and prayers \ngo to Senator Inouye, to his son Kenny and his wife, their extended \nfamily, and all of the Inouye staff here and in Hawaii. We stand \nwaiting to do whatever we can to help in this difficult time. We will \nmiss Maggie. May Maggie's soul rest in peace.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise standing near our friend and \ncolleague from Hawaii as we think about his colleague in the Senate and \nthe fond relationship they enjoyed. If a poll was conducted in this \nChamber or among the Members of this Chamber, if you said: Who is the \nmost respected, beloved, wise Member of the U.S. Senate, you would come \nup with only one name, not that there aren't others of friendship and \ngood will and intellect and all of those things, but Danny Inouye is \nthe exceptional person. His demeanor was quiet and thoughtful and \nalways helpful, and he served his country in a way that few have in our \nhistory, having lost his arm in Italy and fighting on to lead his \ntroops.\n  I give you that background that all of us are so familiar with: a \nMedal of Honor winner, a distinction so rarely given, only to true \nheroes, to true leaders. But Danny is a multidimensional person. He \nalways had room for friendship, warmth, and affection, and his \ncompanion of 57 years, someone he always talked of with respect and \nadmiration, and the linkage was true and fast. He relied on some people \nfor advice and counsel and always cleared the air with his own \nthinking. But Maggie, his wife, was someone who was such an integral \npart of Danny Inouye's living that this moment is especially tragic. He \nlooked after her\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nwith love and affection and talked to those with whom he had contact \nabout her, never really resigning in tone or in words the fact that she \nwas not doing well.\n  So when a Member, a friend like Danny Inouye loses his dearest \nfriend, his beloved wife of 57 years, their relationship, we all feel \nsadness, we all feel touched by his loss and want him and his family, \nhis son and all of the Inouye family, to know that we all care, we all \nshare Danny's grief. We all are ready to stand with him as friends and \ntry to bolster his view about the future by reminding him how valuable \nhe is to all of us and that we understand his pain, his anguish, and \nthe sadness he feels. I think I speak for many in this Chamber: We want \nto express our feeling and devotion to Danny Inouye, friend, soldier, \nleader, our sadness, our grief at this terrible loss he has sustained.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I join with the other Senators in \nexpressing my sadness tonight as to Senator Dan Inouye's loss. I think \nall of us see Senator Inouye as the gold standard of caring. He has \nalways cared about his constituents. He has always cared about his \ncolleagues. But, most of all, he has cared about his family, and he \nthrew himself with every ounce of his energy and strength into caring \nfor his spouse who has passed today.\n  It is important for the Senate to note that in addition to his \ncaring, what Senator Inouye is best known for is his quiet sense of \ndignity. This is a place where it can get loud and clamorous at times, \nand what Dan Inouye has always done is to try to always take the quiet \npath, to lower the decibel level, to try to get Senators to keep a \nperspective. That is why he always put his family first.\n  There are many fine people in the Senate, but when we think about our \ncolleague Dan Inouye tonight and all he did for his spouse in those \nlast few months, there is no better person, no better colleague, no \nbetter friend all of us could have than Dan Inouye. I just wanted to, \nalong with my colleagues, let him know he is in my thoughts and prayers \ntonight.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing our \nsincere sympathy to Senator Inouye on his loss. He is certainly one of \nthe finest, most respected Members of this body. He is one of the great \nSenators who have served here and has been a true American patriot, \nserving his country with such fidelity and putting his very life on the \nline, and nearly losing it, and winning the Nation's highest honors in \nthe course of serving his country.\n  So I would just say from this Senator, and on behalf of so many of \nus, we are sorry to hear this news, and our prayers and support are \nwith Senator Inouye at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about the \nbudget that is before the Senate. But before I do, I want to add my \nvoice to my colleagues who have come out here to express their \ncondolences to our colleague, Senator Inouye, on the loss of his wife \nand long-time partner. Certainly, as the Senator from New Jersey said, \nSenator Inouye is the most respected Senator in this body, and he \nserved his country well. Mrs. Inouye, too, has served her country by \nallowing Senator Inouye to be such a historic figure in this country \nand such a great leader and by all the time that was demanded by that. \nShe has served her State, she has served her country, and we are all \ngrateful. And to Senator Inouye, he and his family are in my thoughts \nand prayers as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to offer my deep condolences \nto our good friend and colleague, Dan Inouye, and his family and to the \npeople of Hawaii on the death of our friend Dan's wife, Maggie, who \ndied this afternoon.\n  The death of anyone is cause for grief. The death of a spouse is an \neven greater cause for grief. The death of the spouse of a good friend, \nDan Inouye, is even more grievous to all of us.\n  Knowing Dan Inouye as we do, we are all hard pressed to find anyone \nwho is as wonderful and caring, a statesman, generous, as wise a man as \nDan Inouye. A Japanese American under the most difficult of \ncircumstances, he served his country--and served it with tremendous \nvalor.\n  His wife Maggie I did not know well. You can tell a lot about a \nperson in the first 5 or 10 minutes of just meeting someone. Maggie was \njust like Danny--very wise, very deep, very caring, very generous, \nclassy like Dan.\n  I say to Dan, to his family, and to the people of Hawaii, you all \nhave our hearts, you have our prayers, our thoughts are with you as \nwell as with Maggie in this most difficult time. Know that we are \nthinking of you, we are praying for you and for your family.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I come to the floor on a matter of great \nsadness for the Senate family. Today, at 4 p.m. at the Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center, after a long and difficult struggle with colon cancer, \nMargaret Awamura Inouye, the lovely and gracious wife of Senator Dan \nInouye, passed on.\n  On behalf of my colleagues, I offer my deepest condolences to the \nesteemed senior Senator from Hawaii. Our hearts go out to the Inouye \nfamily as they mourn their loss.\n  Dan and Maggie were married for 58 blessed years. They met in Hawaii \nin 1947 right before Thanksgiving. He had just returned from the war \nand rehabilitation. She was back from Columbia University with a \nmaster's degree in education.\n  For Dan, it was love at first sight. And he didn't hesitate to make \nhis intentions known. He popped the question on their second date, and \nto his great, good fortune, she said yes.\n  For nearly 6 decades, she stood by him, encouraged him, and believed \nin his success. Dan credits Maggie for putting him on the path to \nbecoming a U.S. Senator. Without her, he said he couldn't have made it.\n  The Senator tells us that Maggie handled her illness with dignity and \ngrace--that she always had a smile and kept a bright outlook.\n  Mrs. Inouye is survived by her husband, Dan, their son, Dan Jr., and \nher five sisters, Edith, Grace, Betty, Shirley and Patricia.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Inouye family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might ask to be recognized for 3 \nminutes on the budget resolution now pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude the matter raised between \nSenator Specter and myself about the resolution brought to the floor by \nSenator Feingold.\n  I heard yesterday that Senator Feingold was going to offer this \nresolution. I did not realize he would do it today. I have spoken to \nSenator Feingold, and I believe it is his intention not to bring this \nto a vote today, as some have suggested, but, rather, to use this as a \ncatalyst to bring about the kinds of hearings and investigations that \nthis Congress owes to the people of the United States on the wiretap \nprogram.\n  I have saluted Senator Specter earlier for his leadership on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I am sorry the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, given a chance to do the same thing, failed to exercise its \noversight responsibility on this same program.\n  I think it is important, regardless of party affiliation, that we ask \nthe critical constitutional and legal questions about this wiretap \nprogram. This resolution by Senator Feingold will be a catalyst for \nthat type of investigation, those types of hearings. Whether that \nresults in a censure of the President or any further action against the \nPresident remains to be seen. But it certainly says to the American \npeople, we are not going to ignore what could be one of the most \nserious constitutional issues to come before this Government in \ndecades.\n  I have read this resolution Senator Feingold has offered. I agree \nwith Senator Specter, I do not think when we voted to go to war against \nthe Taliban we said to the President that he could ignore the law, that \nhe could go about wiretapping Americans without court approval. That is \nbasic to America.\n  The President has said over and over publicly, if we are going to \nwiretap people, we will get court approval. Well, it turns out that is \nnot the case\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\nat all. I do not know how often because I have not been briefed on the \ndetails, but apparently on many occasions this Government has \nwiretapped the conversations of American citizens without court \napproval. The President and the administration have not followed the \nclear letter of the law. That is an important and serious \nconstitutional question.\n  I think the resolution being brought to us by Senator Feingold will \ncause us to look anew at this critically important issue. Whether it \nresults in any action by Congress, as I said, remains to be seen. But I \nthink it is important that we accept this challenge by the Senator from \nWisconsin and that hearings be held in the Judiciary Committee, if that \nis where the resolution is eventually referred, and possibly even in \nthe Intelligence Committee.\n  I hope the Intelligence Committee will start to move on this on a \nbipartisan basis. It has historically been a bipartisan committee. But \nrecently in the last few weeks there have been many important votes \ntaken on partisan rollcalls, votes relative to the authority and \nexercise of that authority by this committee in investigating this Bush \nadministration.\n  It would be good if the committee could return to its bipartisan \nways. I think it would give the institution of the Senate a vote of \nconfidence that we can stand and investigate Presidents of either \npolitical party if there is serious and important policy questions to \nbe determined.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is the time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a previous order that at 5:30 we will \nmove to executive session and proceed to a vote on Calendar No. 520.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think back to a young Senator Inouye, \nserving in our military, putting his life at risk and nearly losing it \nfor our country. One thing he had a right to expect of his Congress \nwas, as a soldier, he would be supported in the conflict.\n  We are here today hearing of a resolution presented by Senator \nFeingold to censure the President of the United States. It is baseless. \nIt is not sound in law, and it is not sound in policy. We, by over a \nthree-quarters vote, voted to send our soldiers in harm's way. This \nSenate voted to do that. We authorized the President, in a use of force \nresolution, to identify those responsible for attacking us and to \nattack and destroy them, to use such military force as he deemed \nappropriate to attack and kill them. And our soldiers have been doing \nthat.\n  The Supreme Court recently had to deal with the situation in which an \nAmerican citizen was captured abroad, Hamdi. They caught him. It went \nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States, and the issue was \nwhether he was entitled to a trial.\n  The question was, Was he entitled to a trial? The Supreme Court held \notherwise. The Supreme Court said that he was a prisoner of war, and \nthe authorization of military force authorized the military to attack \nand kill enemies of the United States. It also authorized them to \ncapture them. That was incident to the use of military force.\n  It is quite plain that our history of military affairs supports the \nconcept that surveilling in a time of war is incident to the carrying \non of war. In the same way that we have a right to take an American \ncitizen and lock them up in jail without trial if they are identified \nto be with the enemy, we can surveil the enemy's communications.\n  The President authorized simply this: al-Qaida conversations in which \none of the parties to that conversation is outside the United States \ncould be monitored. We know it was through those kinds of \ncommunications that 9/11 occurred. We had sleeper cells here activated \nby foreign communications.\n  It is wrong to undermine this President while we have our soldiers at \nwar and at risk, to suggest that he has done something wrong and needs \nto be censured.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I express my strongest disapproval of the propriety of \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2019-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2019-S2020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF LEO MAURY GORDON TO BE A JUDGE OF THE UNITED STATES COURT \n                         OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Under the previous order, the \nhour of 5:30 p.m. having arrived, the Senate will go into executive \nsession and proceed to a vote on Calendar No. 520, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Leo Maury Gordon, of New \nJersey, to be a judge on the United States Court of International \nTrade.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this evening the Senate will consider \nanother lifetime appointment to a circuit court. The nominee is Leo \nMaury Gordon, who is nominated to serve on the U.S. Court or \nInternational Trade. Mr. Gordon is the court's longtime clerk, and he \nis very familiar with its important work. I urge all Senators, \nRepublican and Democratic, to support this nomination.\n  His confirmation will bring the total number of judicial appointments \nsince January 2001 to 232, including the confirmations of two Supreme \nCourt Justices and 43 circuit court judges. Of course, 100 judges were \nconfirmed in the 17 months that Democrats were in the Senate majority. \nIn the other 45 months, 132 judges have been confirmed. Ironically, \nunder Democratic leadership, the Senate was almost twice as productive \nas under Republican leadership.\n  It is most regrettable that this President has not fulfilled his \npromise to the American people to be a uniter. Nor has he fulfilled his \npledge to complete his work in advance of vacancies and to make \nnominations promptly. Judicial vacancies have grown to more than 50, \nand the White House has failed to send a nominee for more than half of \nthose. Some of those vacancies have been sitting empty for more than a \nyear. Over and over the White House has missed the deadline the \nPresident established for himself, and today, half of the judicial \nvacancies, 27, are without a nomination. One-third of those vacancies \nare already more than 180 days old, and one-third of the judicial \nemergency vacancies are without a nominee.\n  If the White House would eliminate its partisan political and \nideological litmus tests from the judicial nominations process and its \nemphasis on rewarding cronies and focus only on qualifications and \nconsensus, the job of selecting nominees and our job of considering \nthem for confirmation would be much easier. That is what this \nconfirmation demonstrates.\n  Recently we have seen the President withdraw a circuit nomination \nafter information became public about this nominee's rulings in a \nnumber of cases in which he appears to have had a conflict of interest.\n  At a minimum, this case reinforces a point about this White House's \npoor vetting process for important nominations. A number of nominations \nby this President have had to be withdrawn. Among the more well known \nare Bernard Kerik to head Homeland Security and Harriet Miers to the \nSupreme Court, which were withdrawn for different reasons. It was, as I \nrecall, reporting in a national magazine that doomed the Kerik \nnomination.\n  When we are considering lifetime appointments of judicial officers \nwho are entrusted with protecting the rights of Americans and when we \nare reviewing important law enforcement officials, it is important to \nbe thorough. Unfortunately, this White House seems more interested in \nrewarding cronies.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Leo Maury Gordon to be a judge of the United States Court of \nInternational Trade?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, on this difficult evening, I wish to take \njust a few minutes to talk about the budget.\n  Last Congress, Senator Snowe and I, on a bipartisan basis, saw 51 \nMembers of the Senate support our bipartisan legislation to lift the \nrestriction on Medicare so that program could bargain to hold down the \ncost of medicine. That vote, where a majority of Senators went on \nrecord in supporting the effort to hold down the cost of medicine, took \nplace before the program went into effect. It seems to me everything \nthat has happened over the last few months, since a majority of the \nSenate voted for our bipartisan amendment, supports our case for \npassing that legislation now.\n  We will be offering our bipartisan proposal, the Snowe-Wyden \namendment, later this week, and I wish to take just a few minutes to \noutline why it is so important.\n  The American Association of Retired Persons says it all in a letter \nendorsing our bipartisan Snowe-Wyden proposal. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the AARP letter endorsing the Snowe-Wyden legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: AARP supports your amendment to the \n     Senate fiscal year 2007 budget bill to provide for the \n     ability of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     participate in negotiations with pharmaceutical manufacturers \n     under the Medicare prescription drug program.\n       Prescription drug prices continue to rise much faster than \n     the rate of inflation. AARP's latest Rx Watchdog report \n     released in February 2006 found that prices for nearly 200 of \n     the brand name medications most commonly used by older \n     Americans rose 6.0 percent during the 12 month period from \n     October 2004-September 2005. At the same time, the rate of \n     general inflation was 3.3 percent. These drug price increases \n     particularly hit older Americans, who use prescription drugs \n     more than any other segment of the U.S. population.\n       Millions of older and disabled Americans now have the \n     opportunity to choose prescription drug coverage as part of \n     their 2006 Medicare benefit options. To date, millions of \n     Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in the program and as a \n     result are realizing savings on their prescription drugs. \n     However, improvements to the Medicare Modernization Act are \n     necessary to strengthen the benefit and the Medicare program. \n     We believe the first step is to keep the drug benefit \n     affordable for beneficiaries as well as taxpayers.\n       While we have seen that the current competitive structure \n     existing in the MMA has helped to bring prescription drug \n     prices down, we believe that giving the Secretary the \n     authority to participate in negotiations may also help to \n     make prescription drugs more affordable for Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues on \n     both sides of the aisle to ensure that the new Medicare Part \n     D benefit remains affordable over time. If you have any \n     further questions, please feel free to contact me, or have \n     your staff contact Anna Schwamlein of our Federal Affairs \n     staff at 202-434-3770.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              David P. Sloane,\n\n                                            Sr. Managing Director,\n                                Government Relations and Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as AARP notes--and they publish an Rx \nWatchdog report--they have noted that for the nearly 200 brand-name \nmedications most commonly used by older people, the costs of those \nmedicines have gone up twice the rate of inflation. So all Americans \nget hit by prescription drug costs. Particularly hard hit are older \npeople, and low-income older people, and people with very big \nprescription drug bills. As noted by AARP, these seniors are hit more \nthan any other segment of the U.S. population by prescription drug \ncosts.\n  At a time when the costs of this program and the costs of Government \nhave gone through the stratosphere, one would think the Government \nwould be doing everything possible to hold down costs. Yet, \nunfortunately, in the original prescription drug legislation, a bizarre \nrestriction was put in place that literally bars the Government from \nbeing a smart shopper. Everybody else in this country tries to use \ntheir clout in the marketplace to get the best possible deal, but not \nMedicare--not Medicare, which offers a benefit to more than 30 million \nolder people. They are not using the opportunity to go into the \nmarketplace and hold down the costs.\n  I compare the Government's approach to buying prescription drugs \nunder Medicare to somebody going into Costco and buying toilet paper \none roll at a time. Nobody would shop that way. No savvy shopper would \never give up, even before they walked into the store, the opportunity \nto hold down the costs. But that is what Medicare is doing, and that is \nwhat Senator Snowe and I want to change.\n  Now, we have seen over the last couple of months older people and \ntheir families absolutely up in arms, up in arms about the frustrations \nof getting this prescription drug program out and usable in a \ncommonsense kind of fashion. It is far too complicated. There are far \ntoo many alternatives. Some seniors say that even with a Ph.D. they \ncan't sort it out. But what is especially troubling is at a time when \nthe costs of the program continue to go up and up and up, the \nGovernment isn't even taking commonsense steps to hold down the cost of \nthese medicines.\n  So what Senator Snowe and I have tried to do in a bipartisan effort \nfor going on 3 years now is to make sure that when necessary the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services can negotiate for the best \npossible prices of prescription drugs for older people.\n  Now, this isn't price control. Specifically, our bipartisan amendment \nstipulates that the authority granted here\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\ncannot be used to set prices or to set a uniform formulary. Nowhere in \nthis amendment is there a call for price controls or anything that can \nbe interpreted as price controls. This is about using marketplace \nforces. This is about using the market just as millions of Americans do \nevery day to hold down the cost of medicine.\n  Senator Snowe and I believe one of the most flagrant mistakes in the \nMedicare law--and both of us voted for that legislation--was to write \ninto law that the Secretary could not have bargaining power under any \ncircumstances at all. We have seen drug prices increase, as AARP has \nnoted, far higher than the rate of inflation. The Wall Street Journal \nhas reported price spikes. The Congressional Budget Office has \nindicated there can be savings from negotiations in the area of single-\nsource drugs that do not face competition, and suffice it to say, many \nof the single-source drugs are ones that are commonly used by Medicare \npatients, such as Lipitor and Zocor and Prevacid.\n  I will wrap up, Mr. President, with only a couple of additional \npoints because I know my colleague from Washington has been very \npatient. The authority that Senator Snowe and I seek to grant to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services is the authority that Secretary \nThompson at his last press conference as head of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, said he wished he had. So the last head of \nthat agency, at a time when they were moving to implement the \nprescription drug law, said specifically he wished he had had this \nauthority.\n  The last point I would make, Mr. President, is that some have said: \nWell, seniors are seeing some savings already. If that is the case, we \nare glad to see it, but it comes about because the basic benefit covers \n75 percent of the cost of the drug after the $250 deductible. So the \nquestion for the Senate is where are you going to look in order to hold \ndown the cost of this program? Are you going to look at taxpayer \nsubsidies? Are you going to look at marketplace forces? Senator Snowe \nand I believe that at a time when the costs of Government are soaring \nand the costs of this prescription drug benefit are soaring, we ought \nto use commonsense marketplace principles to hold down the cost of \nmedicine, not continue to rely on taxpayer subsidies, and that is what \nour amendment is all about.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I do not know of a single private \nsector entity, whether it is a timber company in my home State of \nOregon, or a big auto company in the Midwest, that when they are buying \nsomething in bulk, say: What about the possibility of some discounts? \nSo why shouldn't Medicare ask that question, just to have that \nauthority so as to make marketplace forces work? Why wouldn't we want \nto assure that there is every possible tool to help seniors hold down \nthe costs of medicine?\n  We will debate this at greater length in the course of the week. As I \nnoted, Senator Snowe and I received 51 votes, a majority of the Senate, \nfor this legislation before the program went into effect. I would just \nsay to our colleagues tonight, everything that has happened in the last \nfew months suggests that there is an even better case for the \nbipartisan Snowe-Wyden amendment to hold down the costs of medicine.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2021-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2021-S2023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have risen tonight to express my deep \nconcerns about the budget that is before us. I am concerned that the \nbudget that this Senate is now considering does not pass the test of \nprotecting our homeland. It does not pass the test of promoting fiscal \nresponsibility. And it does not pass the test of fighting for our \nmiddle-class families.\n  Let me start by putting this discussion in the right context. The \nbudget decisions that we make now will either empower us or tie our \nhands when we turn to write the appropriations bills this year. That \nmeans you cannot vote for an unrealistic budget now and then act \nsurprised in the summer and fall when painful cuts are required. Just \nlook at what happened last year. The logjam that we experienced at the \nend of last year was not a surprise. It was the logical outcome of \ndecisions that were made regarding the budget.\n  Starting last March, many of us saw that there was no way we could \nmeet our obligation to our veterans, honor our commitment to America's \nworking families, enact huge cuts in entitlement programs such as \nMedicaid and Medicare, enact another round of tax cuts, and continue to \ncut our Nation's deficit. And when you added the growing cost of the \nwar and Hurricane Katrina, the legislative train wreck was entirely \npredictable. I hope we do not repeat the same mistakes this year--\nstarting with the wrong priorities and unrealistic assumptions here in \nthe budget process which will lead to constrained appropriations bills \nthat will end up hurting our American families.\n  Mr. President, a budget is more than just a bunch of numbers on a \npiece of paper. It is a statement of our values, and it reflects our \npriorities. The budget this Senate is now considering closely follows \nthe President's budget, and it is based on the wrong priorities. It is \nclear to me that we need to invest here at home to make our country \nstrong again. That means investing in education and in health care, in \ninfrastructure and housing, in safety and security, and on each of \nthose fronts the Bush priorities have been time and again misguided, \nadrift, and downright painful for millions of Americans.\n  You know, Mr. President, when I am at home in Washington State or \nhere in the Nation's Capital I hear a lot of concern from the business \ncommunity, from local governments, and from families across the United \nStates about us losing our global competitiveness. They talk to me \nabout the challenges they face in keeping and growing good jobs right \nhere at home, and they tell me that education is one of the elements \nfor our success. But last year's budget, the fiscal year 2006 budget, \nset us on the path of undermining our competitiveness by weakening \neducational programs at all levels, and I fear that this budget, the \nfiscal year 2007 budget, will do the exact same thing.\n  Last year's budget, the 2006 budget so constrained education, the \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill \nfailed once in the House and almost did not pass at all. In the end, \nthe programs faced one last hit, a 1-percent across-the-board cut that \nfurther hindered education at all levels.\n  At a time when our schools are facing the increasing requirements of \nNo Child Left Behind, our families are facing rising college tuition \ncosts, and employers are crying out for highly skilled, educated \nworkers, this is no time for our Nation to be shortchanging education.\n  Because of laws Congress has passed and President Bush has signed, \nschool districts are facing increasingly rigorous academic standards \nand working very hard to meet the new requirements for highly qualified \nteachers.\n  How has Congress responded? Well, a majority in this Congress cut \nfunding for the No Child Left Behind Act by 3 percent, or $13.1 billion \nbelow what was promised when we passed that bill. The fiscal year 2006 \nbudget from last year also led the Government to slide backwards on its \ncommitment to students with disabilities for the first time in 10 \nyears. The Federal share of educational costs dropped from 18.6 percent \nin 2005 to 18 percent in 2006. Funding for disadvantaged students \neligible for title I was inadequate. The fiscal year 2006 funding from \nlast year is $9.9 billion less than what Congress and President Bush \ncommitted to spending in that law. That bill would leave behind 3.1 \nmillion students who could be fully served by title I if the program \nwere funded at the level to which we committed.\n  The reason I feel the need to talk about last year's budget at length \nis to put this year's budget proposal in context because the budget we \nare considering, the 2007 proposal, continues that dangerous trend. The \nPresident proposed the largest cut to education in 26 years. Sadly, \nthis budget resolution makes it impossible to restore those proposed \ncuts. It would eliminate vocational and technical training efforts and \ncollege prep programs that have been so successful, such as TRIO and \nGEAR UP.\n  This year, unless we change course, $11.9 billion is going to be cut \nfrom student loans, loans that help our low-income and middle-income \nfamilies pay\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\nfor college, and 70 percent of those cuts is going to come right out of \nthe pockets of students and their families.\n  Those cuts, by the way, will not go for balancing the budget. They \nare going to go for tax cuts for those who need them the least. We are \ntrading the higher education of the Nation's families for our \nmajority's misguided fiscal policy.\n  Tuition and fees increased by 7.1 percent this year for 4-year public \nuniversities and 5.9 percent for private universities. The policies \nthat are pursued in this budget are not just wrong for our country, \nthey are going to cost our Nation dearly in the long term. Today, one-\nthird of the U.S. workforce has a postsecondary education--one-third. \nBut it is estimated that 60 percent of the new jobs in the 21st century \nare going to require a college education. Workers who have attended \ncollege on average have higher incomes and lower rates of unemployment \nthan those who don't. And those with a college education are more \nlikely to have jobs with benefits like health care and retirement and \npension plans.\n  We should be helping to break down the barriers to a college \neducation, not building them up with this budget. We will not succeed \nin preparing our students for the 21st century by cutting their \nsupport, and we will put our country at a competitive disadvantage as \nwe confront the world's challenges unless we change course.\n  On the workforce issue, the GAO has said that business and customer \nsatisfaction with our workforce system has never been better. But this \nPresident is now proposing hundreds of millions of dollars in budget \ncuts that effectively dismantle our local one-stop system of providing \ntraining and employment services for our workers.\n  I have 5,000 people in my home State of Washington who are \ndesperately seeking training right now, and there are over 50,000 jobs \nthat employers are looking to fill. We should be increasing our \ninvestment in worker training--not ensuring that all of our good-paying \njobs are going to be outsourced abroad.\n  Finally, this budget fails to adequately protect our miners and our \nother workers from health and safety dangers they face in their \nworkplace.\n  On housing, this budget resolution will mean painful cuts--housing \nfor the elderly cut 26 percent, housing for the disabled cut 50 \npercent, community development block grants cut by more than $1 \nbillion. Those are the wrong priorities. We should be providing more \nhelp for the disabled and the elderly and for community development.\n  Everywhere I travel in Washington State, I hear from families \nstruggling to find a safe and affordable place to live. Whether it is a \nyoung couple looking to buy their first home or a family searching for \nrental housing close to their job or a senior citizen who wants better \naccess to social services, it is harder than ever to find affordable \nhousing.\n  Across the country, public housing agencies and nonprofit \norganizations are working hard to help families find a place they can \ncall home. At the same time, they are contributing to community \nrevitalization efforts that will bring new jobs and opportunities. But \na lack of funding threatens the achievements that have been made and \nthe work that is yet to be done.\n  This budget resolution that is before us assumes the President's \nproposal to cut the Community Development Fund, which includes the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program, by more than $1 billion. \nThat, by the way, is on top of a $.5 billion cut the program received \nthis year.\n  Every Senator here knows how successful the Community Development \nBlock Grant Program is. You can see its impact in communities across \nthe country. Whether it is construction of new affordable housing or \nsupporting community revitalization, CDBG is bringing hope and \nopportunity to some of our country's most vulnerable.\n  The budget resolution we are looking at this week does not restore \nfunding for the Community Development Block Grant Program. That will \nmake it virtually impossible to restore cuts in housing and community \ndevelopment, including that $1 billion reduction in CDBG.\n  I refer my colleagues to the views and estimates filed on the Budget \nCommittee resolution from the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, and I want to quote directly from those \nviews:\n\n       We reiterate that unless the committee--the Appropriations \n     Committee--receives substantial relief from these \n     unachievable assumptions, the committee will be unable to \n     fund the President's request much less items of Congressional \n     interest.\n\n  I think that is wrong.\n  I am going to be offering an amendment, with the support of many of \nmy colleagues, to restore that funding.\n  I believe it is also critical that we continue to invest in our \nNation's infrastructure. Recent cuts in transportation spending are \nthreatening to weaken our airline safety. They are imposing new \ntransportation costs on American businesses, and they cost tens of \nthousands of construction jobs. Investing in our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure helps reduce congestion, improves safety, \nand supports continued economic growth.\n  On veterans, this budget does not keep America's commitment to our \nveterans because it is built on making it harder for veterans to get \nthe health care they have earned. The Bush administration wants to \nclose the doors of VA hospitals to 1.1 million veterans. It is going to \nkeep another 200,000 from accessing the VA. The Bush administration is \nimposing new fees, copayments, and blocking access, and that is just \nwrong.\n  The committee resolution will simply make it impossible to fully fund \nVA health care without additional cost sharing. The resolution assumes \nthe President's increase for VA health care, but this increase is \nmatched in part through higher premiums and copayments.\n  I offered an amendment during markup to restore full funding for VA \nhealth care without forcing our veterans to pay for the care they \nearned. Unfortunately, it failed in committee, but we are going to try \nagain on the floor.\n  One of the biggest flaws in this budget is in homeland security. I \nknow a lot of Senators recognize the inadequacies of the \nadministration's approach, with the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nwho also serves as chairman of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee, characterizing it as ``gross \nmalfeasance.''\n\n  I thank the chairman for recognizing this and for making a gesture in \nthe budget toward addressing this gaping hole. But gestures are not \nenough, and if the Senate passes the caps proposed by the \nadministration and contained in this budget, no Senator should be under \nany illusion that we will have any other choice but to once again \nunderfund our Nation's defenses.\n  In recent weeks, we have all heard about the issue of cargo and port \nsecurity. It is looming large, and we have had a vigorous debate here \nand across the country. No matter the particular outcome of this one \ntransaction, this country is not adequately prepared to confront the \nthreats we face to our security through our trading system. Sadly, this \nbudget continues that regretful trend.\n  On health care, the President wants to cut 2.2 percent from HHS. That \nis going to reduce our investment in medical research, in disease \nprevention, and in important safety net programs such as urban Indian \nhealth.\n  During the Budget Committee, I actually offered an amendment to try \nto provide some direction and flexibility to the Finance Committee to \nact on legislation aimed at addressing the problems with the Medicare \nPart D benefit, to provide them with a deficit-neutral reserve fund to \ndeal with the copayments our States are facing.\n  It is only a matter of time and our States are going to revolt, and \nour pharmacists are already paying the price. I hope we again address \nthat.\n  Let me conclude by saying this budget is neither fiscally responsible \nnor disciplined. Under the assumptions in this resolution, the deficit \nis actually going to get worse. Debt is going to continue to increase. \nThe only fiscal constraint included in this resolution is a cap on \ndiscretionary spending that will make it almost impossible to meet our \ncountry's needs or our appropriations deadline of October 1.\n  I will have more to say.\n  Let me end by saying that this budget is based on unrealistic \nspending targets and lacks any real fiscal discipline. Simply providing \nunrealistic\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\ncaps on domestic spending while assuming additional tax cuts is not \nfiscally responsible. I believe this budget is neither honest nor \nresponsible.\n  We have a lot of work to do to make our country strong again. We need \na budget that reflects our priorities and values. And we cannot forget \nthat the choices we make today will empower us--or entrap us--months \nfrom now. I hope we can work together on both sides of the aisle to \ncreate a budget that protects our homeland, ensures fiscal \nresponsibility, and stands up for our middle-class families.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2023-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BUDGET DEFICITS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Book of Proverbs says: ``The borrower \nis servant to the lender.''\n  This is a sad week for America, for we have become servants to many \nnations.\n  This week, we debate legislation to raise the Government's borrowing \nby $781 billion. That is more than three-quarters of a trillion \ndollars.\n  This will be the fourth largest debt increase in the history of our \ncountry, and it will be the fourth debt limit increase enacted in this \nadministration.\n  In 2002, the Government raised the debt ceiling by $450 billion. The \nnext year, 2003, the Government raised it by $984 billion--nearly a \ntrillion dollars. That was an alltime record. And in 2004, the \nGovernment raised the debt ceiling by another $800 billion.\n  This week, we consider legislation to raise the debt ceiling by \nanother $781 billion. When added to the three other debt ceiling \nincreases during this administration, the total increase in the debt \nceiling will be a mammoth $3 trillion. That is servitude.\n  When this administration took office, the limit on Treasury borrowing \nwas about $6 trillion. It took us as a country 212 years to accumulate \nthat much debt. Now, a mere 5 years later, this administration has \nadded another $3 trillion. This one administration has added half again \nas much debt as all the other administrations that came before it put \ntogether. That is servitude.\n  During the period that this administration has been in office, the \ndebt has gone up by about $10,000 for every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica. For a family of four, that is an increase of $40,000 just \nduring the time this President has been serving as President.\n  What would an average American family think of that amount of debt? \nImagine an average American family sitting at the kitchen table. \nImagine them looking at $40,000 in new debt. What would they think? \nWould they just call up the credit card company and ask for a higher \nlimit?\n  The right thing to do would be to turn over a new leaf. The right \nthing to do would be to balance the family budget. When your debt spins \nout of control, you cut up the credit card, you try to live within your \nmeans, and you stick to a budget for the future of your family.\n  The question is, Will Congress show the kind of fiscal discipline \nthat is necessary? Will Congress show that discipline that any American \nfamily should be expected to show?\n  And to whom are we servants? We are servants to foreigners. Much of \nthe Treasury debt is now owned by foreigners. That includes both \nforeign citizens and central banks in foreign countries. That means we \npay interest to foreign citizens and foreign central banks. Over time, \nthis will lower America's standard of living.\n  How is debt like servitude? These large foreign holdings of our \nTreasury debt are a risk to our homeland security and our economic \nsecurity. Suppose the President thinks that another country is \njeopardizing America's security. Suppose the President would like to \ntell that country that America would like action from it and would take \naction against it if it did not change its actions. If that country's \ncentral bank owned a large amount of our Treasury debt, it could \nthreaten to sell it quickly. That sale would drive up interest rates \nand cause the dollar to fall. That would cause a recession in America. \nAs a result, the President might have to back down from threats against \nthat other country. America would be at greater risk.\n\n  Or take the situation where America has a trade dispute with a \nforeign country. Imagine that the foreign country's central bank owned \na lot of our debt. Then that country could threaten to sell the debt to \nforce America to back down from our position in a trade dispute. \nAmerica would be weaker in trade.\n  Foreigners own more than $2 trillion of Treasury debt today. This is \ndouble the amount they owned at the beginning of this administration.\n  Mr. President, 96 percent of the increase in debt held by the public \nbetween December 2004 and December 2005 resulted from foreign purchases \nof that debt. The bottom line is simple. These massive increases in \ndebt harm America. They make us the servants of foreign nations.\n  How did we get to this point? Federal budget deficits drive up our \ndebt, and these deficits have been huge during this administration. \nWhen this administration took office we were running large budget \nsurpluses--not deficits, surpluses. In fiscal year 2000, the last year \nof the previous administration, we ran a surplus of $236 billion. We \nran a surplus of $86 billion even without counting Social Security. By \nfiscal year 2001, the surplus, counting Social Security, had dropped to \n$128 billion, down from the $236 billion in the prior year. Then, the \ntide of red ink really flowed. In fiscal year 2002, the Government ran \na deficit of $158 billion. The following year, 2003, the Federal \nGovernment ran a budget deficit of $375 billion. That was an all-time \nrecord. But that record lasted just 1 year.\n  The next year, fiscal year 2004, the Government set a new record by \nrunning a deficit of $413 billion. The following year, fiscal year \n2005, the Government ran a deficit of $319 billion. Although this was \nnot a record, it was still larger than deficits run in any year before \nthis administration took office. In the current year, the deficit will \ngo up again. The administration predicts that the deficit will rise to \n$423 billion. This represents yet another all-time record.\n  To make matters worse, these record deficits are occurring just at \nthe time the retirement of the baby boom generation is about to begin. \nThe retirement of the baby boom generation will put enormous stress on \nthe Federal budget. It will lead to huge increases in the cost for \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and this will drive up budget \ndeficits.\n  The fiscal policy of this administration has been the most \nirresponsible in the Nation's history. This fiscal policy has generated \nhuge budget deficits, and these deficits, in turn, have contributed to \nmassive increases in Federal debt.\n  We need to change course. We must reenact the tough pay-go budget \nrule. The pay-go rule says if you want to increase entitlement spending \nor tax cuts, we have to pay for them. Senators Conrad and Feingold will \noffer an amendment to the budget and again to the debt limit \nlegislation to restore tough pay-go rules.\n  I will have more to say about that when the amendment is offered, but \nfor now let me cut to the chase. Every Senator ought to vote for that \namendment. We need to enact a tough pay-go rule. We need to work \ntogether to stop increasing the budget deficit. We need to vote against \nthe hemorrhaging of debt that has afflicted us these last few years. \nThat is what we need to do.\n  The choice is clear. Will we fall further into debt to foreign powers \nor do we have the will to break the bonds of our debt servitude? All \nthat is at stake is our freedom.\n  I urge Senators to think deeply about the upcoming vote. The future \nof our country, in many deep senses of the term, depends on that vote, \nespecially the future of our children and our grandchildren.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BRUCE McMILLAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a constituent, Dr. \nBruce McMillan, director of the Illinois State Museum, and congratulate \nhim on his retirement.\n  Dr. McMillan began his career at the Illinois State Museum in 1969 as \nassociate curator of anthropology. Since becoming director in 1977, Dr. \nMcMillan has guided the museum through an expansion from two to six \nfacilities throughout Illinois.\n  The Illinois State Museum serves the State of Illinois through its \nexcellence in interdisciplinary research and its commitment to \ninnovation in exhibits and education. With collections in the natural \nsciences, anthropology, and art, the museum tells the story of the \nland, life, people, and art of Illinois.\n  Dr. McMillan has brought to his work a true passion for research, \ntravel, and the outdoors. Those who know him best call him a natural \nleader who inspires those around him to do things they would never try \non their own. An avid outdoorsman, Dr. McMillan has led yearly field \ntrips for friends and colleagues, including one to the dry shelters of \nArkansas that has become legend amongst his friends.\n  Known to be a sports enthusiast, Dr. McMillan has played in the \nSpringfield senior softball league for years and has admirably \nrepresented Illinois in the Senior Olympics. He is supported by his \nwife Virginia and his three children in all of his many varied \npursuits.\n  Through his decades of service as director of the Illinois State \nMuseum, Dr. Bruce McMillan has promoted discovery, learning, and an \nappreciation of Illinois' heritage. Under his leadership, the Illinois \nState Museum has become one of the premier State museums in the \ncountry, and the legacy he has created will continue to benefit the \nState of Illinois in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Dr. Bruce McMillan on his many \naccomplishments throughout his long and successful career, and I wish \nhim many more years of happiness and accomplishment in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2024-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n               Private First Class matthew lee bertolino\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to PFC Matthew \nLee Bertolino of Hampsted, NH, for his service and supreme sacrifice \nfor his country.\n  Matthew, a 2003 graduate of Pinkerton Academy, Derry, New Hampshire, \nentered the Marine Corps through the Marine Corps Delayed Entry Program \non September 30, 2004. He started his initial training on January 26, \n2005, at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, SC. Upon \ncompletion of his training he became an infantry marine with an 0351 \nassaultman specialty. His awards include the Afghanistan Campaign \nMedal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, National Defense Service \nMedal, and Expert Rifleman Medal.\n  Tragically, on February 9, 2006, this courageous young marine, only \n20 years of age, died as a result of a nonhostile accident while \noperating as part of a combat patrol near Jalalabad, Afghanistan. At \nthe time Private First Class Bertolino was serving with A Company, 1st \nBattalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, III Marine \nExpeditionary Force which was deployed to Afghanistan in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom--Afghanistan.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Afghanistan--and Matthew \nserved in that fine tradition. Daniel Webster said: God grants liberty \nonly to those who love it, and are always ready to guard and defend it. \nMatthew was one of those proud and dedicated volunteers who chose to \nserve our Nation, and guard our precious liberty, and for that we will \nalways owe our sincere gratitude.\n  Family, friends, and fellow marines will no longer be able to enjoy \nthe company of PFC Matthew Lee Bertolino. Yet memories of this young \npatriot will last forever with those who were fortunate enough to have \nhad the opportunity to know him. He realized a calling for a higher \nservice and chose to employ his considerable talents in the service of \nhis country. He understood that the freedoms and opportunities provided \nby this Nation need continuous defense and that they are among the most \nprecious gifts he can give to his family and loved ones. We honor \nMatthew for the dedication he has shown to his family and our Nation. \nBecause of his efforts, the liberty of this country is made more \nsecure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2024-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRATULATING LOYOLA SACRED HEART SPEECH AND DEBATE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on January 27 and 28, a remarkable group of \nstudents from Loyola Sacred Heart High School in Missoula, MT, won the \nState B-C Title for Speech and Debate. This is the 23rd consecutive \nState championship for this squad. I rise today to congratulate this \nteam on their hard work and success.\n  Loyola's accomplishment is truly remarkable. Out of 50 schools \ncompeting at the State Tournament, Loyola's squad of 26 students scored \n167 points. Twenty-one of these twenty six earned medals. And Paul \nStergios and Paul Dallapiazza were the State champions in team debate, \nwhile Dan Evans took home the gold in extemporaneous speaking.\n  These events, which focus on current events and policy, are a \nfantastic educational tool for students to learn about their world and \ntheir government. In fact, I have several former Montana team debaters \non my staff, including a former State champion in team debate.\n  By winning its 23rd straight State championship, the Loyola Sacred \nHeart speech and debate team extends its State record for the most \nconsecutive titles in any division in any activity. A lot of things \nhave changed since they won their first title in 1984, but the success \nenjoyed by Loyola Sacred Heart in speech and debate has remained \nconsistent.

Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the \nTransportation Corporation in South Bend, IN, for its decision to use \nbiofuels to power the South Bend public transit system, the second \nlargest public transit system in all of Indiana. This is good news for \nthe environment and good news for the economy. By using biofuels to \npower South Bend's public buses, Indiana is\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\nsetting an example for the rest of the Nation and leading the way on \nthe path to greater energy security.\n  Ending our dependence on foreign oil is one of the defining \nchallenges of our generation and it's going to affect America for \ngenerations to come. It will affect our economy, our finances, our \nNation's security and, ultimately, the kind of world our children \ninherit from us.\n  If we learned anything from September 11, it is that we can no longer \nafford to be dependent on places like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and \nVenezuela for our energy supply. Yet unfortunately, we are more \ndependent on foreign oil from hostile countries today than we were on \nSeptember 11--making us more vulnerable and putting the United States \nin the uniquely disturbing and intolerable position of bankrolling both \nsides in the war on terror.\n  By tapping the energy potential of Indiana's farm fields, we can \nensure a reliable domestic energy supply to meet our Nation's needs \nwhile ending our reliance on unstable countries for their oil and, at \nthe same time, creating thousands of jobs for Hoosier farmers. South \nBend's buses will run on B20 soy biodiesel, a clean renewable fuel that \ncreates a new market for Indiana's 28,000 soybean farmers. Indiana's \nfarmers represent some of the very best of our State's traditions and \nhistory, and I am proud that they will be our partners as we chart a \npath to energy independence in the 21st century.\n  Although it may seem daunting, we can reduce our dependence on oil. \nBrazil has announced that it expects to be energy independent by the \nend of the year by fulfilling its energy needs in part from \ndomestically produced biofuels. If they can do it, so can we. And here \nin Indiana, we are beginning to understand the power and potential of \nrenewable energy sources. Last year, the Indy Racing League announced \nits decision to use ethanol in its IndyCars. Beginning in 2006, all \nIndyCars will race on an ethanol-blend before switching to 100 percent \nethanol fuel the following year. If a high performance vehicle running \non ethanol can win the Brickyard, surely ethanol is good enough for the \nfamily minivan, too.\n  Today's announcement builds on Indiana's prominent leadership role in \nthe country's growing renewable fuel industry. If cities around the \ncountry would follow South Bend's lead, step-by-step we could move \ntowards energy independence.\n  Here in the Senate, I have introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at \nbreaking America's dependence on foreign oil by reducing our use of oil \nby 7 million barrels a day by 2026. My legislation would achieve that \ngoal by creating incentives to encourage the use of alternative fuels \nlike those being used by TRANSPO and promoting greater energy \nefficiency. A key part of accomplishing this goal involves increasing \nAmerica's use of biofuels through significant increases in tax credits \nand grants. By letting America's farmers produce America's fuel, we \nwill help truly set our country free.\n  I want to thank South Bend and TRANSPO for showing us how to start \nmaking that progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2025-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RONALD SEAWRIGHT OF ST.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of an exceptional Missouri student.\n  Second grader Ronald Seawright of St. Louis has taken it upon himself \nto lead his peers in the St. Louis Public School District in an effort \nto end school violence, particularly bullying. Using his personal \nexperiences at Laclede Elementary School during his first grade year, \nRonald published a short book entitled ``The Bully,'' which he hopes \nwill guide other students to free themselves from bullying.\n  Ronald's book, ``The Bully,'' explains who bullies are and what they \ndo, as well as how to respond when you are frightened by a bully. \nRonald's advice is sound: do not suffer the intimidation of a bully. He \nstresses the importance of communicating to trusted adults in order to \nhelp students overcome peer violence and abuse in its early stages \nbefore the school's learning environment is disrupted.\n  With the aid of his mother and local leaders, Ronald continues to \nspread his message. On March 14, 2006, public schools across the city \nof St. Louis are celebrating Live Bully-Free Day. Ronald has invited \nother school children to join him in learning the personal and social \nskills necessary to protect themselves from bullies, gangs, and their \ntactics. Ronald deserves to be commended not only for his courage but \nalso for his great service and leadership in our community.\n  Mr. President, I encourage you and other Members of the Senate to \njoin me in recognizing the initiative of this brave and creative young \nman, Ronald Seawright.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2025-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2025-S2026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORIAM TO SAM CHU LIN\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

In the 1970s, he became one of the first \nAsian-American journalists to rise from local to network news, working \nfor CBS News in New York. While at CBS, Mr. Chu Lin reported to a \nnational television audience the historic news that the Vietnam War was \nover.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Chu Lin demonstrated his versatility as a \nreporter. He interviewed Presidents and world leaders, and he covered \nearthquakes and other natural disasters. In the late 1980s, he reported \nfrom China about the government crackdown on the Tiananmen Square \ndemonstration for democracy. Since 1995, Mr. Chu Lin worked at KTTV Fox \n11 News in Los Angeles. In addition, he wrote numerous articles about \nAsian-American affairs for news publications such as Asian Week, Rafu \nShimpo, the Nichi Bei Times, and the San Francisco Examiner. He was \nalso a regular contributor to KQED radio in San Francisco.\n  Over the years, Mr. Chu Lin was the recipient of many awards and \naccolades from prestigious organizations, including the Associated \nPress, United Press International, the Academy of Arts and Sciences, \nthe Greater Los Angeles Press Club, and the Radio and Television News \nAssociation. As a strong advocate for Asian-Pacific-Americans and their \ncontributions throughout history, Mr. Chu Lin was also the recipient of \nmany awards from Asian-Pacific-American organizations, most recently \nthe 2005 Spirit of America Award from the Chinese American Citizens \nAlliance.\n  Sam Chu Lin believed that journalism should be educational, and that \n``informing and helping others is what makes journalism exciting.'' He \nfelt that journalism was a ``chance to use your roots for a positive \npurpose.'' In his reports, articles, and stories, it was evident that \nMr. Chu Lin did just that. He was a tireless advocate on behalf of the \nAsian-Pacific-American community, whether he was producing \ndocumentaries on the Asian-Pacific American experience or speaking to \norganizations about the importance of civic participation. His \ncontributions to the field of journalism, especially within the Asian-\nPacific-American community, will not be forgotten.\n  Mr. Chu Lin is survived by his wife, Judy; his two sons, Mark and \nChristopher; and his mother.

Rising from the rank of \nMarine Private, he has served around the globe in both war and peace. \nMajor Jurgensen was born in Oak Park, IL, and spent much of his youth \nin the Chicago area.\n  He began his Marine Corps service at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, \nParris Island, SC. He also completed the School of Infantry, Camp \nLejeune. Assigned duties as a Marine Corps Combat Correspondent, he \nsubsequently graduated from the Military Print and Broadcast Journalist \nProgram at the Defense Information School.\n  Major Jurgensen was then stationed in Tokyo, Japan, as a \nCorrespondent for the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service. \nPromoted to Corporal while in Japan, Major Jurgensen was selected for \nthe Enlisted Commissioning Program and transferred to Quantico, VA, \nwhere he attended Officer Candidate School and the Basic School--\ngraduating with Honors. As a Marine Officer, Major Jurgensen has served \nin North Carolina, Missouri, Louisiana, and Washington, DC.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe Iran emergency declared on March 15, 1995, is to continue in effect \nbeyond March 15, 2006. The most recent notice continuing this emergency \nwas published in the Federal Register on March 14, 2005 (70 FR 12581).\n  The crisis between the United States and Iran constituted by the \nactions and policies of the Government of Iran that led to the \ndeclaration of a national emergency on March 15, 1995, has not been \nresolved.

A bill to transfer authority to review certain mergers, \nacquisitions, and takeovers of United States entities by foreign \nentities to a designee established within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreform and strengthen the national security review process for foreign \ninvestments in the United States. I am very pleased to be joined by \nthree of my colleagues--Senator Lieberman, Senator Coleman, and Senator \nAkaka--in introducing this legislation.\n  In a global economy, foreign investment in this country is becoming \nincreasingly common. The national security and homeland security \nimplications of those investments must be\n\n[[Page S2029]]\n\nscrutinized by the departments with responsibility for those critical \nmatters.\n  The controversy over the Dubai ports transaction has exposed serious \nflaws and shortcomings in the current law and process that is used to \nreview foreign investments in our country.\n  In 1988, Congress passed the Exon-Florio provision of the Defense \nProduction Act to get the President the authority to suspend or \nprohibit any foreign acquisition, merger, or takeover of a U.S. \ncorporation that is determined to threaten our national security.\n  Through an Executive order, the President gave a new committee--known \nas the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, often \nreferred to as CFIUS--the responsibility of reviewing transactions \npursuant to the Exon-Florio law and to make recommendations to the \nPresident.\n  The law is something of an anachronism because of what it doesn't \nsay. It focuses on acquisitions of American companies that are either \nimportant to our military industrial base or have technology that could \nhelp a terrorist state develop weapons of mass destruction. Obviously, \nboth of those concerns are very important. We do want to preserve our \nmilitary industrial base, and we do want to safeguard technology that \ncould help terrorists or anyone else develop weapons of mass \ndestruction. But neither of those transactions or those requirements \naddress transactions that could assist terrorists in threatening our \nsecurity right here at home.\n  Obviously, there are other ways for terrorists to undermine our \nsecurity that might be completely separate from the military industrial \nbase issues or the technological issues related to weapons of mass \ndestruction. In other words, the law is simply too narrow in its \napplication. The current CFIUS process is not designed to analyze \ntransactions that involve a port terminal or other critical \ninfrastructures within our borders.\n  The Government Accountability Office, in a report issued last \nSeptember, found that the Exon-Florio law's effectiveness in protecting \nU.S. national security may be limited--limited because the Department \nof Treasury, as the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Investment in \nthe United States, narrowly defines what constitutes a threat to our \nnational security. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United \nStates, CFIUS, focuses too much on the financial component and not \nenough on security.\n  I think that is what many of us concluded happened in the review of \nthe Dubai ports transaction. The focus was on investment, needed \ninvestment in our ports, rather than being focused on the national \nsecurity or homeland security implications that could possibly arise \nfrom that transaction. The committee is supposed to identify \ntransactions that could affect our national security. It doesn't say \n``harm'' our national security; it says ``affect'' our national \nsecurity. That is supposed to be sufficient to trigger a full 45-day \ninvestigation. But, unfortunately, that is not initially what happened \nwith the proposed Dubai ports transaction.\n  I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to a broader \nissue, and that is the composition of CFIUS. Remember, this is supposed \nto be a national security review, but who chairs the committee? Not the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, not the Department of Defense, not the \nDepartment of Justice. The committee is chaired by the Department of \nthe Treasury, and chairing this committee is meaningful because the \nchairman's interpretation of the law, including the provision that \nmakes a 45-day investigation mandatory in the case of foreign \ngovernment control to entities that could affect national security, \ntends to govern. In other words, what the chairman decides in \ninterpreting whether the 45-day investigation is triggered tends to be \nwhat happens.\n  I suggest to you, and to my colleagues that the system is \nfundamentally flawed if it has the Secretary of Treasury, no matter how \ncapable and well qualified he is--and I believe he is all of those \nthings--chair a committee that is supposed to be looking at national \nsecurity. Thus, I believe the CFIUS process has been weighed too much \ntoward investment considerations and not sufficiently attentive to the \nnational security and homeland security implications. Indeed, the GAO \nfound that Treasury is ``reluctant to initiate investigations to \ndetermine whether national security concerns require a recommendation \nfor possible Presidential action.'' That is what GAO found, and that \ncertainly seems to be an accurate finding.\n  These are concerns which we simply cannot tolerate given today's \nthreat environment, and that is why I am introducing legislation to \nabolish the CFIUS process and to create a new interagency, \ninterdepartmental mechanism chaired by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to analyze transactions for both their homeland security and \nnational security implications. Our bill is designed to fix the process \nthrough the following changes:\n  First, the bill would establish a new committee, the Committee for \nSecure Commerce, to replace the old CFIUS. The Committee for Secure \nCommerce would be chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and \nthe Secretary of Defense would serve as the vice chairman. The Director \nof National Intelligence would be specifically designated as a standing \nmember of the committee in order to ensure that important intelligence \ninformation is part of the deliberative process. The Department of \nTreasury will still be represented on the committee, but with respect \nto the other members, the President shall name the appropriate agencies \nand departments to sit on the committee. This is an important change \nbecause it helps ensure that the focus will, indeed, be national \nhomeland security, and it corrects what I believe to be a major \nshortcoming in the composition of the current committee, and that is \nthat the intelligence community is not represented. That is \nextraordinary, given the purpose of this committee.\n  Second, the bill would explicitly include homeland security among the \nfactors the committee would evaluate in deciding whether to review or \ninvestigate a transaction.\n  Third, the Secretary of Homeland Security would establish a process \nby which the committee reviews transactions and would establish the \nrole and responsibility of each member.\n  In addition, each member would establish the process and procedure by \nwhich each respective agency would conduct its review, sharing that \nwith the other committee members. It is important that committee \nmembers each have a general understanding of the scrutiny being applied \nto a transaction both within their own agencies and across the \ngovernment. Such understanding was not apparent in the current CFIUS \nprocess.\n  Should a transaction warrant an investigation, the bill would require \nthe Director of National Intelligence to consolidate intelligence \nassessments.\n  Lastly, this legislation would strengthen the reporting requirements \nto Congress. The existing process lacks transparency and does not allow \nsufficient oversight. It may be appropriate for the reviews, which may \ninvolve proprietary data and classified information, to be conducted \nconfidentially. However, it is wholly appropriate that Members of \nCongress be briefed in a timely manner.\n  The bill would also address the so-called Byrd amendment loophole, \nrequiring an investigation where the entity would be controlled by a \nforeign-government. In looking at the plain language of the existing \nstatute, a 45-day investigation should have taken place in the Dubai \nPorts World purchase of Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company. \nHowever, the Treasury Department interpretation of the statute for \nnearly 15 years has been contrary to congressional intent, and thus, \nTreasury found there was no need for the 45-day investigation. That so-\ncalled ambiguity has been clarified in our bill. The law requires a 45-\nday investigation in cases where an acquirer is controlled by a foreign \ngovernment, as in the case of DP World, and the acquisition could \naffect the national security of the U.S.\n  It is important that Congress take action to reform the review \nprocess for foreign investment in the U.S. This bill provides a new \nstructure, appropriately focused on national security and homeland \nsecurity. I seek my colleagues support in moving this legislation \nforward.\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\n  The Dubai ports controversy may have temporarily or perhaps \npermanently been set aside, but that does not mean we should abandon \nthe efforts to reform and strengthen the law to ensure a proper review \nof foreign transactions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2400\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nlegislation introduced by Senator Collins and myself that would create \na new Committee for Secure Commerce at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to review the proposed sale of U.S. properties to foreign \ninvesters. This Committee would replace the Committee on Foreign \nInvestments in the United States, whose hasty approval of the Dubai \nPorts World acquisition of terminals at several U.S. ports led to a \npublic outcry, which eventually led to DPW's withdrawal from the deal.\n  The entire affair has been poorly handled, from the original failure \nto conduct a thorough investigation to the failure to consult with and \ninform the Congress and the American public. Any proposed foreign \ninvestment in this country needs a thorough and fair review to ensure \nthat our national security or homeland security is not jeopardized. I \nwas not among those who called for the deal to be prohibited before a \nthorough investigation was conducted, because I felt that Dubai Ports \nWorld never got a chance to make a case that its ownership of port \nterminals in the U.S. would not jeopardize our homeland security. \nBecause of the initial public outcry, they were condemned before they \nwere allowed to stand trial, and I believed that violated this Nation's \ncommitment to the rule of law. A required 45-day investigation of the \ndeal should have been initiated. Congress should have been better \ninformed of the proposed acquisition in the works. And the American \npeople deserved a clear explanation from their President about why he \nthought the sale was in our interest.\n  National security must be the first consideration in the sale of U.S. \nproperty to foreign investors, especially at this period in our \nhistory, when the threat of terrorist attack is always present. Our \nlegislation would ensure that foreign investments are scrutinized by \nthe agencies most directly responsible for protecting this Nation.\n  That is the underlying purpose of our legislation.\n  Our bill would create the Committee for Secure Commerce within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to review and investigate any mergers, \nacquisitions, or takeovers of assets within the U.S. by foreign \ncompanies.\n  Like CFIUS, the new Committee would have 30 days to conduct a review \nof transactions, but could also seek a longer, 45-day investigation as \nwell. A 45-day investigation would be obligatory if a company \ncontrolled by a foreign government tries to purchase assets involved in \nU.S. interstate commerce. And if any member of the Committee objected \nto a proposed deal, the President would have the final say on whether \nit went forward, or whether a divestiture, or some other remedy, was \nnecessary.\n  The Committee would be chaired by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The Defense Department would serve as a vice chair. Our bill \nalso strengthens Congressional oversight by requiring immediate \ncongressional notification of all mandatory investigations, and \nquarterly reports on all other transactions.\n  The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nreceived an illuminating briefing on the Dubai Ports World deal late \nlast month. At that briefing, we learned that the Coast Guard had \nexpressed some intelligence concerns about the transaction but that not \nall CFIUS members were informed of these concerns. Our legislation \naddresses this shortcoming by adding the Director of National \nIntelligence as a full member of the committee and ensuring all \nintelligence assessments are consolidated and shared with all Committee \nmembers and the President.\n  Our legislation is intended to directly address the concerns raised \nby the Government Accountability Office that CFIUS tended to focus more \non investments issues rather than security issues--by placing DHS and \nDoD in charge, and by specifically including homeland security issues \nas factors to be considered by the new committee.\n  The rush to judgment on the DPW deal did not allow the company to \nstand or fall on its own merits. And\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\nthat is not how we do things in America. We do not judge people in our \ndemocracy by their race, nationality, religion, gender, sexual \norientation, or age. We judge people on their merits.\n  I believe this legislation would establish a better process for \njudging the wisdom or folly of selling U.S. property to foreign owners \nby establishing that the Nation's security should be the pre-eminent \nconsideration in foreign purchases of U.S. property and by ensuring \nthat everyone's concerns about such sales get a fair hearing.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Collins and \nSenator Lieberman in introducing a bill to transfer the authority of \nreviewing foreign investment in the United States to the Department of \nHomeland Security and to impose additional structure and increase \ncongressional oversight on the review process. There has been a failure \nin Government procedure that must be corrected, and this legislation \nwill address those procedural failures.\n  I am concerned that our process to review acquisitions, mergers or \ntakeovers of U.S. corporations by foreign entities that ``may'' pose a \nnational security threat, did not trigger the Committee on Foreign \nInvestment in the United States, CFIUS, to conduct a more thorough \nreview. While the United Arab Emirates has supported the United States \nin the war against terrorism, its past activities related to terrorist \ngroups should have triggered CFIUS to conduct a more thorough review.\n  More specifically, the act states that if there is an acquisition, \nmerger, or takeover of a U.S. corporation by a foreign entity, then \nCFIUS, an interagency committee chaired by the Secretary of Treasury, \nreviews the deal to ascertain if there is any threat to our national \nsecurity. In addition, in accordance with Section 837(a) of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1993, called the \nByrd amendment, amended Section 721 of the Defense Production Act, the \nExon-Florio provision, a more extensive review should have been \nconducted on the Dubai Ports World deal, especially since certain \nmembers of CFIUS did have national security concerns about the \nacquisition.\n  Given the questionable interpretation by CFIUS on the Byrd amendment, \nI believe it is important for Congress to revisit the act and clarify \nthe provisions that require CFIUS to conduct a thorough review of \nforeign acquisitions, mergers, and takeovers.\n  Our legislation removes any ambiguity by specifically requiring an \ninvestigation any time a foreign government-owned corporation is \ninvolved in a transaction. As ranking member on the Oversight of \nGovernment Management Subcommittee, it is my responsibility to evaluate \ngovernmental processes and develop solutions that ensure our national \nand homeland security while maintaining the favorable promotion of \nforeign investments in the United States.\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, \nchairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee, respectively, on drafting the legislation to address \nthese process shortcomings, which will promote reasonable transparency \nand oversight within the foreign investment review process. The \nsecurity of U.S. ports is of great concern to me because my home State \nof Hawaii receives 98 percent of its imports via sea-based \ntransportation.\n  Given the national and homeland security implications of the proposed \nDP World takeover, I believe it is absolutely necessary for Congress to \nensure that the executive branch performs a rigorous review of the \ntransaction. Our bill ensures that Congress is informed of pending \ninvestigations that may impact national or homeland security prior to \nthe President making a decision whether to disapprove the transaction. \nI believe that additional intelligence community resources should have \nbeen drawn upon before the President made his determination to support \nthe transaction. There should have been a consolidated intelligence \nassessment, and this report should have been provided to all senior \nmembers of the review committee. The bill we introduce today requires \nconsolidated intelligence assessments to be developed by the Director \nof National Intelligence and provided to all review committee members, \nthereby ensuring that all members are sufficiently informed.\n  I was also disturbed that two of the reviewing Departments--the \nDepartments of Defense and Homeland Security--do not currently have \ninternal written instructions on their review processes. How do we know \nthat adequate reviews of foreign investment in the United States are \nbeing conducted by these two critical CFIUS members if a systematic and \ndocumented process, subject to audit, does not exist? Our legislation \nrequires the development and documentation of internal procedures to \nensure that all reviewing members use a standardized process while \nconducting their review of foreign investment proposals.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that Dubai Ports World is attempting to \naddress the concerns of the American public. However, this problem is \nbigger than just a single transaction, which is why we are introducing \nthis legislation today. I am honored to cosponsor, with Senator Collins \nand Senator Lieberman, this bill which reforms the process of reviewing \nforeign investment in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2401. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \ncertain energy tax incentives, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of a bill \nthat I am introducing today, the Combating Money Laundering and \nTerrorist Financing Act of 2006.\n  I first introduced the Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist \nFinancing Act in 2003 to address what I saw as a significant threat to \nthe security of our Nation. Money laundering is an issue of profound \nimportance to our national security because it undermines financial \nstability by infiltrating and using legitimate financial institutions \nto hide the illegitimate source of these funds. Money laundering also \naffects our national security simply because money is the motivating \nfactor for so much of the criminal activities that affect our daily \nlives, from shoplifting and petty theft to drug trafficking and multi-\nmillion dollar stock frauds.\n  We also know that money laundering is a key tool for terrorist groups \nbecause it fuels their ability to spread murder, fear and destruction \nthroughout the world. One of the 9/11 Commission Report recommendations \nstated that, ``Vigorous efforts to track terrorist financing must \nremain front and center in the U.S. counter-terrorism efforts.'' The \nCommission expressed its concerns about terrorist financing and ``the \nneed to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their \nfunding.'' I strongly share the Commission's concerns and support their \nrecommendations that they provided in their final report.\n  However, I am very concerned about the 9/11 Commission's Final Report \nCard, released on December 5, 2005, which gave the U.S. Government an \nA- for our ``vigorous efforts against terror financing.'' After the \nrelease of the 9/11 Commission Report and nearly 4 years after the \nterrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, our \nGovernment is still too ill-equipped and fraught with in-fighting to \nrate an A- for its efforts. While we have made significant strides in \nidentifying the methods used to earn, store and move this money, we are \nstill far behind the curve on shutting down the flow of illicit \nfinancing permanently.\n  Billions of dollars continue to be funneled to terrorist and criminal \norganizations after being laundered for these organizations around the \nworld. Therefore, we must continue to increase the pressure we put on \nthese organizations until we reach the point where their ever-changing \nmoney laundering methods are no longer convenient, profitable or \neffective.\n  The legislation I am introducing today includes several provisions \nthat will strengthen our current money laundering laws by streamlining \na number of statutes, clarifying language in the current law and \nclosing loopholes that are often exploited by criminal organizations. \nAs our new anti-money laundering laws have proven to be effective and \nmake money laundering through traditional financial institutions more \ndifficult, criminals are\n\n[[Page S2033]]\n\nforced to shift methods to launder their illegally gained funds. As \nthese criminals change their tactics, so must we. Allow me to tell you \nabout some of the key changes that this bill includes to meet these \nchallenges.\n  To begin with, under current law there are over 200 ``specified \nunlawful activities'' or ``SUA's'' that serve as predicate offenses for \nmoney laundering charges. As criminals continue to alter their methods \nof laundering illegal funds, this list of required ``SUA's'' is sure to \ngrow. My legislation will eliminate the need to continually update the \nstatutes by consolidating the growing list of ``specified unlawful \nactivities'' to include all offenses punishable by imprisonment for \nmore than 1 year. This legislation also recognizes the global aspect of \nmoney laundering by including foreign offenses that would be illegal \nmoney laundering offenses had they occurred within U.S. jurisdiction.\n\n  This bill also simplifies current law by allowing the government to \ncharge money laundering acts as a ``course of conduct.'' Currently, in \nmost circuits, courts are required to charge each money laundering \ntransaction as a separate count. This legislation allows, but does not \nrequire, courts to charge a series of money laundering offenses as a \n``course of conduct.'' This change would reduce the time and expense \ncurrently incurred by courts that are required to charge and prosecute \neach separate violation of the money laundering laws.\n  As new laws have made money laundering through traditional financial \ninstitutions more difficult, criminals are turning to riskier methods \nof moving their money. One growing area is bulk cash smuggling, and as \nsuch, this bill increases the penalty for bulk cash smuggling to 10 \nyears.\n  In addition, many ``money service businesses,'' or ``MSB's'' have \nalso come under increased scrutiny because of their suspected role in \nmoving funds from the United States to terrorist organizations \nthroughout the world. Another provision of my legislation amends \nSection 373 of the USA PATRIOT Act regarding money service businesses \nto read ``illegal'' instead of ``unlicensed'' to ensure that the law \ncovers any money service business that promotes unlawful activity as a \ncourse of business.\n  Another money laundering technique is for couriers to carry checks \nthat are complete except for the dollar amount. Under this approach the \ncouriers attempt to avoid U.S. Customs reporting requirements through \nthe movement of monetary instruments that are in bearer form and are \nworth over $10,000. Even though the blank checks are in bearer form, \nthey argue that the value being left blank is not over $10,000 and does \nnot need to be reported. Once they and the blank check reach their \ndestination, all they need to do is to fill in the amount, whatever \nthat may be, and have it negotiated. This legislation removes any \nconfusion as to whether this act is a violation of the reporting \nrequirement. This bill would resolve this issue by clarifying that a \ncheck in bearer form, with an amount left blank shall be deemed to have \na value equal to the highest amount in the bank account that it is \ndrawn upon while the check was being transported, or when the blank \ncheck is cashed or intended to be cashed.\n  My legislation eliminates confusion or ambiguity about the definition \nof ``commingled funds,'' and structured transactions. ``Commingling of \nfunds'' is a method often used by criminals to disguise illegal money \nfrom legal money by mixing the funds together in one account. \n``Structured transactions'' is a method used to circumvent our monetary \ntransaction reporting requirements by breaking monetary transactions \ninto several smaller dollar amounts so as to avoid a Government \nreporting requirement if the transaction had been only one transaction \nwith a value over $10,000. Plus, this legislation clarifies \nextraterritorial jurisdiction to include money laundering acts that \nhave an effect in the United States.\n  Often, money couriers are intercepted before they reach the \ncollection point but are released because they claim that they didn't \nknow that the money was derived illegally. My bill ensures that the \ncourier can no longer be released from responsibility in the money \nlaundering chain by claiming ignorance about how the money was derived, \nwhich means the law enforcement agency can get both the courier and the \nmoney off the street.\n  Finally, this bill updates counterfeiting statutes to keep them \ncurrent with new technology and devices, such as holograms, that are \nused to produce counterfeits of U.S. obligations and securities.\n  The battle against terrorism and organized criminal groups must be \nfought on many fronts--including the financial front. We know that we \nhave made strides in this area as evidenced by the money launderers' \nuse of different techniques. As important as it is to learn what \ntechniques these criminals use, it is just as important to act upon \nthis knowledge. If we can shut down the flow of illegal money, whether \ngenerated by drug sales or in support of terrorist activities, I \nbelieve we will make a significant impact on the demise of these \ncriminal and terrorist groups. This bill is important to identifying \nparticular criminal and terrorist financing operations and putting them \nout of business. I urge my colleagues to support my legislation and \nstrengthen our national efforts against the continued threat of \nterrorist financing and financial crimes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2402\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such warning is \n     defined as a projection that within 7 years General Fund \n     contributions to Medicare funding expressed as a percentage \n     of total Medicare outlays, exceed 45 percent.\n       (b) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order to consider \n     any bill, joint resolution, amendment or conference report \n     that would cause any increase in direct spending, net of \n     proposals to change in direct spending, receipts, or revenues \n     contained in the measure, if a Medicare Funding warning has \n     been submitted to the Senate pursuant to subsection (a) for 2 \n     consecutive calendar years.\n       (c) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended only \n     by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the members, duly \n     chosen and sworn.\n       (d) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n       (e) Determinations.--For the purposes of this section, the \n     determination of whether Medicare funding warrants a funding \n     warning and when it may be appropriate to withdraw such \n     warning, as well as the levels of net direct spending as \n     required under subsection (b), shall be provided by the \n     chairman of the Committee on the Budget.\n       (f) Cancellation.--Should legislation be enacted to reduce \n     the general fund contribution below 45 percent as determined \n     by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, the \n     notification of a Medicare funding warning is withdrawn.\n\n     SEC. 407. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, \n     respectively, and as such they shall be considered as part of \n     the rules of each House, or of the Senate and such rules \n     shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are \n     inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the Senate to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     that house) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as is the case of any other rule of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2041-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2041-S2042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 398--RELATING TO THE CENSURE OF GEORGE W. BUSH\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 398\n\n       Whereas Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), and in so \n     doing provided the executive branch with clear authority to \n     wiretap suspected terrorists inside the United States;\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     has been amended multiple times since 1978, to expand the \n     surveillance authority of the executive branch and address \n     new technological developments;\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     states that it and the criminal wiretap law are the \n     ``exclusive means by which electronic surveillance'' may be \n     conducted by the United States Government and makes it a \n     crime to wiretap individuals without complying with this \n     statutory authority;\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     permits the Government to initiate wiretapping immediately in \n     emergencies as long as the Government obtains approval from \n     the court established under section 103 of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) within \n     72 hours of initiating the wiretap;\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     authorizes wiretaps without the court orders otherwise \n     required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     for the first 15 days following a declaration of war by \n     Congress;\n       Whereas the Authorization for Use of Military Force that \n     became law on September 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-40; 50 \n     U.S.C. 1541 note), did not grant the President the power to \n     authorize wiretaps of Americans within the United States \n     without obtaining the court orders required by the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978;\n       Whereas the President's inherent constitutional authority \n     does not give him the power to violate the explicit statutory \n     prohibition on warrantless wiretaps in the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978;\n       Whereas George W. Bush, President of the United States, has \n     authorized and continues to authorize wiretaps by the \n     National Security Agency of Americans within the United \n     States without obtaining the court orders required by the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush has failed to inform the \n     full congressional intelligence committees about this \n     program, as required by the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \n     U.S.C. 401 et seq.);\n       Whereas President George W. Bush repeatedly misled the \n     public prior to the public disclosure of the National \n     Security Agency surveillance program by indicating his \n     Administration was relying on court orders to wiretap \n     suspected terrorists inside the United States, by stating--\n       (1) on April 20, 2004, that ``When we're talking about \n     chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court \n     order before we do so.'';\n       (2) on July 14, 2004, that ``the government can't move on \n     wiretaps or roving wiretaps without getting a court order''; \n     and\n       (3) on June 9, 2005, that ``Law enforcement officers need a \n     federal judge's permission to wiretap a foreign terrorist's \n     phone, a federal judge's permission to track his calls, or a \n     federal judge's permission to search his property. Officers \n     must meet strict standards to use any of these tools.'';\n       Whereas President George W. Bush has, since the public \n     disclosure of the National Security Agency surveillance \n     program, falsely implied that the program was necessary \n     because the executive branch did not have authority to \n     wiretap suspected terrorists inside the United States, by \n     making statements about the supposed need for the program, \n     including--\n       (1) on January 25, 2006, stating at the National Security \n     Agency that ``When terrorist operatives are here in America \n     communicating with someone overseas, we must understand \n     what's going on if we're going to do our job to protect the \n     people. The safety and security of the American people depend \n     on our ability to find out who the terrorists are talking to, \n     and what they're planning. In the weeks following September \n     the 11th, I authorized a terrorist surveillance program to \n     detect and intercept al Qaeda communications involving \n     someone here in the United States.''; and\n       (2) on January 31, 2006, asserting during the State of the \n     Union that ``The terrorist surveillance program has helped \n     prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essential to the \n     security of America. If there are people inside our country \n     who are talking with al Qaeda, we want to know about it, \n     because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again.''; and\n       Whereas President George W. Bush inaccurately stated in his \n     January 31, 2006, State of the Union address that ``Previous \n     Presidents have used the same constitutional authority I \n     have, and federal courts have approved the use of that \n     authority.'', even though the President has failed to \n     identify a single instance since the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 became law in which another \n     President has authorized wiretaps inside the United States \n     without complying with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978, and no Federal court has evaluated whether the \n     President has the inherent authority to authorize wiretaps \n     inside the United States without complying with the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate does hereby censure \n     George W. Bush, President of the United States, and does \n     condemn his unlawful authorization of wiretaps of Americans \n     within the United States without obtaining the court orders \n     required by the\n\n[[Page S2042]]\n\n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, his failure to \n     inform the full congressional intelligence committees as \n     required by law, and his efforts to mislead the American \n     people about the authorities relied upon by his \n     Administration to conduct wiretaps and about the legality of \n     the program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2042-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 399--DESIGNATING MARCH 25, 2006, AS ``GREEK \n INDEPENDENCE DAY: A NATIONAL DAY OF CELEBRATION OF GREEK AND AMERICAN \n                              DEMOCRACY''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nBiden, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, \nMr. Cochran, Mr. Craig, Mr. Dayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, \nMr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johnson, \nMr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lott, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Obama, Mr. Reed, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nSmith, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Thomas, \nMr. Voinovich, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 399\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete, which \n     provided the Axis land war with its first major setback, \n     setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the \n     outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas the price for Greece in holding our common values \n     in their region was high, as hundreds of thousands of \n     civilians were killed in Greece during World War II;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was 1 of only \n     3 countries in the world, beyond the former British Empire, \n     that allied with the United States in every major \n     international conflict;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, in recognizing Greek \n     Independence Day, said, ``Greece and America have been firm \n     allies in the great struggles for liberty. Americans will \n     always remember Greek heroism and Greek sacrifice for the \n     sake of freedom . . . [and] as the 21st Century dawns, Greece \n     and America once again stand united; this time in the fight \n     against terrorism. The United States deeply appreciates the \n     role Greece is playing in the war against terror. . . . \n     America and Greece are strong allies, and we're strategic \n     partners.'';\n       Whereas President Bush stated that Greece's successful \n     ``law enforcement operations against a terrorist organization \n     [November 17] responsible for three decades of terrorist \n     attacks underscore the important contributions Greece is \n     making to the global war on terrorism'';\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested \n     over $10,000,000,000 in the region;\n       Whereas Greece was extraordinarily responsive to requests \n     by the United States during the war in Iraq, as Greece \n     immediately granted unlimited access to its airspace and the \n     base in Souda Bay, and many ships of the United States that \n     delivered troops, cargo, and supplies to Iraq were refueled \n     in Greece;\n       Whereas, in August 2004, the Olympic games came home to \n     Athens, Greece, the land of their ancient birthplace 2,500 \n     years ago and the city of their modern revival in 1896;\n       Whereas Greece received world-wide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympics of over \n     14,000 athletes from 202 countries and over 2,000,000 \n     spectators and journalists, which it did so efficiently, \n     securely, and with its famous Greek hospitality;\n       Whereas the unprecedented security effort in Greece for the \n     first Olympics after the attacks on the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, included a record-setting expenditure of \n     over $1,390,000,000 and assignment of over 70,000 security \n     personnel, as well as the utilization of an 8-country Olympic \n     Security Advisory Group that included the United States;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity \n     meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with \n     Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has had extraordinary \n     success in recent years in furthering cross-cultural \n     understanding and reducing tensions between Greece and \n     Turkey;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between these 2 nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas March 25, 2006, marks the 185th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution that freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate this \n     anniversary with the Greek people and to reaffirm the \n     democratic principles from which these 2 great nations were \n     born: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 25, 2006, as ``Greek Independence Day: \n     A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \n     Democracy''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2042-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2042-S2043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 400--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n        CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROCESS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Durbin) \nsubmitted the following resolution, which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 400\n\n       Whereas the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina (commonly referred to as the ``Dayton Peace \n     Accords'') was agreed to at Wright Patterson Air Force Base \n     in Dayton, Ohio, on November 21, 1995;\n       Whereas the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords was a \n     historic accomplishment that was made possible through the \n     strong leadership of the United States;\n       Whereas the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords ended a \n     brutal 3\\1/2\\-year conflict marked by aggression and genocide \n     in which many tens of thousands lost their lives;\n       Whereas the Dayton Peace Accords created a framework for a \n     common state in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but was crafted \n     amidst the exigencies of war and included many compromises \n     imposed by the need for quick action to preserve human life;\n       Whereas in the 10 years since the signing of the Dayton \n     Peace Accords, there has been considerable progress in \n     building a peaceful society in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       Whereas this progress in building a peaceful society has \n     been facilitated by both the citizens of the country and the \n     international community;\n       Whereas, during the 9 years that the peacekeepers of the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization worked to keep order in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, their forces suffered no intentional \n     casualties and never fired a single shot in combat;\n       Whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina has demonstrated a \n     willingness to contribute to the work of the international \n     community and sent 36 troops to assist in efforts to \n     stabilize the country of Iraq;\n       Whereas the full incorporation of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     into the Euro-Atlantic community is in the national interest \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas, past accomplishments notwithstanding, the citizens \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to face significant \n     challenges on their road toward further Euro-Atlantic \n     integration;\n       Whereas the Council of Europe's Venice Commission has \n     concluded that the current constitutional arrangements of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina are neither efficient nor rational, \n     and that the state-level institutions need to become more \n     effective and democratic if Bosnia and Herzegovina is to move \n     toward membership in the European Union;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said that \n     the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina need ``a stronger, \n     energetic state capable of advancing the public good'' and \n     pledged that the United States will remain a dedicated \n     partner to Bosnia and Herzegovina as it moves toward further \n     Euro-Atlantic integration;\n       Whereas leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina have already \n     agreed to significant reforms of the budget process, \n     intelligence services, criminal prosecution offices, justice \n     ministry, border and customs services, and defense sector;\n       Whereas, on November 22, 2005, political leaders of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina met in Washington and signed a Commitment to \n     Pursue Constitutional Reform in which members pledged to \n     continue working toward the creation of stronger and more \n     efficient democratic institutions;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``End Child Poverty Act''.\n\n     SEC. ___2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 13,000,000 children in the United States who \n     are younger than 18 live below the poverty line.\n       (2) Most parents of poor children are playing by the rules \n     by working to support their families. Despite their efforts, \n     many of these parents still cannot help their children get \n     ahead. Seven out of 10 poor children live in a working family \n     and 1 poor child in 3 lives with a full-time year-around \n     worker.\n       (3) Poor children are at least twice as likely as non-poor \n     children to suffer stunted growth or lead poisoning, or to be \n     kept back in school. Poor children score significantly lower \n     on reading, mathematics, and vocabulary tests when compared \n     with otherwise similar non-poor children. In more than half \n     of poor households with children in the United States, the \n     members of the households experience serious deprivations \n     during the year, including lack of adequate food, utility \n     shutoffs, crowded or substandard housing, or lack of needed \n     medical care.\n       (4) Over 8,000,000 children under age 18 in the United \n     States lack health insurance. With a 2004 uninsured rate of \n     18.9 percent, poor children are more likely to be uninsured \n     than children generally.\n       (5)(A) The members of 1 in 6 households with children in \n     the United States are hungry or on the verge of hunger, \n     largely due to inadequate household income.\n       (B) Hungry children--\n       (i) tend to lack nutrients vital to healthy brain \n     development;\n       (ii) tend to have difficulty focusing their attention and \n     concentrating in school; and\n       (iii) often have greater emotional and behavioral problems, \n     have weaker immune systems, and are more susceptible to \n     infections, including anemia, than other children.\n       (6) Child poverty has risen significantly, by 1,440,000 \n     since 2000.\n       (7) The poverty rate for children in the United States is \n     substantially higher than that in most other wealthy \n     industrialized nations.\n       (8) Children in the United States are more likely to live \n     in poverty than any other age group in the United States.\n       (9) African-American and Latino children are much more \n     likely to live in poverty than White children. One third of \n     African-American children are low-income, as are nearly a \n     third of Latino children.\n       (10) Great Britain made a public commitment to cut child \n     poverty in half in 10 years, and end child poverty by 2020, \n     and it has already successfully lifted 2,000,000 children out \n     of poverty.\n       (11) Poverty is a moral issue and Congress has a moral \n     obligation to address it.\n\n     SEC. ___3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to set a national goal of cutting child poverty in half \n     within a decade, and eliminating child poverty entirely as \n     soon as possible; and\n       (2) to establish a Child Poverty Elimination Trust Fund as \n     an initial measure to fund Federal programs to achieve that \n     goal.\n\n     SEC. ___4.

Mr. President, I rise to express my enthusiastic support \nfor Don DeGabrielle, an outstanding attorney and committed public \nservant who has been nominated by the President to serve as the U.S. \nattorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n  The Southern District of Texas is home to Houston, our Nation's \nfourth largest city. The district extends from Houston to the U.S.-\nMexico border, and includes the cities of Brownsville, McAllen, and \nLaredo--all of which are located on or near the border.\n  The position for which Don DeGabrielle is nominated has been vacant \nfor some time now. As my colleagues know, the U.S. attorney is each \ndistrict's chief Federal law enforcement officer. So it is critically \nimportant to the Department of Justice and to the people of the \nSouthern District that this vacancy be filled as soon as possible.\n  Don DeGabrielle is an outstanding selection for this post. He brings \nextensive and praiseworthy prosecutorial experience. Don DeGabrielle \nhas served the Southern District as an assistant U.S. attorney for the \npast 20 years--the last 4 as first assistant U.S. attorney. As first \nassistant, he was responsible for the day-to-day management of the \ndistrict, supervising an extensive criminal, civil, and appellate \ndocket.\n  Don DeGabrielle has unimpeachable credentials as a prosecutor. He has \ntried nearly 200 cases in both State and Federal courts, has been an \ninstructor at the National Advocacy Center, and has provided legal \ninstruction to Federal agents.\n  Don DeGabrielle's diverse experience includes a stint in 2001 as the \nResident Legal Adviser to the Republic of South Africa, where he \nadvised that nation's prosecutors and helped reorganize its Justice \nMinistry. Prior to his career as a prosecutor, he served as an FBI \nspecial agent in New Orleans and New York City.\n  In short, Don DeGabrielle's unique qualifications make this \nnomination a superb one. I am confident that he will serve this country \nwith distinction. And I am proud to support his nomination.\n\n\n                      nomination of amul r. thapar\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my great honor and privilege \ntoday to speak on behalf of Amul R. Thapar, the President's nominee to \nbe the next U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky. Mr. \nThapar is an outstanding man of great credentials and character. He has \nmany years of experience successfully prosecuting some of America's \nmost wanted criminals, and his confirmation will lead to a safer, more \njust Kentucky.\n  Mr. Thapar has served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Cincinnati \nsince 2002. In that position, he has managed the successful prosecution \nof a wide variety of Federal crimes, with an emphasis on public \ncorruption, homeland security, and violent crimes.\n  Mr. Thapar led the Southern Ohio Mortgage Fraud Task Force, which \nsuccessfully prosecuted approximately 40 perpetrators of mortgage \nfraud. Last year, he led the successful investigation and prosecution \nof a conspiracy ring to provide illegal aliens with fraudulent drivers' \nlicenses.\n  Mr. Thapar also served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney right here in \nWashington, DC, from 1999 to 2001. He went after violent criminals in \nthe District, and had a role in prosecuting the notorious ``Starbucks \nHomicides'' that happened in Georgetown several years ago.\n  For his excellence in public service, Mr. Thapar has been recognized \nby the Department of Justice, which honored him with a special \nachievement award; by the Postal Inspection Service, for his many \nsuccessful investigations of violent and white-collar crimes; by the \nSecret Service for his efforts to fight counterfeiting; and the FBI for \nhis campaigns against bank fraud and election fraud.\n  Mr. Thapar is an accomplished attorney in private practice as well. \nHe has worked as an associate at both the prestigious Squire, Sanders & \nDempsey law firm of Cincinnati and the Williams & Connolly law firm of \nWashington, DC. In both of those jobs, he managed and litigated complex \ncases on behalf of major corporations in both Federal and State courts.\n  Mr. Thapar has served as an adjunct professor at Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center, and until recently served as an adjunct \nprofessor at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, where he \ntaught Federal criminal practice. He has clerked for Judge Nathaniel R. \nJones of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and Judge S. \nArthur Spiegel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nOhio.\n  Even while managing such an impressive career, Amul still finds time \nto volunteer in his community. In 1995, he founded the Cincinnati \nchapter of the well-respected Street Law program. Street Law sends law \nschool students into underprivileged high schools to teach kids about \nthe basic underpinnings of our legal system, and the rights and \nresponsibilities inherent in being an American citizen. Hundreds of \nstudents have benefited from Amul's initiative, and the program is \nlarger and more successful than ever after 11 years.\n  Amul graduated from the renowned Boalt Hall School of Law of the \nUniversity of California after receiving his undergraduate degree with \nhigh honors from Boston College. In addition to his remarkable career \naccomplishments, Amul has a remarkable family, and I am sure his wife, \nKimberly, and his children, Zachary, Carmen and Nicholas, are very \nproud of him and all he has achieved.\n  The President has made the right choice by calling on Amul to serve \nthe people of Kentucky as the chief law enforcement officer for the \nState's Eastern District. Amul's entire career has prepared him for \nthis assignment. He has risen to the top of his field to become a \nstellar career prosecutor. He has gained valuable experience in \nhandling all types of cases. And, most importantly, he is a man of \nintegrity, intelligence, and spirit, who has a deep desire to seek out \njustice on behalf of those who deserve it.\n  I appreciate my fellow Senators' expeditious handling of Mr. Thapar's \nnomination, and I am confident he has the energy and the experience to \nexcel as Kentucky's next U.S. Attorney.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2048-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 399\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete, which \n     provided the Axis land war with its first major setback, \n     setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the \n     outcome of World War II;\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\n       Whereas the price for Greece in holding our common values \n     in their region was high, as hundreds of thousands of \n     civilians were killed in Greece during World War II;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was 1 of only \n     3 countries in the world, beyond the former British Empire, \n     that allied with the United States in every major \n     international conflict;\n       Whereas President George W.

The United States deeply appreciates the \n     role Greece is playing in the war against terror. . . . \n     America and Greece are strong allies, and we're strategic \n     partners.'';\n       Whereas President Bush stated that Greece's successful \n     ``law enforcement operations against a terrorist organization \n     [November 17] responsible for three decades of terrorist \n     attacks underscore the important contributions Greece is \n     making to the global war on terrorism'';\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested \n     over $10,000,000,000 in the region;\n       Whereas Greece was extraordinarily responsive to requests \n     by the United States during the war in Iraq, as Greece \n     immediately granted unlimited access to its airspace and the \n     base in Souda Bay, and many ships of the United States that \n     delivered troops, cargo, and supplies to Iraq were refueled \n     in Greece;\n       Whereas, in August 2004, the Olympic games came home to \n     Athens, Greece, the land of their ancient birthplace 2,500 \n     years ago and the city of their modern revival in 1896;\n       Whereas Greece received world-wide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympics of over \n     14,000 athletes from 202 countries and over 2,000,000 \n     spectators and journalists, which it did so efficiently, \n     securely, and with its famous Greek hospitality;\n       Whereas the unprecedented security effort in Greece for the \n     first Olympics after the attacks on the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, included a record-setting expenditure of \n     over $1,390,000,000 and assignment of over 70,000 security \n     personnel, as well as the utilization of an 8-country Olympic \n     Security Advisory Group that included the United States;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity \n     meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with \n     Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has had extraordinary \n     success in recent years in furthering cross-cultural \n     understanding and reducing tensions between Greece and \n     Turkey;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between these 2 nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas March 25, 2006, marks the 185th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution that freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate this \n     anniversary with the Greek people and to reaffirm the \n     democratic principles from which these 2 great nations were \n     born: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 25, 2006, as ``Greek Independence Day: \n     A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \n     Democracy''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2049-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROCESS \n                       IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 400\n\n       Whereas the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina (commonly referred to as the ``Dayton Peace \n     Accords'') was agreed to at Wright Patterson Air Force Base \n     in Dayton, Ohio, on November 21, 1995;\n       Whereas the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords was a \n     historic accomplishment that was made possible through the \n     strong leadership of the United States;\n       Whereas the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords ended a \n     brutal 3\\1/2\\-year conflict marked by aggression and genocide \n     in which many tens of thousands lost their lives;\n       Whereas the Dayton Peace Accords created a framework for a \n     common state in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but was crafted \n     amidst the exigencies of war and included many compromises \n     imposed by the need for quick action to preserve human life;\n       Whereas in the 10 years since the signing of the Dayton \n     Peace Accords, there has been considerable progress in \n     building a peaceful society in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       Whereas this progress in building a peaceful society has \n     been facilitated by both the citizens of the country and the \n     international community;\n       Whereas, during the 9 years that the peacekeepers of the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization worked to keep order in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, their forces suffered no intentional \n     casualties and never fired a single shot in combat;\n       Whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina has demonstrated a \n     willingness to contribute to the work of the international \n     community and sent 36 troops to assist in efforts to \n     stabilize the country of Iraq;\n       Whereas the full incorporation of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     into the Euro-Atlantic community is in the national interest \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas, past accomplishments notwithstanding, the citizens \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to face significant \n     challenges on their road toward further Euro-Atlantic \n     integration;\n       Whereas the Council of Europe's Venice Commission has \n     concluded that the current constitutional arrangements of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina are neither efficient nor rational, \n     and that the state-level institutions need to become more \n     effective and democratic if Bosnia and Herzegovina is to move \n     toward membership in the European Union;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said that \n     the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina need ``a stronger, \n     energetic state capable of advancing the public good'' and \n     pledged that the United States will remain a dedicated \n     partner to Bosnia and Herzegovina as it moves toward further \n     Euro-Atlantic integration;\n       Whereas leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina have already \n     agreed to significant reforms of the budget process, \n     intelligence services, criminal prosecution offices, justice \n     ministry, border and customs services, and defense sector;\n       Whereas, on November 22, 2005, political leaders of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina met in Washington and signed a Commitment to \n     Pursue Constitutional Reform in which members pledged to \n     continue working toward the creation of stronger and more \n     efficient democratic institutions; and\n       Whereas it is imperative that changes to the constitution \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina be agreed to by April 2006 to take \n     effect prior to national elections in October 2006: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is time for Bosnia and Herzegovina to work toward \n     the creation of a state with more functional, self-sustaining \n     institutions;\n       (2) any agreement on constitutional reform in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina should advance the principles of democracy and \n     tolerance;\n       (3) the constitutional reforms of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     should be consistent with, and bring the country closer to, \n     the goal of membership in the European Union;\n       (4) the United States supports the development of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina as a unified, fully democratic, and stable \n     state on the path toward Euro-Atlantic integration;\n       (5) all parties to negotiations on the reforms of the \n     Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina should work together \n     and seek compromises so that a first set of revisions to the \n     Constitution can take effect before national elections in \n     October 2006;\n       (6) all groups responsible for past violence and atrocities \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina must accept responsibility for \n     their actions and promote reconciliation among the different \n     ethnic groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and\n       (7) all levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina must \n     comply with the directives of the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), arrest persons \n     indicted for war crimes, and turn over fugitives to face \n     justice at the International Criminal Tribunal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/13/senate-section/article/S2049-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2049-S2050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REPUBLIC OF BELARUS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
