Mr. President, shortly there will be a debate on an \namendment that was offered on my behalf and a number of other \nDemocrats.\n  It is an amendment that would implement all 41 recommendations of the \nbipartisan 9/11 Commission.\n  The amendment would equip our intelligence community to fight \nterrorists. In effect, what it would do is go back to what we have been \ndoing for 27 years; that is, allow the Intelligence Committee every \nyear to have a bill before this body, to allow them to update what \nneeds to be done so they can proceed with intelligence activities in \nour country and around the rest of the world. We did not authorize the \nIntelligence Committee's work for the first time in 28 years last year. \nNow, this year, we have not done it again. This amendment would put \nthat in effect.\n  Third, the amendment would secure our ports, rails, roads, airports, \nchemical and nuclear plants, and mass transit systems.\n  Fourth, the amendment would refocus America on the war on terror. I \nwent into that in some detail yesterday.\n  Fifth, the amendment would provide better, updated tools to bring \nterrorists to justice.\n  Finally, the amendment would change course in Iraq. Certainly that is \nsomething the American people deserve and want.\n  Yesterday in Iraq, 65 Iraqis were found dead, a number of them \nbeheaded, one with a note saying: Anyone that cooperates with \nAmericans, this is what is going to happen to them. In addition to \nthat, scores of others were killed in bombing incidents around the \ncountry. Two American soldiers were killed.\n  So the amendment would change course in Iraq. Americans deserve real \nsecurity. This bill is real security. The amendment is real security. I \nask colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, may I proceed?\n\n[[Page S9450]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. You may.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the President pro tempore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9450-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9450-S9452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NSA WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the National Security Agency has been \nwiretapping the conversations of Americans without obtaining court \norders, as required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or \nFISA, for the past 5 years.\n  In recent months, a number of bills have been proposed which would \ncodify the President's program of warrantless surveillance. The White \nHouse is now pushing the Senate Judiciary Committee to pass sweeping \nlegislation that would amend FISA and grant the President unprecedented \nauthority to undertake wiretapping in the United States without the \njudicial scrutiny currently required by law.\n  For Congress to legislate on this program in the coming days would \nnot only be premature but irresponsible.\n  The fact remains that despite repeated assurances from the \nadministration, Members of Congress remain in the dark and cannot \nanswer fundamental questions about the program's existence, \neffectiveness or legal justification.\n  As one of the few Members who have received the most detailed \ninformation to date. I can tell you that, putting aside the legal \nargument, the administration has not been able to document convincingly \nthe counterterrorism benefits of the program.\n  In fact for the past 6 months, I have been requesting, without \nsuccess, specific details about the program including how many \nterrorists have been identified, how many arrested, how many convicted, \nand how many terrorists have been deported or killed as a direct result \nof information obtained through the warrantless wiretapping program.\n  I can assure you, not one person in Congress has the answers to these \nfundamental questions.\n  At the same time, let me be perfectly clear, I support all efforts to \ntrack down terrorists wherever they are using all of our best \ntechnology and resources. But it can and must be done legally and in a \nway that protects the rights of all Americans.\n  For 4\\1/2\\ years, the President had restricted knowledge of this \nprogram to the top leaders of the Senate and House and the two top \nleaders on the congressional Intelligence Committees.\n  By limiting the briefings to 2 of the 15 Intelligence Committee \nmembers, the White House had sought to prevent the committee from \nconducting the legally required oversight of the NSA program.\n  Because of this restriction on access to the program, the committee \nhas been effectively prevented from knowing about the program, \nevaluating the program, and acting on the program.\n  Frankly, I believe the White House goal of the past 5 years has been \nto use the iron cloak of secrecy to keep Congress ignorant of and \npowerless to challenge a controversial program of suspect legality.\n  The repeated representations by the President and senior \nadministration officials that the warrantless wiretapping program was \nand is subject to extensive congressional oversight are simply \noutrageous.\n  Entire committees, not individual Senators, report out legislation \nthat authorizes and funds intelligence collection programs. The full \nSenate, not individual Senators, takes action to approve or reject this \nlegislation.\n  The White House wanted a warrantless wiretapping program that was \nexempt from the scrutiny of both the courts and the Congress, even if \nit meant ignoring the legal requirements of FISA and the National \nSecurity Acts and shattering what had been decades of responsible, \nbipartisan congressional oversight of intelligence programs. Why?\n  Administration officials have stated that the fact that the NSA was \ncollecting the communications of suspected terrorists coming in or out \nof the United States without a court's determination that probable \ncause existed was simply too sensitive to disclose to the other Members \nof Congress intimating that the congressional Intelligence Committees \ncould not keep aspects of the program classified.\n  I would remind this administration that the Intelligence Committee is \nentrusted on a daily basis with the secrets that if disclosed would \nirreparably harm our national security, compromise multibillion-dollar \ncollection programs, and even get people killed.\n  There are 15 members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and many \nmore of my colleagues who at an earlier time served on the committee.\n  All Senators, by right of their elected position and the duties they \nare sworn to carry out have access to the details of these highly \nclassified collection programs.\n  It is a sobering responsibility but members of our committee and the \nSenate as a whole have protected these secrets because each of us \nunderstands what is at stake.\n  In fact, as someone who has been briefed on the NSA wiretapping \nprogram, I can assure may colleagues that the sensitivity of the \nprogram pales in comparison with other intelligence activities our \ncommittee oversees on a routine basis.\n  My colleagues should be troubled by the fact that the only NSA \nintelligence collection program that the White House has directed be \ndescribed in detail publicly is also the only NSA program the White \nHouse continues to withhold from the full Senate.\n  I want my colleagues to consider the implications of this carefully.\n  At a time when terrorism is the No. 1 threat to America's security, \nthe White House has decided that Congress cannot be trusted with the \njob of protecting our citizens.\n  Instead of working with Congress, the President decided with an \nalmost imperial disdain to ignore the constitutional role the \nlegislative branch plays in providing for the National defense.\n  It wasn't until March 9 of this year, and after enormous pressure, \nthat the administration agreed to allow five additional committee \nmembers and three staffers to be briefed into the program.\n  Another 2 months would pass before the White House agreed with our \nrequest that the entire committee membership be apprised of the \nprogram's operations.\n  However, contrary to public statements in recent months by the \nPresident and Vice President that Congress is being fully briefed, I am \ndismayed to report that this administration continues to pursue its \npolicy of depriving the Congress the information it needs to understand \nand evaluate the NSA program's legal underpinnings, operational \nconduct, and usefulness in identifying and arresting terrorists.\n  On February 23, 2006, I wrote to NSA Director GEN Keith Alexander, \nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales and Director of National Intelligence \nJohn Negroponte requesting documents and information about the NSA \nprogram, including the Presidential orders authorizing the program, \nlegal reviews and opinions relating to the program, procedures and \nguidelines on the use of information obtained through the program, and \nspecifics about the counterterrorism benefits of the program.\n  This letter was followed up with a second more refined request on May \n15 of 54 items based on briefings the committee had recently received.\n  The May letter repeated my earlier request for basic documentation \nand information, such as the Presidential authorization orders, which \nare essential in order for the Intelligence Committee to fully \nunderstand and thoroughly evaluate the NSA program, a necessary step \nbefore considering whether legislation relating to the program or \namending FISA is needed.\n  Over 6 months have passed since I sent my original February letter \nand the Intelligence Committee has not received the requested \ninformation.\n  During this time, I and my staff director repeatedly raised the issue \nof the delinquent replies with White House and administration \nofficials, including a direct appeal I made to Director Negroponte in \nJuly.\n  Six months and no response from the administration. This is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Three days after I met with Director Negroponte and expressed my \nconcerns about the lack of a response to the February and May requests \nfor documents and information, the Intelligence Committee received a \nfax from the NSA's Office of General Counsel forwarding ``a set of \nadministration-approved unclassified talking points for members to \nuse.''\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\n  The cover page of the fax included comments indicating that the \ntalking points were prepared in response to questions from committee \nmembers about what could be said publicly about the NSA program.\n  When I read the talking points, I was stunned to find that the NSA \nprovided political talking points.\n  Instead of providing the requested assistance in delineating what is \nand what is not classified about the program, the talking points \ncontain subjective statements intended to advance a particular policy \nview and present the NSA program in the best possible light.\n  Instead of providing the committee with the documents and information \nrequested a half year earlier and allowing the committee to complete \nits own review of the NSA program and to draw its own independent \nconclusions, the administration preferred telling committee members \nwhat to think and what to say.\n  The administration-approved talking points encouraged Senators to \nmake statements such as ``I can say that the Program must continue; It \nis being run in a highly disciplined way,'' and ``There is strict \noversight in place both at NSA and outside, now including the full \ncongressional committees.''\n  The talking points also argue for changes to FISA claiming ``Current \nlaw is not agile enough to handle the threat'' and ``The FISA should be \namended so that it is technologically neutral.''\n  These statements were intended to advocate the White House policy \nline rather than provide guidance on classification.\n  Even before the intelligence committee can finish its own review of \nthe NSA program the administration attempted to use the members of the \nintelligence committee--the only committee witting of the program's \ndetails--as mouthpieces to parrot conclusive statements in support of \nWhite House policy.\n  These talking points are the latest examples of how the \nadministration has co-opted an agency of the intelligence community to \nkeep information from Congress in support of a controversial policy or \nprogram. Our committee has run into this disturbing practice with \nrespect to the administration's program for the detention, \ninterrogation and rendition of individuals suspected on involvement \nwith terrorism as well.\n  The White House's unwillingness to provide requested information to \nthe Congress on the detention and interrogation program for many years \ncreated a void in congressional oversight, eventually filled by the \ncourts and the Hamdan decision earlier this year.\n  In this case, the administration took the calculated risk that it \ncould go it alone, without working with Congress, and they guessed \nwrong.\n  Now faced with a court decision not to its liking, the White House is \ncoming to Congress seeking a legislative remedy.\n  Evidently, the administration has failed to learn the lessons of this \ngo-it-alone approach.\n  The documents I requested of the NSA, Justice Department, and Office \nof the DNI 6 months ago have been withheld at the direction of the \nWhite House.\n  The administration is trying to run out the clock on my requests in \nthe hopes that Congress can be manipulated to pass legislation this \nsession authorizing a program it does not fully understand.\n  At the same time, a simple request of the NSA to detail what is and \nis not classified about the warrantless surveillance program is forced \nto go through the White House and, as a result, turned into a litany of \nadministration P.R. statements.\n  I and six other members of the Intelligence Committee wrote to NSA \nDirector Alexander last month expressing our concerns over the \nappropriateness of these administration-approved talking points and \nobjecting to the requirement that the NSA must clear with the White \nHouse any requested information about its own program before it is sent \nto Congress.\n  We also asked that Director Alexander review this incident and \nprovided the committee in writing an explanation of by whom and on what \nauthority these talking points were prepared, who approved of their \ndistribution to members of the Intelligence Committee, and who made the \ndecision that they should be cleared by the administration prior to \nbeing provided to committee members.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe administration-approved NSA talking points, faxed to the \nIntelligence Committee on July 27, 2006, the August 29, 2006, letter to \nNSA Director Gen. Alexander signed by me and Senators Levin, Feinstein, \nWyden, Bayh, Mikulski, and Feingold, and the September 1, 2006, \nresponse from General Alexander.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: Alonzo Robertson, Office of General Counsel.\n     Date: 27 July 2006.\n     To: Hon. Pat Roberts, Chairman, SSCI.\n       During recent Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) \n     briefings, a number of members have expressed a desire to \n     know what they can say about the TSP. Attached is a set of \n     Administration approved, unclassified talking points for the \n     Members to use.\n       We would appreciate it if you would distribute to the \n     Members.\n                                                 Alonzo Robertson.\n\n Talking Points for Intelligence Committee Members To Use on Terrorist \n                          Surveillance Program\n\n       The terrorist threat to this country is real. We need to do \n     everything possible to make our nation safe, and we need to \n     do it in a way that preserves our civil liberties.\n       As a member of an intelligence committee of Congress, I am \n     fully committed to that goal. We are the watchdogs of the \n     Intelligence Community, including the National Security \n     Agency that is carrying out the Terrorist Surveillance \n     Program.\n       I have been briefed on the Program and stood on the \n     operations floor at NSA to see first-hand how vital it is to \n     the security of our country and how carefully it is being \n     run.\n       It would be irresponsible to reveal details because that \n     would give our adversaries an advantage. My colleagues and I \n     are very serious about protecting our nation's secrets.\n       I can say that the Program must continue. It has detected \n     terrorist plots that could have resulted in death or injury \n     to Americans both at home and abroad.\n       It is being run in a highly disciplined way that takes \n     great pains to protect U.S. privacy rights. There is strict \n     oversight in place, both at NSA and outside, now including \n     the full congressional intelligence committees.\n       The Program is not ``Data mining''; it targets only \n     international communications closely connected to al Qa'ida \n     or an affiliated group.\n       I have personally met the dedicated men and women of NSA. \n     The country owes them an enormous debt of gratitude for their \n     superb efforts to keep us all secure.\n       Current law is not agile enough to handle the threat posed \n     by sophisticated international terrorist organizations such \n     as al Qa'ida. This is because the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978, or ``FISA,'' has not kept pace with \n     communications technology and was not designed for the types \n     of threats we now face.\n       Today, in part because of technological changes over the \n     last 30 years, the FISA frequently requires judicial \n     authority to collect the communications of non-U.S. persons \n     outside the United States. This clogs the FISA process with \n     applications for court orders that have little to do with \n     protecting U.S. privacy rights.\n       The FISA should be amended so that it is technology \n     neutral. This would return it to its original purpose of \n     focusing FISA privacy protections on Americans in the United \n     States. It would greatly improve the FISA process and relieve \n     the massive amounts of resources currently being consumed.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 29, 2006.\n     Gen. Keith B. Alexander,\n     Director, National Security Agency,\n     Fort George Meade, MD.\n       Dear General Alexander: If our intelligence agencies are to \n     be successful in their mission, it is vitally important that \n     they maintain their independence. It is the National Security \n     Agency's (NSA) duty to make sure that policymakers and \n     military leaders are presented with accurate, objective \n     intelligence information. If the NSA, or any other \n     intelligence agency, enters a policy debate, it risks the \n     loss of policymakers' confidence and could compromise the \n     agency's effectiveness. That is why we were so troubled by \n     talking points that members of the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence recently received from the NSA.\n       The talking points at issue related to the NSA warrantless \n     surveillance program and were accompanied by a cover page \n     from the NSA's Office of General Counsel. The cover page \n     included comments indicating that the talking points were \n     prepared in response to questions from Committee members \n     about what could be said publicly about the NSA program. \n     Instead of providing assistance in delineating what is and is \n     not classified about the program, the talking points contain \n     subjective statements that appear intended to advance a \n     particular policy view\n\n[[Page S9452]]\n\n     and present certain facts in the best possible light.\n       The talking points include statements such as ``I can say \n     that the Program must continue''; ``It is being run in a \n     highly disciplined way''; and ``There is strict oversight in \n     place, both at NSA and outside, now including the full \n     congressional oversight committees,'' The talking points also \n     argue for changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act (FISA) claiming ``Current law is not agile enough to \n     handle the threat'' and ``The FISA should be amended so that \n     it is technological1y neutral.'' These statements appear \n     intended to advocate particular policies rather than provide \n     guidance on classification.\n       As you know, the Congress is currently evaluating various \n     aspects of the NSA program. The Senate Intelligence Committee \n     is in the process of gathering information to understand \n     operational aspects of the program, and the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee has held public hearings related to the program's \n     legal foundations. Several pieces of legislation dealing with \n     this program and the FISA have been introduced in the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives.\n       The future of the warrantless eavesdropping program and any \n     proposed changes to the FISA are policy matters currently \n     being considered in the political arena. We understand the \n     Administration has a certain point of view regarding this \n     program. The program is, however, the subject of \n     consideration in the Congress.\n       We believe that it is inappropriate for the NSA to insert \n     itself into this policy debate. In addition, we are \n     particularly troubled by the statement on the cover page that \n     the document is ``Administration approved, unclassified \n     talking points for Members to use.'' We object to an \n     intelligence agency, such as the NSA, clearing documents such \n     as these with the Administration prior to providing them to \n     the Congress.\n       We also would note that the administration has failed to \n     provide the Committee with documents and other basic \n     information we need to conduct the strict oversight of the \n     NSA program that the NSA talking points suggest is happening.\n       We ask that you review this incident and provide the \n     Committee in writing, no later than September 8, 2006, an \n     explanation of by whom and on what authority these talking \n     points were prepared, who approved of their distribution to \n     members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and who made \n     the decision that they should be cleared by the \n     Administration prior to their being provided to Committee \n     members. We also ask that your response describe steps you \n     intend to take to ensure that all NSA employees understand \n     the importance of NSA maintaining its independence from \n     policy debates.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n     Jay Rockefeller.\n     Evan Bayh.\n     Russell D.

Meade, MD, 1 September 2006.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     Vice Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Vice Chairman Rockefeller: I appreciated the chance to \n     talk with you yesterday about the concerns you raised in your \n     letter of 29 August 2006 pertaining to a set of talking \n     points on the President's Terrorist Surveillance Program \n     (TSP) that NSA provided to the full Senate and House \n     intelligence committees. I regret that our effort was \n     misperceived as political.\n        As I stated on the phone, my intent was to respond to \n     requests from intelligence committee Members who visited the \n     Agency to oversee the TSP. They cited constituent concerns \n     and asked what they could say publicly about the Program, and \n     we wanted to be as helpful as possible. Because we are an \n     Executive Branch agency, it is standard practice that NSA \n     coordinated the talking points with the Department of \n     Justice, National Security Council staff, and the Office of \n     the Director of National Intelligence. We were especially \n     concerned that nothing we gave out could or would be \n     construed as classified.\n       I again assure you that we intended our effort to be \n     apolitical. We are proud of our people, and our talking \n     points reflect the pride in our service to our nation. I want \n     to emphasize that NSA will not permit political \n     considerations to taint our intelligence information.\n       If you have any questions, please call me or Michael \n     Lawrence, Director of Legislative Affairs.\n\n                                           Keith B. Alexander,\n\n                                    Lieutenant General, U.S. Army,\n                                                    Director, NSA.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is clear to me that the \nadministration's withholding of documents is designed to hamper the \nIntelligence Committee's review of the NSA program. Up to this point, \ninformation provided to the committee in briefings held since March has \nbeen filtered and generalized through charts and slides.\n  My attempts to obtain original documents, such as the Presidential \nauthorizations, and to ask questions that go beyond these \nadministration-approved briefings have been ignored.\n  This refusal to respond to legitimate information requests from the \nOversight Committee, combined with the administration's over-\nrestriction of member and staff access to the NSA program, is part of a \ncynical White House strategy to prevent Congress from either acting or \nforcing it to legislate on vital national security and privacy issues \nin the dark.\n  Twenty of the 100 currently serving Senators have been briefed on the \nNSA program at one point or another in the past 5 years. The White \nHouse currently allows only three members of the Intelligence Committee \nstaff--two Republican staffers and one Democrat--to have access to the \nNSA program.\n  By contrast, there are well over a thousand employees at the NSA, \nCIA, FBI, Justice Department, Office of DNI, Pentagon and White House \nbriefed into the NSA program.\n  I want my colleagues to take note of this disparity. Twenty Senators \nand three staffers compared with over a thousand executive branch \nemployees.\n  If, in the remaining weeks of this session, the full Senate is asked \nto consider legislation to revise FISA or authorize aspects of the NSA \nwarrantless surveillance program, it is untenable--if not \nunprecedented--to keep four-fifths of the Senate ignorant of why the \nchanges are justified or what intelligence activities they are \nauthorizing.\n  The Senate should insist that all Members be allowed to understand \nthe NSA wiretapping program--with the appropriate care being taken to \nprotect the remaining classified aspects not already acknowledged by \nthe President--and be given the chance to draw their own conclusions \nabout whether it is justified.\n  Finally, General Hayden and others have publicly stated that no legal \nconcerns have been raised within the administration about the operation \nof the NSA program. Limited information presented to the committee \ncontradicts this assertion. But the committee has been prevented from \nunderstanding the details and context of these internal debates about \nthe program's legality due to the administration's stonewalling.\n  I urge my colleagues--we must insist on a full accounting of the \nNSA's ongoing 5-year program before acting on legislation that gives \nthe President the authority to wiretap the phone conversations of \nAmericans where a court has not determined that a probable cause \nstandard has been met.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak for 8 minutes and ask the \nChair to give me the signal when I have used that time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 16\\1/2\\ minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9452-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9452-S9454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNITY IN THE WAR ON TERROR\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am really delighted, after some of the \nthings I have read and heard this morning. I decided last night to make \nthe speech I am about to make. This morning, I want to go back to the \nspeech the President made on Monday evening and go back to the \nPresident's clarion call for us to unite as a nation behind our effort \nto win the war on terror.\n  During the past 3 days--first Monday, September 11, where we all \nhonored and mourned the tragic loss of 3,000 citizens, through today--I \nhave read constant editorials and listened to numerous speeches that \nimply to me that that sense of unity doesn't really exist. I think the \nPresident was right to call for unity.\n  This morning I rise in an effort to have us focus on what we are \nreally all about, not to point fingers or castigate anybody but to talk \nabout what I believe is the ultimate war between good and evil. What \nhappened on September 11 in 2001 was one of the most tragic events in \nthe history of mankind. What the United States did, and what this \nPresident declared, by changing our policy from one of reaction to one \nof preemption was precisely the right thing to do. There is no doubt \nthat in the last 5 years mistakes have been made. But there is no doubt \nthat the greatest mistake would have been not to respond. It is now \ntime for us to resolve to support this country, our men and women in \nharm's way, our intelligence agencies, with a resolve to see\n\n[[Page S9453]]\n\nit through to its conclusion, understanding that it is going to be a \nlong and difficult battle.\n  We should not forget that the Cold War lasted half a century. As a \nyoungster at R.L. Hope Elementary School in Atlanta, GA, I remember \nevery week we practiced climbing under our desks as we did drills \nbecause we feared a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. It was only \nwhen the Berlin Wall came down in the 1990s and communism was finally \ndefeated that the Cold War ended.\n  This war could be as long and as difficult. But it is different. We \nfight an enemy with no uniforms, no diplomats, and no capital. It \ndoesn't want what we have. They don't want us to have what we have. \nThey don't want us to have the freedom of speech--for me to do what I \nam doing here--or for the press to criticize it. They don't want you to \nbe able to bear arms if you are a law-abiding citizen or to go to \nchurch on Saturday or Sunday and worship or to not worship at all or \nthe way you want. They don't want you to have the freedom to assemble \nand gather.\n  They are using those very inalienable rights of ours against us today \nand, in some cases, some of us are unwitting accomplices in that \ncriticism. By way of example, we argue and parse about issues of \ninterrogation and some issues of intelligence and surveillance, when \nevery day that we fail to act the other side uses that against us to \ntry to find a way to break us and kill American citizens. How else in \nthe 21st century, in a world of computers and digital technology and \ncellular technology, can we track terrorists if we cannot listen to \nthem? How in the world can we learn about those who would kill innocent \nAmericans if we cannot interrogate them?\n  There was an editorial in the Monday paper, September 11, 2006, 5 \nyears after 9/11, in my hometown paper, the Atlanta Constitution. It \nsaid, ``Power is found in our ideals not in our weapons.'' That is a \ngreat headline. They are right. One of the great ideals that the \nAmerican people have is that we don't quit. We didn't quit in our \nrevolution or in our Civil War or in World War I and World War II, and \nwe cannot quit now. In this editorial, criticizing us in terms of \nGuantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, who is the moral authority quoted? None \nother than Osama bin Laden. The man that is quoted as questioning \nAmerica's values is the man that relishes cutting off the heads of \ninnocent American citizens, the man who takes pride in calling out and \ncharging terrorists with attacking American citizens on 9/11, and the \nman who to this very day plots to kill innocent Americans.\n  We must listen to what they are saying, track what they are doing. \nWhen we capture them, we must get the intelligence necessary to save \ninnocent lives. We must unite as a country, a media, political parties, \nand as a people to stand steadfastly behind this effort and see it \nthrough to conclusion.\n  I personally submit that we are getting pretty close. I think the \nfact that they are concentrating in Baghdad, the fact that we have seen \nwhat we have seen in terms of them trying to portray a civil war is \nbecause we have had them on the run and it is their last stand. You \nsee, terrorism doesn't have to beat us on the battlefield. They only \nhave to make us quit and come home. Then they can declare victory. We \ncannot let that happen.\n  I conclude my remarks by admonishing all of us, myself included, to \njoin together to find solutions to move forward and support this effort \nto its conclusion and to its success. We should not tie the hands of \nour Armed Forces or our intelligence networks behind their backs. We \nshould instead put our arms around them and embrace them, let them \ncharge ahead and continue to track our enemies wherever they are and \nfind out the information that is necessary. Then, and only then, will \nwe be equalized in the war on terror and ultimately prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 10\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Isakson from \nGeorgia, in calling for the ceasing of this politicizing of a very \nimportant effort and the need to unify as a nation. As we commemorate \nthe fifth anniversary of 9/11, I was reminded of how far we have come \nsince that terrible day in securing America's homeland against future \nattacks, and how much further we have left to go.\n  I am thankful to be part of a Republican majority that is taking real \naction to make America safer, to secure our borders first, to \nstrengthen port security with background checks for workers and scan \nevery cargo container at our busiest ports for weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  President Bush and a Republican-led Congress have also shown \nrelentless determination in the war against radical Islamic terrorists \nall around the world.\n  We prevented further attacks by uncovering and stopping 15 major \nterrorist plots against America and likely many others which are not \npublic knowledge. We have frozen $1.5 billion in terrorists' assets in \nthe United States through economic sanctions. We have implemented 37 of \n39 recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. And we have liberated more \nthan 50 million Afghans and Iraqis from despotism, permitting the first \nfree elections in either country.\n  Just this week, the Senate took another important step to keep \nAmerica's families safe by voting unanimously to pass the WARN Act, an \nimportant piece of legislation that will modernize our severely \noutdated emergency alert system using everyday technology such as cell \nphones and Blackberrys.\n  Meanwhile, and unfortunately, Democrats are trying to kill the port \nsecurity bill by tying it up with political amendments--once again \nproving that they are willing to put their hope of winning an election \nahead of the security of our country.\n  Unfortunately, during this election year, many of my Democratic \ncolleagues seem more interested in posturing and pointing fingers than \nin putting forward serious proposals about how to deal with the ongoing \nterrorist threat. They accuse President Bush and Republicans of being \nsatisfied with the status quo. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The Republican-led Congress has actively fought to secure America's \nhomeland by funding critical ongoing needs of our troops and by \nincreasing funds for border security, while Democrats have blocked \ncommonsense efforts such as stopping the catch-and-release program for \nillegal immigrants which encourages more and more illegal immigration \nin this country.\n  The Democrats have blocked, or tried to block, the renewing of the \nPATRIOT Act, but we have been able to pass it despite the Democratic \nleader's claims to have killed it.\n  The Republican Congress is defending the use of military intelligence \nand law enforcement resources that have led to the capture of many of \nal-Qaida's top leaders and have helped to degrade al-Qaida's \ncapabilities around the world. But these very techniques were \ncriticized by my distinguished Democratic colleague this morning on the \nfloor. We have to use the technology available to us to track \ncommunications, to stop financing of terrorism around the world, and if \nwe don't we put our country at risk.\n  The Republicans have supported strong nominees for critical national \nsecurity and foreign policy positions, such as U.N. Ambassador John \nBolton, despite Democratic obstruction.\n  Again, despite continued Democratic obstruction, Republicans will \ncontinue to push a comprehensive agenda to secure America's homeland \nthat will strengthen our borders with additional border agents, enforce \nimmigration laws with worker verification, secure our ports with worker \nbackground checks, and support surveillance to find and stop terrorists \nbefore they strike.\n  What is the Democratic plan? The latest Democratic plan to secure our \ncountry is to complain about Donald Rumsfeld, to send a letter to the \nPresident telling him to do things in Iraq that have already been \nimplemented and, as we heard this morning, to complain about the \nlistening or tracking of phone calls from known terrorists.\n  I can't put it any better than my good friend, the Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. Mitch McConnell, who recently said while talking about \nDemocrats' cut-and-run strategy:\n\n       The Democratic leadership finally agrees on something--\n     unfortunately, it's retreat.\n\n  Whether they call it redeployment or phased withdrawal, the effect is \nthe\n\n[[Page S9454]]\n\nsame: they would leave Americans more vulnerable and Iraqis at the \nmercy of al-Qaida, a terrorist group whose aim toward Iraqis and \nAmericans is clear.\n  If Democrats spent half as much time fighting terrorists as they do \nthis administration, America would win this war a lot faster.\n  Democrats claim to be the only ones who care about what Americans \nthink, but Americans can see through their posturing. Compassionate \nrhetoric without a real plan for action is nothing more than an empty \npromise.\n  Republicans are committed to securing our homeland and have backed up \nthat talk with action. Like my colleague, Senator Isakson, I invite my \nDemocratic colleagues to join us in honoring the sacrifice of those who \nhave already given their lives for freedom by providing real hope and \nsecurity for all Americans instead of just partisan rhetoric.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, September 12, \n2006, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, first I would like to point \nout the cosponsors. Senators Talent, Leahy, Obama, Durbin, Dayton, \nSchumer, and Clinton have all asked to be original cosponsors of my \namendment.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 4954 that will provide \nmuch needed emergency relief to farmers, ranchers, and small businesses \nin rural America that today and for some time have been suffering the \ndevastating impacts of natural disasters, such as the long-running \ndrought in my home State of Nebraska.\n  A few years ago, I named the drought ``David'' to make the point that \na drought is a natural disaster just like hurricanes--although it seems \nto be in slow motion--or floods or tornadoes and should be treated by \nCongress in much the same way because they are disastrous. Congress \nprovides emergency relief to those who have suffered through \ndevastating hurricanes, and there is no excuse for not helping farmers, \nranchers, and businesses suffering from this natural disaster.\n  Unfortunately, in parts of Nebraska, Drought David is celebrating its \nseventh birthday, and yet Congress has failed to provide relief. I \nbelieve this relief must be addressed before Congress heads home for \nthe elections, and I believe it should be addressed this week. That is \nwhy I am offering my amendment.\n\n  Ordinarily, I wouldn't offer an amendment to the port security bill \nbecause I certainly want to support that. But because of the lack of \nother opportunities and the increasing need for relief, I am faced, \nalong with my cosponsors and others who will join me, with the \nrecognition that there aren't many opportunities. And waiting until \nafter\n\n[[Page S9455]]\n\nthe election just doesn't seem appropriate. I thank Senator Conrad for \nhis tireless efforts to get disaster assistance legislation passed \nthrough the Senate and for his work to draft and introduce the \nEmergency Farm Relief Act of 2006 that is the basis for this amendment.\n  Every time I check the U.S. Drought Monitor--and we can take a look \nat Drought David on this chart--showing where and how severely this \ndrought is affecting the rural parts of America, I see the entire \nCentral United States, as my colleagues can note from this \ndemonstration, is suffering from drought conditions that are \ncategorized as severe, extreme, or exceptional, including the western \ntwo-thirds of Nebraska, which is currently suffering from severe to \nextreme drought, Nebraska being located right here.\n  In the Dakotas the same thing is true, and dropping down to Texas and \nmoving east, we find that the entire central part of our country is \nunder these extreme to severe drought conditions.\n  So there is a great need for this relief. Recently, in my State of \nNebraska, Professor Brad Lubben at the University of Nebraska released \na report on the drought's impact on Nebraska's farmers and ranchers. He \nconcluded that as of August 2006, this year, the drought has cost \nNebraska agriculture a total of nearly $342 million--not much money by \nsome measurements in Washington, DC, but extraordinary in the State of \nNebraska. He found that the drought has thus far caused $98 million in \ncrop losses, mostly wheat; $1 million in additional irrigation costs; \nand about $193 million in livestock production losses which have been \nincurred as well due to pasture and range conditions that are \nsubstantially below average. Grazing losses in western Nebraska are \nestimated to be from 50 percent to 70 percent. Pretty simple: no grass, \nno grazing, cattle losses.\n  The 2006 production year is not yet complete, so we don't know the \nfinal impact this will have on corn, soybeans, and sorghum, but I have \nseen many fields that are devastated by this drought and many farmers \nwho have been given the go-ahead to cut their crop for silage rather \nthan corn production.\n  Congress and the rest of Washington must understand this problem is \ncritical and recognize the need to address the devastating impact our \nfarmers and ranchers have suffered.\n  This comprehensive package provides emergency funding to farmers and \nranchers who have suffered weather-related crop production shortfalls, \nquality losses, and damage to livestock and feed supplies. The bill \nalso helps farmers overcome losses as a result of energy prices that \nspiked during last year's hurricanes--certainly an incident our \nPresiding Officer knows very well.\n  The bill would also expand funding for the Emergency Conservation \nProgram, some of which could be made available for rehabilitating grass \nand ranch lands in places such as western Nebraska and, I would \nimagine, in the Dakotas as well that were damaged from recent \nwildfires.\n  I recently toured some of the drought-stricken regions of western \nNebraska, including Lake McConaughy which for so long has been called \nBig Mac but which now is, unfortunately, less affectionately referred \nto as Little Mac, and the communities that had been devastated by the \nwildfires last month. When I visited firefighting officials, emergency \nresponse coordinators, and community leaders, I asked them how we could \nhelp. This amendment will provide some meaningful and immediate \nassistance to Nebraskans who lost so much in these fires.\n  Recognizing the devastating impact the disasters have had on Main \nStreets all over rural America, the amendment also provides assistance \nfor thousands of small businesses simply fighting to keep their doors \nopen. When farmers and ranchers have inadequate income, obviously it \nimpacts the Main Street of that community. Lower purchasing power, \nlower sales, and fighting to keep doors open is an obvious result. \nDrought affects related businesses such as feed lots, grain dealers, \nimplement dealers, and even local store fronts that service rural \ncommunities. Drought doesn't just destroy farms, it economically \ndamages our rural communities and businesses.\n  Now, I know we are discussing port security, as I said before. So, \nordinarily, I wouldn't offer this amendment as a part of that bill, but \nI am offering it at this time because it is needed, and Congress needs \nto accomplish this before it leaves at the end of the month.\n  My question is a very simple one: If not now, when? If not now, when?\n  Our farmers and ranchers cannot wait. The devastating impact of \nDrought David threatens to drive many of our farmers and ranchers in \nrural communities and businesses out of operation, and without them we \ncannot expect to secure our food supply and we cannot expect to \ncontinue to grow our domestic alternative fuel supplies, which is such \na critical part of our own fuel security in America today. When \nagriculture suffers, the opportunities for alternative fuels such as \nbiofuels will suffer as well. That is why we need to do this.\n  If we fail to act and by our inaction we allow farmers and ranchers \nand rural businesses to dry up under the impact of this drought, then \nwe have failed to ensure both our food and fuel security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first I thank very much the Senator from \nWashington for her courtesy, and the Senator from Maine as well. I will \nbe very brief.\n  I also recognize my colleague from Nebraska for his leadership and \nthank him publicly and personally for offering this amendment right \nnow. Normally, I would never join in offering this amendment on port \nsecurity, but this involves the food security of the country, and this \nhas now become a critical matter in our part of the Nation. We just had \na drought rally yesterday with farmers from all across America, joined \nby 14 Senators, on a fully bipartisan basis, and joined by my State's \ngovernor and joined by Members of the House of Representatives from the \nheartland of the country as well.\n  The message was clear and consistent: It is imperative that Congress \nact now. If there is a failure to act, literally thousands of farm \nfamilies will be forced off the land. That is how acute this crisis has \nbecome. By scientific measure, they now tell us this is the third worst \ndrought in the Nation's history.\n  The extraordinary irony is that last year in my State we had massive \nflooding--flooding that prevented 1 million acres from even being \nplanted. I note the occupant of the Chair represents the State of \nLouisiana which suffered so dramatically from Hurricane Katrina. Those \nof us outside that area agreed to help and support disaster assistance \nbecause it was clearly needed, and we were pleased to step forward and \noffer our assistance. I might say to the occupant of the Chair and to \nothers who are listening: Now we have suffered as a result of a \ndisaster. It is different. It is not as dramatic, but for those \naffected, it is every bit as dire. I say to my colleagues, this is one \nof the worst situations I have seen in my lifetime in the State of \nNorth Dakota.\n  Last year, here is what the headlines said all across the State: \n``Heavy Rain Leads To Crop Diseases.'' ``Area Farmers Battle Flooding \nAnd Disease.'' ``Beet Crop Could Be Smallest In Ten years.'' ``Crops, \nHay Lost To Flooding.'' ``Rain Halts Harvest.''\n  It was a devastating year. As a result, last year I offered disaster \nlegislation that formed the basis of this amendment. I updated that \nlegislation on Wednesday of last week. We now have 20 cosponsors in the \nSenate on a fully bipartisan basis saying this legislation is needed, \nit is needed urgently, and it is needed now.\n  This is a picture from last year of a farmstead in North Dakota \ncompletely surrounded by water. I know these are remembrances to the \noccupant of the Chair of what happened in his own State of Louisiana. \nAgain, we would be quick to acknowledge the disaster in the Gulf States \nis more dramatic, more far-reaching, but this is national legislation. \nThis wouldn't just help those of us hurt by flooding last year and \ndrought this year; this would help all those wherever they are situated \nwho have suffered from a natural disaster.\n  This year, as the Senator from Nebraska just demonstrated, this is \nwhat\n\n[[Page S9456]]\n\nthe Drought Monitor shows: Right down the center of the country, a very \npersistent and extreme drought. In fact, they have a schedule that goes \nfrom abnormally dry to moderate drought to severe drought to extreme \ndrought to exceptional drought, exceptional drought being obviously the \nmost extreme. And you can see the core of the exceptional drought is \nright in the heartland of America. But we are not alone because we can \nsee areas of exceptional drought right down the center of the country, \nall the way over to the State of Arizona. Not only did we have \nextraordinary drought, we had the most incredible summer of extreme \ntemperatures that I have ever seen in my lifetime, culminating on July \n30 in my hometown when it reached 112 degrees--112 degrees. I went to a \ncorn farm south of Bismarck, ND, that was irrigated--irrigated corn. We \nstripped the corn of its husk and the ears weren't filling, even though \nthey were putting tens of thousands of gallons of water on that field a \nday. Why not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a farm field in North Dakota. This \nis supposed to be a cornfield. You can see there is nothing there; it \nis devastated. This is widespread in my State.\n  This picture is from Grant County, an alfalfa field, and you can see \nit is in a Moon state. There is nothing there.\n  Let me just conclude by saying to my colleagues, this is an urgent \nmatter. This is a response to a disaster. If we fail to act, the \nbankers of my State have told me we will lose 5 to 10 percent of the \nfarmers and ranchers in my State. South Dakota is worse, and this \ndisaster goes right down the center of our country. The time to act is \nnow.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4936\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, earlier today in morning business, the \nDemocratic leader spoke in favor of the amendment that he has brought \nto the Senate floor which we will vote on shortly this afternoon. I \nrise in opposition to Senator Reid's amendment.\n  Mr. President, this is Senator Reid's amendment, and this is the port \nsecurity bill. I can barely hold up the 507 pages of the Democratic \nleader's amendment. It is an interesting hodgepodge of provisions that \nare irrelevant to the underlying bill--to port security. It includes \nprovisions that have already been rejected by the Senate. It includes \nprovisions that have already been enacted by the Congress and signed \ninto law. It includes provisions that have just recently been passed by \nthe Senate and added to the port security bill.\n  What it does not include are provisions that have to do with port \nsecurity. This proposal, 507 pages, includes 37 pages of findings, 16 \nsenses of Congress, and no fewer than 95 reports, certifications, and \ndeterminations.\n  Let me tell my colleagues a bit about what is actually in Senator \nReid's amendment. Let's go first to the category of provisions which \nhave already been rejected by the Senate. Let me give two examples. The \nlegislation includes, word for word, the exact same language regarding \nthe involvement of the United States in Iraq that was soundly rejected \nby the Senate by a vote of 39 to 60 in June of this year. This is the \nlanguage that calls for a phased redeployment of U.S. forces in Iraq. \nIt has nothing to do with port security, and it is legislation that \nthis body has already thoroughly considered and voted against.\n  Let me give a second example of provisions of the Reid amendment on \nwhich the Senate has already spoken. The Reid amendment contains a \nfirst responder funding formula amendment that is almost identical to \nthe one the Senate rejected earlier this year by a vote of 32 to 65. \nIndeed, the sponsor of this amendment voted against the formula change \nhe has included in this bill, as did a total of 25 Democratic Senators, \nthe majority of the Democratic caucus. It is not surprising that they \ndid, for if the Reid amendment were to pass, 34 States would lose money \nfor homeland security activities. It is also ironic that the funding \nformula included in Senator Reid's amendment is an implicit endorsement \nof the funding allocation decisions that were so widely and correctly \ncriticized earlier this summer.\n  This bill would give the Department of Homeland Security additional \ndiscretion in allocating homeland security funds. We know what happened \nwhen we gave the Department additional discretion. The outcome was not \na good one.\n  I mentioned that the amendment also includes provisions that have \nalready been signed into law. Let me give an example. Mr. President, \n105 pages of this 507-page amendment have to do with implementing the \n9/11 Commission's recommendations on foreign policy and public \ndiplomacy. The proposals outlined in that section of Senator Reid's \namendment were signed into law as part of the Intelligence Reform Act \nof 2004. They are almost exactly the same as title VII of the \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004. Why do we need to repeat this? It is \nalready law. How does enacting it a second time somehow improve our \nnational security? It makes no sense.\n  Let's move to the third category; that is, provisions in this \namendment which have already passed the Senate. There are many good \nexamples of that, but let me just cite two. They have to do with the \nrail security and mass transit security amendments which we have \nalready adopted.\n  Senator McCain's rail security amendment was adopted very early in \nthe debate on this bill. The proposal offered by Senators Shelby and \nSarbanes last night is identical to the mass transit security \nprovisions in the Reid amendment. Since those two amendments have \nalready been included in the bill, why would we want to do it all over \nagain?\n  I think what most disturbs me about Senator Reid's proposal is that \nit is clearly a partisan amendment that has been offered to a bill, the \nport security bill, that has been bipartisan every step of the way, \nfrom conception to introduction to committee consideration to the floor \ndeliberations. Port security is so important. I know the Presiding \nOfficer understands that well, coming from Louisiana. We have gone to \ngreat lengths to make sure that the port security bill was bipartisan.\n  Patty Murray has been the leader on this bill on the Democratic side. \nSenator Lieberman worked hard on it in the Homeland Security Committee. \nNorm Coleman, Senator Coleman, on our side of the aisle, worked with \nSenator Levin to investigate port security programs.\n  Even in the House, this has been a completely bipartisan--indeed, a \nnonpartisan--effort, with the legislation being authored by \nRepresentatives Dan Lungren and Jane Harman.\n  At every step of the consideration, this has been a bipartisan bill. \nWhen it went through the Homeland Security Committee, it was \nbipartisan. In the negotiations with the Commerce Committee and the \nFinance Committee, it was bipartisan. It is very unfortunate that we \nare now having a blatantly partisan amendment offered to a bill that I \nhad hoped would be the exception to the rule, a bill we could enact in \na bipartisan manner, because it is so important that we act without \ndelay.\n  As I indicated, from the very beginning of the discussions on this \nbill, from the hearings, through the committee markups, through visits \nto ports around the country, it has always been bipartisan. Let's not \nweigh this bill down with partisan amendments. Instead, let's get the \njob done and send this bill, a bipartisan bill, to the President for \nhis signature without delay.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time on this side.\n  Mr. DeMINT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who yields time to the \nSenator from South Carolina?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield time to the \nSenator from South Carolina, depending on how much time he needs.\n  Mr. DeMINT. About 5 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. That will be fine. I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4970\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4970.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the calling up of the \namendment?\n\n[[Page S9457]]\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues for unanimous consent \nthat following the remarks by Senator DeMint, I be recognized for 6 \nminutes on the time remaining on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Reserving the right to object, I would like to see a \ncopy of the amendment. We may not object, but I would like to see a \ncopy of the amendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I will speak on the amendment and we will \ncall it up once the copies are available to the minority, if that is \nOK?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today, obviously, in support of \namendment No. 4970 which we will distribute in a moment. The Maritime \nTransportation Security Act of 2002 required the Transportation \nSecurity Agency, which we call TSA, to develop a biometric security \ncard for port workers to limit access to sensitive areas within a \nseaport. To satisfy this law, TSA is developing a transportation worker \nidentification credential which we call a TWIC card. The law requires \nthat the Secretary of Homeland Security issue a card to an individual \nrequesting one unless determination can be made that they pose a \nterrorism threat. However, it should trouble Americans that the law \nspecifically allows those who have been convicted of a felony more than \n7 years prior to their application or have been released from \nincarceration 5 years prior to their application to be eligible for a \nTWIC card. This standard is too lax and must be strengthened. DHS \nofficials need clear rules that prevent those convicted of serious \nfelonies from obtaining access to our secure port areas. My amendment \ndoes just that. It takes the standards the TSA uses for airport workers \nwith access to secure areas and applies them to maritime port workers.\n  Let me make that clear. The exact same standards that are used in our \nairports for workers are in this amendment to apply to transportation \nworkers at our port. Just like the TSA airport safety regulations, my \namendment automatically bars those convicted of serious felonies, which \nare listed in this amendment, including crimes of violence, fraud, \nbribery, and terrorism, from being allowed to obtain one of these \ntransportation cards.\n  TSA's airport rules have successfully kept felons out of the airport \nworkforce, and it is time we do the same for our seaport workforce. \nBecause of the gravity of the threat facing our ports, we cannot afford \nto roll the dice by hiring convicted felons. The stakes are too high.\n  When setting policies that will keep our transportation system \nsecure, we are continually told by experts that we must identify and \nreduce risk in every situation possible. This amendment will prevent \nhigh-risk individuals from having access to our most sensitive port \nareas.\n  Keep in mind, felonies are serious crimes that are punishable by \nincarceration or death. This amendment is not aimed at so-called \nyouthful offenses or individuals who have received several traffic \ntickets. My amendment also does not take away the current ability of \nthe Secretary of DHS to grant a waiver for exceptional cases. Felons, \nthrough their previous criminal activity, are more likely to be \npersuaded to look the other way when a suspect shipment comes through \nthe port. This suspect system could contain a variety of dangerous \nitems--dirty bomb, weapon, contraband to sell that would help finance \nterrorist operations, just to name a few. Someone who will commit \nextortion, fraud, or traffic in drugs should not be trusted to protect \nthe security of our maritime cargo. While felons do need a second \nchance, it should not come at the expense of an extremely vulnerable \npart of the U.S. port infrastructure.\n  I know some people may object to my amendment by saying that \nlongshoremen might be criminals but they are not terrorists. I do not \nbelieve longshoremen are criminals, by the way, but that is why we need \nto allow DHS to focus on crimes that specifically relate to terrorism. \nWhile it may be true that many of the criminals working in our ports do \nnot wake up with the intent to promote terrorist activity, this does \nnot mean they do not pose a terrorist security risk. What I and many \nothers fear is that convicted felons could pose a security terrorist \nrisk by working with those criminals associated with trying to sneak \ndrugs or stolen goods into this country. It might actually turn out to \nbe 50 grams of plutonium instead of 50 grams of cocaine that could be \nused as a dirty bomb that would poison--kill thousands of people, or \nmaybe it is not part of a dirty bomb or chemical weapon. Maybe it is \njust ordinary contraband which could be used to help fund terrorist \nactivity in the United States.\n  Some others think it is too expensive to automatically exclude \nindividuals who have committed one of these serious felonies from \nworking in our ports.\n  To those objecting colleagues I would say: please detail to us which \none of the airports in their State these offenders should be working \nat, because the list of felonies we use was lifted right from the same \nlist the TSA uses for airports.\n  Another argument I have heard is that we are not going to have enough \npeople to work in our ports.\n  This is an exaggeration. The fact is, the TWIC card will be rolled \nout and workers who need to have access to the secure area will apply \nfor the TWIC card. As a practical matter, felons know who they are, and \nthey know that they will not be issued a TWIC card. The likely effect \nis that they will never apply for a card in the first place. The local \nunion will immediately notice that a number of its workers are not \napplying for TWIC cards. They will then have the opportunity to reach \nout to their communities and find new union members to fill the spots.\n  Logistically, this is not a huge challenge. The port of Charleston \nhas 2,000 longshoremen working there. If severe criminality, as \noutlined under the amendment is rampant within the workforce and is at \nthe high level of 10 percent--which is nearly double the national \naverage for incarceration at one point in their lifetime of 6.6 \npercent--that would only mean that they would need to replace 200 \nworkers in the whole port of Charleston.\n  The bottom line is this applies the same protection to seaports that \napplies to airports. The current TWIC regulatory regime writes their \nsecurity regulations to fit their workforce. It should be the other way \naround. The workforce regulations should be written to meet their \nsecurity needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask we call up the amendment and have it read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment and calling up this amendment? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment 4970:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the issuance of transportation security cards to \n         individuals who have been convicted of certain crimes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I allowed the amendment to be read because \nour critics have already suggested that this amendment would include \nminor offenses. I will challenge critics of this bill to point out \nwhich of these felonies they would like transportation workers in our \nports to be able to commit. It makes absolutely no sense for us to \nspend literally hundreds of millions of dollars as a nation to protect \nthe security of our airports and our ports if we allow the workers who \nare using this scanning equipment for these inspections to be of a \ncriminal nature.\n  I thank the manager for allowing me to offer this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-six minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4945\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nemergency agricultural disaster assistance package. At the outset, I \ncommend my colleague, Senator Kent Conrad, for having taken the \nleadership role in making sure we are taking care of the needs of \nfamily farmers and ranchers across America. I also congratulate Senator \nNelson for his leadership on this issue this morning.\n  Last night, as America went to sleep, much of America--the farmers \nand ranchers who bring us the food security in this country--continued \nto work way into the night. I can assure you that across this country, \nwhere those combines are running until 11 or 12 or 1 o'clock in the \nmorning, those farmers are working. Today probably starting at about 3 \nor 4 in the morning, there were many farmers who were out there trying \nto bale their hay with the leftover dew from the nighttime, making sure \nthey were baling what was left in a way that would bring them the \nmaximum production. While the rest of America slept, America's farmers \nand ranchers were working very hard to make sure that the food security \nof this country was, in fact, maintained. As those farmers and ranchers \nwent home to get a few hours of sleep, what was probably on their minds \nwas whether their family farm or ranch was going to be there the \nfollowing year and whether they were going to be able to pay off their \noperating lines of credit for the mortgage payments at the local bank.\n  The fact is, rural America is in trouble. Farmers and ranchers are \nvery much in trouble because of two factors which have been totally out \nof their control for the last couple of years. One of them is drought \nand the other is the high cost of fuel. Those two factors combined \ncreate a disaster emergency that is unfolding across America today.\n  On this picture to my left, you will see a cornfield in Kit Carson, \nCO, which turned completely brown because of the severe drought in my \nState. This drought we see going on in Colorado has had this kind of \neffect not only this year but for the last 7 years. Colorado is now in \nits seventh year of a very severe drought that will have a very major \nimpact on the opportunities and the economies related to these farmers \nand to the farm community.\n  Second is the high cost of fuel which has affected most Americans. \nThe fact is that most Americans are upset by the very high cost of fuel \nwe are paying. Farmers and ranchers consume a tremendous amount of gas \nand diesel as they operate these machines all across the farms in \nAmerica. Today, farmers are paying twice as much as they were 2 years \nago for the cost of fuel. Yet, during that same timeframe, the cost of \nthe produce we have from these farms and ranches does not increase very \nmuch.\n  We are facing a disaster emergency which is very much going to affect \nall of rural America.\n  I hope all of my colleagues in the Senate will join us in passage of \nthe emergency agricultural disaster assistance package. I am also \nhopeful that we can sound a loud drumbeat that will be heard all the \nway to the White House, all the way to President Bush because he needs \nto send a signal that he is going to stand up for rural America and \nthat he is going to support us as we try to bring emergency assistance \nto the farmers and ranchers of America.\n  The last time we passed a similar bill in the Senate, it was killed \nin the House, frankly, because it did not have the support of the White \nHouse. Rural voters who gave support to President Bush ought to be \nknocking on the door of the White House and making sure the President \nunderstands that rural America is important and that this disaster \nemergency package is very important as well.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4936\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to spend the remainder of my time speaking on \nbehalf of and in support of the Real Security Act which was offered by \nSenator Reid. The fact is, this legislation is a very important piece \nof legislation as we look forward to creating the safest America we \npossibly can.\n  The fact is that 5 years after 9/11, we are not yet safe in America. \nWe know our ports are not secure. We know law enforcement does not have \nthe training they should have. I would imagine most Americans frankly \ntoday are feeling that we are not living in a secure world as we were 8 \nor 9 or 10 years ago and that our world has continued to become \nincreasingly dangerous.\n  The components of the legislation that was set forth by Senator Reid \nare simple steps to move us in the right direction in creating greater \nsecurity for the people of America here in our homeland. Very simply, \nthe legislation first and foremost implements the recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission has been heralded as perhaps \nthe most successful commission in the last 50 years in America. It \nhandled a very important question of how can we make America safe. It \ncame up with a series of recommendations. Many of those recommendations \ntoday, some 4 years later, have not yet been implemented.\n  The first point that has been made with the Real Security Act is we \nwill implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  Second, the amendment also equips our intelligence community to fight \nagainst terrorists. For the first time in 18 years, this Republican-\ncontrolled Congress has failed to pass the Intelligence authorization \nbill that would give the CIA the resources to conduct aggressive and \neffective intelligence gathering. Senator Rockefeller has eloquently \nspoken to this issue. It is an abysmal neglect of duty on the part of \nthe United States of America and its Government if we don't reauthorize \nthe intelligence act as has been done in the past 28 years.\n  Third, the amendment as proposed by Senator Reid will make sure we \nare investing additional money to secure our ports, our rails, our \nroads, our airports, our chemical and nuclear plants, and mass transit \nsystems. We only need to look at what has happened in the United \nKingdom and in Spain and\n\n[[Page S9459]]\n\nother places to know that our rails, our mass transit systems, and our \nports are, in fact, not at all secure today.\n  Fourth, we would refocus America on the war on terror by making sure \nwe continue to pursue Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.\n  Fifth, the amendment would provide better updated tools so we can \nbring these terrorists to justice. Five years after 9/11, there are \nstill hundreds of terrorists who need to be prosecuted and brought to \njustice. We can't afford to wait any longer.\n  Finally, the amendment would, in fact, bring about a new \nunderstanding of how we ought to move forward with the war in Iraq.\n  I believe strongly that the Real Security Act which has been proposed \nby Senator Reid should be supported by our colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding time to \nme.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last Thursday I introduced a bipartisan \nresolution urging the President to take immediate action to avert a \nlooming tragedy in Darfur, Sudan. I urge the Senate to pass it today. \nThe Government of Sudan has launched an all but military offensive in \nDarfur that could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths. The United \nStates must lead the international community to save those lives. It is \nurgent that we act.\n  Over the past 2 years the situation in Sudan has remained dire. As \nmany as 400,000 people have died. Two million people have been \ndisplaced from their homes, over 200,000 are refugees in Chad, and 3 \nmillion rely on international aid. Those numbers haven't diminished \nover time, they have gotten worse. And now, they may be on the brink of \nbecoming even more catastrophic.\n  In May of this year, the Government of Sudan and rebels in Darfur--\nspecifically the Minni Minawi faction of the Sudan Liberation Army--\nsigned a peace agreement. Tragically, instead of improving the security \nsituation, the Darfur Peace Agreement has made things worse.\n  The agreement never had the support of the entire SLA, or the other \nmajor rebel movement in Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement. Nor \ndid it have the support of people living in displaced persons camps in \nDarfur. In the days and weeks after news of the agreement spread, \nviolence in camps increased either because people misunderstood what \nwas in the agreement, or they felt the agreement was flawed. And \nviolence on the ground became worse, as the rebel factions split and \nfighting erupted between those who had signed the Darfur Peace \nAgreement and those who had not.\n  Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in fighting since \nMay--50,000 in the last 2 months alone. Many of them have taken refuge \nin camps for the internally displaced. Attacks on humanitarian aid \nconvoys have increased by a factor of more than 10 compared to this \ntime last year. Twelve humanitarian workers have been killed in the \npast 4 months--more than during the entire previous year. Two hundred \ninternally displaced women have been raped and another 200 violently \nassaulted over the course of the past 5 weeks.\n  The United Nations, after months of delay, finally extended the \nmandate of the U.N. Mission in Sudan--UNMIS--to Darfur at the end of \nAugust. And, through U.N. Security Council Resolution 1706, it \nauthorized the deployment of over 17,000 peacekeepers and 3,000 \ncivilian police to Darfur.\n  However, the Government of Sudan has categorically rejected the \ndeployment of the U.N. force. In fact, the Sudanese Government has \nlaunched a military offensive in the region. Khartoum has sent over \n10,000 troops to Darfur and has resumed aerial bombardments. Seven \nvillages--villages, not military targets--were bombed just this \nweekend. African Union officials have stated that they will not extend \nthe mission in Sudan past the end of this month. I understand that the \nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council will meet in New York on \nSeptember 18, just before the U.N. General Assembly meeting takes \nplace. But it is unclear if the AU will reverse its decision to \nterminate its mission in Sudan. If it does terminate it, ``Katey, bar \nthe door,'' all the carnage going on now will be increased multifold.\n  Even if the impediments I just mentioned did not exist, it would be \nmonths--we are talking January--before a U.N. mission could fully \ndeploy, so we need the AU to stay in place a while longer.\n  In the mean time, Khartoum is doing its level best to be sure that no \nU.N. force comes to Darfur. The Government of Sudan's tactic seems to \nbe to scorch enough earth--and people--such that there will be no need \nfor the peacekeeping force because there will be no one left to protect \nand no peace to keep.\n  At this point in time, right here today, we are at a pivotal moment. \nHundreds of thousands of Sudanese are in camps, vulnerable to aerial \nand ground attacks from government forces. We cannot stand by and do \nnothing.\n  This resolution is very straightforward. It calls on the President to \nundertake three key actions, some of which the Senate has asked him to \ndo before:\n  First, it once again calls on him to pursue the imposition of a no-\nfly zone through the U.N. NATO or NATO allies. The Senate asked the \nPresident to propose that NATO consider how to implement and enforce \nsuch a no-fly zone in March of this year. If anything the need to \nenforce a no-fly zone has increased.\n  Second, it asks that the President secure the necessary support from \nUnited Nations member states to schedule a special session on Sudan in \nthe United Nations Human Rights Council. The international community \nmust speak out on the atrocities which continue to unfold in Sudan--and \nit must act.\n  Third, it asks the President to appoint a Special Envoy to Sudan to \nhead the office that Senator DeWine and I established at the State \nDepartment through the supplemental appropriations bill signed into law \nin June. The administration has avoided naming a Special Envoy to Sudan \nfor years, and our diplomatic efforts have suffered as a result.\n  I am under no illusion that these actions alone will stop the \nSudanese Government's murderous actions in Darfur. The international \ncommunity must put a credible international force on the ground as soon \nas possible. NATO should be prepared to help the AMIS hand-off to the \nUnited Nations. The U.S. should impose targeted financial, travel, and \ndiplomatic sanctions against the Sudanese leadership, rebel forces, and \nothers determined to be responsible for the atrocities and pursue the \nimmediate imposition of similar sanctions by the U.N. Security Council \nand the European Union as called for by U.N. Security Council \nResolutions 1556 and 1564. It is long past time for the Security \nCouncil to take such action. If the Council cannot act because of \nthreats of a Russian or Chinese veto, then the United States and Europe \nshould do so together.\n  I visited the camps across the border in Chad. It is an absolute \ntragedy. There are tens of thousands of people in that one camp alone, \nwith no real protection. When the appropriate time comes I will \nintroduce this resolution. I hope it meets the approval of my \ncolleagues. I hope the President will listen.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for yielding me this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4962\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n Assistance Act to authorize the President to carry out a program for \n    the protection of the health and safety of residents, workers, \n               volunteers, and others in a disaster area)\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up amendment No. 4962.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio, [Mr. Voinovich] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4962.\n\n\n[[Page S9460]]\n\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, September 12, \n2006, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Disaster Area \nHealth and Environmental Monitoring Act, an amendment to the port \nsecurity bill.\n  This legislation is vital because it provides for the monitoring of \nthe health and safety of individuals exposed to harmful substances as a \nresult of a presidentially declared disaster. The Senate passed this \nbill by unanimous consent in the 108th Congress, but jurisdictional \ndisagreements between committees in the House caused it not to be \npassed in the House.\n  This issue first came to my attention during a series of Environment \nand Public Works Committee hearings in 2002 when we learned of the \nsevere health problems facing thousands of workers and volunteers who \nheroically responded to the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World \nTrade Center. Perhaps some of my colleagues saw the ``60 Minutes'' \nsegment this last Sunday that examined the problem in depth.\n  I will never forget Joe Allbaugh, 3 months after September 11, before \nthe committee. I asked him: What have you found out about what folks \nwere exposed to, those who were first responders?\n  And he said: I can't get the information.\n  This bill would give the President the right to immediately go in and \ndo the investigation to determine what these folks were exposed to.\n  One of the things that we also did was discover that these first \nresponders did not have the opportunity to have a screening. We were \nable to get $14 million set aside to do screening of first responders.\n  In the case of Ohio--we had one of the first responding units there--\nwe found a variety of health problems, including respiratory illness, \npneumonia, asthma, and many faced the possibility of long-term health \nissues.\n  I am deeply saddened to note the recent passing of New York City \nPolice Detective James Zadroga, a rescue worker at the World Trade \nCenter, whose tragic death was directly caused by his exposure to toxic \nfumes and dust at Ground Zero.\n  Currently, the Federal Emergency Management Agency does not hold the \nauthority to conduct the necessary long-term monitoring of health \nimpacts following environmental exposures in the wake of a disaster.\n  In 2003, Federal funding helped establish the World Trade Center \nWorker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program at Mount Sinai Hospital \nand the University of Cincinnati. I have already referred to that. At \nleast way afterwards we started doing the screening to let the folks \nknow what they were subjected to. According to the findings, almost 70 \npercent of the World Trade Center responders had a substantially worse \nrespiratory system following their work at the World Trade Center. \nAmong the responders who were asymptomatic before September 11, 61 \npercent developed respiratory symptoms while working at the World Trade \nCenter.\n  In addition to that assistance at Ground Zero, OTF responded to the \nneeds of communities around the country faced with the aftermath of \nnatural disasters. OTF sent responders to Florida following Hurricane \nDennis in July of 2005 and to Louisiana and Mississippi following \nHurricane Katrina in August of 2005.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the need for public health \nmonitoring became clear. The CDC and EPA have identified 13 \nenvironmental health issues confronting first responders, including \ndrinking water, wastewater, solid waste, debris and soil contamination \nfrom toxic chemicals. It is vital this legislation is enacted to \naddress any health care needs that arise for the thousands of first \nresponders who are active on the gulf coast. S. 1741 authorizes the \nPresident, if he determines that substances of concern have been \nreleased in a federally declared disaster area, to activate a program \nin a Federal partnership with appropriate medical institutions for the \nprotection, assessment, monitoring, and study of the health and safety \nof individuals.\n\n  The act also would direct Federal agencies to enter into a contract \nwith the National Academies of Sciences to study and report on disaster \narea health protection and monitoring.\n  It is extremely important we take care of these individuals because, \nas I stated in past hearings, whether people volunteer to be first \nresponders depends on how we treat the first responders at the World \nTrade Center, the gulf coast, and other disaster areas. If they are not \ngoing to be able to find out immediately what they have been exposed \nto, and the President has the authority to get in there and find out \nwhat it is, we will have more and more people reluctant to come to the \nhelp in other disasters in the country.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill which \nis cosponsored by 16 of our Senate colleagues. It is strongly supported \nby the first responder community.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for this opportunity to share why it \nis important we get it passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4936\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Reid amendment, the \nReal Security Act, offered as an amendment, and I rise to say a word \nabout the amendment offered by Senator Nelson today which Senator \nConrad and I and many others have worked on and support, dealing with \nfarm disaster aid.\n  First, let me talk about this issue, the Real Security Act. I know \nthere are some who say this is an omnibus piece of legislation offered \nas an amendment; it is moving too quickly. I don't think the U.S. \nCongress has ever been accused of speeding. I don't think we ever ought \nto be worried about moving too quickly. My concern with respect to \nsecurity in this country is that we move too slowly.\n  The issue of one, two, or three areas in which we deal with the \nsecurity of this country--we do it here, there, elsewhere--over a month \nor two, a year or two, or 5 years, there is a lot to be done, and it \nneeds to be done in an omnibus way, in a way that is organized.\n  That is what my colleague, Senator Reid, has offered, the Real \nSecurity Act, which we have worked on in its various pieces for a long \ntime.\n  Let me describe why we need something like this and why this is a \ngood place to begin discussing it. The fact is, it is 5 years after \nSeptember 11. We just had the commemorative anniversary of that \nterrorist attack against our country in which thousands of Americans \nwere murdered. We still have a circumstance where in many areas first \nresponders cannot speak to each other. Firefighters, police officers, \nand so on are not able to communicate with each other. In the event of \na future terrorist attack my hope is we have compatible communications.\n  My colleague offers an amendment that deals with a whole range of \nissues, including emergency preparedness, response, communications, \nborder security, increasing the number of special forces, safeguarding \nnuclear materials, and increasing the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram. He describes in this amendment a new approach with respect to \nrail security and mass transit security, as well as aviation security.\n  As an aside, I point out that we have a situation with respect to \naviation security that I know is very difficult for this country, for \nthe traveling public, and for the airlines. There is no question we \nunderstand what the terrorists did. The terrorists used some box \ncutters and an airplane loaded with fuel to run into buildings. Both \nthe World Trade Center attacks and the Pentagon were low-tech attacks. \nMy understanding was that attack on September 11 cost around $500,000, \nwith 19 people, some box cutters and some hijacked airplanes.\n  We have a lot to do with respect to trying to understand where the \nnext attack might come from and how to foil that attack. I commend all \nof those who have been working in these areas who have been successful \nin uncovering conspiracies and uncovering potential attack plans \nagainst our country and\n\n[[Page S9461]]\n\nfoiling those plans. They deserve our undying thanks. We need to say to \nthem: Stay on the job. Continue to do that excellent work.\n  We also need to give them the tools. The Reid amendment offers those \ntools in a wide range of areas--the tools that will equip our first \nresponders, the tools that will equip our intelligence community, the \ntools that will equip our soldiers. For example, there is a provision \nin the Reid amendment that talks about the funding necessary for new \nlanguage capabilities in the Middle East and Asian languages in our \nintelligence communities. Yes, we are doing some of that, but we are \nnot doing as much as we could.\n  This amendment is an omnibus amendment that, in my judgment, moves in \nthe right direction. As I said before, I know those who say it does too \nmuch, the danger is not that we are doing too much in Congress, the \ndanger is we will do too little. With respect to this issue of real \nsecurity, this Congress, this Senate, would be well advised to accept \nthis amendment.\n  I read in the paper this morning a congressional colleague on the \nother side of the aisle in the other body said:\n\n       I wonder if Democrats are more interested in protecting \n     terrorists than in protecting the American people?\n\n  That is a pathetic political statement not worthy of much response, \nexcept to say this: All Members in this Chamber care about this \ncountry. All in this Chamber are Americans who want to protect this \ngreat country of ours. There is a barrel full of politics around this; \nI understand that. When you read what I read in the paper this morning \nby someone from the other body, it is pretty pathetic.\n  What we ought to do, it seems to me, is not worry about trying to \nmove too fast. Let's worry we are not moving fast enough. Let's embrace \nthis Reid amendment and have a debate on it and add this to the port \nsecurity bill and we will have done this country a significant amount \nof good work in protecting America's future.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4945\n\n  I take a couple of minutes to say I strongly support the agricultural \ndisaster piece offered as an amendment by Senator Nelson. I have twice \noffered an agricultural disaster piece that has gone through the full \nSenate. We have gone to conference two times. In both circumstances, \nonce last December and once this spring, we lost it because the \nPresident threatened to veto it and the House conferees would not \naccept it as a result of that Presidential veto threat.\n  I will just show three charts very briefly. This is a soybean field \nthat is supposed to be about a foot high at this point. There is almost \nnothing growing. This is a man from my State. He is walking in a creek \nbed. The creek is dry. We have suffered a devastating drought. When \nfarmers lose everything, when they have no crop, when their pasture is \ngone and it looks like a moonscape, when they have to send their cows \nto market because there is nothing for a cow to eat, that is a \ndisaster.\n  This country goes all over the world: You have trouble, let us help; \nwe want to help you. Good for us. That is a good value system. How \nabout doing that at home? When farmers and ranchers lose everything, \nhow about us saying: We want to help you. We want to extend a helping \nhand.\n  We have not done that yet because the President has threatened a \nveto. I hope the President will work with us rather than against us and \ndecide it worthy to help Americans who are in trouble.\n  So my colleague, Senator Nelson, has offered an amendment on this \nbill. My colleague, Senator Conrad, and I, and many others have worked \nin a bipartisan way. This is not a partisan issue in the Senate. We \npassed it twice on a bipartisan basis. I hope we will add this \namendment to this underlying bill as well. I hope in between now and \nwhen it gets to the White House the President will understand the \nurgency of this situation.\n  Times change. Things change. The fact is, these folks need help. We \nhave a responsibility to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment is laid aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4975\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a Homeland Security and Neighborhood Safety \nTrust Fund and refocus Federal priorities toward securing the Homeland, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4975.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since I only have 2 minutes--and I am not \ngoing to ask for a vote on it now--my amendment talks about the dirty \nlittle word no one wants to talk about: How are we going to pay for all \nthis? The fact is, we are arguing over peanuts. The fact is, we should \nset up a trust fund as we did with the violent crime trust fund. We \nshould fund everything everyone knows we need to fund here, all those \nelements the 9/11 Commission called for, plus reinstating local law \nenforcement.\n  The whole cost of that would be less than 1 year--1 year--of the tax \ncut for people making over $1 million. My amendment sets up a trust \nfund, has $53 billion put into that trust fund, displaced over 5 \nyears--$10 billion a year--to pay for all we are doing here.\n  Rich folks are just as patriotic as poor folks. It instructs the \nFinance Committees to go out and find the means by which they would \ndeal with that, take it 1 year or take a piece of it over 5 years.\n  The bottom line is, this is crazy. We are talking about all that we \ndo not have. We are passing amendments like the Biden-McCain amendment \nor the McCain-Biden amendment on rail. We know it is never going to be \nfunded. We know the cost is about $50 billion to fund what we all need. \nYet, at the same time, we are spending three times as much on a tax cut \nas we are spending on how we are going to do it.\n  This is only for people making over $1 million. Again, I floated this \nwith millionaires. I have been with groups who are millionaires. I have \nasked them: Would you object to giving up 1 year of your tax cut?\n  The response is: No, if you guarantee me it is going to go to provide \nfor security.\n  This amendment would guarantee that, set up a trust fund. For those \nwho are skeptical about trust funds, let me remind you, we did it with \nthe violent crime trust fund. It worked, and it reduced crime. We \nshould step to the plate and say how we are going to pay for it.\n  Everyone in this body knows that we are not yet safe enough. \nIndependent experts, law enforcement personnel, and first responders \nhave warned us that we have not done enough to prevent an attack and we \nare ill-equipped to respond to one.\n  Hurricane Katrina, which happened just over a year ago, demonstrated \nthis unfortunate truth and showed us the devastating consequences of \nour failure to act responsibly here in Washington.\n  And, last December, the 9/11 Commission issued their report card on \nthe administration's and Congress's progress in implementing their \nrecommendations. The result was a report card riddled with D's and F's. \nAnd, to add to this, the FBI reported earlier this summer that violent \ncrime and murders are on the rise for the first time in a decade.\n  Given all of this, it is hard to argue that we are as safe as we \nshould be. To turn this around, we have to get serious about our \nsecurity.\n  If we establish the right priorities, we can do the job. We can fund \nlocal law enforcement, which the President has attempted to slash by \nover $2 billion. We can give the FBI an additional 1,000 agents to \nallow them to implement reforms without abandoning local crime. We can \nsecure the soft targets in our critical infrastructure, to ensure that \nour chemical plants and electricity grids are protected from attacks. \nWe can immediately re-allocate\n\n[[Page S9462]]\n\nspectrum from the television networks and give it to our first \nresponders so they can talk during an emergency.\n  I know what many of my colleagues here will argue. They will argue \nthat it is simply too expensive to do everything. That is malarkey. \nThis is all about priorities. And, quite frankly, this Congress and \nthis administration has had the wrong priorities over the past 5 years.\n  For example, this year the tax cut for Americans who make over $1 \nmillion is nearly $60 billion. Let me repeat that, just 1 year of the \nBush tax cut for Americans making over $1 million is nearly $60 \nbillion.\n  In contrast, we dedicate roughly one-half of that--approximately $32 \nbillion--for the entire operations of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  We have invested twice as much for a tax cut for millionaires--less \nthan 1 percent of the population--than we do for the Department \nintended to help secure the entire Nation.\n  For a nation that is repeatedly warned about the grave threats we \nface, how can this be the right priority?\n  The amendment that I am offering would change this by taking less \nthan 1 year of the tax cut for millionaires--$53.3 billion--and invest \nit in homeland security over the next 5 years.\n  By investing this over the next 5 years at just over $10 billion per \nyear, we could implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations and do \nthose commonsense things that we know will make us safer.\n  For example, under this amendment, we could hire 50,000 additional \npolice officers and help local agencies create locally based \ncounterterrorism units.\n  We could hire an additional 1,000 FBI agents to help ensure that the \nFBI is able to implement critical reforms without abandoning its \ntraditional crime-fighting functions.\n  We could also invest in security upgrades within our critical \ninfrastructure and nearly double the funding for State homeland \nsecurity grants.\n  And, the list goes on.\n  The bill that we are debating today is a good bill, and I am sure it \nwill pass, but does anyone really believe that the $400 million in port \nsecurity grants authorized in it will really be funded? A look back at \nour recent appropriations bills tells us that this is not likely.\n  Just this July we passed the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations budget. In that legislation, the Senate allocated only \n$210 million for port security grants--just over one-half of what we \nare advocating be authorized in this bill.\n  Another example of this problem is our shameful record on providing \nfunding for rail security. For the last two Congresses. the Senate has \npassed bipartisan rail security legislation sponsored by myself and \nSenator McCain, and others.\n  This legislation authorizes $1.2 billion to secure the soft targets \nin our rail system, such as the tunnels and stations. In fact, this \nlegislation was added as an amendment to this bill 2 days ago. I thank \nmy colleagues for including it, but we all understand that there is no \nchance of fully funding it unless we change our priorities.\n  Indeed, this body has voted against funding rail security when I have \noffered it as an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill the past 2 years. During that time, only $150 \nmillion per year has been allocated for rail and transit security with \nless than $15 million allocated for Amtrak security.\n  So while I thank my colleagues for recognizing the need for increased \nrail security by adopting the McCain-Biden amendment, it is clear that \nit won't mean much. Unfortunately, this is an example that is repeated \nover and over.\n  We know that the murder rate is up and that there is an officer \nshortage in communities throughout the Nation. Yet, we provide zero \nfunding for the COPS hiring program and we have slashed funding for the \nJustice Assistance Grant.\n  We know that our first responders can't talk because they don't have \nenough interoperable equipment. Yet, we have not forced the networks to \nturn over critical spectrum, and we vote down funding to help local \nagencies purchase equipment every year.\n  We know that only 5 percent of cargo containers are screened, yet we \ndo not invest in the personnel and equipment to upgrade our systems.\n  We know that our critical infrastructure is vulnerable. Yet, we allow \nindustry to decide what is best and provide scant resources to harden \nsoft targets.\n  The 9/11 Commission's Report Card issued last December stated bluntly \nthat ``it is time we stop talking about setting priorities and actually \nset some.''\n  With this amendment, we set some priorities.\n  I won't go through the entire amendment on the floor, but I would \nlike to touch on the highlights.\n  First, we provide the funding necessary to implement the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  Next, we take the commonsense steps to make our Nation safer.\n  We make sure that law enforcement and first responders have the \npersonnel, equipment, training, and are sufficiently coordinated to do \nthe job.\n  With this trust fund we could provide: $1.15 billion per year for \nCOPS grants; $160 million per year to hire 1,000 FBI agents; $200 \nmillion to hire and equip 1,000 rail police; $900 million for the \nJustice Assistance Grants; $1 billion per year for interoperable \ncommunications; and $1 billion for Fire Act and SAFER grants.\n  We could invest in screening technologies: $100 million to improve \nairline screening checkpoints; $100 million for research and \ndevelopment on improving screening technologies.\n  We set aside funding for our critical infrastructure: $500 million \nper year for general infrastructure grants; $500 million per year for \nport security grants; $200 million per year to harden our rail \ninfrastructure.\n  And, the list goes on.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude where I started. This is all about \nsetting the right priorities for America. Instead of giving a tax cut \nto the richest Americans who don't need it we should take some of it \nand dedicate it towards the security of all Americans.\n  Our Nation's most fortunate are just as patriotic as the middle \nclass. They are just as willing to sacrifice for the good of our \nNation. The problem is that no one has asked them to sacrifice.\n  If we adopt this amendment, we will be asking them to sacrifice for \nthe good of the Nation, and I am convinced that they would gladly help \nus out. We have done this before with the Violent Crime Trust Fund.\n  This amendment is about reordering our homeland security priorities, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from Washington, for \nyielding me the time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4936\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to be as constrained as possible \non this concept, but I do want to talk about this amendment of Senator \nReid's. It is a 500-plus-page amendment to be added to our port \nsecurity bill, and most of the provisions are totally unrelated to port \nsecurity. It covers Iraq policy; intelligence reform; all of the 9/11 \nCommission reforms; troop redeployment concepts; Iraqi contractor \nprovisions; a section regarding detainees, such as those people at \nGuantanamo Bay; immigration and border security; and a whole section on \ntransportation.\n  Now, I do not know if the Senate realizes, but the port security bill \nthat our committee, the Commerce Committee, reported was originally \nSenator Inouye's bill. As a matter of fact, we took it and reviewed it \nand made some minor modifications to it, and Senator Inouye suggested \nthat my name go first since I was chairman. We are cochairmen of the \ncommittee. As a matter of fact, it was the Inouye, Stevens, Collins, \nLieberman, Grassley, Baucus, Coleman, Murray amendment that we were \ntalking about when we finally got to the floor and put everything \ntogether.\n  We worked on trying to make this bill before the Senate a bipartisan \nbill, and what does my good friend--he is my good friend--the \nDemocratic leader, do? He brings us a bill, 500 pages, totally \npartisan. There is no bipartisanship in that bill at all. In each \ninstance, it is the minority's position on these very controversial \nsubjects.\n  We have worked 18 months to come to the floor with bills from three \ncommittees--a bipartisan approach--and\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\nwe are at the last minute supposed to vote on an amendment with 500-\nplus pages on a whole series of things.\n  I remember people used to say: It's everything but the kitchen sink. \nDo you know what I mean? There is so much in this bill that is totally \npartisan--it is awesome--when we are working to try to finish up this \nyear and trying to reach out and be bipartisan. Above all bills, this \nbill we brought to the floor was bipartisan--three separate committees \non a bipartisan basis. And from all three committees, the ranking \nmembers and the chairmen signed that bill.\n  Now, I cannot think of anything that has been done to destroy the \nbipartisanship we seek to have to deal with issues such as security \nother than this bill. Why should we be forced to have a cloture vote or \nraise a point of order against a bill like that? It should not have \nbeen brought to the floor.\n  Now, it is time we settled down and started thinking about: How can \nwe get our work done? There are going to be elections soon, and it is a \ntough period for everybody. One-third of the Senate is up for election. \nI know that. We all know that. And we try to understand, on a \nbipartisan basis, we should do some things and not be offensive to \npeople who are up for election.\n  I hope I am not being offensive to my friend from Nevada. But I am \ntelling him he should not, as a leader, do this. And it is time we \nthought about how we can settle problems like the security at our \nports. The bill we brought to the floor could have been passed with one \nor two amendments in a few hours. As a matter of fact, we thought that \nwas going to happen. We really did. Because of the cooperation that was \nthere from each committee and the work we did literally through our \nstaffs and through the members of consolidating the work of three \ndifferent committees on a bipartisan basis, we thought we had this \nsubject covered. But the amendments that are being brought to us now \nhave nothing to do with port security.\n  We thought we would emphasize port security. At the suggestion of the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, we put rail security in. It, too, is \nso interlocked with port security, it was justifiable. And, again, that \nportion of the bill was bipartisan. No question about it. That was part \nof the work of our committee on railroad and rail security.\n  But I say to the Senate, time is now a commodity before the election. \nThere is very little of it left. I would hope we don't have any more of \nthese amendments. And if we do, I think we ought to face the question \nof just immediately tabling them. Let's stay directed toward what our \nwork demands of us; and that is, to take the action that is necessary \nto assure security in the different modes of transportation that our \npeople must use. I hope we will have no more of these amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the time situation between the \ntwo parties?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 28 minutes 41 seconds. The \nminority has 21 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Then, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntime in the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me just add to the comments made by \nthe distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee about the \namendment offered by the Democratic leader. I mentioned earlier that \nthis amendment is 507 pages. This, in my hand, is the port security \nbill. Now, this, in my hand, is the Reid amendment. I can barely lift \nit. It requires no fewer than 95 reports, certifications, and \ndeterminations. It has 37 pages of findings. It has 16 sense-of-the-\nCongress resolutions. It requires 36 GAO reports and audits.\n  But what is not in there? There is virtually nothing in there that \nrelates to port or maritime security. In fact, we have now done a \nsearch of the entire amendment. We found one--one--reference to port \nsecurity and one reference to maritime and cargo security in the entire \nReid amendment.\n  I think that makes the point. I think that says it all. This \namendment is irrelevant to the underlying bill.\n  As I mentioned earlier, it includes provisions that the Senate has \nalready decisively rejected on what our policy should be in Iraq and \nwhat the funding formula should be for the homeland security grant \nprogram. It is not as if those provisions were rejected years ago; they \nwere rejected just a few months ago. So it makes no sense for this \namendment to include formula changes and a change in our policy in Iraq \nthat this body, by more than 60 votes in each case, decisively \nrejected.\n  In fact, when it comes to the funding formula for homeland security \ngrants, the majority of the Democratic Caucus rejects the formula \nchange that is included in the Reid amendment. As I mentioned, over 100 \npages of the Reid amendment deal with foreign policy recommendations, \npublic diplomacy recommendations of the 9/11 Commission that are \nalready law. They are virtually identical to a title of the \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004, which is already law. Other provisions \nin the Reid amendment we have passed during the debate on the port \nsecurity bill--the proposals of Senator McCain and Senators Shelby and \nSarbanes on rail and mass transit security. We already adopted those. \nThose are redundant at best.\n  What it comes down to is, unfortunately, this is simply a partisan \namendment. That is so unfortunate because the work on this port \nsecurity bill has never been partisan--never. There have been leaders \nsuch as Senator Murray and Senator Lieberman on the Democratic side. \nThere have been leaders on the Republican side. The Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Homeland Security Committee did \ninvestigations of the port security programs that were completely \nbipartisan, headed by Senators Norman Coleman and Carl Levin. The \ncommittee consideration both in the Homeland Security Committee and the \nCommerce Committee was completely bipartisan. This has been a \nbipartisan effort in the House of Representatives, as well, where the \nbill was sponsored by Representatives Dan Lungren and Jane Harmon. It \nhas been bipartisan since the conception to where we are today.\n  It is so unfortunate to have a blatantly partisan amendment, 507 \npages, that swamps the bill and has nothing to do with the bill offered \nby the Democratic leader. So I hope our colleagues will take a look at \nwhat is really in the Reid amendment. I fear we may well have a \npartisan vote. I hope we do not. I think if my friends and colleagues \non the other side of the aisle actually look at what is in the Reid \namendment, I would be surprised if they vote for it because they voted \nagainst large chunks of it in the past.\n  So I hope once we have disposed of the Democratic leader's amendment, \nwe can return to the constructive, bipartisan approach that we have \ntaken on this bill. This is an important bill. It is a bill that \nmatters to the security of our country. It is a bill that is too \nimportant to be bogged down in partisan politics. It has never been \nbogged down in partisan politics. It has been bipartisan every step of \nthe way. Let's conclude consideration of this bill in a bipartisan way, \nin a way that reflects well on this Senate, and send this important \nbill to the President for his signature.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 9 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher good work. I thank Senator Collins for her work on port security. I \nam proud to say that in the Commerce Committee, in a bipartisan way, we \nhave worked over and over again to make this country safer. I was part \nof that\n\n[[Page S9464]]\n\nunder the leadership of Senator McCain at the time, and first Senator \nHollings and now Senator Stevens.\n  I want to show you a little bit of history about what has happened in \nthe Republican Congress every time we have voted out one of these good \nbills because you can say what you want about partisan politics, but \nthe fact is, almost every single time we reported one of these bills \nout of our committee, it simply died and went nowhere. I want to talk \nabout that history because, of course, Senator Collins is right that \nprotecting Americans is our job. It has nothing to do with being a \nDemocrat or a Republican.\n  Here is what happened. In the 107th Congress, we passed the Ship, \nSeafarer, and Container Security Act; no action by the full Senate. In \nthe 108th Congress, we passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act \nof 2004. It passed the Senate on September 21, 2004, and was not even \nconsidered in the House of Representatives. In the 109th Congress, we \npassed the Transportation Security Improvement Act of 2005. Commerce \npassed it on November 17, 2005; no action by the full Senate.\n  There you have it. Do you wonder why the 9/11 Commission has given \nthis Congress and this administration failing grades? You can talk \nabout bipartisanship. We reported these bills out of the committee on a \nbipartisan basis, but the leadership never bothered. So when I heard \nthat the last days of this session were going to be about homeland \ndefense, I said thank God for that, thank goodness for that. Whether it \nis an election driving it or anything else, I could not care less. \nLet's get it done. This Congress and this administration have received \nfailing grades from the \n9/11 Commission.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this document printed in the Record, \nwhich is a final report on 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   FINAL REPORT ON 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS, DECEMBER 5, 2005\n\n     Part I: Homeland Security, Emergency Preparedness and Response\n\n     Recommendation--Grade\n\n\n                  emergency preparedness and response\n\n     Provide adequate radio spectrum for first responders--F (C if \n         bill passes)\n       The pending Fiscal Year 2006 budget reconciliation bill \n     would compel the return of the analog TV broadcast (700 Mhz) \n     spectrum, and reserve some for public safety purposes. Both \n     the House and Senate bills contain a 2009 handover date--too \n     distant given the urgency of the threat. A 2007 hand over \n     date would make the American people safer sooner.\n     Establish a unified Incident Command \n         System--C\n       Although there is awareness of and some training in the \n     ICS, hurricane Katrina demonstrated the absence of full \n     compliance during a multi-jurisdictional/statewide \n     catastrophe--and its resulting costs.\n     Allocate homeland security funds based on risk--F (A if House \n         provision passes)\n       Congress has still not changed the underlying statutory \n     authority for homeland security grants, or benchmarks to \n     insure that funds are used wisely. As a result, homeland \n     security funds continue to be distributed without regard for \n     risk, vulnerability, or the consequences of an attack, \n     diluting the national security benefits of this important \n     program.\n     Critical infrastructure risks and vulnerabilities \n         assessment--D\n       A draft National Infrastructure Protection Plan (November \n     2005) spells out a methodology and process for critical \n     infrastructure assessments. No risk and vulnerability \n     assessments actually made; no national priorities \n     established; no recommendations made on allocation of scarce \n     resources. All key decisions are at least a year away, It is \n     time that we stop talking about setting priorities, and \n     actually set some.\n     Private sector preparedness--C\n       National preparedness standards are only beginning to find \n     their way into private sector business practices. Private \n     sector preparedness needs to be a higher priority for DHS and \n     for American businesses.\n\n\n                        TRANSPORTATION SECURITY\n\n     National Strategy for Transportation \n         Security--C-\n       DHS has transmitted its National Strategy for \n     Transportation Security to the Congress. While the strategy \n     reportedly outlines broad objectives, this first version \n     lacks the necessary detail to make it an effective management \n     tool.\n     Improve airline passenger pre-screening--F\n       Few improvements have been made to the existing passenger \n     screening system since right after 9/11. The completion of \n     the testing phase of TSA's pre-screerung program for airline \n     passengers has been delayed. A new system, utilizing all \n     names on the consolidated terrorist watch list, is therefore \n     not yet in operation.\n     Improve airline screening checkpoints to detect explosives--C\n       While more advanced screening technology is being \n     developed, Congress needs to provide the funding for, and TSA \n     needs to move as expeditiously as possible with, the \n     appropriate installation of explosives detection trace \n     portals at more of the Nation's commercial airports.\n     Checked bag and cargo screening--D\n       Improvements here have not been made a priority by the \n     Congress or the administration. Progress on implementation of \n     in-line screening has been slow. The main impediment is \n     inadequate funding.\n\n\n                            border security\n\n     Better terrorist travel strategy--Incomplete\n       The first Terrorist Travel Strategy is in development, due \n     to be delivered by December 17, 2005 as required by PL 108-\n     458.\n     Comprehensive screening system--C\n       We still do not have a comprehensive screening system. \n     Although agencies are moving ahead on individual screening \n     projects, there is lack of progress on coordination between \n     agencies. DHS' new Screening Coordination OffIce still needs \n     to establish and implement goals for resolving differences in \n     biometric and traveler systems, credentialing and \n     identification standards.\n     Biometric entry-exit screening system--B\n       The US-VISIT system is running at 115 airports and 15 \n     seaports, and is performing secondary screening at the 50 \n     busiest land borders. But border screening systems are not \n     yet employed at all land borders, nor are these systems \n     interoperable. The exit component of the US-VISIT system has \n     not been widely deployed.\n     International collaboration on borders and document \n         security--D\n       There has been some good collaboration between US-VISIT and \n     Interpol, but little progress elsewhere. There has been no \n     systematic diplomatic effort to share terrorist watchlists, \n     nor has Congress taken a leadership role in passport \n     security.\n     Standardize secure identifications--B-\n       The REAL ID Act has established by statute standards for \n     state-issued IDs acceptable for federal purposes, though \n     states' compliance needs to be closely monitored. New \n     standards for issuing birth certificates (required by law by \n     December 17, 2005) are delayed until at least spring 2006, \n     probably longer. Without movement on the birth certificate \n     issue, state-issued IDs are still not secure.\n\n           Part II: Reforming the Institutions of Government\n\n     Recommendation--Grade\n\n\n                       The Intelligence Community\n\n     Director of National Intelligence--B\n       The framework for the DNI and his authorities are in place. \n     Now his challenge is to exercise his authorities boldly to \n     smash stovepipes, drive reform, and create a unity of \n     effort--and act soon. He must avoid layering of the \n     bureaucracy andJ focus on transformation of the Intelligence \n     Community. The success of this office will require decisive \n     leadership from the DNI and the president, and active \n     oversight by the Congress.\n     National Counterterrorism Center--B\n       Shared analysis and evaluation of threat information is in \n     progress; joint operational planning is beginning. But the \n     NCTC does not yet have sufftcient resources or personnel to \n     fulfill its intelligence and planning role.\n     Create FBI national security workforce--C\n       Progress is being made--but it is too slow. The FBI's shift \n     to a counterterrorism posture is far from institutionalized, \n     and significant deficiencies remain. Reforms are at risk from \n     inertia and complacency; they must be accelerated, or they \n     will fail. Unless there is improvement in a reasonable period \n     of time, Congress will have to look at alternatives.\n     New missions for CIA Director--Incomplete\n       Reforms are underway at the CIA, especially of human \n     intelligence operations. But their outcome is yet to be seen. \n     If the CIA is to remain an effective arm of national power, \n     Congress and CIA leadership need to be committed to \n     accelerating the pace of reforms, and must address morale and \n     personnel issues.\n     Incentives for information sharing--D\n       Changes in incentives, in favor of information sharing, \n     have been minimal. The office of the program manager for \n     information sharing is still a start-up, and is not getting \n     the support it needs from the highest levels of government. \n     There remain many complaints about lack of information \n     sharing between federal authorities and state and local level \n     officials.\n     Government-wide information sharing--D\n       Designating individuals to be in charge of information \n     sharing is not enough. They need resources, active \n     presidential backing, policies and procedures in place that \n     compel sharing, and systems of performance evaluation that \n     appraise personnel on how they carry out information sharing.\n     Homeland airspace defense--B-\n       Situational awareness and sharing of information has \n     improved. But it is not routine or comprehensive, no single \n     agency currently leads the interagency response to airspace \n     violations, and there is no overarching\n\n[[Page S9465]]\n\n     plan to secure airspace outside the National Capital region.\n\n\n                  civil liberties and executive power\n\n     Balance between security and civil liberties--B\n       The debate surrounding reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act \n     has been strong, and concern for civil liberties has been at \n     the heart of it. Robust and continuing oversight, both within \n     the Executive and by the Congress, will be essential.\n     Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board--D\n       We see little urgency in the creation of this Board. The \n     President nominated a Chair and Vice Chair in June 2005, and \n     sent their names to the Senate in late September. To date, \n     the Senate has not confirmed them. Funding is insufficient, \n     no meetings have been held, no staff named, no work plan \n     outlined, no work begun, no office established.\n     Guidelines for government sharing of personal information--D\n       The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board has not yet \n     begun its work. The DNI just named a Civil Liberties \n     Protection Officer (November 2005).\n\n\n                congressional and administrative reform\n\n     Intelligence oversight reform--D\n       The House and Senate have taken limited positive steps, \n     including the creation of oversight subcommittees. However, \n     the ability of the intelligence committees to perform \n     oversight of the intelligence agencies and account for their \n     performance is still undermined by the power of the Defense \n     Appropriations subcommittees and Armed Services committees.\n     Homeland Security committees--B\n  The House and Senate have taken positive steps, but Secretary \nChertoff and his team still report to too many bosses. The House and \nSenate homeland security committees should have exclusive jurisdiction \nover all counterterrorism functions of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n     Declassify overall intelligence budget--F\n  No action has been taken. The Congress cannot do robust intelligence \noversight when funding for intelligence programs is buried within the \ndefense budget. Declassifying the overall intelligence budget would \nallow for a separate annual intelligence appropriations bill, so that \nthe Congress can judge better how intelligence funds are being spent.\n     Standardize security clearances--B\n  The President put the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in charge \nof standardizing security clearances. OMB issued a plan to improve the \npersonnel security clearance process in November 2005. The Deputy \nDirector of OMB is committed to its success. All the hard work is \nahead.\n\n    Part III: Foreign Policy, Public Diplomacy, and Nonproliferation\n\n     Recommendation--Grade\n\n\n                            Nonproliferation\n\n     Maximum effort by U.S. government to secure WMD--D\n  Countering the greatest threat to America's security is still not the \ntop national security priority of the President and the Congress.\n\n\n                             Foreign Policy\n\n     Long-term commitment to Afghanistan--B\n  Progress has been made, but attacks Taliban and other extremists \ncontinue and the drug situation has worsened. The U.S. and its partners \nmust commit to a long-term economic plan in order to ensure the \ncountry's stability.\n     Support Pakistan against extremists--C+\n  U.S. assistance to Pakistan has not moved sufficiently beyond \nsecurity assistance to include significant funding for education \nefforts. Musharraf has made efforts to take on the threat from \nextremism, but has not shut down extremist-linked madrassas or \nterrorist camps. Taliban forces still pass freely across the Pakistan-\nAfghanistan border and operate in Pakistani tribal areas.\n     Support reform in Saudi Arabia--D\n  Saudi authorities have taken initial steps but need to do much more \nto regulate charities and control the flow of funds to extremist \ngroups, and to promote tolerance and moderation. A U.S.-Saudi strategic \ndialogue to address topics including reform and exchange programs has \njust started; there are no results to report.\n     Identify and prioritize terrorist sanctuaries--B\n  Strategies have been articulated to address and eliminate terrorist \nsanctuaries, but they do not include a useful metric to gauge progress. \nThere is little sign of long-term efforts in place to reduce the \nconditions that allow the formation of terrorist sanctuaries.\n     Coalition strategy against Islamist terrorism--C\n       Components of a common strategy are evident on a bilateral \n     basis, and multilateral policies exist in some areas. But no \n     permanent contact group of leading governments has yet been \n     established to coordinate a coalition counterterrorism \n     strategy.\n     Coalition standards for terrorist detention--F\n       The U.S. has not engaged in a common coalition approach to \n     developing standards for detention and prosecution of \n     captured terrorists. Indeed, U.S. treatment of detainees has \n     elicited broad criticism, and makes it harder to build the \n     necessary alliances to cooperate effectively with partners in \n     a global war on terror.\n     Economic policies--B+\n       There has been measurable progress in reaching agreements \n     on economic reform in the Middle East, including a free trade \n     agreement with Bahrain and the likely admission of Saudi \n     Arabia to the WTO before long. However, it is too early to \n     judge whether these agreements will lead to genuine economic \n     reform.\n     Vigorous effort against terrorist financing--A-\n       The U.S. has won the support of key countries in tackling \n     terrorism finance--though there is still much to do in the \n     Gulf States and in South Asia. The government has made \n     significant strides in using terrorism finance as an \n     intelligence tool. However, the State Department and Treasury \n     Department are engaged in unhelpful turf battles, and the \n     overall effort lacks leadership.\n\n\n                            Public Diplomacy\n\n     Define the U.S. message--C\n       Despite efforts to offer a vision for U.S. leadership in \n     the world based on the expansion of democratic governance, \n     public opinion approval ratings for the U.S. throughout the \n     Middle East remain at or near historic lows. Public diplomacy \n     initiatives need to communicate our values, way of life, and \n     vision for the world without lecturing or condescension.\n     International broadcasting--B\n       Budgets for international broadcasting to the Arab and \n     Muslim world and U.S.-sponsored broadcasting hours have \n     increased dramatically, and audience shares are growing. But \n     we need to move beyond audience size, expose listeners to new \n     ideas and accurate information about the U.S. and its \n     policies, and measure the impact and influence of these \n     ideas.\n     Scholarship, exchange, and library programs--D\n       Funding for educational and cultural exchange programs has \n     increased. But more American libraries (Pakistan, for \n     example) are closing rather than opening. The number of young \n     people coming to study in the U.S. from the Middle East \n     continues to decline (down 2% this year, following declines \n     of 9% and 10% in the previous two years).\n     Support secular education in Muslim countries--D\n       An International Youth Opportunity Fund has been \n     authorized, but has received no funding; secular education \n     programs have been initiated across the Arab world, but are \n     not integrated into a broader counterterrorism strategy. The \n     U.S. has no overarching strategy for educational assistance, \n     and the current level of education reform funding is \n     inadequate.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, here are some of the things on which we \nreceived bad grades: We are not providing adequate radio spectrum for \nfirst responders. We are not establishing a unified incident command \nsystem. We are not allocating homeland security funds based on risk. We \nare not protecting the critical infrastructure. We don't have a private \nsector that is prepared. We don't have a national strategy for \ntransportation security. We are not prescreening passengers like we \nshould be. We don't have screening checkpoints detecting explosives. We \nare still not screening the cargo that goes into passenger planes, even \nthough they are taking away our lip gloss. I don't care about giving up \nmy lip gloss, believe me. I would give up my lip gloss and everything \nelse, but how about protecting the cargo that goes underneath that \npassenger plane? How about making sure it is safe, making sure it won't \nexplode?\n  I have an amendment that I will offer to this bill--unless the \nmajority shuts me down--to say that until we are screening all of the \ncargo, let's make sure there is a blast-resistant container on these \naircrafts. That is a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission that has not \nbeen followed. So when you have a suspect piece of cargo and you are \nnot sure about it, put it into the blast-resistant cargo container. We \npushed this in the Commerce Committee. TSA tested it and we know it \nworks. But it is not happening.\n  I could go on, page after page of this document, where this Congress \nand this administration have failed. I say they have been soft on \nhomeland defense. Why? I say two reasons: They cannot afford it because \nthey are spending our money in Iraq instead of protecting us from the \nterrorists at home, instead of going after Osama bin Laden in \nAfghanistan. The President says over and over again that it is one\n\n[[Page S9466]]\n\nand the same. Do you know what? The bipartisan Senate Intelligence \nCommittee was right out there and said Saddam Hussein--the tyrant \nthough he is, and he deserves whatever fate awaits him--had not one \nthing to do with al-Qaida. As a matter of fact, he was threatened by \nthem because he had a secular government. He was fearful of them, and \nrumors were that he wanted some of them assassinated.\n  The war in Iraq has strengthened Iran. It is a recruiting tool for \nOsama bin Laden. It is busting the budget. It is causing the debt to \nexplode, not to mention the deaths of close to 3,000 of our service men \nand women, and 20,000 have been severely injured. The money going there \nis about $10 billion a month. We could protect every single American \naircraft today from the threat of shoulder-fired missiles with the cost \nof Iraq in 1 month.\n  Then there is the other priority of this administration--tax breaks \nfor billionaires. That is costing trillions. Look at every other \nPresident in the history of our country; they didn't do that in a time \nof war. So you have the war in Iraq, and the only strategy we have from \nthis President is that we are going to be there ``as long as I am the \nPresident.'' Well, that is not a strategy; that is a recipe for more \ndeath, more destruction. That is clear.\n  There are many ways that we could begin reducing the cost over \nthere--the cost to our troops. We can say to the Iraqi people that our \npeople have fought and died for you; now take the reins of your own \ngovernment and protect yourselves. If you cannot figure out how to \nprotect neighbor from neighbor, you have a problem. Nobody did it for \nus. Everybody always says compare what happened in Iraq to the American \nRevolution. I don't get the comparison, but if we go with that for a \nminute, it is true that other countries helped us in that battle--\nFrance, for example--but at the end of the day, we had to take over the \nsecurity on the ground and make our new country a success. So we cannot \nforce democracy and force people to love each other at the point of a \ngun. It is their business.\n  We have spent our treasure and are spending our treasure to the point \nwhere we cannot afford a comprehensive bill. You heard Senator Collins \nsay, ``I hope you will vote against this broad bill.'' Why? We have \nbeen condemned by the 9/11 Commission for not doing enough in a broad \nway. This bill just does port security. Thank goodness we have \namendments to add rail and transit. It is moving toward the Reid bill. \nLet this go on because the more we debate and the more we offer \namendments, the more this bill looks like the Democratic alternative. \nIt has taken a big step in that direction.\n  We know what happened in Madrid. We saw what happened in London. We \nknow our infrastructure is at risk. But 5 years after 9/11, we get \nfailing grades. It is a sad moment.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Collins, and I thank my colleague, \nSenator Murray, two fantastic women who fought hard to get a port \nsecurity bill to the floor. But let's welcome this as an opportunity to \nprotect our people, not just focus narrowly on one problem.\n  I hate to say it, we have an array of problems. We have 41 problems \nand 41 recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, the bipartisan \nCommission we have not listened to, and that is what the Reid bill \ndoes. It is very important.\n  I thank my colleagues for going as far as they have gone, but I hope \nwe will go even further and change this truth that this Congress has \nbeen soft on homeland defense. We can change that, and I welcome the \nfact that we will be debating security from now until we get out of \nhere because if ever there were a place we have neglected, it is \nhomeland security.\n  I am very happy to be part of this debate. I look forward to \nsupporting the Reid amendment and all the other amendments that will \nmake our country safer. We can scare people. We can make speeches and \nfrighten them. That is not our job. Our job is to protect them, not to \nscare them. We haven't done that, and we have an opportunity to do that \nbetween now and the time we get out of here and go home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield all our remaining time to Senator \nDurbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for \n6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my colleague \nfrom the State of Washington for her leadership on this bill relative \nto port security. It is a very important bill.\n  Of course, the Port of Chicago is concerned about these issues, as \nmany are around the country. We understand this is basically an \nauthorization bill and that before things will happen, money has to be \nappropriated. So an authorization is a promise; an appropriation is a \nreality. I hope we can follow through with the good promises that are \nincluded in this bill, many important good promises, with the reality \nof appropriating money for that particular effort. But what we have \noffered in addition to the port security bill is the Real Security Act \nwhich has been proposed by the Democratic side.\n  In just the few moments I have, I wish to outline what we do.\n  First, we are going to rely on the expertise of a bipartisan group \nthat has gained great respect across the Nation, and that, of course, \nis the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission, with Governor Kean of New \nJersey, a Republican, and Congressman Hamilton, a Democrat, came up \nwith 41 recommendations to make America safer. They published those \nrecommendations more than 2 years ago. It was a blueprint for making \nthis a safer nation.\n  This Commission has stayed in business long enough to grade the \nadministration and Congress on its response. The results of their last \nreport card were alarming. Last December, they graded our Government's \nprogress as follows: 5 F's, 12 D's, 9 C's, and one A-minus. That is it. \nFor 41 recommendations, we ended up being told by this Commission that \nwe are not paying attention.\n  The Real Security Act, which the Democrats propose, basically says as \na starting point that we need to establish a comprehensive system to \nmake certain the 9/11 recommendations are followed. That, to me, should \nbe a bipartisan starting point. But the President's budget and the \nactions of Congress have not allowed us to reach that goal.\n  We also believe we cannot talk about a secure America without \nspeaking about the obvious: 145,000 Americans are risking their lives \nin Iraq today as we stand in the safety of this Chamber; 2,671 of our \nbravest soldiers have died, 19,000 seriously injured; and a war that \nhas cost us $325 billion with no end in sight. That is the reality.\n  We believe that if we learned the lessons of 9/11, we need to bring \nour troops home with their mission truly accomplished. That means a \npartial redeployment of troops this year so the Iraqis take \nresponsibility for their own defense and their own future.\n  There is also an element in this bill that is near and dear to me, \nand it relates to the issue of transportation. We are just not doing \nenough. We know at the airports, when we have to take off our shoes, \nthey go through our luggage, and we hand over our toothpaste, what is \ngoing on there. What is happening in other places? We are not doing \nenough when it comes to making Amtrak safer.\n  Three million Illinoisans ride Amtrak each year. Yet neither Amtrak's \ntracks nor its Midwest hub, Chicago's Union Station, is as secure as it \nshould be. The Chicago Transit Agency alone has over $500 million in \nunmet security needs. And the Port of Chicago, as I mentioned earlier, \nneeds more funds for homeland security.\n\n  I am afraid that the Bush administration and this Republican-led \nCongress have also done little or nothing\n\n[[Page S9467]]\n\nto deal with the potential threats at our nuclear powerplants and our \nchemical industry plants. These, I am afraid, could be a tempting \nterrorist target.\n  In our bill, the Real Security Act, on the Democratic side, proposes \nwe spend money to make certain they are safer, that we authorize this \nexpenditure. We want to equip our intelligence community to fight the \nwar against terrorism. Intelligence is our first line in defense. For \nthe first time in 28 years, the Republican Congress has failed to pass \nan intelligence authorization act. Our amendment does that, to make \nsure the intelligence agencies have the authorizations they need and \nthe guidance they need to keep America safe.\n  We also need to provide better tools to bring terrorists to justice. \nWe believe we can do this without abandoning the Constitution or the \nrule of law.\n  I salute the Presiding Officer, who has shown extraordinary \nleadership in this area. His background in the Air Force and his \nservice in the Judge Advocate General Service Corps has made him a very \nvaluable voice in this debate.\n  I am hopeful that we can show we can keep America safe without \nabandoning our values, that we can fight terrorism while still honoring \nthose basic principles, those constitutional principles we have all \nsworn to uphold. We can bring these terrorists to justice. We can do it \nin a way that we can point to with pride, that the world can judge was \na fair proceeding and, in so doing, we can demonstrate to the world \nthat the rule of law is worth following, even when a nation is under \nattack and threat of terrorism.\n  This Real Security Act of 2006 is a comprehensive effort on the \nDemocratic side to complement the underlying bill and to make sure we \ndon't do just part of the job but do the entire job, that we move \nforward to make America safer.\n  We understand the threat. We live in a dangerous world. The fifth \nanniversary of 9/11 was a reminder to all of us where we were on that \nfateful day. If we are going to look forward and say to the American \npeople: We can make your country and our country safer, then we should \nenact the Real Security Act, the amendment pending before the Senate.\n  Wouldn't it be refreshing if our Republican colleagues would join us \nin supporting this amendment, if we could return to the bipartisan \nspirit that followed 9/11 and do something in concert without partisan \ndivision? It really makes America safer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes 28 seconds for the \nmajority and 29 seconds for the minority.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas, the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment that is proposed by Senator Reid. The title of the act \nSenator Reid has proposed is called Real Security. If my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle actually believe this amendment is real \nsecurity, I encourage every American to go home and simply lock their \ndoors.\n  There are provisions in the amendment that I like. In particular, I \nsupport the passage of the Intelligence Authorization Act as it was \nreported by the Intelligence and the Armed Services Committees. I hope \nthe Senate can act on that bill by unanimous consent without insisting \non needless partisan debate on a bill that has bipartisan support.\n  But now, on the other hand, I oppose the sense-of-Congress language \nSenator Reid has inserted in that bill that suggests the terrorist \nsurveillance program is unlawful. Talk about the sense of the \nCongress--that means the Congress would not have any sense.\n  Like most Americans, I believe the President should use all the \nauthority provided by the Constitution and laws of the United States to \nprevent terrorists from killing innocent Americans. If terrorists \noutside the United States are placing calls to individuals in the \nUnited States, as many people have said over and over and over and over \nand over again, our intelligence agencies should know about it.\n  The terrorist surveillance program is lawful. It has been effective. \nI will oppose any legislation that does not support the continuation of \nthat very valuable program. The bottom line on the terrorist \nsurveillance program is this: The men and women of the NSA are working \nhard to protect our country day in and day out. We should let these \npatriotic Americans get back to doing their job.\n\n  Beyond that, I am convinced that my colleagues consulted perhaps a \ngroup of tenth grade English teachers in preparing this amendment. I \nhaven't seen so many assigned reports since I was in high school.\n  Instead of providing flexible authorities to protect our Nation, my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have proposed approximately \n52--a deck of cards, 52--I say that again, 52 new and continuing \nreporting requirements. That is one new reporting requirement for every \n9 pages of the amendment.\n  The U.S. Government should be focused on securing our borders, \ndisrupting terrorists, and protecting our ports. This amendment does \nnothing but divert focus to reporting requirements.\n  My colleagues have also resorted to an old standby: If you don't have \nany ideas, throw money and people at a problem. There are about 29 \nsections that propose new or additional ways to spend our limited \nresources. We haven't had any committee hearings on these, but they are \nreported. There are three provisions that increase the size of our \nGovernment by adding more personnel.\n  As a substitute for congressional consideration of legislation to \nrespond to the Supreme Court's Hamdan decision, my colleagues have \nproposed yet another national commission--yet another national \ncommission. I am not going to go through the trouble of listing all of \nthe commissions that we have had in the last 4 or 5 years. This one, \nhowever, is to focus on the detention and interrogation of terrorists \ncaptured in the war on terror. Let me give my colleagues the bottom \nline on the Government's detention and interrogation programs--and \nthere will be legislation that already is reported from the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to take care of that--they have kept this Nation \nsafe. I think we can forego another commission.\n  Finally, Senator Reid's amendment would authorize three new \nadministrative subpoenas: one for the new commission, one for the \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and one for a new Senate \ncommittee.\n  If Senator Reid and his colleagues want real security, they should \nstrip out these provisions and simply give the FBI an administrative \nsubpoena to track terrorists and spies. But that is the point of this \nbill; it is not about real security. This bill is about real Monday \nmorning quarterbacking. It is about tying the hands of our homeland \nsecurity and intelligence professionals as they attempt to protect this \nNation.\n  The only way this amendment would make the Nation safer is if we made \ncopies of all of the reports that it requires and carpet-bombed Osama \nbin Laden. I am certain he would suffocate.\n  I will not support this amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose it \nas well.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I am voting today to remove the \nbudgetary point of order in order to consider the REAL security \namendment offered by Senator Reid. In doing so, I am following through \non my longstanding commitment to pass and adequately fund all of the \nkey recommendations of the 9/11 Commission for preventing future \nterrorist attacks and protecting our country and our people.\n  If the Senate votes to allow consideration of the amendment, I will \nintroduce a second-degree amendment to strike the provisions on Iraq \nfrom the REAL security proposal because they contain language calling \nfor a deadline-driven withdrawal of troops from Iraq, which I have \nconsistently opposed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9468]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, it is interesting to hear my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle talk about the 9/11 Commission and then \nimply that the Reid amendment would finish the job of the 9/11 \nCommission. In fact, as I pointed out earlier, over 100 pages of the \n507-page Reid amendment already are law. They are the foreign policy \nand public diplomacy recommendations that were recommended by the 9/11 \nCommission and included in the Intelligence Reform Act which became law \n2 years ago--2 years ago. Many of the other recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission were enacted as part of that legislation.\n  Now, there is one area where the 9/11 Commission did recommend \nchanges that have not been completely made, and that is in the area of \ncongressional oversight and the reorganization of committees. Instead, \nthe Senate and the House adopted some, but not all, of those \nrecommendations. But, ironically, the amendment proposed by the \nDemocratic leader does not deal with that unfinished recommendation of \nthe 9/11 Commission. So I don't want to leave the impression that the \n9/11 Commission's recommendations are what are largely found in this \namendment; they are not, other than the more than 100 pages on the \nforeign policy and public diplomacy recommendations, which are already \nlaw and have been for almost 2 years.\n  The fact is, our country has made tremendous progress in \nstrengthening our security since 9/11. We have taken many actions, and \nif we talk to the experts, they will all tell us that those actions \nhave made a difference. Are we completely safe? Of course not. We can \nnever say that we are completely safe, but we are clearly safer than we \nwere 5 years ago due to actions taken by this Congress, this \nadministration, and State and local law enforcement. We have a ways to \ngo, and the underlying bill on port security will help advance the \nsecurity of this country.\n  So for the reasons I have already spoken on extensively today, I hope \nthat our colleagues will vote to sustain the point of order which I \nwill shortly be raising against Senator Reid's amendment. It does \nviolate the Budget Act, and I will be raising a point of order against \nit.\n  But aside from the budget issues, the procedural objections, I hope \nmy colleagues will actually look at the Reid amendment and look at what \nit does contain. If they do, they will find only one reference in it to \nport security--only one reference in it to maritime and cargo security. \nThey will instead find page after page of policy that this Senate has \nalready rejected with regard to our engagement in Iraq and the policy \non the formula for homeland security grants. They will also find \nlegislation that is already law, and they will find amendments that we \nhave already adopted having to do with rail and mass transit security.\n  So, unfortunately--and I mean this--sadly, this amendment is simply a \npartisan hodgepodge of provisions that have been cobbled together. I \nhope we can dispense with it quickly and then move back to the port \nsecurity bill, an enormously important bill, a bill that many of us \nhave worked on for years, a bill that has been bipartisan from the very \nstart in both the House and the Senate. That is unusual, as the \nPresiding Officer knows. This bill is an exception to the rule. But, \napparently, we couldn't quite get through the floor debate without \nhaving a partisan bomb lobbed at this bill, and I think that is \nunfortunate. But I hope once we get through this, we can go back to \nbipartisan consideration of relevant and germane amendments and we can \nget this work done.\n  This is a gap in our homeland security. When we talk to the experts, \nthey all tell us they are worried about the security of our seaports \nand the 11 million shipping containers that come into this country each \nyear. We have a carefully crafted, balanced bill that strikes the right \nbalance between the need to strengthen security and the need to \nfacilitate trade.\n  Again, I recognize the work that Senator Murray has done on this \nbill. She originated a lot of the concepts in this bill. It has been \nthat kind of bipartisan partnership that has brought us to where we are \ntoday. So let's get this partisanship out of the way, and let's return \nto a bipartisan debate. This bill is so important to the security of \npeople living near our seaports, to those working on our seaports, to \nthe retailers in this country that rely on the cargo brought into our \nseaports, to our farmers who rely on shipping their crops out of our \nseaports. Let's remember the impact of this bill on communities not \njust on our coasts where the seaports are located but communities all \nacross this country that rely on the products brought to our shores by \ncargo ships, or rely on the cargo ships to export these products.\n  So I hope we can return to the underlying bill. It is a good bill, \nand it deserves continued bipartisan support.\n  Could the Presiding Officer inform me how many minutes are remaining \non our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nmajority side.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, has all time expired under the time \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I raise a point of order against the \nReid amendment because it violates section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthat act for purposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Rhode Island (Mr. Chafee).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I wish to discuss this for a few \nminutes.\n  I call to the attention of the Senate that this, too, is an all-\ninclusive amendment. It restores the cuts for law enforcement. It deals \nwith all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. It deals with \nrequiring 100 percent screening of cargo containers, which is our \nobjective. But we cannot do it all at once. It seeks to bring about \nscreening technologies for liquid explosives and other hazardous \nmaterials. It has some interoperable language in it.\n  This represents a 32-percent annual increase over the current \nallocation of funds for the Department of Homeland Security. It \nrequires a substantial addition to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The interesting thing--and my friend from Delaware is innovative in \nterms of this--is it does not appropriate the money, but it requires \nthe committee to come forward with a bill to provide $53 billion \nadditional for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  It is a very interesting amendment, there is no question about that. \nThis is another one of those things everyone would like to do if they \nhad the money to do it. Beyond that, the way it is done, it is a \ndifficult amendment to deal with.\n  It is not necessary to carry out the port security bill or the real \nportion of this bill. It deals with an enormous number of issues beyond \nthe scope of the bill. Under the circumstances, I have no alternative \nbut to move to table this amendment. I give my friend from Delaware a \nchance if he wishes to make a final statement. I move to table the \nSenator's amendment, but I ask that there be consideration of a period \nof time prior to voting on that so the Senator may express his point of \nview; I would say 4 minutes equally divided, or something like that, \nbefore the vote.\n  I have been requested to state that we would like to have that vote \ntake place at 2 p.m. today and prior to the vote have 4 minutes equally \ndivided, with no amendments or other motions in order, and the motion \nto table subject only to the provision of 4 minutes before a vote is \ntaken on that motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4930, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I call for the regular order with \nrespect to amendment No. 4930.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Schumer as a \ncosponsor to 4958.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. At this time, I ask that we return to the regular \norder. I am going to yield 2 minutes to Senator Kerry and then reclaim \nthe remainder of the time set aside for me on the Democratic side with \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object. Just a minute. We do not want to have a whole \nschedule here through one Senator having the floor.\n  What amendment is now pending before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Schumer amendment. The amendment numbered \n4930 is now pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator from New York yielding time on Senator \nSchumer's amendment?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I ask unanimous consent to set aside Senator Schumer's \namendment and return to the regular order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the request for time limitation on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Schumer amendment is the regular order. \nThere is no time agreement on this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not objecting to her setting aside the Schumer \namendment. She has made a request beyond that for a limitation of time \non some amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask to speak on amendment 4958, \nwhich I ask to be pending at this time. The Senator from Massachusetts \nasked for a 2-minute timeframe. I was trying to accommodate the \nSenator. I had been told by our side I would have 20 minutes to speak \non amendment No. 4958.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, if I could clarify for the Senate, on \nour side, what we would like to be able to do over the next half hour, \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts would like 2 minutes, the Senator from \nNew York would like 20 minutes, and we are willing to work with you in \norder to accommodate both those Senators.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't know who has the floor. I think the Senator from \nNew York does.\n  Madam President, we are perfectly willing to enter into a time \nagreement on the Senator's amendment, but we want some allocated to \nthis side, too. We would like to know what the request is for time.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, could I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Kerry be given 2 minutes and I follow with 20 minutes and then \nwe go back to the other side with their procedure as to their speakers?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have no objection to the Senator requesting time for \nherself and the Senator from Massachusetts. I just don't think it is \nright to have a time allocation without consideration of the Senators, \nthat is all.\n  Ms. COLLINS. And without checking with the managers of the bill. We \nhave a great number of Senators who are seeking to bring up their \namendments or speak on the bill, and it would be helpful if the Senator \nfrom New York would work through the managers of the bill.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I spoke with the Senator from \nWashington who is managing the bill on our side. That was the direction \nI received from the Senator from Washington. I would like the record to \nreflect that I am following the direction of the manager of the bill on \nour side.\n  I hope we can move forward now with a unanimous consent order as to \nhow we will proceed going forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New York, and I \nthank the Senate.\n  Madam President, I would like to speak as in morning business.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4958\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, is the pending business before the \nSenate amendment No. 4958?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this amendment goes to the heart of our obligations to \none\n\n[[Page S9478]]\n\nanother with respect to homeland security. It arises out of the attacks \nof 9/11, the extraordinary physical damage that has been done to \nthousands and thousands of New Yorkers and other Americans because they \nresponded to that disaster, because they worked in the area of Ground \nZero, because they lived or volunteered there.\n  Each of us is marked in our own way by the events of 5 years ago. I \nneed not recount them. We have just gone through a very painful \nanniversary of those attacks. My hope is we would not mark this 5-year \nanniversary merely by replayings and speeches and solemn readings of \nthe names of the victims but that it would serve as a reminder of our \nunfinished business and a call to action on behalf of the service and \nsacrifice of first responders, workers, and volunteers who participated \nin the rescue and recovery at Ground Zero.\n  I have worked over the past 5 years to honor the memories of those \nwho died, to take care of their families, and to help rebuild New York. \nI have fought for the funding that has generously been offered by the \nAmerican people to support the economic recovery of downtown New York, \nbuilding new buildings, helping to support small businesses, creating \nnew transportation infrastructure to replace that which was \nobliterated. And I have worked to secure funding, starting in the fall \nof 2001, to monitor those who were affected by the exposure to the \ntoxic gases and substances in the air as a result of the attacks and \nthe implosion of the buildings.\n  I believe we have a moral obligation as a nation to take care of \nthose who both took care of us and who attempted to return to their \nordinary lives as a way of demonstrating solidarity and commitment, \nresilience and courage, in the face of the terrorist attacks.\n  There is much we have to do, which is why we are debating this bill \nabout port security. But there is so much more than port security. \nDemocrats offered a comprehensive amendment to this bill that contained \nthe recommendations of many experts, including the 9/11 Commission. \nSadly, it was unsuccessful. But that does not mean it was not merited. \nWe cannot rest until we have a comprehensive, well-funded strategy to \ndeal with the threats we face.\n  But I rise today to talk about a very specific issue. The toll of \nthat fateful day goes beyond the families and friends and colleagues, \nthe brave responders who saved 25,000 people in the greatest rescue \nmission in the history of the world. Their lives will always stand in \nour memory and in honor. But thousands of others rushed into that \nburning inferno. Thousands of others were there when that enormous, \ndevastating cloud of death and destruction covered much of lower \nManhattan, crossed the river to Brooklyn, crossed the river to New \nJersey.\n  We have been working to understand the health implications for the \npeople who breathed that air. That is why I fought to get money for a \nmonitoring and screening program that was established, both at the fire \ndepartment to take care of our firefighters and also at one of our \ngreat hospitals, Mount Sinai, to figure out what happened to everybody \nelse.\n  The work that commenced from the moment the first plane hit was \nhazardous and difficult. For as long as 9 months, we had firefighters \nand police officers, trade and construction workers, other workers, \nvolunteers, residents--we had probably at least 40,000 people coming \nand going and staying on that site. They worked and lived amidst the \ndust and the fog and the smog--a toxic mix of debris, smoke, and \nchemicals.\n  I first visited the site about 24 hours after the attacks. I was \nwithin blocks of the epicenter of the attack, and I could not see \nanything. But I could smell it. I could taste it. I could literally \nfeel it. And as I watched that curtain of darkness part and the \nfirefighters walking out, covered in black soot, dragging their fire \naxes, barely able to stand after being on duty for probably 24 hours, I \nhad the first inkling that the damaging effects of 9/11 would last far \nbeyond the actual attack.\n  Now, unfortunately, our Government officials in charge of making sure \nhealth and working conditions did not negatively impact our first \nresponders sent mixed signals, at best. I would go further. They misled \npeople. They said the air was safe. They made no effort to reach out \nand share the dangers that people knew were in this air.\n  It was not only people from New York who responded; it was people \nfrom all over the country. My colleague, Senator Voinovich from Ohio, \nand I have a bill that would set up a system for the President to carry \nout a program for the monitoring of the health and safety of first \nresponders who are exposed to harmful substances as a result of the \ndisaster, rather than reacting on ad hoc basis, as we have had to do in \nthe wake of 9/11.\n\n  Because of what I witnessed firsthand, and what people started to \ntell me, the trademark World Trade Center cough appeared within days. \nPeople had trouble breathing. They had trouble swallowing. They were \ncoughing. That is why I was so insistent upon getting $12 million to \nestablish the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening \nProgram at Mount Sinai. We quickly realized they would need a lot more \nworkers because thousands and thousands of people were signing up and \ncoming. So we secured an additional $90 million, and we expanded the \nnumber of workers and volunteers, and that was in addition to what we \ndid for the fire department, which ran its own program.\n  Well, last week, Mount Sinai released a report that confirmed our \nworst fears. It confirmed an earlier report of the New York City Fire \nDepartment study. Tens of thousands of firefighters and all the others \nwho were there were not only exposed but were suffering from \nsignificant medical and mental health problems. We are seeing young men \nand women in the prime of their lives, who were in excellent physical \nhealth, experiencing asthma, bronchitis, persistent sinusitis, \nlaryngitis. They are suffering from serious diseases, reactive airwave \ndisease. Their lungs are collapsing. Their livers are polluted. In \nfact, we are now seeing the first deaths.\n  It is not enough to say we stand with the brave men and women who \nresponded when we needed them. We have to do more. We appropriated $125 \nmillion. And after a year and a half of struggle, money that was meant \nto go for the workers' comp system--because so many of these people \ncannot work anymore. They are on disability. They are forced into \nretirement. And so many of them--about 40 percent of them--who were \nscreened at Mount Sinai had no insurance, so they cannot even get the \ntreatment which they now know they need.\n  We have met with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has \npromised to get the money released to begin treating these brave men \nand women. We have worked with Dr. John Howard, the Director of NIOSH, \nwho has documented so many of the diseases and chronic conditions we \nhave seen. But we have a long way to go, and we need to start now.\n  I cannot give you an exact amount of money that it will take to take \ncare of these thousands of people, but we know it is going to be a lot \nmore than the $75 million we are waiting to be released on October 1. \nThat is why this amendment would authorize $1.9 billion in grants to \nbegin the process of setting up the system and over the next 5 years \nimplementing a system to take care of thousands of people who are \ngetting sick and who are dying.\n  We had a bipartisan, bicameral hearing in New York City last week. \nOne of the witnesses, Steve Cetrone, who is a Federal employee, sat \nbefore us--his skin yellowed from the disease of his liver, his memory \nshot, his lungs collapsing--and described in detail how his Government \nhas let him down and left him behind.\n  If we do not take care of these people now and start putting up a \nsystem we can have in place for the next several years, we are going to \nbetray a fundamental responsibility to those whom we salute whenever it \nis convenient, when it is political. But enough with that. They do not \nwant our speeches; they do not want our flowery rhetoric; they want our \nhelp.\n  My amendment uses rough estimates of about $5,800 per individual per \nyear to provide for the continuing monitoring, but, more importantly, \nto provide for the treatment of these individuals. These are the rough \nestimates, the best we have right now from the fire department and \nMount Sinai.\n\n[[Page S9479]]\n\n  But we already know there are people on lung transplant lists who \nwere on that pile. We already know people who have been disabled are \nunable to work and therefore have no insurance any longer. We know \nthere are those who have died because of these exposures.\n  Now, did everybody get sick? No. Will everybody who got sick die? No. \nMuch of it depends upon where you were, what you were exposed to, what \nthe intensity and the length of the exposure was. Some of it also \ndepends upon your predisposition, your susceptibility, your genetic \nmakeup.\n  But take the case of Detective James Zadroga, a 34-year-old detective \nwho joined the NYPD in 1992.\n  He did not smoke. He had no known history of asthma. He was an \nexemplary New York PD detective, the kind they make TV shows about, \nsomeone with a shelf full of commendations, who put himself in harm's \nway time and time again to protect the people of New York. I spent time \nwith his father Joseph, a retired police chief. You will hear about the \n450 hours that this decorated detective spent working on recovery \nefforts on the pile at Ground Zero in 2001. It filled his lungs with \nfiberglass, with pulverized concrete, and other toxic chemicals that \ndestroyed his lungs. The stress and strain of his deteriorating \nphysical condition was followed by the death of his wife, leaving him \nresponsible for his 2-year-old daughter. He died on the floor of his \nbedroom with his little girl trying to wake him.\n  I know this is an authorization bill, and I know that it doesn't \nappropriate money, but it does something equally important: it sets a \nmarker, makes a statement, and it takes all of the words and claims of \nconcern and puts them into action. It says we are not only with you in \nword and deed, but we will not abandon you in your time of need.\n  If, as we hear, September 11 was a day that changed our Nation \nforever, and it is one that Americans will always remember, then let's \nnot lose sight of its lessons. Let's finally heed the recommendations \nof the 9/11 Commission by fully implementing them. Let's do everything \nwe can to make our bridges, tunnels, transit systems, rail lines, our \nentire infrastructure as safe as possible; otherwise, we are going to \nhave a lot of autopsy reports like we had for James Zadroga. We are \ngoing to read about the deaths and disability of thousands of our \nbravest, most courageous men and women. We are going to see \nconstruction workers who, before 9/11, could lift three times their \nbody weight in steel and do whatever was necessary to construct those \nskyscrapers but are now bent over in pain, unable to breathe and sleep. \nI don't think that is what we want as our legacy as a Nation coming out \nof 9/11.\n  This country has been supportive of New York, and I am extremely \ngrateful. But we were on the end of the spear when it came to absorbing \nthe attack and reacting. Now we have to continue to keep faith with \nthose who did our country proud in the hours, days, weeks, and months \nfollowing that horrific attack on our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the consideration of this amendment to honor \nthose who honored us and to create a system to make sure that they do \nnot go without care, that they get the treatment they need, that their \nlife can be saved and prolonged, that we don't lose any more like that \n34-year-old detective. In his autopsy report, the pathologist said:\n\n       It is felt with a reasonable degree of medical certainty \n     that the cause of death in this case was directly related to \n     the 9/11 incident.\n\n  Let's not have any more victims of the terrorists. Let's not let bin \nLaden and al-Qaida claim any more Americans who die as a result of \ntheir evil attack on us. Let's band together and support those who need \nus in their hour. I hope we can make such a statement with this \namendment today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the reports recently released by the \nMount Sinai Center did reveal disturbing news about the long-term \nhealth effects suffered by those working in recovery efforts after \nSeptember 11. It is very disturbing because, clearly, we should make \nevery effort to respond to and monitor the health problems of those who \nwere at or near Ground Zero on that day--the heroes who risked their \nown lives and, apparently, their long-term health by rushing in to \nrescue others.\n  This amendment would direct the Secretary of HHS, acting through the \nDirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to award \ngrants to entities to provide medical and mental health monitoring, \ntracking, and treatment to individuals whose health has been directly \naffected as a result of the attacks on New York City on September 11.\n  I do have some questions about the amendment, however. For one--and I \nsee the sponsors otherwise engaged, but I am going to pose the question \nanyway. Again, I am very sympathetic. I think we have an obligation to \nthose rescue workers, firefighters, emergency medical personnel, police \nofficers, and others who risked their own lives and health to respond \nto the needs of others.\n  I am concerned that the amendment only applies to those first \nresponders in New York City. There may well be health impacts that were \nsuffered by the rescue workers, firefighters, police officers, and \nothers who responded to the Pentagon. I am concerned that the Senator \nlimits the nearly $2 billion in funding to only New York, and that \ndoesn't seem fair to me. It seems to me that it should apply to both \njurisdictions. I don't know whether there were similar problems in \nPennsylvania, as well, but it seems to me it should be broader.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, may I respond to the Senator?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New York to \nrespond to the question.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I greatly appreciate the Senator's awareness and \ncommitment to doing something to help those who were affected. \nCertainly, from her position as chair of the Homeland Security \nCommittee, she knows as much or more about these issues than any one of \nus. I appreciate greatly the suggestion that we include everyone. I \nmake the following two additional points: Apparently, the rescue \nworkers at the Pentagon were given respiratory equipment, given \nappropriate garb to wear, and were put into decontamination showers. \nThey had the kind of worksite I wish we had had after a couple of days \nwhen the emergency immediately passed. So I wish we had that at Ground \nZero. If there are those suffering from ill effects, I completely agree \nwith the Senator. That is one of the reasons Senator Voinovich and I \nhave joined together to try to expand the ability to treat first \nresponders who come from anywhere. He had a rescue unit that went back \nto Ohio and they are sick.\n  The final point in response to the Senator's question is, our issue \nin New York is somewhat complicated by the fact that the EPA, under \nthen-Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, consistently stated that the \nair was safe, told the city, the State, and the workers that, and that \nthere was no effort made to try to even obtain the respiratory \nequipment and other protective coverings the workers might have needed. \nI agree that we should not leave any of our responders behind, no \nmatter where they came from or who they are.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom New York. The conditions in New York, as far as respiratory \nequipment, may have been different. But I have worked closely with \nSenator Voinovich on his broader bill. We reported it from the Homeland \nSecurity Committee. He offered it today as an amendment. I hope, \nperhaps, we can have a meeting of the minds on what is a real problem. \nWe do not want those who were so brave that horrible day to not receive \nassistance, care, and monitoring for health problems associated with \ntheir bravery, regardless of which environment they were in.\n  The second issue I have to raise is the extent of the resources that \nwill be needed to deal with this issue. I don't know the basis for the \nnearly $2 billion authorization that the Senator has come up with, so I \ncannot comment on it.\n  That leads me to my third point, which is the way the Senator has \ndrafted this amendment, directing the Secretary of HHS, through the \nDirector of the CDC, to allocate the funds. That means it is not in the \njurisdiction of the Homeland Security Committee, or\n\n[[Page S9480]]\n\neven the Commerce Committee or Finance Committee. It is in the \njurisdiction of the HELP Committee. So I have asked staff to notify the \nHELP Committee of this amendment so that they have an opportunity to \nreview it.\n  With that, let me again repeat that I think the Senator from New York \nhas identified a real problem. It is not germane to the underlying port \nsecurity bill, but it is an urgent and real problem. It is in another \ncommittee's jurisdiction. We have a different approach that the \nHomeland Security Committee has taken in working with Senator Voinovich \nbecause this even goes beyond 9/11.\n  I know the Senator from New York has also worked with Senator \nVoinovich on his amendment, which is under the Homeland Security \nCommittee's jurisdiction. So I suggest that we get some input from \nSenator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, since they are the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong favor of the \namendment offered by the Senator from New York. I have listened \ncarefully to the reasons the other side is objecting. At this stage, it \nsounds as if they are objecting. I hope they will accept this \namendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. There is not necessarily an objection. I don't know \nbecause it is not under the jurisdiction of the committee that I am \nprivileged to chair. So I don't want to prejudge whether there is an \nobjection from the HELP Committee or not because I don't know. I have \nsaluted the Senator from New York for bringing a very real problem to \nour attention, although I wish it were on a different bill. I wish we \nwould move the Voinovich bill separately, which has been on the \ncalendar for a long time. I don't know that there is an objection on \nthis side.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. A point of clarification, Mr. President. I believe the \namendment builds on the World Trade Center monitoring program which did \ngo through Homeland Security. That may not be the best way to proceed \nin the future, but that is an existing structure.\n  I absolutely agree with the Senator from Maine that the Voinovich \nbill will give us an opportunity to avoid these problems in the future, \nwhich has to be one of our primary goals.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am glad that I said what I did because \nmaybe we have a chance to see this amendment get a favorable response \nin the Senate. It is true that this is broader than a port security \nbill, but so was Senator McCain's amendment and Senator Shelby's \namendment. We are broadening this bill because I believe this is our \nlast opportunity to address the issue of homeland defense.\n  This is a great opportunity to look back at what we have done right \nand what we have done wrong. And one of the things that was wrong was \nwhen Christie Todd Whitman, then head of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, came before my committee, the Environment Committee, and said \nthe air was safe. She said the air was safe. People were down there at \nthat site. The Senators from New York, Senator Clinton and Senator \nSchumer, know best how people are suffering, but I can tell you, in \nCalifornia, when we had fierce fires and we had horrible problems that \nbefell our first responders, I wrote a bill. At that time, we could not \nget a bill through that said that these first responders, these bravest \nof the brave, deserve to have health care. Many of them were working \npart time and didn't have health benefits. Many of them lost their jobs \nand lost their health benefits. That is what is happening to those who \nworked at the World Trade Center site.\n  Senator Collins makes some good points about jurisdiction, but I \ndon't think the families who are seeing their loved ones wheeze and \ncough--and one I just read about died literally holding the hand of his \n4-year-old--care that this bill before us is about the Department of \nHomeland Security but the amendment deals with the first responders \nthrough another agency. That is why politicians get such bad names \nsometimes, because we come up with the craziest reasons for saying we \ncan't support something. I am encouraged that Senator Collins said not \nnecessarily, that she may, in fact, support this bill.\n  Words are cheap. We can say anything we want; it is free. But if you \nmean what you say, that the first responders are heroes, if you mean \nwhat you say when you say they should be lauded, remembered, their \nfamilies protected, and all the rest, then do something about it.\n  I am so pleased that the Senator from New York has given this Senate \na chance to say thank you and to say we are sorry because some of the \npeople were told the air was fine when it wasn't.\n  I hope we will stand up and be counted. As I said earlier today, I am \nso glad we have the subject of homeland defense before this Senate. It \ncomes in the form of a port security bill that Senators Collins and \nMurray worked on and on which many members of the Commerce Committee \nand other committees have also worked.\n  This is a good bill, but we can't leave here thinking that because we \ndid a port security bill, we have addressed the issue of homeland \nsecurity and all the ramifications that followed from 9/11. We are \nmaking this bill better. We are making it more like the Reid amendment. \nWe are going after rail security. We are going after transit security. \nAnd now with the Clinton amendment, we have a chance to help those who \ndeserve to be helped--the heroes of 9/11.\n  We were just reminded--we saw the scenes, we saw their selflessness, \nand this is a chance for everyone who spoke about them to cast a \n``yea'' vote for them. That is an opportunity we should not miss today.\n  Again, my thanks go to the Senator from New York and my colleagues \nfor allowing debate on this very important amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clinton amendment is the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of \norder for as long as I may consume, not to exceed 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor not to exceed 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, September 11 has come and gone, and as we \nremember those who were lost, those lives that were lost on that awful \nday, that fateful day, and contemplate events since the horrific \nattack, one truth stands out: The war in Iraq has backfired, producing \nmore recruits for terrorism and deep divisions within even our own \ncountry. It is a war we should never have begun.\n  The detour from our attack on bin Laden and his minions hiding in the \ncracks and crevices of the rough terrain of Afghanistan, to the unwise \nand unprovoked attack on Iraq, has been a disastrous one.\n  Mr. Bush's war has damaged the country because he drove our blessed \nland into an unnecessary conflict, utterly misreading the consequences, \nwith the result now being a daily display of America's vulnerabilities \nto those who wish us ill. The United States is a weaker power now, \nespecially in the Middle East but also in the court of world opinion. \nWhere, where, where is the America of restraint? Where is the America \nof peace and of inspiration to millions? Where is the America respected \nnot only for her military might but also for her powerful--her \npowerful--ideas and her reasonable diplomacy?\n\n  Our country may have deviated occasionally from its positive global \nimage in the past, but Abu Ghraib, the body snatching for torture, \neuphemistically called rendition, Presidential directives which \nunilaterally altered conditions of the Geneva Conventions--these\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\nare not the stuff of mere slight deviations from the America of \npeacefulness, the America of fairness, and the America of goodwill. \nThese are major policy and attitudinal changes of tsunami-sized \nproportions--tsunami-sized proportions. Our friends shake their heads \nin disbelief. Our enemies nod wisely and claim they knew all the while. \nI cannot remember a time in our history when our elected leaders have \nfailed the people so completely, and yet, so far, are not held \naccountable for costly misjudgments and outright deceptions.\n  Take our Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, for example. He \nmisread the Iraqi situation completely and entirely. He adamantly \ndismisses suggestions for a larger force in Iraq. He failed to object \nwhen the White House's Coalition Provisional Authority disbanded the \nIraqi Army, only to have them go underground and provide fodder for the \ninsurgency. Yes, he insisted that the Iraqi people would view our \nsoldiers as liberators, not occupiers, and even failed to properly \nanticipate the equipment needs of our men and women in harm's way. Who \nam I talking about? Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.\n  He continues to insist that we are not facing a civil war in Iraq, \ndespite convincing evidence to the contrary. Yet he sits comfortably in \nhis office as the echo of his errors in judgment and strategy continue \nto cost thousands of lives--thousands of lives.\n  Then there is President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. These \nmen continue to try to make the American public swallow whole the line \nthat the war in Iraq is the frontline of a global war on terror which \nmust be continued at all costs. Stay the course, they say, stay the \ncourse despite 3 years of discouragingly little progress in Iraq. The \nbody count is approaching 2,700 for our side, tens of thousands for the \nbeleaguered Iraqi people. We ought to think of them, too. Tens of \nthousands of men, women, and children, the Iraqi people, and billions--\nbillions, I say--billions of American tax dollars of which an \nembarrassingly large chunk has been wasted by irresponsible contractors \nand Government officials who lack the proper respect for the public \npurse. Many of our allies have left the field, recognizing the truth \nthat the administration fails to see; namely, we had the weapons to win \nthe war but not the wisdom to secure the peace.\n  Yet too many in the public are utterly complacent about the numerous \nviolations of the public trust and the continuing loss of human life in \nIraq. Some of our citizens have apparently been convinced that it is \nunpatriotic to criticize one's country when that country is engaged in \nan armed conflict. In fact, in our land today, there is a troubling \ntolerance for Government overreaching on fronts at home as well as \nabroad. This administration has repeatedly used fear and flag-waving to \nblunt the traditional American insistence on the Bill of Rights: \npersonal freedom of thought and action, privacy, and one's right to \nspeak and write as one pleases. Such a cynical exercise on the part of \nhigh officials of our Government is unconscionable. It is shameful \nbehavior for which there is no excuse--no excuse, none.\n  The Congress, under the control of the President's party, has been \nsubmissive--submissive, a lap dog wagging its tail in appreciation of \nWhite House secrecy and deception. Yes, a lap dog Congress. Yes, we. \nEven the vast majority of the opposition party has been too quiet for \ntoo long, unable to find its voice, stunted by the demand to support \nthe troops. We forget too often that there is a very real difference \nbetween support for the troops and support for an unnecessary war. The \nmen and women of our military did not ask to go--no, they didn't ask to \ngo to those faraway places, but they were willing. They went. They \nanswered their country's call. We have an obligation to support them, \nbut we do not need to follow blindly the unthinking policies that keep \nthem mired in a country that is in the middle of a civil war.\n  The American public is our last best hope now. You out there who are \nwatching through those lenses, you are our last great hope, the \nAmerican people. Our people must demand more from their \nrepresentatives--from me, for one--their representatives in Congress, \nand from their leaders in the White House. Donald Rumsfeld should be \nreplaced by the President because he has made so many grievous errors \nin judgment on Iraq and because a new voice--hear me now--a new voice \nat the helm at the Department of Defense could be a breath of fresh \nair--fresh air--yes, fresh air for our policies in Iraq. Mr. Rumsfeld's \nreplacement would be good--good--for our country. Yet even a sense-of-\nthe-Senate vote of no confidence in Mr. Rumsfeld's leadership has been \nblocked by the President's party in the Senate. Personal accountability \nhas been long absent from this administration, and I would like to see \nit returned.\n  One would hope that men and women who rise to positions of awesome \nresponsibility would have the grace, the dignity, and the honor to know \nin their own hearts when a well-timed resignation would advance \npatriotic goals. But too often, the selfish love of power or some \nmisguided show of toughness wins the day to the detriment of our \ncountry's fortunes. Donald Rumsfeld ought to step down or his \nPresident, Mr. Bush, ought to ask him to step down. There is too much \nat stake for any other course.\n  Personally, I believe the President is being derelict in his duties \nif he does not ask for Mr. Rumsfeld's latchkey. The bungling and the \nloss of life attendant to this tragic--this tragic--3-year-long debacle \nin Iraq have hurt this country, hurt its public image, and hurt its \nability to achieve numerous other national and international goals. \nThat kind of dangerous ineptitude should not be excused. It should not \nbe excused. But like so many things, when it comes to Iraq and the \nMiddle East in general, the United States of America is stuck in \nneutral, with the only thing showing vigorous movement--the ever-\nspiraling price of gasoline. We have destabilized the Middle East and \nhanded the Mullahs a way to affect the daily lives and livelihood of \nevery American, and the efficacy of our military might: the oil supply \nlines upon which our own economy and our own military depend.\n  Now that oil supply is the favorite target for terrorists who have \nlearned the joys of bombing pipelines and listening to America bite its \nnails about the high cost of gasoline while it laments its lack of \nforesight in developing alternative fuels.\n  Now we have passed yet another anniversary of the bloody attacks \nwhich precipitated the disastrous situation in which our country finds \nitself today. Yet while we mourn, there are hard truths to confront. \nOur attention has been shifted by design and deception too quickly from \nthe war in Afghanistan, a war that we needed to fight, a war that we \nneeded to win. Now the Taliban is on the rise in that country. Al-Qaida \ncontinues to find sanctuary in the mountains, violence is on the rise, \nand peace and stability are in jeopardy.\n  North Korea, probably reacting to our doctrine of preemption--a very \nunconstitutional-on-its-face doctrine--North Korea, probably reacting \nto our doctrine of preemption and our newfound bellicosity, has \nincreased its nuclear capability. Iran has been emboldened by our \ninability to stop the violence in Iraq and by the lukewarm support that \nwe have garnered from traditional allies. Even the people of Turkey--\neven the people of Turkey, one of the United States's staunchest \nallies, Turkey, a member of NATO, and a model, yes, a model of secular \nMuslim democracy--have turned against us.\n  A survey, conducted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, \nindicates that Iran has become one of the most popular countries in \nTurkey and that there is a growing willingness to identify with radical \nIslam. A display of ineptitude and spectacular miscalculation in Iraq \nhas cost us dearly. Disenchantment at home with the dismal results in \nIraq will have reverberations for years, much like the failure in \nVietnam did in the 1960s.\n  President Bush insists that his war must go on. He defends \nwarrantless wiretapping of our own citizens as essential to his cause, \ndespite a Court decision that the President has no such authority under \nour Constitution--our Constitution, this Constitution. He defends \ntorture and rendition and says that they have produced valuable \nevidence which has subverted several terror attacks on our country. But \nhis\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\ncredibility is so damaged that it is difficult to believe him. He \ndemands the authority to hold terror suspects indefinitely and then to \ntry them using military tribunals which deny basic rights, also in \ndefiance of a Supreme Court ruling. He seems convinced that he can win \na global war on terror despite the demonstrated failure of his policies \nof unilateralism, militarism, overheated rhetoric, and a pathological \ndislike of diplomacy.\n  So it is up to the Congress--up to us, the Congress, the people's \nbranch--to change course and to stop the heinous raiding of \nconstitutionally protected liberties by a White House which does not \nfully appreciate the true meaning of the word liberty, the true meaning \nof the word freedom.\n  My fellow Senators, I hope that we may find the courage.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4975\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 4 minutes of debate equally divided on the motion to table \nthe Biden amendment.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to take 1 minute and reserve \n1 minute. I make this motion to table because I believe this amendment \nis so comprehensive, it really doesn't belong on this bill. The concept \nof the funding for the activities recommended by the Biden amendment is \nthe amendment mandates the committee to bring out a bill to provide the \nfunding. It would be an increase of $32.8 billion for the Homeland \nSecurity Department; that is a 19-percent increase over the amount that \nhas already been allocated. We do not need that. This is not the place \nto consider that, anyway. This deals with restoring the cuts that have \ntaken place in law enforcement areas. It is looking at liquid \nexplosives and hazardous materials concepts. It has a whole series of \nthings in here that deal with funding--money for more FBI agents, more \nmoney for Justice Assistance grants, more money for Customs agents. A \nwhole series of things are involved. It is two pages long.\n  The money that would be authorized by the funds that the Biden \namendment would mandate we provide under the appropriate procedures.\n  Being essentially a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, it is difficult \nto deal with, but that kind of resolution becomes a mandate in the next \nyear.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. What happens if \nthe Senator does not arrive and the time comes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains approximately 20 seconds in \nopposition to the motion.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me use the remainder of my other minute, then.\n  I point out to the Senate that this amendment would create a new \ntrust fund, and into that trust fund would go the moneys that would \ncome from the mandate to the Finance Committee to reduce the scheduled \nand existing income tax reductions enacted since the taxable year 2001 \nwith respect to what taxpayers earn in excess of $1 million a year. \nThat is a laudable thing, but this is not just a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution; it is a mandate to the Senate to do this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the question occurs on the motion to table \nthe Biden amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Rhode Island (Mr. Chafee).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 244 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Akaka\n     Chafee\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Senator Baucus's 10,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with this last vote, the senior Senator from \nMontana, Max Baucus, casts his 10,000th vote. He has entered into very \ngood company having cast his 10,000th vote. Senator Sarbanes, Senator \nLugar, and Senator Hatch are in the company with him.\n  I applaud and congratulate my friend, Max Baucus. He has served a \nlifetime representing the people of the State of Montana. He was \nelected to the Montana State Legislature in 1973, the House of \nRepresentatives of the United States the next year, in 1978 elected to \nthe Senate. He has a compelling background. He was raised on a ranch \nnear Helena, MT.\n  One of the fascinating things that speaks of Senator Baucus's \npersonality, he did not know as a young man what he wanted to do. So to \nget his thoughts together and his head on straight, as he said, he \ndecided he would travel the world. And he did that, by himself, \nhitchhiking and catching rides, and when he had a few dollars, he would \ncatch some type of public transportation. He traveled the world over. \nHe got very sick on an occasion or two drinking water that was not like \nwater in Helena, MT.\n  I repeat, it speaks of who Max Baucus is. He has an outstanding \neducation. He was educated in one of the finest university's in the \nworld, Stanford, for both his undergraduate work and for his law \ndegree.\n  When I was elected to the Senate, the first person to reach out to me \nsocially was Max Baucus. He invited me to his home, where I met his \nlovely wife Wanda. Now, in the years since, because of our Senate \nschedules being as busy as they are, we have not done a lot of things \nsocially. I speak to Wanda a lot on the telephone, trying to find \nSenator Baucus. She is, to me, a fascinating woman--whether she is \ndoing her painting or writing a book, she is always doing something \nintriguing. They have a wonderful son Zeno.\n  We all shared in the tragedy that occurred in Senator Baucus's life \nduring the past few weeks when his nephew--who to Senator Baucus was \nlike a son--United States Marine Corpsman Phillip Baucus, was killed in \nIraq serving our country.\n  I am almost embarrassed to talk about Max's athletic accomplishments \nbecause mine so pale in comparison. I always feel kind of good about \nthe fact that I have run a lot of marathons. Marathons are nothing for \nMax Baucus. He has run 50-mile races, 100-mile races. Remember, a \nmarathon is only a little over 26 miles. But in one race, he has run \nfour times the marathon that I and others run.\n  Senator Baucus has been chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, chairman of the Committee on Finance, ranking member now. He \nset a great example to me as I\n\n[[Page S9483]]\n\nwas then a junior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee \non the first highway transportation bill, working with him and Senator \nMoynihan.\n  One of the things I recognize with Senator Baucus is he has been a \ngreat leader for our caucus and the Senate, from Social Security to the \neconomy. Generally, we look to him for guidance.\n  One of the things I also appreciate and admire in Senator Baucus is \nthe working relationship that he has with Senator Grassley. They do not \nalways agree on issues, but they have a real partnership in that \nCommittee on Finance. I think they set an example for what all Senators \nshould do, and certainly all chairman and ranking members. I so \nappreciate their working together. I repeat, they do not always agree, \nbut they never are disagreeable in their disagreements.\n  I know I speak for all Montanans, and I know I speak for all \nDemocratic Senators, and I am sure Republican Senators, in expressing \nour admiration and respect for Senator Baucus in casting his 10,000th \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if I could follow on in the same vein in \norder to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, knowing Senator Baucus, I bet he is so busy that he \nprobably didn't even realize he was casting his 10,000th vote. I know \nit is a very major accomplishment; very few Members do that.\n  I congratulate him. That signifies a lot of hard work in and of \nitself, but I think of the really hard work that Senator Baucus does \nworking as a member of the Senate Committee on Finance--sometimes as \nchairman, sometimes as ranking member--and, more importantly, not just \nworking hard but working in a cooperative way to get things done.\n  I honor him. I didn't know anything about it. I am glad to hear about \nit. He should be recognized, and I thank him for the cooperation he has \ngiven to me over the years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Iowa. I thank all \nmy friends, especially Senator Reid and Senator Grassley. I had no idea \nI cast 10,000 votes until someone said it was the 10,000th about 15 \nminutes ago.\n  I have several thoughts. No. 1, it is such a privilege to represent \nthe State of Montana. I have 900,000 of the world's best bosses. You \ncould not ask for better employers than the people of the State of \nMontana. I am so grateful to have the privilege to serve my 900,000 \nconstituents.\n  Second, I am reminded a little bit of years past. There have been \nvery great Senators serving this body, a time when there was more \nagreement, more bipartisanship. It was not quite as partisan as it is \ntoday. I hope over the next 1,000 votes, or however many are cast, we \nmove to a time of more bipartisanship; that we do work together.\n  Senator Grassley and I are very lucky to work closely together. I am \nhonored to work with him. There have been a lot of major votes I am \nproud of. There are a couple, as I look back, I wish I had not cast. \nBut that's life. We do the very best we can, and most of us do a pretty \ngood job.\n  I thank my friends. I thank my colleagues. I thank everyone else who \nis part of the larger Senate for all that you do. It means a lot to me.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Before I call up an amendment, I will say a \nword about Senator Baucus. It is a measure of the man in times of \ntragedy how one will stand tall and be a healing force among the \nbereaved. In this terrible tragedy his family has had, the son of his \nbrother being killed in Iraq, Senator Baucus was able to bring comfort \nto his family, and particularly to his brother, by going to the Air \nForce Base and receiving the body of his nephew and then escorting the \ncoffin all the way to Montana, and returning that body, as the Good \nBook says, from dust to dust.\n  I want to add my personal comments of appreciation for the life of \nSenator Baucus and especially for his public service.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4968\n\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4968.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments are set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4968.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Department of Homeland Security provide \nCongress with a strategy for deploying radiation detection capabilities \n                  to all United States ports of entry)\n\n       On page 27, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       (h) Expansion to Other United States Ports of Entry.--\n       (1) In general.--As soon as practicable after--\n       (A) implementation of the program for the examination of \n     containers for radiation at ports of entry described in \n     subsection (a), and\n       (B) submission of the strategy developed under subsection \n     (b) (and updating, if any, of that strategy under subsection \n     (c)),\n     but no later than December 31, 2008, the Secretary shall \n     expand the strategy developed under subsection (b), in a \n     manner consistent with the requirements of subsection (b), to \n     provide for the deployment of radiation detection \n     capabilities at all other United States ports of entry not \n     covered by the strategy developed under subsection (b).\n       (2) Risk assessment.--In expanding the strategy under \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall identify and assess the \n     risks to those other ports of entry in order to determine \n     what equipment and practices will best mitigate the risks.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the 9/11 Commission Report \nsaid:\n\n       [O]pportunities for terrorists to do us harm are as great--\n     or greater--in our shipping ports as they are in commercial \n     aviation.\n\n  We have done a pretty good job in tightening up the security of our \nairports but not so in our seaports. That is the purpose of this whole \nbill on port security.\n  A respected policy center that studies terrorism looked at what would \nhappen if a 10-kiloton bomb was detonated in a seaport--in this \nparticular simulation, the Port of Long Beach, CA. They pointed out \nthat 60,000 people would die instantly, and another 150,000 would \nsuffer radiation poisoning, and some 2 to 3 million people would have \nto be relocated as a result of the contaminated land. Of course, the \ncost to our Nation's economy would be enormous--about $1 trillion under \nthat scenario.\n  Most experts agree that our ports are not only vulnerable but also \nthe damage resulting from an attack could be catastrophic. Where are \nmost of the ports located? Mostly, they are snuggled up to, close to, a \ndowntown, a highly dense urban community.\n  The State I represent, Florida, is home to 14 deepwater ports, so we \nhave the task we are trying to address in this bill of protecting these \nports and protecting the peace and security of our people.\n  The outcome of this fight has very broad implications for our \ncountry. All of our Nation's 88 ports that handle cargo containers \nstill remain vulnerable. Only--we are estimating--6 percent of all the \ncargo coming into these ports is fully inspected.\n  Our own Department of Homeland Security says three out of four \nAmerican ports do not have the equipment to screen for nuclear weapons \nor for a dirty bomb, which is a conventional weapon designed to spread \nradioactive material. And the Congressional Budget Office says the \nPresident's proposed plan falls about $130 million short of what is \nneeded to protect these ports.\n  I recall my former colleague from Florida, the former chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, former Senator Bob Graham, recently warned that \nthe increase in Federal spending was not enough to adequately protect \nports. This former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said \nthat if he were a terrorist, he would know exactly how to go about \nwreaking havoc--he would head for a port with lax security and then do \nhis dirty work.\n  In the legislation before us, we have taken a giant step in the right \ndirection. We are proposing to secure 22 of our Nation's busiest \ncontainer ports. But what about the other 66 domestic container ports? \nShouldn't they receive the scrutiny? And shouldn't we protect the \nadditional 273 secondary sea and river ports in the United States?\n\n[[Page S9484]]\n\n  Certainly, we should. That is why I offer this amendment today, which \nwill direct the Homeland Security Secretary to develop a strategy for \nthe deployment of radiation detection capabilities at every U.S. port. \nI believe it is going to make all of us a little bit safer. There has \nbeen enough delay. Now it is time to do this. And we should do it \nright. So this legislation is the implementation of a program for the \nexamination of containers for radiation at ports of entry described in \nthe bill, not just the 22 major ports.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the port security legislation we are \nconsidering requires that radiation detection equipment be installed in \nthe busiest 22 ports of entry by the end of next year. That would \nresult in 98 percent of all cargo coming into this country being \nscreened for radiation or radiological devices.\n  The Senator's amendment raises the question of, What about those \nsmaller ports? Doesn't this invite, for example, terrorists, knowing \nthey will be screened at the 22 largest ports, to instead divert \ndangerous cargo to a small port?\n  The Department of Homeland Security wants to make sure it has \nflexibility to do, perhaps, handheld devices for screening rather than \nthe expensive, large radiation portal monitors that are at big ports, \nsuch as Seattle.\n  I would pose a question, through the Chair, to the Senator from \nFlorida, whether there is anything in his amendment that speaks to the \ntype of equipment that must be installed, because obviously, if you \nhave a very small port that only gets a couple of cargo ships per year, \nit may not make sense to invest in radiation portal monitors, but it \nmay make sense to, instead, assume that the Customs and Border Patrol \nagents are equipped with handheld screening devices, which still \nscreen.\n  So I would ask, through the Chair, my colleague from Florida whether \nhis amendment, as I read it, gives flexibility to the Department as to \nthe types of equipment, in keeping with the fact there are different \nneeds and different volumes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Florida \nwill be given the opportunity to reply.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Well, indeed, thank you, Mr. President.\n  The Senator from Maine is exactly correct. There is the flexibility \nin the amendment for the Department to make that determination because \nit is specifying the implementation of a program for examination of \ncontainers for radiation at ports of entry.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his \nclarification.\n  With that understanding, I am pleased to recommend that the Senate \nadopt his amendment.\n  I yield to the Democratic manager of the bill to see if we could \nclear this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have cleared this amendment on the \nDemocratic side, and we are happy to move forward with its adoption \nright now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4968) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is there objection to \nsetting aside the pending amendment?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we have had a lot of amendments offered \non the Democratic side, and there are Republican Senators who are eager \nto come to the floor--Senator Coburn, Senator DeMint, Senator \nVoinovich--to complete the action on their amendments. I thought we had \nan understanding that we were going back and forth, but instead we seem \nto be doing Democratic amendment after Democratic amendment after \nDemocratic amendment. So until I get some clarification on how we are \ngoing to proceed, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I totally understand the concerns of the \nSenator from Maine. I just would like to request--we only have one \nSenator on our side at this time who wants to bring up an amendment, \nand there are no Republicans here at this time. He is the only one I am \naware of right now who is here in the Chamber ready to go. If it would \nnot be objectionable, if it would be all right that he could just offer \nhis amendment, he just wants to call it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it would be helpful if the Democratic \nmanager of the bill or the sponsor of the amendment gave us some idea \nas to the subject of the amendment and whether the Senator from New \nJersey is seeking a full debate on it or just wants to call it up \nbriefly--or what his intentions are.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has an amendment that we are trying to \nput in a block of amendments to deal with the issue of scanning cargo. \nThere are three such amendments that are pending: the amendment of the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer; the amendment of the Senator from \nNew Jersey; and the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. I need \nmore information about the Senator's intentions, given he has filed \nmore than one amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from New Jersey \njust wants to call up his amendment and speak for a few minutes, if I \nam not incorrect.\n  I say to the Senator from New Jersey, if you could just tell us--I \nbelieve it has been shared on both sides.\n  I say to the Senator from Maine, I know your staff has a copy of it.\n  But if the Senator could just explain his intentions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, my amendment is amendment No. 4999. It \nis to ultimately have a plan to move toward the scanning of cargo. I \nintend to speak for about 10 minutes on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, then I am going to have to object to the \nSenator proceeding at this time because we have proposed that all three \namendments that deal with the scanning or screening of cargo be \nconsidered together, including the amendment of the Senator from New \nJersey. If we can get an agreement where we could consider and debate \nall three amendments and then have three consecutive votes on those \namendments, then I would not object. But if we cannot get that \nagreement, then I do object.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Coleman \namendment No. 4982, to be followed by a vote in relation to the \nMenendez amendment No. 4999, with no amendment in order to either \namendment prior to the vote; finally, that the time until the vote be \nequally divided between the two managers or their designees, and that \nthere will be 2 minutes equally divided of debate prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have no objection to this agreement. I \nthank the manager for working through this with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n\n[[Page S9485]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4999\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 4999 be \ncalled up at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4999.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To improve the security of cargo containers destined for the \n                             United States)\n\n       On page 30, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 126.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Inouye, \nSenator Murray, and Senator Collins, for their work and attention to \nthis critical subject. I am pleased to stand with them in trying to \nwork to ensure that a concrete port security measure takes place that \nmakes our Nation's ports safer than they are presently.\n  We have just commemorated the fifth anniversary of the September 11 \nattacks. I cannot think of a way in which we can learn from those \nlessons more than to finally come to an agreement on a strong, well-\nfunded port security bill. For those of us who represent States such as \nmine, New Jersey, with the largest ports in the country, it is not a \nmoment too soon. In fact, some would argue that it comes rather late in \nthe game. I have to agree.\n  Five years after that tragic September day, nearly 4 years after \nCongress passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act, and 2 years \nafter the September 11 Commission issued its report and its 41 \nrecommendations, our Nation's busiest ports remain underfunded, \nunderstaffed, and overwhelmed. A myriad of new stories over the last \nweek in the runup of the fifth anniversary of September 11 have \nconsistently pointed to one irrefutable fact: our ports remain \nvulnerable to a terrorist attack. This is not news for some of us.\n  In December of 2001, I introduced a port security measure in the \nHouse of Representatives which sought to fully understand the \nvulnerabilities we face at all of our ports. I certainly hope this will \nmove us along in that way. I urge, certainly, that we come to that \nconclusion.\n  Let's remember that an attack at our ports would not just hurt trade \nand commerce. Such an attack at a port would devastate surrounding \ncommunities. In August, the Rand Corporation released a report \nconcluding that ``a nuclear explosion at the port of Long Beach could \nkill 60,000 people immediately, expose 150,000 more to radiation, and \ncause 10 times the economic loss of the September 11 attacks.''\n  In my State of New Jersey, the Elizabeth-Newark Port, the largest \ncontainer seaport on the east coast, handled more than $132 billion in \ngoods in 2005 and creates over 200,000 jobs. Imagine what would happen \nto the Nation--not just New York or New Jersey--if commerce were shut \ndown in this port. Imagine the number of lives in that immediate \nregion, one of the greatest concentrations of population in the Nation.\n  According to retired Coast Guard CDR Stephen Flynn, the cargo \ncontainers ``are a potential Trojan horse in the age of terrorism.'' He \nis right. Mr. Flynn pointed out that we are not keeping pace with the \nterrorists' capabilities. The threat continues to evolve. When we \npatched up one security hole, they found another gap, another \nvulnerability.\n  In December 2005, small undercover teams of investigators from the \nGovernment Accountability Office were able to carry small amounts of \nCesium 137, a radioactive material used for medical and industrial \npurposes, in the trunks of rental cars in the States of Washington and \nTexas. The Washington Post reported that the radioactive materials did \nset off alarms, but GAO agents were able to use phony documents to \npersuade U.S. border guards and Customs officers to let them pass into \nthe country.\n  As long as cargo containers remain a mainstay of international \ncommerce, and as long as we cannot verify what is inside each and every \none of them, we are vulnerable.\n  Right now, only 5 percent of containers entering this country are \ninspected. That is a number which I believe would shock most Americans. \nLet me be clear. It would be unacceptable to screen only 5 percent of \nWhite House visitors every day, so why is it acceptable to scan only 5 \npercent of cargo entering our country every day? Scanning anything less \nthan 100 percent of cargo that enters our ports is irresponsible and \ndownright negligent. Only scanning 5 percent of cargo containers that \nenter our ports is the equivalent of locking the car doors but leaving \nthe windows down and the keys in the ignition. It is unacceptable.\n  Even the system we now use to determine which of the 5 percent of \ncontainers to inspect is riddled with flaws. Customs inspectors rely on \nmanifests and intelligence data--both of which can be unintentionally \nincorrect or even manipulated--to develop algorithms that tell them \nwhich container to open. We cannot take the risk that complex \nmathematical equations relying on faulty inputs will catch a chemical, \nnuclear, or biological weapon shipped into our ports. We need to \ndevelop a system that will eventually ensure that 100 percent of \ncontainers bound for this country are inspected, either physically or \nthrough effective nonintrusive scanning that will find and detect \nweapons no matter how they are disguised.\n  We need to take advantage of existing technologies that can scan the \ninside of a container, even before it leaves a foreign port, and create \na downloadable image of what is inside. That image can be reviewed in \nreal time by security officials in the United States so we know exactly \nwhat the container holds before it even sets sail for our shores. By \ncombining this technology with scans for radioactive material, we can \nfind dangerous materials before they ever arrive in our ports.\n  Port security is a serious matter that should be addressed with a \ncomprehensive and consistent plan, not a game of ``Eeny Meeny Miney \nMo'' to figure out which cargo container to scan. Five years after \nSeptember 11, we must have a plan, a clear roadmap that describes how \nwe will move our Nation to 100 percent scanning at our ports. To \naccomplish this, this amendment would require just that: to produce an \ninitial plan, a tangible document that clearly outlines how to increase \nscanning to 100 percent at our ports. The plan must include yearly \nbenchmarks and consequences for supply chain entities that fail to \ncomply, and this could include loss of access to U.S. ports and levying \nof fines.\n  My amendment also includes a requirement for an update of the initial \n100-percent scanning plan that would include lessons learned from the \npilot system.\n  The definition of 100 percent scanning is very important here, and I \nhope\n\n[[Page S9486]]\n\nour colleagues will focus on this issue. The American public should not \nbe misled by anyone stating that screening is sufficient or that \noffering amendments for 100-percent screening is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Let me be very clear: 100 percent screening means just looking at \nmanifests, manifests that are often incomplete and incorrect. Relying \non manifests is simply not the way to ensure cargo containers do not \ncontain items they should not, items that could endanger the security \nof our ports, the surrounding communities, and the people in our \ncountry.\n  I want to emphasize that I am not calling for all containers entering \nthe United States to be opened up and examined. What I am calling for, \nand something that is well within our technical capabilities, is to \nensure that all containers entering the United States have been scanned \nusing nonintrusive technology.\n  But to get to 100 percent container inspection and to have true \ncontainer security, we also need to take immediate steps to put \nscanners in place here and abroad to track containers as they move \nacross the ocean and to start protecting against not only nuclear but \nchemical and biological agents.\n  In conclusion, we have been debating the details of this cargo \ninspection regime for far too long. It is not a new issue. But the time \nhas come to act decisively and with one voice to make our ports safer \nthan they are now.\n  Five years after September 11, we still do not know what is entering \nour ports. Recently, a commercial airplane was diverted because someone \nforgot their BlackBerry on board. Yet thousands of cargo containers \nstream into our Nation every day without us knowing exactly what they \ncontain.\n  Just this past Monday, we commemorated the fifth anniversary of the \nattacks that shocked the Nation and took the lives of 3,000 Americans, \nincluding 700 New Jerseyans. We must remember the terrorists used \nmethods beyond our wildest imaginations and spurred the Congress into \nsome action to better protect our Nation. Here we stand 5 years later \nand we are still not scanning 100 percent of the cargo that enters our \ncountry. We are tempting fate in a most reckless way. We have \nidentified a clear vulnerability and we must do everything we can to \ndecrease the threat before it is too late.\n  If we could roll back the clock 10 years and spend a few billion \ndollars to raise the levees in New Orleans to be able to withstand a \ncategory 5 hurricane, we would have saved hundreds of lives, as well as \nthe billions of dollars it will take to rebuild that city. I don't want \nthis country to look back in hindsight a few years from now with the \nrealization that if we had taken action today, we could have prevented \na major terrorist attack. Who among us would be satisfied in the \naftermath of an attack that we did not take the steps that could have \nprevented it because we were unwilling to dedicate the necessary \nresources? That is the choice the Congress faces and the Senate faces \ntoday. And for the security of our country, it is essential that we \nmake the right one.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that we can do so \nand move toward a plan that will give us 100 percent scanning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the comments of \nthe Senator from New Jersey in which he advocates for 100 percent \nscanning. He says, for example, that is the only way we can be safe, \nthat we would never scan just 5 percent of the people coming to the \nWhite House. I think there is a lot of misunderstanding about how the \ncurrent system works, so let me start with an explanation of the \nlayered system of security we have at our ports right now.\n  First, all cargo manifests are submitted to authorities 24 hours \nbefore ships pull into ports. The automated targeting system is a \nsophisticated analysis that looks at where did the cargo come from, \nwhat is its destination, what is the cargo, who are the shippers \ninvolved, who is the retailer or other recipient of the cargo. Through \na classified system, those and other factors are considered, and the \ncargo is assigned scores depending on this analysis.\n  Let me first be very clear. Every single container goes through that \nstep, and that is called screening. There is a lot of confusion among \nthe terms ``screening,'' ``scanning,'' ``integrated scanning,'' and \n``inspection.'' So what I have described is the screening process that \nuses this automatic targeting system to identify at-risk containers.\n  After the at-risk containers are identified, they are supposed to be \nscanned or even physically searched by Customs and Border Protection. \nHowever, an investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations of the Homeland Security Committee, which Senator \nColeman led, indicated that this system didn't always result in an \ninspection of the high-risk container, despite it being identified. \nSenator Coleman is going to be offering an amendment shortly that will \nensure 100 percent scanning of those high-risk or at-risk containers. \nSo that is one aspect of the system we have now.\n  Another layer is the Container Security Initiative. Under this \nprogram, our American Customs and Border Patrol officers are stationed \nat foreign ports. The CSI program is currently operational in 44 ports \nwhich cover approximately 75 percent of containerized cargo heading for \nthe United States by sea. What we do is we work with the host \ngovernment, and again, the process is to push hazards away from our \nshores, identify the high-risk cargo, and make sure it is never loaded \nonto our ships in the first place.\n  In addition, there is another system, which is that many containers \nare also scanned for radiological material at U.S. ports. When I \nvisited, with the Senator from Washington State, the Seattle Port, we \nsaw the radiation portal monitors that do this kind of scanning. Our \nbill requires that by the end of 2007, the largest U.S. ports must have \nradiation scanners which will ensure that 98 percent of inbound \ncontainers are scanned.\n  There is also a Department of Energy program called the Megaports \nInitiative that is currently scanning containers in foreign ports for \nradiological material.\n  Yet another layer of security is the Customs Trade Partnership \nAgainst Terrorism Program, the so-called C-TPAT Program. This is a \nprogram whereby manufacturers, retailers, and shippers secure the \nsupply chain so that security is assured from the factory door to when \nthe container arrives at our shores. Every step of the supply chain is \nsecured. Senator Murray has improved upon that concept with her \nGreenLane concept which will give additional benefits to shippers who \nundertake even stronger security measures. This involves making sure, \nfor example, that containers are sealed with electronic seals that can \nreveal whether they have been tampered with or opened en route. In \nother words, this is a risk-based approach to enhancing the security of \nour containers.\n  At the same time--and this is the approach our bill builds upon--the \nlayered approach to security allows the maritime cargo industry in the \nUnited States, which moves more than 11 million containers per year, to \nfunction efficiently. That is important. I have seen the giant VACIS \nmachines that do these x-ray screenings. It is not that quick a \nprocess. It takes a while. It takes probably 4 minutes or so for them \nto go around the container, and then the analysis of those images can \ntake up to 15 minutes.\n  With 11 million containers entering the U.S. seaports every year, the \ndelay caused by screening all containers would cause a massive backlog \nof cargo at the ports. That doesn't mean that someday--someday soon, I \nbelieve--we are not going to have the technology that will allow us to \ndo an integrated scan, both in x ray and a scan for radiological \nmaterial, in a far more efficient way and have a method of triggering \nan additional review if something is found.\n  The Washington Post said it very well in an editorial yesterday when \nthey said:\n\n       The ``inspect all containers'' mantra is a red herring that \n     exploits America's fears about what might slip through in \n     order to score political points, ignoring the fact that there \n     are much more cost and time effective ways of keeping \n     dangerous cargo out of the country.\n\n  Our bill we have brought before the Senate would do just that by \nstrengthening and improving upon the existing\n\n[[Page S9487]]\n\nprograms. I believe with Senator Coleman's amendment, which I am proud \nto cosponsor along with the Senator from Alaska, we can even improve it \nfurther and set the stage when someday--soon, I hope--we do have the \ntechnology that allows us to do 100 percent integrated scanning.\n  The Senator from New Jersey just calls for scanning, so I don't know \nwhether he doesn't want an integrated system which includes the \nradiological scan. But in any event, it has an integrated scanning \nsystem that will work and allow us to move cargo quickly. That is where \nwe should be headed. We can't ignore the reality that we don't have the \ntechnology yet to do that effectively and efficiently now but that we \ncan put in place a layered system that gives us greater protections \nthan we have today.\n\n  We have to realize also that we have limited resources. I remember an \nexpert in port security once telling me that if you inspect everything, \nyou inspect nothing. You have to focus on risk and you have to come up \nwith systems that build a layered approach, starting with securing the \nsupply chain, working with the governments of foreign ports, having \nradiological scanning, making sure we put into place a layered security \nsystem.\n  I would note two other issues that I see in the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  First, much to my surprise, the language on page 2 of his bill \nsuggests that all outbound cargo from the United States would have to \nbe scanned. I can't imagine what the impact on trade would be. They \nwould be using the same equipment as the inbound containers, so it \nwould cause a tremendous backlog in scanning containers.\n  Second, he has some troubling language where he calls for a \ndescription of the consequences to be imposed on foreign ports or U.S. \nports that don't meet the benchmarks described in his language, which \nmay include the loss of access to U.S. ports and fines. What are we \nsaying--that we are going to threaten ports with fines rather than \nworking with them? That kind of language just invites retaliation by \nforeign governments, and I think it is misguided in the extreme.\n  So I think the bill is a very good bill that we have brought before \nour colleagues and a balanced bill to deal with this issue, but I think \nwe can strengthen it further, improve it further by adopting the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota, which I am proud to support \nand cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4982\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and ask for the immediate consideration of \namendment No. 4982.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Coleman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4982.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4982\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that \n all cargo containers are screened before arriving at a United States \n  seaport, that all high-risk containers are scanned before leaving a \n United States seaport, and that integrated scanning systems are fully \ndeployed to scan all cargo containers entering the United States before \n                   they arrive in the United States)\n\n       On page 66, before line 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 233. SCREENING AND SCANNING OF CARGO CONTAINERS.\n\n       (a) 100 Percent Screening of Cargo Containers and 100 \n     Percent Scanning of High-Risk Containers.--\n       (1) Screening of cargo containers.--The Secretary shall \n     ensure that 100 percent of the cargo containers entering the \n     United States through a seaport undergo a screening to \n     identify high-risk containers.\n       (2) Scanning of high-risk containers.--The Secretary shall \n     ensure that 100 percent of the containers that have been \n     identified as high-risk are scanned before such containers \n     leave a United States seaport facility.\n       (b) Full-Scale Implementation.--The Secretary, in \n     coordination with the Secretary of Energy and foreign \n     partners, shall fully deploy integrated scanning systems to \n     scan all containers entering the United States before such \n     containers arrive in the United States as soon as the \n     Secretary determines that the integrated scanning system--\n       (1) meets the requirements set forth in section 231(c);\n       (2) has a sufficiently low false alarm rate for use in the \n     supply chain;\n       (3) is capable of being deployed and operated at ports \n     overseas;\n       (4) is capable of integrating, as necessary, with existing \n     systems;\n       (5) does not significantly impact trade capacity and flow \n     of cargo at foreign or United States ports; and\n       (6) provides an automated notification of questionable or \n     high-risk cargo as a trigger for further inspection by \n     appropriately trained personnel.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the submission \n     of a report under section 231(d), and every 6 months \n     thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a report to the \n     appropriate congressional committees describing the status of \n     full-scale deployment under subsection (b) and the cost of \n     deploying the system at each foreign port.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. First, before I begin talking about my amendment, I wish \nto thank the Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Collins, \nand her cosponsor for the work they have done on port security. The \nSenator from Washington has been a champion. Although she is not on our \ncommittee, she has spent as much time sitting in on these hearings as \nmany committee members. It has been a magnificent display of \nbipartisanship and a magnificent display of the best in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Looking at the issues today, we have serious challenges, and I \nbelieve the bill before us does a magnificent job of addressing some of \nthe greatest vulnerabilities our Nation faces. We have vulnerabilities, \nand our subcommittee did its own work in looking at some of these \nareas.\n  For about 3 years, we have looked at these issues of trying to \nbolster America's port security and supply chain security. During the \ncourse of that, we identified numerous weaknesses. The subcommittee \nfound at one point in time that only a de minimis number of high-risk \ncontainers were actually inspected. It was a very serious problem.\n  The subcommittee found that an overwhelming proportion of C-TPAT \ncompanies that Chairman Collins talked about enjoy the benefits without \nhaving been inspected, without having the certifications you need to \nmake sure that if you are going to give people the benefit of operating \nthis program, they do it the right way. We found a flawed system that \nHomeland Security uses in identifying high-risk containers entering the \nUnited States. We raised concerns about the percentage of cargo \ncontainers entering U.S. ports that are actually screened with \nradiological devices. So these are just a handful of the significant \nproblems we discovered.\n  The bottom line is that the underlying legislation tackles these \nconcerns and many other weaknesses head-on--head-on. So as someone who \nhas spent 3 years looking at this issue, I look at the underlying bill \nand say the concerns that the subcommittee raised in terms of \ninadequate nuclear and radiological screening will be taken care of in \na set period of time. There are deadlines in here. When Secretary \nChertoff testified before our committee this week, he indicated that by \nthe end of next year, 2007, we will have 100 percent screening of \nradiological material in this country. So the bill addresses it. The \nactions of the committee have moved the agency forward, and I think \nthat is a good thing, although there is more to be done.\n  One of the things I have been a champion of is the idea of screening \nand scanning all containers coming to our country. That is a goal. \nThere are 11 million--11 million--that enter into our country, and the \ngoal is it would be ideal to be able to scan every one. It is \nimportant, by the way, that we screen every one.\n  One of the things we worry about here as we get closer to election \nseason is that some language is generating some fears on the part of \nthe American public about our vulnerability. People in this country \nshould know that every container is screened. There is a system in \nplace. Our chairman did a tremendous job of describing the layered \nsecurity that is employed. There are layers of security that highlight \nhigh risks and allow us then to do a targeted job of dealing with the \nissue of security.\n\n[[Page S9488]]\n\n  We never have a 100-percent guarantee. We live in a world where there \nare few 100-percent guarantees. But we have a system that allows us to \nhave this layered security, improved substantially by this bill, that \nallows the flow of commerce to go through.\n  If my colleagues recall, Osama bin Laden said he wanted to destroy us \neconomically. He wanted to cripple this country. He understood that if \nyou destroy the economy, you destroy the country. So as we deal with \nthis issue of supply chain security, we have to do everything we can to \nmake sure we are secure. We also have to make sure we don't put things \nin place that achieve the goal of the terrorists, which is to destroy \nthe flow of commerce and destroy the economy. That is the balance, and \nit is difficult. We are always erring on the side of safety.\n  One of the things we saw during the course of our investigation--I \nhad a chance to go to Hong Kong as well as the Port of Los Angeles and \nother ports throughout this country. But we saw in Hong Kong a system \nwhere they actually scanned every container. It was a very good system, \nby the way, in terms of getting a picture--I would call it kind of a \nmoving CAT scan.\n  The Senator from Maine talked about the systems we have here--a very \nslow process. Literally, the container is in one place and the system \ngoes over it. In Hong Kong, they have a system that scans on kind of--I \nwould call it a moving CAT scan. The trucks come through, they never \nstop, they are rolling right through, and on each and every one of them \nthere is a picture taken and you get a scan, and then there is a \nradiological detection device that is over that and it goes through and \nit is magnificent. I think some of my colleagues saw that and said: We \nhave to have that right here, right now. That sounds wonderful.\n  It is important to note that, in fact, there are 40 lanes of traffic \nin Hong Kong, and only 2, only 2 have this system. So what we have in \nthe underlying bill is an amendment that says we are going to set up a \npilot project, and in that pilot project what we are going to do is we \nare going to test this system.\n\n  By the way, it is also important to note that of all the images we \nget, they are not processed. We have a library of images where, God \nforbid there was an attack, we could go back and pinpoint where it came \nfrom and not shut down every port. But there is no use of those images \ntoday. They are not being fed into Langley, they are not being fed into \nour intelligence system, they are not being fed into anything. So in \nthe end, when the Senator from Maine talks about an integrated system, \nintegration means not just integration of a standing image with a \nradiological detection device but integration of the information that \nis being gathered, which is substantial, to be used then in terms of \nour own analysis of what is in that cargo--does it represent high-risk, \net cetera.\n  There is a great opportunity here, a great opportunity. But we are \nonly at a point now where we have in one place in the world--we have \ntwo lanes of traffic that are using a system, and we now have the \nopportunity in this bill to get a pilot project, and I think it is \nmagnificent. But there are also weaknesses we have which we then can \naddress with this amendment, amendment No. 4982. What it says is--we \nkind of walked through and looked at what was in the bill, and we \nrealized that, in operation, 100 percent of high-risk containers \nweren't being screened. This amendment says they will be. So every \ncitizen out there should know that 100 percent of those containers \nwhich are identified as high risk will be screened, and that is \nimportant.\n  Then we go to the next step, and we do it in a responsible way. I \nhave always believed that good policy is good politics. We do this in a \ngood-policy way. We say that the Secretary shall ensure that 100 \npercent of the containers that have been identified as high risk are \nscanned before such containers leave a seaport facility. And then we \nsay: The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy and \nforeign partners, shall fully deploy integrated scanning systems to \nscan all containers entering the United States before such containers \narrive in the United States as soon as the Secretary determines that--\nand this is the key--the integrated scanning system has a sufficiently \nlow false alarm rate, is capable of being deployed and operated in \nports overseas, meets certain requirements set forth in the statute--\nvery basic requirements--does not significantly impact trade capacity \nand flow of cargo at foreign and U.S. ports.\n  So we have a system that says: OK, Mr. Secretary, this is what you \nhave to do, because we want this system in place, but we want it to be \ndone in a way that doesn't cripple the supply chain and that \npractically can be done. It is nice to be able to say we want 100 \npercent. I think we have about 704 operational seaports in 147 \ncountries today, and we have a scanning system that is used in 2 lanes \nand one that is not even integrated into our entire system. We are not \nthere yet. We want to get there. This amendment puts us on a course to \nget there.\n  Then, to make sure we are not simply leaving it to the discretion of \nthe Secretary to say when he decides it should be done, we tell him to \ncome back to us, to come back to our colleagues in Congress, and we \nwant to know where you are. So it says that not later than 6 months--\nand the underlying pilot project requires the Secretary to come back--\nit is a 1-year pilot project--come back within 120 days with a report \nand tell us how the pilot project worked. And then this amendment says \nthat not later than 6 months after the submission of this report and \nevery 6 months thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a report to the \nappropriate congressional committees describing the status of full-\nscale deployment under subsection B and the cost of deploying the \nsystem at each foreign port.\n  So what we have in place here is what I hope my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle would say is the right way to go. We set in place a \npilot project. We ask that the pilot project be evaluated. The \nSecretary is required to give us a report on how that pilot project is \nworking, and then we tell the Secretary: Every 6 months, come back, \nbecause we want to know how close we are to getting to 100 percent \nscanning, how close we are and what else has to be done. It gives us \nthe opportunity in a responsible way--a responsible way--to come back \nto see if we can put in place a system where we scan 100 percent. But \nscanning 100 percent on arbitrary deadlines, scanning 100 percent on \nimpossible deadlines doesn't make any sense, and I am glad we are not \nat that point right now. We are at the point right now where we have in \nplace the ability to significantly improve the level of safety and \nsecurity in those 11 million cargo containers which are entering the \nUnited States.\n  We have an underlying bill that does a magnificent job of addressing \nweaknesses that have been identified, and now we will take care of \nthem. We have an amendment in place that builds on a pilot project, and \nbuilding on that pilot project puts certain obligations on the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to come back to us in Congress and tell \nus how you are doing, and if you are not moving quick enough, we will \nbe on your case. We will be on your case. We know what the goal is, and \nwe share a common vision, and we have now a responsible way of doing \nit. That will allow the free flow of commerce, will allow jobs to grow, \ngiving people economic security at the same time that we protect \nnational security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from the \nNew Jersey, Mr. Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n6 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding time.\n  After listening to this debate, I think my distinguished colleagues \nare talking about another pending amendment, not my amendment. My \namendment is very clear and forthright. It asks for a plan to achieve \n100 percent scanning--a plan.\n  Now, after listening to the debate, the reality is that after all of \nthe items that were discussed, that still is only 1 percent scanning of \n5 percent of the cargo. Let's not get confused. Words matter. There is \na difference between screening and scanning.\n\n  Who in our country will be satisfied with a mathematical equation \nbeing used as the way in which we determine what 5 percent ultimately \ngets taken care of? What it still says, notwithstanding all those \nlayers of security\n\n[[Page S9489]]\n\nthat the distinguished Senator from Maine spoke about, is that still \nonly has us reviewing 5 percent of the cargo. That is what it does. So \nwho among us is willing to allow mathematical equations that are based \nupon information that can be either intentionally or unintentionally \nfaulty to ultimately protect the ports of this country, the people who \nwork there, the communities that surround them, and the commerce of the \nNation? I wouldn't.\n  If Hong Kong can do this, the United States of America can do it. All \nwe say is let's have the Department of Homeland Security develop a plan \nto achieve it. We do not insist on specific ways in which we do that. \nWe allow them to develop the plan. But let's get to a plan for 100 \npercent of the cargo.\n  As for domestic, we say it will include benchmarks that they will \ndetermine in the plan for what type of cargo inspectors are inspecting \nhere in the United States before they leave. It doesn't say \nspecifically the amount, and as it relates to the loss of access to \nU.S. ports and fines, it says it may include such loss of access if we \nbelieve that is the way in which we should seek enforcement. It doesn't \nsay ``it shall.'' It says ``it may.''\n  At the end of the day, if we adopt the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota, we are still saying: OK, 5 percent is something we are \nwilling to live with. At the end of the day, we do not move to a plan \nof 100 percent scanning of the Nation's cargo. Doesn't the Nation \ndeserve a plan to get there, a plan that largely can be devised to \nensure that both technological accomplishments, as well as security \nconcerns, are brought together to achieve the goal? I think the Nation \ndeserves a plan. So it is very important to understand that when we \nkeep saying screen--screen means looking at a cargo manifest.\n  I had the Port of Elizabeth in Newark in what was my former \ncongressional district for 13 years and dealt with them for quite a bit \non a number of issues. Screening just means let's look at what is in \nthat container. Let's see the list. Where is it coming from? What port \nis it coming from? Let's ultimately take all of that and put it in a \nmathematical equation and look at what is inside the cargo. But that is \nnot scanning 100 percent of what comes into the Nation. Let America not \nbe confused by that.\n  Also, this is about scanning it abroad. When we wait until it comes \ninto a port of the United States, if it has a nuclear device in it, it \nis a little late. We need to be doing that scanning abroad.\n  I urge my colleagues to understand the difference between these \namendments. Ours produces a plan to get us to 100 percent of scanning, \nand it gives flexibility for the Department to do so, but it does move \nus toward that ultimate goal.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nWashington, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the floor?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 8\\1/2\\ minutes, the majority \nhas 2\\1/2\\.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment \nbrought by my colleague, Senator Menendez, because I think it covers \nthe bases we are concerned about. This amendment, very simply, demands \naccountability from the Bush administration on port security. The bill \nbefore us contains an amendment as well, that I authored in committee, \nto require 100 percent screening of containers coming into the United \nStates. These containers would have to be screened before they are \nloaded on ships at a foreign port. I think that is the time to do it.\n  We have already seen attempts by the majority to downplay or even \nduck this requirement. I am not suggesting, in the interests of safety \nand security, that the Senator from Minnesota or the Senator from Maine \nis less concerned about the security or the safety of our people. But I \nam supporting the Menendez amendment because he gets specifically to \nthe point, and I think the approach that we take is the strongest one \nand in the best interests of the American people.\n  We need the administration to tell the American people exactly how \nlong it will take them to provide the security necessary to reach the \nlevel of a 100-percent screening requirement. Right now, as we all \nknow, we only inspect around 5 percent of shipping containers coming \ninto our country. Terrorists could smuggle weapons, nuclear or chemical \nweapons, into a harbor and potentially launch an attack even more \ndevastating than the 9/11 attack we experienced.\n  I listened very carefully to Senator Menendez review his amendment, \nand that is to get us to the 100 percent opportunity. The Senator from \nMinnesota says he believes there would be 100 percent screening. But \nthat would come only after there have been paper documents saying what \nwas being shipped was OK.\n  I ask you, would we take the most honest presentation of a clergyman, \na doctor, a lawyer, a judge, or an individual and say: OK, that \nindividual can bypass security at the airport? Not on your life. And we \nshould not do it here.\n  Why do we want to put trust in a paper-laden system where the GAO \nsays that many of the manifests and the documents for shipping cargo \nare unreliable, that they are not trustworthy. I think if we are really \ngoing to do the job people expect of us, we are going to have to try to \nget as quickly as we can to 100 percent screening. The amendment of \nSenator Menendez does absolutely that, so we ought not to tinker any \nfurther.\n  Are we really serious about getting to the end of the game, \nprotecting our citizens as much as we can? Then we have to do it by a \n100-percent screening. What we are not saying is do it overnight or do \nit by next week or next month. But we are saying: Give us the plan, Mr. \nPresident and this administration, on how you expect to do this.\n  We have to remember one thing: Senator Menendez has, in his former \nterritory, in his former constituency, the second largest port in the \ncountry; the New York-New Jersey Harbor is just that. He has worked \nwith people who run the cargo operations. He knows the people who are \nterminal operators. He is very conscious of what it takes to protect \nourselves to the last detail that we can.\n  I believe we have to be in support of the Menendez amendment that \nsays: OK, come on, tell us what it is that you plan to do to protect \nthe people of America in a way that gives us comfort--not 1 out of 20 \ncargo containers that arrive that might be supported by a paper \nmanifest that doesn't mean an awful lot because there is plenty of \nopportunity to tinker with that cargo container before it leaves the \nshore unless we have scanned it at the last moment possible.\n  I urge our colleagues to support the Menendez amendment. Let's not \nwaste any more of the time that the people of America need to feel \nsecure about those ships that enter our harbors bringing goods into \nthis country.\n  I yield whatever time there is back to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nmajority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COLLINS. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Minnesota, \nand I retain a minute for myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues listening, the \ndifference between the Menendez amendment and mine is America doesn't \nneed another plan. There are some technical infirmities. There are some \nquestions about what it may do in terms of our relations with other \ncountries. Put all that aside. We don't need another plan. We need \naction. Maybe it is the ex-mayor in me. The underlying bill and the \npilot project and the Coleman amendment will provide action. They put \nin place a pilot project to test how 100 percent scanning can work, and \nthen it directs the Secretary to fully deploy, with a series of steps \nput in front of him, and then requires him to come back to Congress. It \nis not about planning, it is about action.\n  The American public wants action. We are giving the action. We are \nstrengthening our port security. We\n\n[[Page S9490]]\n\nare putting in place a pilot project. We are directing the Secretary to \nensure there is 100 percent screening of every high-risk container, and \nthen requiring him to fully deploy an integrated scanning system 100 \npercent, lays out the conditions, and has him report back to us.\n  I am not sure we can do any better today based on the technology we \nnow have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if you think about it, those who are \nadvocating that we go to 100 percent scanning prior to having the \ntechnology in place to do it efficiently without slowing down trade \nare, in fact, rejecting the whole notion of the C-TPAT Program. Why \nshould a shipper, retailer or manufacturer, secure its supply chain \nfrom end to end if they are going to be subjected to the same kinds of \ninspection as a shipper who has high-risk cargo in an unsecured supply \nchain? That doesn't make any sense at all. It completely undermines the \nC-TPAT Program, the container security initiative, because it embraces \nthe concept that all cargo is alike. It is not all alike. There are \nlow-risk containers.\n  I think we should think very carefully about the implications of this \namendment. I think Senator Coleman has come up with an excellent \namendment. He has done a great deal of work, and I urge my colleagues \nto support the Coleman-Collins-Stevens amendment and to vote against \nthe amendment of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired. The \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I believe there is 3 minutes left on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey however much time \nhe needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  I listened very carefully to what our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have said. I wonder about why it is we are defending a \nvoluntary system, of sorts, that raises the question about why a \nshipper would waste any time tracing the source of the product if they \nare going to be inspected again. What are we doing? Are we saying the \nquestion is whether we trust the shipper? That is not the position we \ntake at all.\n  The position we take, that the amendment of Senator Menendez takes, \nis tell us when you are going to have 100 percent security. That is the \nright objective. We know that it works. We know in Hong Kong they can \nprocess a scan of a cargo container in something around 2 minutes at an \naverage cost of about $8. Is it not worth it? We pass the cost along to \nthe shipper. That is their cost, not the American taxpayer's cost.\n  As regards relying on paperwork to give us a head's up as to whether \nthat cargo should be inspected, GAO has found that shipping documents \nare one of the least reliable sources of information that Customs \ncollects.\n  One audit pre-9/11 showed that over 60 percent of these documents had \nmajor discrepancies. So who are we trying to defend? Are we trying to \ndefend the well-being of the American people, of the economy that \nrelies so much on harbor activity, on imported goods, or are we trying \nto satisfy an industrial perspective that says don't take the time, \ndon't do that, let's trust, right now, 95 percent of the cargo that \ncomes in here as being safe to reach our shores.\n  I do not think that is a very good way for us to be reacting when \neveryone is so concerned about another terrorist attack, something that \neverybody is concerned about, a repetition of something that resembles \n9/11, or even worse.\n  The best thing to do is stick to our guns and say that we want to see \n100 percent of those cargo containers scanned so we know what is in \nthere. After it has been closed up, after everything else has been \ndone, the paper manifest is still there, and whether they are exactly \nprecise would not matter. We will know what is in that cargo container, \nand we will be able to protect the American people as we should.\n  I, once again, hope Members will reject the amendment and support \nSenator Menendez's amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nColeman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes equally divided on the \nMenendez amendment.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we just agreed to an amendment that will \nrequire 100 percent scanning of high-risk containers and put us on the \npath to having 100 percent scanning of containers, once it is feasible, \nonce the technology is there.\n  I am concerned about the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey. I \ndon't think it has the kind of thought in it that was in the Coleman \namendment. There are two provisions, in particular, that concern me.\n  One, it requires a plan for scanning containers that are going out of \nU.S. ports. That is going to slow down trade incredibly and will be a \nreal problem for our farmers who are exporting their crops.\n  Second, it has a provision requiring consequences to be imposed on \nforeign ports or U.S. ports that do not meet the benchmarks described \nin the plan, which may include a loss of access to U.S. ports and \nfines. This will lead to retaliation by foreign ports.\n  I urge our colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nLautenberg as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, with reference to the concerns the \nSenator from Maine raised, let me just say the amendment we just \nadopted says we are going to scan 100 percent of the\n\n[[Page S9491]]\n\ncontainers that have been identified as high risk before they leave the \nUnited States. So that is the very essence of what we seek to do as \nwell.\n  Secondly, the only amendment before the Senate that will move us to a \nplan to get to 100 percent scanning of all cargo in this country is the \namendment presently before the Senate.\n  If you want to continue to allow a mathematical equation to determine \nhow we inspect only 5 percent of the cargo in this country, then that \nis what you just accomplished. If you want to move toward a plan to get \n100 percent scanning of all the cargo that comes into this country, \ngiving the Department of Homeland Security the opportunity to develop \nsuch a plan, then this amendment is the one you want to vote for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up pending amendment No. 4958, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending. Is there a \nsufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4096\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to read a letter I just received \ntoday from a representative of an American company that employs \nmillions of workers, including hundreds in my home State of Montana.\n  He writes:\n\n       As one of the Nation's largest employers of people coming \n     off welfare, we have kept our end of the bargain and \n     continued hiring throughout this year with the understanding \n     that the Work Opportunity and Welfare to Work tax credits \n     would be extended.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       We now face a significant increase in our tax liability and \n     will have to book corresponding losses to our profitability \n     unless you act now. The ongoing frustration is taking its \n     toll on us.\n\n  Indeed, the frustration over the 2005 expired tax incentives is \ntaking its toll on millions of Americans.\n  This letter is from the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, \nHomeGoods, A.J. Wright, and Bob's Stores. That company likely has \nstores in each State in the Union and each congressional district. \nThese are real people, real jobs, and real money on the line. Yet some \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have taken these \npopular tax credits hostage. In fact, some have openly referred to \nthese credits as ``hostages.'' Some have said that sometimes you have \nto kill hostages to be taken seriously. It is time that we end these \nthreats and get back to the business of legislating.\n  Let me remind everyone how many times these popular tax cuts have \nbeen set aside. We first passed them as part of the tax reconciliation \nbill last November. They passed this body, but they were set aside in \norder to accommodate provisions in that tax bill that were expiring, \nnot in 2005 but expiring 4 years later in 2009. Then we were promised \nthey would surely be included in the pension conference, the next tax \nvehicle. Once again, they were pulled out at the last moment after \nweeks of negotiations and haggling.\n  The package we are discussing is a compromise package. It passed the \nHouse. It does not include everything I would want, but it is what we \nagreed to months ago, and it is what we should have enacted months ago.\n  This package includes the research and development tax credit. I \nremind my colleagues that companies are now beginning to restate their \nfinancials. Why? Because Congress has not extended the R tax credit \nthat expired at the end of last year. We have letters from companies \nsaying they have to restate, but they had the R credit in the past. \nThey have to start restating their financials. It is not in the law \nnow. If we were going to extend it, we should have extended it a long \ntime ago.\n  The package includes the deduction for schoolteachers who buy \nsupplies for their students. Of all things to give our teachers. Think \nof them, who buy supplies for their students. They are supposed to get \na deduction. It expired last year. My Lord, here we are already at the \nbeginning of the school year and the deduction is not there for them.\n  The package includes the tuition deduction for college students \ntrying to go back to school. It includes the deduction for State and \nlocal sales taxes. Just think. And it includes other widely supported \ntax cuts.\n  If we do not enact these provisions, then millions of Americans will \nhave their taxes increased. This Congress has been zealous in \npreventing tax increases several years into the future. We ought to \nprevent these tax increases which are happening today.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass a clean, retroactive extension, back to \nthe end of 2005, of these popular credits for businesses, \nschoolteachers, employers who hire welfare workers, and all the people \nwho are depending on us to do the right thing. Let us end the \nfrustration today.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has more than 30 cosponsors. I imagine \nthere would be many more if we asked them. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Bingaman, Feinstein, and Kennedy be added as cosponsors. I \nalso ask unanimous consent that Senator Obama, Senator Reed from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Akaka, and Senator Inouye be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 326, H.R. 4096; that the Senate adopt my \namendment that is at the desk, the substance of which is the agreed-\nupon tax extender package; that the bill be read a third time and \npassed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the \nSenate return to the port security bill; and that all this occur \nwithout intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the issue before us is an issue we have \naddressed on the floor of the Senate. Republicans felt very strongly \nthat these tax extenders need to be extended and brought them to the \nfloor prior to our recess. Yes, they were coupled with two other \nissues, one of which was a permanent solution to the death tax, which \nis a fair thing to do, overwhelmingly supported by the majority of the \npeople, and an increase in the minimum wage by 40 percent, something \nthat I feel strongly that we are in a position to do.\n  We took those issues to the floor. The bill was defeated by the other \nside\n\n[[Page S9492]]\n\nof the aisle. Again, it was very unfortunate. It was referred to as the \nso-called trifecta bill. I did switch my vote at that time, and it may \nwell be that over the next couple of weeks, if we can continue to build \nsupport for these issues, we can bring that bill back to the floor.\n  Thus, at this juncture, instead of breaking those bills up, we are \ngoing to keep those bills together, and thus I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before the Senator objects, may I make one \ncomment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection has been heard on the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask to have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the views of the majority \nleader. I must remind all of our colleagues that we have been down that \nroad a couple of times and that, in my judgment, they are not going to \nfly.\n  I support the provisions that are in that package. This Senate has \nvoted a couple of times, and it is my strongly held view in talking \nwith Senators that it just is not going to get passed. In the meantime, \nit is important to get something passed that is so important to so many \npeople.\n  I hear what the majority leader is saying, but it is my judgment that \nsometimes it is better to go on and do legislation that can get enacted \nand not stick around and try to delude ourselves into passing bills \nthat cannot get passed. That is why I am bringing this up today, \nbecause we can get this passed today, I am quite confident. \nRegrettably, the provisions the majority leader mentioned cannot be \npassed, and therefore we should not delay the passage of something that \nis so important to so many people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ndistinguished colleague. Time is very short, I understand. That is why \nmy colleague brings it to the floor now, because it is very important \nthat we extend these tax provisions--sales tax, college tuition, and \nthe R tax credit. It is very important. That is really the reason I \ntook a bill I know my colleague supports, and that is a permanent \nsolution to the death tax--maybe not exactly the way it is now, but he \nis somebody who supported that cause. Indeed, it has the majority \nsupport of the United States of America. It is the right thing to do. \nThe minimum wage, again, I think is something that is broadly supported \nby the American people. And then the tax extenders. All three are \nbroadly supported.\n  The benefit is, if we can build that support and have it reflected on \nthis floor--that is really on the Senator's side of the aisle--that \nwould be the law of the land because it has already passed the House of \nRepresentatives. If we were to vote on these today, it would be signed \nby the President 3 days from now. That means people's minimum wage \nwould go up 40 percent, the tax extenders would be done because it \nwouldn't have to go back to the House and it would be done 3 days from \nnow, and we would have a permanent solution to the death tax, which is \na fair and right thing to do.\n  I am going to preserve that option for now. I appreciate my \ncolleague's support because I think he probably does individually \nsupport each of those three issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I want \nto explain how we are going to proceed. Obviously, Senator Baucus made \nhis unanimous consent request. I didn't anticipate that when we were \nordering the speakers earlier. We are going to go to Senator Santorum \nfor the purpose of an amendment, but he will only take 3 minutes, and \nthen we are going to go to Senator Obama for his amendment, and then I \nam going to propose on behalf of Senator Voinovich an amendment he has \nworked out with the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4990\n\n       (Purpose: To provide for comprehensive border security, and \n     for other purposes.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4990 and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the pending amendment \nbeing set aside? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4990.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SANTORUM. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that I \nbelieve offers us an opportunity to secure our borders now. My bill \ntakes a first-things-first approach and recognizes that it is \nimperative that we secure our borders now. This first step cannot--and \nshould not have to--wait for a ``comprehensive'' solution. Once we \nsecure our borders, we can look at all of the other illegal immigration \nrelated issues that remain. There is a bipartisan consensus on what \nneeds to be done on border security and the provisions that make up \nthis consensus. We should not hold our border security hostage to a \nbroader initiative.\n  My amendment will significantly increase the assets available for \ncontrolling our borders. It provides more inspectors, more marshals, \nand more border patrol agents on both the northern and southern \nborders. It provides new aerial vehicles and virtual fencing--camera, \nsensors, satellite and radar coverage, etc. It increases our \nsurveillance assets and their deployment and provides for new \ncheckpoints and ports of entry. It includes Senator Sessions' amendment \nfor greater fencing along our southern border, including 370 miles of \ntriple-layered fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers. It also \nprovides for the acquisition of more helicopters, powerboats, motor \nvehicles, portable computers, radio communications, hand-held global \npositioning devices, night vision equipment, body armor, weapons, and \ndetention space.\n  While we know these resources will be critical improvements, it does \nnot just throw resources at the problem. My amendment requires a \ncomprehensive national strategy for border security, surveillance, \nports of entry, information exchange between agencies, increasing the \ncapacity to train border patrol agents and combating human smuggling. \nIt enhances initiatives on biometric data, secure communications for \nborder patrol agents, and document fraud detection. It includes Senator \nEnsign's language to temporarily deploy the National Guard to support \nthe border patrol in securing our southern land border. Additionally, \nit increases punishment for the construction, of border tunnels or \npassages.\n  When our borders are not secure, it is our cities and counties that \nare on the front lines, particularly those closest to the borders. \nUnfortunately, the negative impacts of illegal immigration are not \nlimited to our border towns. Recently I worked with communities in \nsoutheastern Pennsylvania--Allentown, Easton, Bethlehem, Reading and \nLancaster--as well as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania, Pat Meehan, to get one of the six recent Anti-Gang \nInitiative grants given by the Department of Justice. This area, called \nthe Route 222 Corridor, was the only nonmetropolitan area to receive \none of the $2.5 million grants to combat growing criminal activity in \npart because of illegal immigrants. However, I raise this issue here \nbecause U.S. Attorney Meehan's letter explains this issue very \nsuccinctly. He stated ``[e]ach city is seeing extensive Latino \nrelocation to its poorer neighborhoods and housing projects. Once \nlargely Puerto Rican, the minority populations are increasingly from \nCentral America. Simultaneously, Mexican workers migrate to the \nagricultural areas around Lancaster, creating a southern link to \ncriminal networks. The urban core is therefore transient, poor, non-\nEnglish speaking and often undocumented . . . In this fertile \nenvironment, the Latin Kings, Bloods, NETA, and lately, MS-13, are \nrecruiting or fighting with local gangs for control of the drug \nmarkets. Violence is a daily by-product.''\n  My amendment provides relief for cities, counties, and States dealing\n\n[[Page S9493]]\n\nwith increased costs because of illegal immigration--specifically those \ncaused by the criminal acts of illegal immigrants. There are four \nprograms included in my amendment to address these issues. First, there \nare grants to law enforcement agencies within 100 miles of the Canadian \nor Mexican borders or such agencies where there is a lack of security \nand a rise in criminal activity because of the lack of border security, \nincluding a preference for communities with less than 50,000 people. \nSecond, local governments can be reimbursed for costs associated with \nprocessing criminal illegal aliens such as indigent defense, criminal \nprosecution, translators, and court costs. Third, State and local law \nenforcement agencies can be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the \ndetention and transportation of an illegal alien to Federal custody. \nFinally, reimbursements are available for costs incurred in prosecuting \ncriminal cases that were federally initiated but where the Federal \nentity declined to prosecute. In addition, my bill requires the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to provide sufficient transportation and \nofficers to take illegal aliens apprehended by State and local law \nenforcement officers into custody for processing at a detention \nfacility operated by the Department, and that the Secretary designate \nat least one Federal, State, or local facility in each State as the \ncentral facility to transfer custody to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n\n  This amendment also expedites the removal of criminal aliens from \ncorrectional facilities and expands border security programs through \nthe Department of Commerce such as the Carrier Initiative, the Americas \nCounter Smuggling Initiative, the Container Security Initiative, and \nthe Free and Secure Trade Initiative.\n  Throughout this debate, I have consistently stated that the first \nthing we must do is secure our Nation's borders. While the House and \nSenate are working to come to an agreement on the broader issues in an \nimmigration bill, I am here to offer the Senate an opportunity to \nsecure our borders now by adopting my Border Security First Amendment. \nOur borders must be secured now--not later. In the post 9/11 world we \nlive in, our national security depends on our border security. We need \nto know who is coming into our country, where they are from, and what \nthey are doing here. We must put first things first--we must secure our \nNation's borders. I hope that my Senate colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing the urgency of this amendment.\n  Again, I offer this amendment because I wish to make a point. The \npoint is, we are talking about port security, and that is very \nimportant. But what I hear when I go home is not about port security, I \nhear about border security over and over again. If there is one issue \npeople come up to me and talk to me about without fail, no matter what \npart of the State I am in, it is: What are you folks going to do about \nsecuring our borders?\n  We passed a bill in the Senate that is not going anywhere in the \nHouse of Representatives. It doesn't seem to be going anywhere in \nconference right now. What we should do and what the people in America \nwould like us to do is to secure the borders first.\n  This amendment does just that. It is all the provisions in the \nSenate-passed bill that deal just with border security. If you want to \ntalk about securing this country--and that is what this bill is about--\nborder security is a national security issue, it is an economic \nsecurity issue, and it also has to do with who we are as a country and \nour ability to sustain our culture.\n  This is an important amendment. I know this is not going to be \ngermane postcloture, and we are going to have a cloture vote tomorrow \nmorning. So I will not pursue it further because I am told I cannot get \na vote on it. I bring this up because this is what we need to do \nbetween now and the end of this month before we recess. We need to pass \na bill that secures our borders and tells the American people that we \nget it in Washington as to what the priorities are. There are other \nthings we need to do, I understand that, but this is what we need to do \nand do first.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4990, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clinton amendment.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4972, as Modified\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4972, as modified, \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Obama] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4972, as modified.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure the evacuation of individuals with special needs in \n                          times of emergency)\n\n       On page 87, after line 18, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 407. EVACUATION IN EMERGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to ensure the \n     preparation of communities for future natural, accidental, or \n     deliberate disasters by ensuring that the States prepare for \n     the evacuation of individuals with special needs.\n       (b) Evacuation Plans for Individuals With Special Needs.--\n     The Secretary, acting through the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency shall take appropriate actions to ensure \n     that each State, as that term is defined in section 2(14) of \n     the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101(14)), \n     requires appropriate State and local government officials to \n     develop detailed and comprehensive pre-disaster and post-\n     disaster plans for the evacuation of individuals with special \n     needs, including the elderly, disabled individuals, low-\n     income individuals and families, the homeless, and \n     individuals who do not speak English, in emergencies that \n     would warrant their evacuation, including plans for the \n     provision of food, water, and shelter for evacuees.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report setting forth, for each State, the status and key \n     elements of the plans to evacuate individuals with special \n     needs in emergencies that would warrant their evacuation.\n       (2) Contents.--The report submitted under paragraph (1) \n     shall include a discussion of--\n       (A) whether the States have the resources necessary to \n     implement fully their evacuation plans; and\n       (B) the manner in which the plans of the States are \n     integrated with the response plans of the Federal Government \n     for emergencies that would require the evacuation of \n     individuals with special needs.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould supplement the steps we are taking through this port security \nbill and increase our preparedness for a potential terrorist attack. My \namendment is fairly modest. It requires FEMA to mandate that each State \nhave a plan for the evacuation of individuals with special needs during \ntimes of emergency. Such plans would include an explanation of how \nthese people--particularly low-income individuals and families, the \nelderly, the disabled, and those who cannot speak English--will be \nevacuated out of the emergency area and how the States will provide \nshelter, food, and water to these people once evacuated.\n  This amendment was included in S. 1725 and passed out of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee in September of 2005.\n  This amendment obviously grows out of the tragedy of Hurricane \nKatrina, which devastated the gulf coast a little more than a year ago. \nOne of the most striking aspects of the devastation caused by Katrina \nis the majority of stranded victims who were our society's most \nvulnerable members. As I indicated, after the tragedy, I think the \ngovernment officials who called for the evacuation of the gulf coast--\nand this is true not just for Federal folks but also State and local \nofficials--seemed to assume that all residents could pack up their \nfamilies into an SUV, fill up the gas tank, drive out of town, and find \na hotel in which to ride out the storm. As we learned, that was not the \ncase. Many people were forced to find shelter in the Superdome or \nconvention center because they did not own cars. They didn't have the \nmoney for a tank of gas or a hotel room. They\n\n[[Page S9494]]\n\nmight not have wanted to leave their jobs or their belongings. Maybe \nthey were in nursing homes or maybe they misunderstood the warnings \nbecause they didn't speak English. Whatever the reasons, thousands of \npeople were not evacuated, and we saw the horrific results of that \nmistake.\n  This failure to evacuate so many of the most desperate citizens in \nthe gulf coast could easily happen again if we are faced with another \nnatural disaster such as Katrina or a terrorist attack that struck one \nof our cities. That is why I have come to the floor to offer this \namendment. Our charge as public servants is to worry about all people. \nI was troubled that our emergency response and disaster plans were \ninadequate for large segments of the gulf coast. I have serious doubts \nat this point whether the plans in other regions are adequate as well. \nPerfect evacuation planning is obviously not possible, but greater \nadvanced preparation can ensure the most vulnerable are not simply \nforgotten or ignored.\n  Even the Department of Homeland Security recognizes the urgent need \nfor action, and the Department's nationwide plan review published this \nJune found:\n\n       Significant weaknesses in evacuation planning are an area \n     of profound concern.\n\n  Congress can and should act to address this concern by passing this \namendment. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment which, as I \nsaid, passed the Homeland Security Committee on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Salazar be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Maine is \ngoing to proceed with an amendment, but I ask unanimous consent that at \nthe conclusion of her proceedings for the amendment, I be recognized to \nspeak on the pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first I would inquire through the Chair \nof the Senator from Illinois whether he has modified his amendment. I \ndidn't hear a request that it be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment was called up as modified.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I appreciate the clarification.\n  Mr. President, this proposal of the Senator from Illinois is very \nsimilar to a provision of the post-Katrina Stafford Act reforms that \nwere reported by the Homeland Security Committee. The Senator from \nIllinois is absolutely right that we need to do a far better job in \nthis country of developing comprehensive plans for the evacuation of \nindividuals with special needs before, during, and after a disaster.\n  When we look at the experience with Hurricane Katrina, what we find \nis those who were left behind were predominantly elderly and disabled. \nThose were the characteristics that caused people to not be able to \nevacuate. Another factor was they tended to be lower income \nindividuals, too. But the disabled individuals of the area, in \nLouisiana in particular, also actually had the experience of going to \nRed Cross shelters and being turned away, which is something I have \ndiscussed with the Red Cross.\n  So I think it is a good idea to require State and local governments \nto develop these kinds of plans, and I am happy to accept the \namendment. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Collins for supporting \nthis amendment. I very much appreciate her remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4972), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer is well aware, \nthis reflects an agreement between the Senator from Oklahoma and the \nSenator from Ohio. It is my understanding that it has been cleared on \nboth sides, and I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4962), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Senator from \nMaine, the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Iowa, and the ranking \nmembers of those committees--Finance, Commerce, and Homeland Security--\nfor bringing forward this extremely important piece of legislation \nrelative to port security. It has a lot of the initiatives in it that \nare necessary to be sure we move forward with a legal framework which \nwill allow us to secure our ports.\n  But I did want to make these points about what we have already done \nand\n\n[[Page S9496]]\n\nwhat we are doing, even though we may not have had the actual \nauthorization language in place, because I think people listening to \nthis debate may presume: Well, because they are actually debating this \nlanguage, maybe nothing has been done on this point or on that point \nwhich has been raised, such as monitoring, such as Coast Guard \nenhancement, such as expanding the number of Customs officers.\n  Nothing could be further from what is actually occurring on the \nground. We have moved forward. Granted, we haven't done it under the \ncontext of authorization language; we have done it through the \nappropriations process. But we have moved forward very aggressively \nwith the funding of port security as a Congress and as an \nadministration.\n  The Senate specifically has taken the leadership in this area. When \nthe Homeland Security appropriations bill was on the floor under the \nauthorship of Senator Byrd from West Virginia, we increased port \nsecurity funding, which is already fairly significant within the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill; we increased it by over $600 \nmillion specifically for port security initiatives. As a result, that \nadditional funding, coupled with the funding which was already in place \nand which has been growing over the last few years, represented a very \nstrong commitment to trying to upgrade our ports because we all \nrecognize--there is no subtlety to this--the ports are a significant \npoint of vulnerability for our Nation.\n  Just to put this in context, if we are able to pass the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill as it passed the Senate--and I suspect we \nwill be fairly close to those numbers as a result of the support we \nhave received from Senator Cochran and from the leadership of both the \nHouse and the Senate in giving us the allocation plus some additional \nfunds for emergencies to accomplish the type of funding initiatives we \nneed--we will add 460 new Customs and Border Patrol agents purely for \nthe purpose of port security. That is on top of the agents we already \nhave, which number in the hundreds. We will add over $211 million for \nnonintrusive inspection equipment. We will add $139 million for \ncontainer security initiatives, $60 million for Customs Trade \nPartnership Against Terrorism, and $27 million for the automatic \ntargeting system.\n  We have also committed massive amounts of dollars to the Coast Guard \nand to enhancing the Coast Guard's capability because they truly are \nthe front line of port security. Our goal in the area of port security \nis not to wait for the ship to arrive in an American port before we \nactually know what is on it and before we have a chance to inspect it \nbut to inspect that cargo before it even leaves the docks of the \nforeign nation that may be shipping it to us and to be sure we have the \ncapability under any scenario to intercept a ship should we deem it to \nhave suspicious cargo while it is at sea. In order to accomplish that, \nwe have committed over $7.5 billion to the Coast Guard for border \nsecurity. Of that, approximately $4 billion was specifically for port \nsecurity, and about $2.1 billion of that was for an improvement of what \nis called their deepwater assets, which is really a misnomer. In my \nopinion, it should be called the inland water assets because \nessentially these new facilities, these new boats and aircraft are \ngoing to allow us to make sure our ports are more secure.\n  The Coast Guard inspection effort was increased by $23 million for \nsecurity assessment of foreign and domestic ports. That will allow the \nCoast Guard to pursue very aggressive unscheduled inspections of both \nforeign and domestic ports to see what their standards are.\n  We have committed $10 million to set up two new interagency operation \ncenters on top of the three operation centers we have already, which \nare port-oriented operation centers, which are very important to make \nsure we have a coordinated effort around especially our major ports in \nthis country.\n  We have $10 million of Coast Guard funding to do port security \nexercises. This is critical. We can't really plan effectively in a \nvacuum. We have to actually send out an exercise where we create an \nevent which is artificial but which is treated as if it is real and \nhave the Coast Guard and the various agencies engaged in the process of \nmaking sure they can respond to that event.\n  We have added $786 million for the purposes of upgrading the cutter \nprogram and $50 million for the fast-response cutter program. Over 12 \nof the medium-endurance cutters are going to be dramatically upgraded, \nand we are purchasing 5 patrol boats and 16 medium-response patrol \nboats. This is a lot of new hardware which will be put in the hands of \nthe Coast Guard.\n  On top of that, in the aircraft area, we are adding two major new \npatrol aircraft. We will have had 71 helicopters, as a result of this \nbill, armed, which is a major step forward. We only have I think two or \nthree--maybe five helicopters armed today.\n  Interestingly enough--and this is a little aside, a little vignette--\nthe Coast Guard has determined that they have 100 percent interdiction \nwhen they try to stop a boat with an armed helicopter versus a much \nlower interdiction rate when they try to stop a boat with an unarmed \nhelicopter.\n  We have extended the life of 18 of the helicopters--I am sorry--18 of \nthe HC-130 planes, we have reengined the entire helicopter fleet, and \nwe have dramatically expanded the mission capability of the HC-130J \nairplanes.\n  So the Coast Guard has been given a robust infusion of funds for on-\nthe-ground capability in port security and out-in-the-port capability \nfor port security.\n  In addition, in the appropriations bill which passed the Senate 100 \nto nothing, there was a $210 million commitment to support security \ngrants, which was a significant increase. There was a $178 million \ncommitment for the purchase of radiation portal monitors, which are \nobviously key to determining the major threat, which is the threat of a \npotential dirty weapon being brought into the United States through a \nport or a cargo vessel.\n  So if you look at the authorization language in this bill relative to \nfunds which this bill calls for in order to meet what are the needs of \nthe ports, we have actually passed as an appropriation in the \nappropriations process essentially almost all the money. It is nice to \nhave it authorized, but essentially what we have already done is \nappropriated. The only major difference would be in the port security \ngrants, and even there we have made a very significant downpayment as a \npercentage of what this bill calls for. So there has been a strong \ncommitment made already in the area of appropriating funds in order to \nmake sure our ports are more secure. I did want to make that clear so \nthat people watching this debate, as important as the debate is, would \nrealize we haven't been waiting for the language to be brought \nforward. It is important language. It is critical language to do the \njob right. But we as a Congress, and the administration, have been \nmoving forward to make sure that Homeland Security and especially the \nCoast Guard and those people who are responsible for making the \ndecisions as to how we inspect, and the Customs and Border Patrol \ndepartments, have the resources they need in order to effectively begin \nto secure our ports.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 4945\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which \nis at the desk, amendment No. 4945. There are modifications at the \ndesk. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Burns and Senator Cantwell \nbe added as original cosponsors as well as make the following \nmodifications to the amendment which is there at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified. The cosponsors will be added.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 27, on line 24 after ``emergency measures'', insert \n     the following:\n       ``including wildfire recovery efforts in Montana and other \n     States''\n       On page 28, after line 12, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 133. ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY INCENTIVES PROGRAM.\n\n       The Secretary shall use an additional $200,000,000 of funds \n     of the Commodity Credit\n\n[[Page S9497]]\n\n     Corporation to carry out emergency measures identified by the \n     Secretary through the environmental quality incentives \n     program established under chapter 4 of subtitle D of title \n     XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3839aa et \n     seq.), of which not less than $50,000,000 shall be used to \n     carry out wildfire recovery efforts (including in Montana and \n     other States).''\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity \nto be here today. I thank Senators Collins and, of course, Patty Murray \nfor the opportunity to speak.\n  What I want to say is that I have been hearing rumors that the \nleadership staff says this drought disaster amendment is not germane. \nAs far as I know, cloture has not been invoked. Until and unless \ncloture is invoked, it is germane. It cannot be ruled as not germane.\n  The amendment I offered this morning now has 19 bipartisan \ncosponsors. I have already pointed to the chart to show what the extent \nof the drought is and the devastation that the drought is wreaking all \nacross the middle part of the country and down into the southeastern \npart of the country as well.\n  The drought conditions range from severe to less than moderate in \nmost of the instances, and the darker, the more it is affecting. What \nisn't shown on this chart is the number of years that the drought has \nendured in some parts of the country.\n  In Nebraska, for example, the drought in some cases is 7 continuous \nyears in duration, planting with higher input costs and no crop for \nmany farmers. Many have not been able to sustain themselves. They have \nhad to leave their farms.\n  Ranchers are being adversely affected by the drought, obviously, \nbecause their pastures are crisp where the grass should be green. The \ngrass is brittle because of the continuing drought conditions.\n  As a matter of fact, trying to get some recognition of what a drought \nconsists of as opposed to a hurricane, which has a name in each and \nevery case--I named this drought David just a few years ago. \nUnfortunately, in some caces Drought David is celebrating its seventh \nbirthday, in other cases its fifth birthday, and in some other cases 2 \nor 3 years. This is a continuing condition.\n  That is why our farmers and ranchers deserve an up-or-down vote on \nthis amendment. There is no ruling that it isn't germane. We could have \nan up-or-down vote on it tonight. I hope we would be able to do that.\n  The severity continues, and denying an up-or-down vote doesn't mean \nthe drought goes away. It just means the ranchers and farmers are not \ngoing to get what they deserve.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment, No. 4945.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objectin, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Net Neutrality\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, I have put a public hold on \nthe telecommunications legislation that has cleared the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, and I have decided to come to the floor, from time to time, \nto try to outline why I have committed to block that legislation until \nthe legislation ensures that the Internet will be free of \ndiscrimination.\n  That is what the debate known as Net neutrality is all about. It is \nsomething I feel very strongly about. I think as colleagues and the \ncountry come to understand more about what this issue is all about, \nthere will be increasing concern about the absence in this legislation \nof tough, enforceable provisions to ensure that the Internet is free of \ndiscrimination.\n  Now, the lobbyists for the big communications concerns would like \nAmericans to believe this is a very complicated issue. Certainly, there \nare technical aspects to it. But the bottom line proposition, Mr. \nPresident and colleagues, is, today, when you log on, you get to take \nyour browser where you want to go, when you want to go there, and \neverybody is treated the same. That is what would change under this \nlegislation because it would be possible, under the way the bill is \nwritten now, for major phone companies and cable companies to \nessentially set up what they have described--described in the business \npress--as a pay-to-play arrangement. It would change the fundamental \nnature of the way the Internet works today. I happen to think that is a \ngreat mistake.\n  Now, in prior speeches, I have come to the floor to give examples of \nwhat the world would look like without Net neutrality for consumers and \nsmall business and innovators.\n  Over the recess, a small business came to me and shared a story that \nI thought was particularly interesting. It is the story of a company \nknown as New Mexico Chili. The two individuals, a married couple, who \nestablished this firm, NMChili.com, set it up as an alternative to the \nhigh-priced on-line Southwestern Chili stores that most people were \nforced to patronize on line. This couple started with a simple idea and \na motto, ``Even our prices taste good.''\n  From the small town of Hatch, NM, home of the world famous Labor Day \nChile Festival, people from around the world can now access the \nwonderful chili that has made Hatch famous. Somebody from my hometown \nin Portland can go on line and within 48 hours have delivered to their \ndoorstep Hatch's finest mild red chili or hot green chili.\n  They have been able to achieve all of this because of the open nature \nof the Internet. They pay their fee to get on the Net and for the \nbandwidth they use, and the business can flourish. This is because the \nNet remains neutral and free of discrimination.\n  Under the Senate Commerce Committee telecommunications bill, this \nwould no longer be the case. This particular couple, in the small town \nof Hatch, NM, would be forced to pay fees to Internet access providers \naround the United States in order to have access to subscribers of \nthese providers, or else they could get stuck in the ``slow lane.'' \nThey would be left with two bad choices: If they pay the fees to the \nproviders, they would no longer be able to say ``even our prices taste \ngood,'' as they will be forced to charge customers more in order to \ncontinue to make profits. If they do not pay the fees to providers, \ntheir Web site would get stuck in what will become the Internet ``slow \nlane,'' angering customers and causing them to lose business to larger \ncompetitors who can afford to pay the fee. Either way, New Mexico \nChili, a small business that came to us, would lose, and its customers \nwould lose.\n  In this example, the large businesses that own the Internet pipes \nextend their reach to the detriment of small business. According to the \nbusiness plans of the major phone and cable companies, what they have \nbeen telling Wall Street, what is printed in the business press, this \nis the direction in which they are headed.\n  Without Net neutrality, without strong, enforceable provisions to \nensure that the Internet is free of discrimination, this small firm in \nNew Mexico would not be able to use the Net the way they can today, and \nthere would be thousands and thousands of other small businesses like \nit.\n  Now, Mr. President and colleagues, we are going to hear a lot about \nthis legislation in the days ahead. I have been hearing reports, for \nexample, that if you have Net neutrality we are going to have problems \nfor consumers in terms of blocking spam. That is not going to happen. \nAnd in the days ahead, I will outline how that is the case, as well.\n  The newest attack is that Net neutrality would prevent parents from \nkeeping pornographic content away from their children's eyes and ears. \nThat also is not going to happen. That is why organizations with great \ninterest and expertise in the area, groups such as the Parents \nTelevision Council, are strongly supporting an Internet that is free of \ndiscrimination, an Internet that has strong provisions to protect Net \nneutrality.\n\n[[Page S9498]]\n\n  The fact is, an Internet free of discrimination, an Internet that \nensures there is Net neutrality is going to allow parents to do the \nsame things they now do in terms of keeping pornography out of their \nhome. And the fact is, I think it is going to give parents new tools in \nthe days ahead to have additional new and exciting options in video \nprogramming that is free of the violence and foul language and sexual \ncontent that many of them are forced to buy today in order to receive \nthe best educational programming on television. That is because the \npromise of a competitive Internet television market is going to grow \nfastest with an Internet that is free of discrimination and an Internet \nthat ensures there is true Net neutrality.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senators who have been active \non the legislation, the distinguished Senator from Alaska and the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington, on the Senate floor. It is not \nmy intent to get in the way of their moving this important legislation. \nSo I intend to come to the floor on additional occasions in the days \nahead to discuss this issue. I wanted to go through the example of that \nsmall business in New Mexico, New Mexico Chili, to outline why they \nbenefit so dramatically with an Internet that is free of \ndiscrimination. I also wanted to outline why Net neutrality is so \nimportant to the cause of protecting parents and families from \npornography and ensuring that those families have the tools to fight \nspam.\n  As I have indicated to the Senate in the past, it is my intent to \nkeep my public hold on the telecommunications legislation until strong \nlanguage is included in that bill that ensures that the Internet, which \ntoday operates free of discrimination, treats all customers the same \nway. Until that is embedded in the legislation that comes before the \nSenate, I will continue to keep my hold on this legislation.\n  I know the sponsors of tonight's bill have important work to do.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, at another time I might discuss this \nsubject, Net neutrality, with the Senator from Oregon. I think what I \nwill do is send him a copy of all the letters I have received from his \nconstituents who agree with me. But I thank him very much for his \ncomments.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Clinton \namendment. Although I understand the need to ensure that first \nresponders and volunteers with definitive health effects from 9/11 \nreceive treatment, I remain very concerned with the current proposal \nfrom the Senator from New York.\n  I must first say that I am sorry Senator Clinton did not speak with \nme first about this matter, as it falls within the HELP Committee \njurisdiction, which I chair and of which Senator Clinton is a member.\n  It also concerns me that the main genesis for action on this issue is \na report released just last week from Mount Sinai, as part of the \nongoing monitoring of health effects that we in Congress have \nauthorized. Given that it has simply been a week since that report, we \nhave not had a full amount of time to review that report and understand \nall of its implications.\n  I am concerned with the Senator from New York's proposal to delegate \nCDC as the primary entity administering this program. Rather than rely \non the current mechanisms for providing health care and treatment \nprograms through the Health Resources and Services Administration at \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, this amendment creates a \nnew role for CDC, taking them away from critical public health \nactivities, such as responding to bird flu and potential bioterrorist \nattacks.\n  It is also important to make sure a program such as this is designed \nin such a way to meet the needs of the first responders and emergency \nworkers that need it most.\n  The eligibility criteria are also too vague and provide health care \nservices for activities that are not related to the events of September \n11, 2001. I appreciate that Senator Clinton's staff have been clear \nwith mine that this is an issue that she recognizes as flawed and she \nwould like to address it. However, we do not have the time to do that \nright now. We should not as a responsible legislative body approve a \nflawed proposal.\n  I do want to continue to work with the Senator from New York to \naddress the health issues of the first responders who assisted in our \nresponse to 9/11. I know that time is limited in the remaining days of \nthis Congress, and all of us would like all of our major priorities to \nbe addressed. However, I have confirmed with HHS that they will soon \nsend out another $75 million in addition to the $125 million which they \nhave already distributed, to provide care and treatment to these \nindividuals for the next few months.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a funding document from \nHHS be inserted into the Record that fully describes the funds that \nhave been allocated to New York city to date.\n  In closing, I want to restate my commitment to further investigating \nthe health effects of 9/11 on first responders and working with HHS to \nensure their health care needs are addressed.\n  We do have time for thoughtful consideration and review of this \nissue, including giving HHS additional authorities through regular \norder.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Selected HHS Post 9/11 Funding\n\n\n                                  cms\n\n       Disaster Relief Medicaid Program: $335 million: HHS \n     provided expedited health care coverage for low-income New \n     York children and adults in the Medicaid, Child Health Plus \n     and Family Health Plus programs and temporary medical \n     coverage for those affected by the September 11th terrorist \n     attacks.\n\n\n                                  hrsa\n\n       Health Centers: $10 million in FY 2001: 33 Health Centers \n     grantees in New York City and Northern New Jersey received \n     one-time grants to support immediate costs of response as \n     well as longer-term health care services as a result of the \n     September 11th terrorist attacks.\n       Grants to Health Care Providers: $35 million in FY 2001: \n     Funding was provided to St. Vincent's Hospital-Manhattan and \n     New York University Downtown Hospital, two of the hospitals \n     in Manhattan that were dramatically impacted by the September \n     11th terrorist attacks. These hospitals mobilized staff to \n     respond to hundreds of seriously injured patients.\n       Grants to Health Care Providers: $135 million in FY 2002: \n     In FY 2002, a special grant to health care entities that \n     suffered financial losses directly attributable to the \n     September 11th terrorist attacks was provided under the \n     Hospital Emergency Response program.\n\n\n                                 samhsa\n\n       Emergency Assistance: $22 million in FY 2001: Funds were \n     provided to support mental health treatment for long-term \n     disorders and to expand substance abuse treatment services to \n     address the needs of individuals and families impacted by the \n     September 11th terrorist attacks.\n       Other Counseling: $10 million in FY 2002: Funding was added \n     to the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative to improve \n     the quality of treatment services to children and adolescents \n     who experienced traumatic events.

NIEHS's Superfund Worker Education Training Program \n     created the primary safety training program for response and \n     cleanup workers at Ground Zero.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in strong support today of the \namendment offered by my colleague Senator Baucus. At the end of the \nlast year, the higher education deduction, along with a number of other \nimportant tax credits, expired. This means that unless we act to extend \nit, nearly 4 million families and students will not be able to deduct \ntheir college tuition from their taxes for this year. At a time when \ncollege prices have more than doubled over the last 5 years, now is not \nthe time for this deduction to disappear.\n  In my State of New Jersey, as across the Nation, tuition is becoming \na heavier burden on our students. New Jersey families spend an average \nof 34 percent of their income on tuition at a 4-year public university. \nThe higher education deduction is a simple way that we can reduce that \nburden, by allowing taxpayers to deduct up to $4,000 in tuition costs. \nDespite this, Congress has sat by while this and other crucial tax \nprovisions expired.\n  In addition to the higher education deduction, Senator Baucus's \namendment would also extend the $250 deduction for out-of-pocket \nexpenses that teachers spend on supplies for their classrooms. \nPurchasing supplies with their own money is only one of the many \nsacrifices our teachers make--this small deduction is the least we can \ndo to help them shoulder that cost. In addition, the amendment would \nextend and expand the research and development credit for companies to \nspur innovation and continue new research, and the new markets tax \ncredit, which helps bring loans and new investments to lower income \ncommunities.\n  Today is now the fourth time this year we have considered extending \nthe important tax credits contained in this amendment.\n  We had our first chance in February, when a majority of this body \nvoted to extend these provisions. Then in May, when we should have \npassed these extensions, instead, our Republican colleagues made a \nchoice. Instead of extending the deduction for college tuition or out-\nof-pocket teacher expenses, both of which have expired, our colleagues \nchose to extend tax cuts on something that does not expire for 2 more \nyears--investment and capital gains income. Our colleagues chose to \nspend $50 billion to extend these tax cuts for 2 more years, when the \ncost to extend both the teacher out-of-pocket and college tuition \ndeductions is less than $8 billion. The fact is, we are running out of \ntime. As a hearing last week highlighted, if these extensions are not \nenacted into law by October 15, it will be too late for the IRS to \nadhere to them for this tax year. We likely have less than 10 \nlegislative days left in this body. If we do not act today, the \nquestion is, when?\n  So, we have a choice once again today. Are we going to act to help \nstudents with the cost of their college tuition, or teachers with the \nsacrifices they make for their students, or are we going to sit by and \npretend that these costs are not a hardship for millions of Americans?\n  I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will see the \nneed and the urgency to extend these provisions today, and not continue \nto wait, putting off tax relief that our students and families deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Baucus amendment, and to extend \nthis relief today.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, on Monday, we marked the fifth anniversary \nof the September 11 attacks. The horror and sadness of the attacks on \nthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon remain with us as a nation. We \nare still trying to come to grips with the security failures that \nallowed four civilian airplanes to be hijacked resulting in the death \nand injury of thousands of Americans and civilians from across the \nworld.\n  Fortunately, there has not been a terrorist attack on the United \nStates since 9/11; but al-Qaida continues to perpetrate terrorist \nattacks throughout the world. We remain at risk.\n  Today, we are considering legislation essential to keeping American \nports and the maritime industry safe from terrorist attacks. I commend \nSenators Collins, Lieberman, Stevens, Inouye, Grassley, Baucus, and \nMurray for their work on this legislation.\n  While our Nation acted quickly after 9/11 to secure our airports and \nairplanes, major vulnerabilities remain in maritime and surface \ntransportation. As the 9/11 Commission concluded ``opportunities to do \nharm are as great, or greater, in maritime and surface transportation'' \nas in commercial aviation. I am glad the Senate is finally turning its \nattention to these critical security challenges.\n  A terrorist incident at one of our Nation's ports could have \ntremendous costs in human lives and force the shutdown of ports across \nthe Nation, which would have devastating and long-term impacts on our \neconomy.\n  This bill is a good first step in protecting our seaports and \nmaritime industry. However, there must be funds to support the homeland \nsecurity initiatives in this bill if we are to make more than a \nsymbolic effort. I am glad that the Senate accepted Senator Murray's \namendment to provide dedicated funding for port security. This \nadministration and Congress has not made port, rail, or transit \nsecurity priorities for funding, and authorizing language while \nimportant is not sufficient.\n  Al-Qaida and other terrorist groups continue to strike across the \nworld. A recent survey by the Center for American Progress and Foreign \nPolicy magazine of national security and terrorism experts found that \n86 percent believe the world is now more dangerous, and 84 percent \nbelieve the United States is losing the war on terror. For too long, \nthe administration's focus on the war in Iraq has diverted resources \nand attention from the true war on terror. These are resources that \ncould be used to fund security efforts at airports, at ports, on rail, \nand on public transit. These are resources that could be used at home \nto make us safer.\n  Each year, more than 11 million containers pass through U.S. ports \nand 53,000 foreign-flagged vessels visiting them. Since 9/11, Congress \nhas appropriated a total of $765 million for port security grants, \nincluding $173 million in fiscal year 2006, to help our ports adopt \nimportant security measures. The Coast Guard, however, estimated that \nneeded port security improvements could cost more than $5 billion.\n  Transit agencies around the country have identified in excess of $6 \nbillion in transit security needs--$5.2 billion in security-related \ncapital investment and $800 million to support personnel and related \noperation security measures to ensure transit security and readiness.\n  I am pleased that the Senate passed an amendment coauthored by \nBanking Committee Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Sarbanes, Senator \nAllard, and me to the port security bill that will authorize a needs-\nbased grant program within the Department of Homeland Security to \nidentify and address the vulnerabilities of our Nation's transit \nsystems. I thank Senators Shelby and Sarbanes for their leadership and \nhard work on this vitally important issue.\n  This amendment, consistent with the Public Transportation Security \nAct that passed the Senate in the 108th Congress, provides $3.5 billion \nover the next 3 years to transit agencies for projects designed to \nresist and deter terrorist attacks, including surveillance \ntechnologies, tunnel protection, chemical, biological, radiological, \nand explosive detection systems, perimeter protection, training, the \nestablishment of redundant critical operations control systems, and \nother security improvements.\n  Transit is the most common, and most vulnerable, target of terrorists \nworldwide, whether it is Madrid, London, Moscow, Tokyo, Israel, or \nMumbai. According to a Brookings Institution study, 42 percent of all \nterrorist attacks between 1991 and 2001 were directed at mass transit \nsystems.\n  Transit is vital to providing mobility for millions of Americans and \noffers\n\n[[Page S9500]]\n\ntremendous economic benefits to our Nation. In the United States, \npeople use public transportation over 32 million each week day compared \nto 2 million passengers who fly daily. Paradoxically, it is the very \nopenness of the system that makes it vulnerable to terrorism. When one \nconsiders that roughly $9 per passenger is invested in aviation \nsecurity, but less than one cent is invested in the security of each \ntransit passenger, the need for this amendment and increased funding is \nclear.\n  Transit agencies and the women and men who operate them have been \ndoing a tremendous job to increase security in a post 9/11 world, but \nthere is only so much they can do with the very limited resources at \ntheir disposal. Our Nation's 6,000 transit agencies face a difficult \nbalancing act as they attempt to tighten security and continue to move \npeople from home to work or school or shopping or other locations \nefficiently and affordably. This amendment authorizes necessary funding \nto provide transit agencies with the tools they need to secure our \ncommuter trains, subways, ferries, and buses.\n  With energy prices taking a larger chunk out of consumers' \npocketbooks, public transit offers a solution to our national energy \ncrisis and dependence on foreign oil. But, more Americans will not use \ntransit unless commuters feel safe. I am glad that the Senate passed \nthis bipartisan amendment which will grant transit security a similar \nstanding as aviation security.\n  I would also like to take a moment to touch upon some of the \nprovisions in the Real Security Act amendment offered by Senator Reid \nthat are relevant to efforts I have been working on in my capacity as a \nmember of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--HELP--\nCommittee. I am disappointed that this amendment failed on a budget \npoint of order.\n  At the end of last year, the majority inserted into the must pass \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations bill broad liability protections \nfor drug manufacturers for countermeasure products. While we certainly \nneed vaccines and other medications to protect the population from the \narray of potential biological, chemical, and nuclear agents that could \nbe intentionally used against us, such sweeping immunity was not \nappropriate.\n  At the same time, the bill did next to nothing to protect first \nresponders, health care providers, and the general public should they \nbe injured as a result of a countermeasure product utilized during the \ncourse of a public health emergency.\n  Senator Reid's Real Security amendment provided for a sound and \nlogical process for anyone who is injured or dies as a result of a \ncountermeasure to receive fair and just compensation under the vaccine \ninjury compensation fund. The amendment also provided appropriate \nindemnification for producers of countermeasure products.\n  A key element in any effort to respond to a public health emergency \nis public trust and cooperation during the process. If our health care \nproviders, first responders, and the general public do not have \nconfidence in the response effort, they will choose not to participate. \nWe have already been through this experience once with the President's \nfailed effort to get first responders inoculated against smallpox.\n  We must have thoughtful and clear procedures in place to demonstrate \nto those who may be called upon during a public health emergency that \nthey will have recourse should they suffer as a result of a \ncountermeasure intended to protect them. We all know that no vaccine or \npharmaceutical is 100 percent safe. A small segment of the population \nwill inevitably suffer an adverse event and to ensure they are taken \ncare of in this event is the right and responsible thing to do.\n  Another important area this amendment addresses is the need to \nstrengthen our hospital and public health infrastructure.\n  Federal efforts to shore up our hospitals and public health systems \ncontinue to fall short. Despite the ongoing support for bioterrorism \npreparedness activities in cities and states, grants for these \nimportant efforts, like many other critical domestic priorities, have \nactually declined over the past year.\n  The Real Security amendment would have bolstered our hospitals and \npublic health workforce in their preparedness efforts, enhances the \nability of health care providers to respond during a public health \nemergency, and improves our domestic and international disease \nsurveillance capabilities.\n  When it comes to protecting our homeland against a terrorist attack, \nwe can and must do more to fortify our ports, our transit systems, and \nour health care infrastructure. We must also reorient our priorities to \nensure that we are doing all we can to protect our most important \nasset--our citizens.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to herald two amendments to this \nimportant homeland security legislation that, I hope, will go a long \nway toward improving the security of our nation's rail and mass transit \nsystems.\n  Yesterday, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nheld a hearing at which Secretary Chertoff, representatives from the \nNew York and Los Angeles County police departments, and two security \nexperts testified about the future direction of homeland security. The \nwitnesses expressed an eclectic array of views. But on at least one \npoint, they were all in agreement: radical Islamic terrorists have \ntargeted railroads and mass transit systems in Europe, and the United \nStates could very well be next.\n  Terrorists have hit the subways, trains, and buses of London, Madrid, \nMumbai, Tokyo, Moscow, and Israel. It is inconceivable that they have \nforgotten about us in the United States.\n  In fact, ``Jane's Intelligence Review'' posted a story on its Web \nsite at the end of last month, stating that ``Terrorist attacks on \ntrains and metro rail systems in cities such as Mumbai, London, Madrid, \nand Moscow suggest a sustained interest by terrorists in exploiting the \noften open aspect of commuter rail infrastructure to execute mass \ncasualty attacks.''\n  This is an enormous concern to nearly all of us in this body. \nFourteen million people use rail and mass transit every day in this \ncountry. In my home State of Connecticut, for example, the Metro North \nNew Haven line is one of the busiest rail lines in the United States, \ncarrying about 110,000 riders each day. And the Stamford, CT, train \nstation on that line is among the busiest city rail stations in the \nUnited States.\n  Mass transit is a way of life for so many Americans. Our subways, \ntrolleys, buses, and ferries carry millions of us to work each day, to \nshop, to sporting events, and to see friends and family. The speed, \nreliability, and convenience of mass transit has become a part of the \ncultural fabric of this Nation and helps to make us as mobile a Nation \nas we are.\n  Unfortunately, transit systems pose one of the greatest challenges to \nsecurity experts--a challenge that calls for the attention of our \nNation's best and brightest minds and should be a much bigger priority \nfor the Federal Government than it is has been.\n  After the London bombings last July, our committee led a bipartisan \ninvestigation of the state of mass transit systems in the United \nStates, culminating in a hearing on September 21, 2005. Chairman \nCollins and I examined the vulnerability of those systems, the threats \nto them, and the level and types of attention that our governments \nshould devote to them.\n  Unlike airports, which are closed systems, rail and transit systems \nare open and carry seven times as many people in a year. With so many \nstops, stations, and lines, we cannot install airport security type \nchecks at every subway station, bus stop, and rail terminal. Traffic \nwould come to a dead halt.\n  But we can and must apply the ``can do, will do'' attitude we have \nadopted toward aviation security to mass transit and rail security. The \namendments that we have added to this bill are an important step in \nthat direction.\n  The first of these amendments is Senators Shelby's and Sarbanes' \nproposal to beef up the security of our public transportation systems. \nI proudly cosponsored this amendment because of my strong belief and \nconviction that we need to do all we can to secure our mass transit \nsystems.\n  This week, the Commerce and Homeland Security Committees have put the \ninterests of the country ahead of jurisdictional and party differences \nto work to improve the security of America's ports. That is real \nleadership.\n  The Shelby-Sarbanes amendment was adopted by the Senate in the same \nvein. The Banking and Homeland Security Committees also have put aside\n\n[[Page S9501]]\n\ntheir jurisdictional differences to promote the interests of the \ncountry first. If the Senate produced more legislation in this manner, \nperhaps the American public could suspend its cynicism about our \noverwhelming absorption with scoring political points.\n  The Shelby-Sarbanes amendment will authorize $3.5 billion in grants \nfor mass transit security, including capital improvements, research and \ndevelopment, and operations.\n  This amendment is an authorization but it sets a marker for the \nCongress to fund these grant programs in the subsequent appropriations \ncycles.\n  The amendment also restores funding for the Public Transportation \nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center, which is the vehicle for mass \ntransit systems all over the country to share and analyze intelligence \nabout threats to their sector, and defenses against them.\n  The second amendment I want to address is Senator McCain's rail \nsecurity amendment, which I also cosponsored. In fact, when my friend \nfrom Arizona introduced this amendment as a bill in the 108th Congress, \nI cosponsored it then. It will make marked improvements in the security \nof our passenger rail systems with an authorization of $1.2 billion. \nThe amendment directs the Department of Homeland Security to complete \nand prioritize recommendations regarding vulnerability assessments for \nfreight and passenger rail transportation systems. Notably, the \namendment would benefit Amtrak and its thousands of daily riders in \nthree direct ways.\n  The amendment also creates a pilot program to conduct random security \nscreens of passengers and baggage at a specified number of Amtrak \nstations. It calls for certain fire and life-safety improvements and \ninfrastructure upgrades to Amtrak tunnels on the Northeast Corridor. \nAnd it directs Amtrak to submit to the National Transportation Safety \nBoard and the Secretary of Transportation a plan to address the needs \nof families of passengers involved in rail passenger accidents.\n  Combined, the authorizations contained within these two amendments \nare in line with the American Public Transportation Association's \nestimate that $7.2 billion is needed to secure the country's rail and \ntransit systems.\n  Over the last few years, we have seen the decentralization of al-\nQaida and with it the growth of homegrown terrorist activities directed \ntoward the open, densely populated, and vulnerable mass transit and \nrail systems.

Madam President, an awful lot has been written and enough \nhas been said about the comments made yesterday by House majority \nleader John Boehner. I am not interested in asking Mr. Boehner for a \nclarification or retraction or even an apology. His statement was very \nclear and I believe equally despicable. And his words are, frankly, \nbeyond redemption. They are, however, sadly, what we have seen much too \nmuch of in politics today in our country.\n  So this is an opportunity today for the Senate to be the Senate. We \ntalk here about ``my friend from across the aisle.'' We talk about the \ntraditions of the Senate. We talk about civility. But in the last \nyears, a lot of us have seen things happen here that never would have \nhappened in the Senate of 15 or 20 years ago.\n  We have come a long way since the days when Bob Dole and George \nMitchell refused to campaign against each other. I have seen colleagues \nsay in the cloakroom that they thought it was wrong to see the courage \nof their friend, Max Cleland, attacked, but on the floor of the Senate \nthere is silence.\n  I know there are good people here who still long for civility. I have \nheard it. I heard the junior Senator from Oregon say, just this summer: \nMy soul cries out for something more dignified. My friend from Arizona, \njust this spring, said: The self-expression sometimes overwhelms our \ncivility.\n  Well, this is one of those times. But I think it is more than that. I \nthink it is an opportunity, in keeping with these pleas for civility, \nfor some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to actually \ncome to the floor and not just talk about civility but express the \ntruth, to come here and condemn Mr. Boehner's remarks in no uncertain \nterms if they disagree with them. I think that is the real test of the \nkind of place we have become and the kind of politics we are willing to \ntolerate. It is a test of the character of the Senate. And I think \nevery American would benefit from hearing where Republicans stand on \nMr. Boehner's words expressed yesterday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9501-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SENATOR BAUCUS'S 10,000TH VOTE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

On \nrollcall vote No. 244, the distinguished Senator from Montana and the \ncurrent ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus, \ncast his 10,000th vote in this Chamber.\n  Senator Baucus now joins a very historic and select club of U.S. \nSenators who can claim this distinction. Only 26 other Senators have \nachieved this milestone.\n  From his post on the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus has worked on \na bipartisan basis on many issues important to Montanans, from tax \npolicy to health care reform. Legislating is the art of compromise, and \nin his 28 years of service Senator Baucus has mastered it.\n  A recent example that comes to mind is the Medicare prescription drug \nbill, which I sponsored. Without Senator Baucus's hard work and \nsupport, 31 million seniors wouldn't have the drug benefits they now \nenjoy.\n  Back home in Montana, Senator Baucus is affectionately known for his \n``Work Days''--days he spends working a full day alongside Montanans at \na local business.\n  Senator Baucus, I know I speak for all your fellow Senators, when I \nsay congratulations on this achievement, but more importantly, thank \nyou for your service to Montana, to your country, and importantly, to \nthe United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9501-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    50TH ANNIVERSARY OF GOLINHARRIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr President, I would like to make remarks about an \nAmerican who has made many proud and achieved an incredible milestone \nthis past weekend.\n\n[[Page S9502]]\n\n  The person I am referring to is Joe Dumars who has been affiliated \nwith the Detroit Pistons professional basketball franchise since he was \ndrafted by the Pistons in 1985. This past Friday, Joe was inducted in \nthe Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, MA. On \nbehalf of all Michiganders and Pistons fans everywhere, I would like to \ncongratulate Joe and his family on this great achievement.\n  Joe Dumars was born May 24, 1963, in Shrevepoint, LA. He attended \nNatchitoches High School and later McNeese State University, both also \nin Louisiana. He was the number eighth overall pick in the 1985 \nNational Basketball Association--NBA--draft, selected by the Pistons \nfor, among other things, his reputation to play defense.\n  In the NBA, Joe lived up to that reputation--often being called on by \nPistons head coach Chuck Daly to guard the other team's best player. \nThis was never more evident in the 1980s as the Pistons consistently \nbested the Chicago Bulls due in part to Joe Dumars' defense on a young \nguard named Michael Jordan. To this day, Michael Jordan says Joe Dumars \nwas one of the best defenders he ever faced.\n  Always a team player, Joe Dumars became a pillar in the foundation of \na Pistons team that went to the NBA finals three times in his career \nwinning the championship twice in 1989 and 1990. Isiah Thomas, Bill \nLaimbeer, Dennis Rodman, John Salley, and Joe Dumars proved that \ndefense wins championships, and Joe was personally rewarded as the NBA \nFinals MVP in 1989.\n  Joe Dumars retired as a player from the NBA in 1999 playing all 14 of \nhis seasons with the Pistons. His career achievements include scoring \n16,401 points, handing out 4,612 assists, grabbing 2,203 rebounds, and \nrecording 903 steals. He was named to the NBA All-Star team six times \nand to the NBA All Defensive first team four times during his career. \nJoe's jersey was retired by the Pistons the year after he retired and \nit now hangs high in the rafters of the Palace of Auburn Hills.\n  Although Joe's playing career was now over, his enthusiasm and love \nof the game never diminished, so he took a job in 2000 with the Pistons \nin their front office as president of Basketball Operations. He was \nnamed NBA Executive of the Year in 2003 and put together the team that \nreached the NBA finals in 2004 and 2005. Winning the NBA championship \nin 2004 made Joe a key figure of all three Pistons' championships.\n  Friday in Springfield, MA, all of Joe's achievements earned him the \nultimate recognition in his chosen profession. So to Joe, his family, \nhis former teammates, and the entire Pistons organization, from this \nPistons fan I say congratulations on a recognition well deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9502-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9502-S9503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join the vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee in expressing my concerns about the Committee's \ninability to conduct oversight of the President's illegal warrantless \nwiretapping program. Unfortunately, the administration's continued \ndefiance of Congress is simply the latest in a series of efforts to \nhide its illegal activities and obscure the true extent of its power \ngrab.\n  Let us not forget how we got to this point. For 4 years, the \nadministration conducted a plainly illegal program, eavesdropping on \nAmericans on American soil without the warrants required under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. During this time, the \nadministration refused to inform the full congressional intelligence \ncommittees, in clear violation of the National Security Act.\n  Then, late last year, the program was revealed in the press. Rather \nthan admit that it had broken the law and explain why it had done so, \nthe administration used the occasion to embark on a coordinated and \nmisleading public relations campaign. In speeches and press \nconferences, administration officials repeatedly asserted that domestic \neavesdropping without a warrant was necessary to conduct surveillance \nof terrorist suspects, and it suggested that those committed to the \nrule of law were unconcerned about the terrorist threat.\n  Even the title the administration has bestowed upon its illegal \nbehavior--the Terrorist Surveillance Program--is misleading. We already \nhave a ``terrorist surveillance program.'' It is called FISA. It \npermits the surveillance of terrorist suspects in the United States, \nwith the approval of a secret court, and it has been the law of the \nland for nearly 30 years.\n  Let us also not forget the administration's illegal defiance of \ncongressional oversight. For 4\\1/2\\ years, including several months \nafter the warrantless wiretapping program was revealed in the press, \nthe administration violated the National Security Act by refusing to \nbrief the congressional intelligence committees on the program. The \nadministration began the briefings required by law only when it became \nclear that its defiance might complicate the nomination of General \nHayden, who, as the then-Director of the NSA, implemented the program \nand had been nominated as the new Director of the CIA. Despite months \nof public discussion about the program by administration officials, the \nmajority of the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee were \nbriefed about the program for the first time only on the eve of General \nHayden's confirmation hearing in May.\n  Those of us who hoped that this belated briefing marked a change in \nattitude--and a recognition of the administration's legal \nresponsibilities--were quickly disappointed. That is why, later that \nmonth, the full Senate Intelligence Committee called on the \nadministration to work with the committee so that we could conduct \nongoing, thorough oversight over the operational, legal and budgetary \naspects of the program. The cooperation requested by the Committee has \nnot happened, however. And, as the vice chairman has pointed out, the \nadministration continues to refuse to provide the committee with \ncritical documents and information necessary to review the program.\n  The congressional intelligence committees review highly sensitive \nclassified intelligence programs every day. That is their job. The vast \nmajority of those programs have never been publicly disclosed. Yet the \nwarrantless wiretapping program--which has been the subject of \nspeeches, press conferences and public testimony by administration \nofficials, making it the most widely examined, the most public program \nin NSA's history--is the one program the administration still refuses \nto explain fully to the congressional intelligence committees.\n  The vice chairman of the committee has described some of the \nmaterials that the administration has thus far refused to provide the \ncommittee--Presidential orders authorizing the program, legal reviews \nand opinions relating to the program, and procedures and guidelines on \nthe use of information obtained through the program. All of these \nmaterials relate to the legality of the program. It is difficult to \navoid the conclusion that the administration has stonewalled the \ncommittee's efforts to conduct oversight of this program not because \nthe program is uniquely sensitive, but because it is illegal.\n  While the Intelligence Committee has been unable to conduct oversight \nof the warrantless surveillance program, the Judiciary Committee, which \nthis morning reported out a bill that seeks to legalize the program, \nhas been denied access to any information about the program. Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales has provided testimony to the Judiciary Committee, but \nthat testimony has been limited to a careful repetition of only what \nthe President has already publicly acknowledged. As a result, the \nJudiciary Committee does not have access to information it needed \nbefore it should even have begun considering legislation, including \nmany of the legal documents denied the Intelligence Committee. The \nJudiciary Committee was left to legislate in the dark, with many \nmembers blindly seeking to legalize illegal behavior without even an \nunderstanding of whether those changes are actually necessary.\n  And now, we face the prospect that the full Senate may consider \nlegislation related to the program. It is bad enough to have a \ncommittee legislate in the dark. But having the entire Senate debate \nlegislation when just a few Senators--those on the Intelligence\n\n[[Page S9503]]\n\nCommittee--have any information at all on the subject of the \nlegislation only makes things worse.\n  In the rush to rubberstamp the administration's unconstitutional \npower grab, Congress could end up turning the legislative process on \nits head. As an institution, and as elected representatives of the \nAmerican people, it is our responsibility to make sure the President \ncomplies with the law. Instead, Republican leaders are rushing to make \nsure the law complies with the President. That is far from the ringing \naffirmation of the rule of law that we should expect from Congress in \nresponse to the administration's law-breaking.\n  If Congress and the administration are going to take seriously their \nrespective responsibilities, four things must happen. First, the \ncongressional intelligence committees must demand that the \nadministration provide documents and information related to the \nwarrantless surveillance program and insist on the same kind of \nthorough oversight to which other intelligence programs are subject. \nThe National Security Act requires that the committees be kept fully \nand currently informed of all intelligence programs. It is long past \ntime for the administration to respect the spirit of that law.\n  Second, the administration must provide the information the Judiciary \nCommittee needs about the program so that it can reconsider the \nuninformed and dangerous legislation reported out this morning. That \ndoes not mean the Judiciary Committee has to see operational details \nabout the program. It does mean it needs to understand the basics of \nthe program and the administration's contemporaneous legal \njustifications throughout the duration of the program. Certainly, the \nJudiciary Committee should not even have begun to consider expanding \nFISA before it received an explanation from the administration as to \nwhy it was unwilling to comply with current law. The administration has \nnever provided that explanation because, in my view, it cannot. From \nwhat I have seen as a member of the Intelligence Committee, the \nsurveillance that the administration says is necessary to protect this \ncountry can be accommodated without violating FISA.\n  We can listen in on terrorist suspects without surrendering the basic \nprinciple of individualized warrants. We can be secure without having \nto accept unchecked executive power. We can effectively fight terrorism \nwithout sacrificing the rights and freedoms that make this country the \ngreatest beacon for individual liberty in the history of the world.\n  The mere assertion by the President that FISA no longer applies \ncannot be the basis for eradicating 30 years of law and jurisprudence. \nCongress should demand answers before deciding whether and how to amend \nFISA.\n  This leads me to my third point--that the Judiciary Committee should \ncarefully and thoroughly consider any specific proposals for improving \nthe FISA law, closely examining whether they are justified. Despite the \naction this morning, we have not done that yet. Recent testimony by \nGenerals Alexander and Hayden provided some possible suggestions as to \nways that FISA might be modernized--the kinds of suggestions that \nshould have been made years ago. Congress should encourage more such \nexchanges, and should consider major revisions to FISA only after it \ncan fully assess the need for such legislation as well as its ultimate \nimpact. By rushing to legitimize and legalize domestic surveillance \nthat does not comply with the FISA law, Congress only short-circuits \nthis process.\n  And fourth, regardless of current oversight and legislative efforts, \nthe President needs to be held accountable for breaking the law. His \ndomestic warrantless wiretapping program is illegal. The legal \narguments put forward to justify the program are as dubious today as \nthey were when they were made last December, particularly in light of \nthe recent Supreme Court decision in Hamdan. The President's failure to \ninform the full congressional intelligence committees about the program \nfor years was also illegal, and his subsequent decision to provide only \nlimited information about the program to the intelligence committees at \nthe least violates the spirit of the National Security Act. And the \nPresident continues, to this day, to mislead the country about \nterrorist surveillance and FISA. For these reasons, Congress should \ncensure the President. The challenging and crucial work of defending \nour Nation against a determined enemy demands a return to the rule of \nlaw. We are stronger as a law-abiding country, not weaker.\n  We should be working together to protect America. The President's \npower grab has been a long and costly distraction. It has undermined a \npreexisting consensus about how to defend our country and its \ndemocratic traditions. It has resulted in a completely unnecessary \nstand-off between the executive branch and Congress. And it has \nresulted in an administration publicly making the untenable argument \nthat the laws passed by Congress can be ignored.\n  None of this was inevitable. And it can all be resolved, if only we \ntake a step back and remember the principles on which our system of \ngovernment was based. The balance of powers enshrined in the \nConstitution and the freedoms contained in the Bill of Rights are not \nimpediments to our national security. They are our strength. We can and \nmust fight terrorism aggressively without undermining the rule of law \non which this country stands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9503-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9503-S9504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Kenneth Jenkins\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

As Nick likes to say, \nthis is the ``non-farm,'' or ``non-food'' part of USDA. It's about new \nwater and waste water systems, so people can have clean, dependable \nrunning water. It's about new community centers, town halls, and even \nhigh-tech or educational assets like broadband service, telemedicine \nand long-distance learning.\n  Since taking office, Nick has presented scores of oversized checks, \nin countless photos for local papers telling stories about a new water \ntower or a new police car or fire truck.\n  Some people might think these things are small, and they often are in \nterms of Federal dollars. But these modest services will reverberate \nfor years to come. As Nick says: USDA rural development is really about \neconomic development, helping to encourage and sustain job creation--\npaving the way for communities to grow.\n  Nick has helped administer more than $100 million to Mississippi's \ncities and towns through this agency. He hasn't sat on laurels waiting \nfor mayors, supervisors, town aldermen, or CEOs to approach him. Nick \nhas been proactive, innovative, and he is actively sought cases and \nways to meet individual community needs through USDA's various rural \ndevelopment programs.\n  We have all heard the old saying: ``Don't tell me what you can't do, \ntell me what you can do.'' That is been Nick Walters' approach to \npublic service. His first inclination is to act. That is something we \nMississippians appreciate. After Hurricane Katrina, we saw many Federal \nbureaucrats in FEMA and elsewhere strapped by indecision, blinded by \ntunnel vision, stuck on what they could not do, obsessed with the word \n``no'' when they should have been saying ``yes.'' Nick isn't that type. \nHe has provided a great example of what someone in this office can do \nusing its authority to the utmost, and we're working hard to find a \nsuccessor who will continue this strong leadership.\n  Nick Walters will be missed but my guess is that he will be back in \npublic service one day. In what capacity? I don't know. That is a \ndecision for him, his wife Lisa, and his young children, Porter and \nJohn Garrett.\n  But now with this success behind him and given his previous \nexperience in the private sector, his work with former Mississippi \nGovernor Kirk Fordice, his stint as chief of staff for the Mississippi \nPublic Service Commission Nick Walters will be successful in wherever \nhis endeavors may lead.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Nick Walters for his \nexemplary service to the Federal Government and, more importantly, to \nAmerica as Mississippi's USDA rural development director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9504-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MURRAYHILL LITTLE LEAGUE ALL-STAR TEAM\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nOregon's Murrayhill 11 and 12-year-old Little League All-Star team. \nThey recently placed second in the U.S. Little League World Series \nChampionship, and third in the World Little League Championship.\n  On August 26, 2006, at Howard J. Lamade Stadium in South \nWilliamsport, PA, Murrayhill capped a remarkable postseason, losing the \nUnited States Championship to Columbus Northern Little League from \nGeorgia. Murrayhill was the first Oregon team in 48 years to qualify \nfor the Little League World Series, and the first to ever reach the \nU.S. Championship game. On their road to the championship, they won the \nDistrict 4, Oregon State, and Northwestern Regional Baseball \nTournaments.\n  Murrayhill displayed great heart, outstanding teamwork, dedication, \nresilience, character, and sportsmanship throughout the tournament \nwhile achieving one of the highest honors in Little League Baseball.\n  This team of 11 and 12-year-olds brought pride to the State of Oregon \nwith their remarkable run during this year's postseason. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating all the players involved in a \nhard-fought U.S. Little League World Series.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9504-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MONROE SWEETLAND\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life of \nMonroe Sweetland--a visionary, a patriot, a statesman, and the father \nof the modern Democratic Party of Oregon. Monroe passed away Sunday, \nSeptember 10, at the age of 96, having lived a very full life in \npursuit of a better Oregon and a better Nation.\n  An Oregon native, Monroe was born in Salem in 1910. After attending \nlaw school, he returned to Oregon, and, following the Second World War, \nhe worked tirelessly on behalf of the Democratic Party of Oregon, \nrebuilding the party from the ashes. Monroe was a strong Democrat, a \nproud partisan who stood with his party not out of any desire for \ninfluence or power but out of a belief in the values espoused. He \nseemed to know instinctively that if the party was strong in its \nvalues, then electoral success would follow. And on that basis, he \nworked to rebuild our party from the ground up.\n  A tireless worker on behalf of others' campaigns, he also held \nelected office, serving for 10 years in the State legislature, first as \na member of the Oregon House of Representatives and then as a member of \nthe Oregon Senate. Prior to that, in 1948, he was elected to the \nDemocratic National Committee.\n  Given his strong partisan politics, some might think his most notable \nfeat was converting U.S. Senator Wayne Morse, whose seat I now hold, to \nthe Democratic Party--helping Senator Morse to see the light, as it \nwere. But Monroe considered the passage of the Bilingual Education Act \nof 1968, a product of his work at the National Education Association, \nhis most important accomplishment. What I will remember most about \nMonroe is the way he lived: his boundless optimism, his energy to get \nthings done and his smile that would warm even the coldest room.\n  When I spoke with Monroe a few weeks ago, he was still the activist \nwe all knew so well. The last thing we discussed was the November 2006 \nelections, and, since Monroe was constitutionally incapable of being \nanything other than optimistic, he did not want to discuss what-ifs \nabout the outcome of the election; he only wanted to talk about the \ngood that the Democratic Party will accomplish when it wins back the \nmajority in Congress this fall.\n  Oregon and the Nation are better for having had Monroe Sweetland in \nthe world. For 96 years, we were blessed with his presence on this \nsmall planet. Although life seems a little dimmer without him, I know \nmy life is better for having known him.\n  I know Monroe is in heaven, and if I had to guess, I would say it is \nlikely he is up there right now organizing the angels for further good \ndeeds. Nothing on this Earth slowed him down and I don't expect that to \nchange now that he has gone ahead to a better place.\n  A giant of politics in our State, and an even greater human being, \nMonroe will be sorely missed by all who knew him, and even more sorely \nmissed, though they may never know it, by those who never had that \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9504-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9504-5", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9504-S9505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S9505]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9504-5", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9504-S9505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S9505]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/13/senate-section/article/S9505-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 9:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n  S.3534.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Trust \n     Fund Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 2002, an independent, bipartisan commission, the \n     National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \n     States (in this section referred to as the ``Commission''), \n     was established under title VI of Public Law 107-306 to \n     prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances \n     surrounding the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, \n     including preparedness for and the immediate response to the \n     attacks.\n       (2) The Commission was also tasked with providing \n     recommendations designed to guard against future attacks \n     against the United States.\n\n[[Page S9511]]\n\n       (3) The Commission held 12 public hearings to offer a \n     public dialogue about the Commission's goals and priorities, \n     sought to learn about work already completed, and the state \n     of current knowledge, all in order to identify the most \n     important issues and questions requiring further \n     investigation.\n       (4) This Commission was widely praised for its thorough \n     investigation and the bi-partisan nature of its proceedings.\n       (5) On July 22, 2004, the Commission released its final \n     report that set out the events leading to the attacks on \n     September 11th, a chilling minute-by-minute account of that \n     tragic day, and, more importantly, issued 41 recommendations \n     to better prepare the United States to protect against future \n     terrorist attacks.\n       (6) While the Commission was officially dissolved, the \n     Commissioners stayed together to create the 9/11 Public \n     Discourse Project in order to push for the implementation of \n     those recommendations.\n       (7) On December 5, 2005, the Commissioners released a \n     report card evaluating the progress in implementing those \n     recommendations.\n       (8) The Commissioners issued very few A's and B's and \n     issued 12 D's and 5 failing grades.\n       (9) The failures identified by the Commissioners' report \n     card were across the board, ranging from transportation \n     security, to infrastructure protection and government reform.\n       (10) Specifically, the Commissioners stated that ``few \n     improvements have been made to the existing passenger \n     screening system since right after 9/11. The completion of \n     the testing phase of TSA's pre-screening program for airline \n     passengers has been delayed. A new system, utilizing all \n     names on the consolidated terrorist watch list, is therefore \n     not yet in operation.''.\n       (11) The Commissioners also found that ``. . . No risk and \n     vulnerability assessments actually made; no national \n     priorities established; no recommendations made on allocation \n     of scarce resources . . . It is time that we stop talking \n     about setting priorities and actually set some.''.\n       (12) The Commission issued a grade of D on checked bag and \n     cargo screening measures, stating that ``improvements have \n     not been made by the Congress or the administration. Progress \n     on implementation of in-line screening has been slow. The \n     main impediment is inadequate funding.''.\n       (13) With regard to information sharing and technology, the \n     Commission noted that ``there has been no systematic \n     diplomatic efforts to share terrorist watch lists, nor has \n     Congress taken a leadership role in passport security . . .'' \n     and that ``there remain many complaints about lack of \n     information sharing between federal authorities and state and \n     local level officials.''.\n       (14) The Administration has failed to focus on prevention \n     here at home by abandoning our first line of defense against \n     terrorism--local law enforcement.\n       (15) In the President's FY 2006 budget request, the \n     President requested a cut of over $2,000,000,000 in \n     guaranteed assistance to law enforcement.\n       (16) According to the International Association of Chiefs \n     of Police, this decision represents a fundamentally flawed \n     view of what is needed to prevent domestic terror attacks.\n       (17) The Council on Foreign Relations released a report \n     entitled, ``Emergency First Responders: Drastically \n     Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared'', in which the Council \n     found that ``America's local emergency responders will always \n     be the first to confront a terrorist incident and will play \n     the central role in managing its immediate consequences. \n     Their efforts in the first minutes and hours following an \n     attack will be critical to saving lives, establishing order, \n     and preventing mass panic. The United States has both a \n     responsibility and a critical need to provide them with the \n     equipment, training, and other resources necessary to do \n     their jobs safely and effectively.''.\n       (18) The Council further concluded that many State and \n     local emergency responders, including police officers and \n     firefighters, lack the equipment and training needed to \n     respond effectively to a terrorist attack involving weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (19) Current first responder funding must be increased to \n     help local agencies create counter-terrorism units and assist \n     such agencies to integrate community policing models with \n     counter-terror efforts.\n       (20) First responders still do not have adequate spectrum \n     to communicate during an emergency. Congress finally passed \n     legislation forcing the networks to turn over spectrum, but \n     the date was set for February 2008. This is unacceptable, \n     this spectrum should be turned over immediately.\n       (21) The Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure \n     that the people of the United States are protected to the \n     greatest possible extent against a terrorist attack, \n     especially an attack that utilizes nuclear, chemical, \n     biological, or radiological weapons, and consequently, the \n     Federal Government has a critical responsibility to address \n     the equipment, training, and other needs of State and local \n     first responders.\n       (22) To echo the sentiments of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, ``it is time that \n     we stop talking about setting priorities and actually set \n     some.''.\n       (23) The cost of fully implementing all 41 recommendations \n     put forth by the Commission and the common sense steps to \n     secure the homeland represents less than 1 year of President \n     Bush's tax cuts for millionaires.\n       (24) By investing 1 year of the tax cuts for millionaires \n     into a trust fund to be invested over the next 5 years, the \n     Federal Government can implement the Commission's \n     recommendations and make great strides towards making our \n     Nation safer.\n       (25) The Americans making more than $1,000,000 understand \n     that our country changed after 9/11, yet they have not been \n     asked to sacrifice for the good of the Nation.\n       (26) In this Act, we call on the patriotism of such \n     Americans by revoking 1 year of their tax cut and investing \n     the resulting revenues in the security of our neighbors and \n     families.\n\n     SEC. 503. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) Trust fund.--The term ``Trust Fund'' means the Homeland \n     Security and Neighborhood Safety Trust Fund established under \n     section 504.\n       (2) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, \n     established under title VI of the Intelligence Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (Pub.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This chapter may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 562. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with\n\n[[Page S9537]]\n\n     Mexico. Many of the local law enforcement agencies located \n     along the border are small, rural departments charged with \n     patrolling large areas of land. Counties along the Southwest \n     United States-Mexico border are some of the poorest in the \n     country and lack the financial resources to cover the \n     additional costs associated with illegal immigration, drug \n     trafficking, and other border-related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region.\n\n     SEC. 563.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 522, S. 2464.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2464) to revise a provision relating to a \n     repayment obligation of the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation \n     under the Fort McDowell Indian Community Water Rights \n     Settlement Act of 1990, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has \nagreed to pass S. 2464, the Fort McDowell Indian Community Water Rights \nSettlement Revision Act of 2006, with an amendment that I have also \noffered. S. 2464 amends the Fort McDowell Indian Community Water Rights \nSettlement Act of 1990, which ratified a negotiated settlement of the \nFort McDowell Yavapai Nation's water entitlement to flow from the Verde \nRiver. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Kyl as an original \ncosponsor of this bill and the amendment.\n  The 1990 Settlement Act provided, among other things, for the \nSecretary of the Interior to provide the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation a \nno-interest loan pursuant to the Small Reclamation Project Act for \nconstruction of facilities for the conveyance and delivery of water to \nthe Fort McDowell reservation. However, during environmental review \nconducted prior to construction of the irrigation system, 227 of the \nacres to be irrigated were discovered to contain significant cultural \nsites. With the agreement of the tribe, the Secretary withdrew those \nacres from development, but replacement lands have proven difficult and \nexpensive to mitigate and implementation of the Act has been left \nuncompleted.\n  The current values of the no-interest loan outstanding and the \ncurrent cost of the Department of the Interior's obligation to mitigate \nreplacement acreage are nearly identical, thus the tribe and the \nDepartment have agreed to resolve this issue by mutually releasing \ntheir remaining obligations under the reclamation provisions of the \n1990 Settlement Act. S. 2464 would implement this mutually agreed upon \nresolution.\n  After approval of this measure by the Indian Affairs Committee, a \npotential ambiguity in the bill was identified, possibly calling into \nquestion the finality of the 1990 Settlement Act. The amendment offered \nstrikes the potentially ambiguous language and inserts new language to \nclarify that the agreement of the Yavapai Nation and the Department of \nthe Interior contained in S. 2464 achieves a full and final \nimplementation to the Fort McDowell Water Rights Settlement Act of \n1990.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment at \nthe desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5006) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To make a technical correction)\n\n       On page 3, strike lines 7 through 9 and insert the \n     following:\n     achieve the full and final implementation of the Fort \n     McDowell Water\n\n  The bill (S. 2464), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2464\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (B) comply with the deployment of United Nations \n     peacekeepers to Darfur as called for by the United Nations \n     Security Council;\n       (4) calls upon the United Nations--\n       (A) to deploy as quickly as practicable peacekeeping troops \n     as authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1706 (2006) that are well trained and equipped; and\n       (B) to begin considerations of sanctions as called for by \n     paragraphs 6 and 7 of United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1556 (2004) and paragraph 14 of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1564 (2004);\n       (5) urges the President to take urgent steps to help \n     improve the security situation in Darfur, including by--\n       (A) pursuing the imposition of a ``no-fly zone'' in Darfur \n     in cooperation with the United Nations, NATO, or NATO allies;\n       (B) garnering support for NATO assistance with the handover \n     by the African Union of the AMIS mission to the United \n     Nations;\n       (C) working through diplomatic channels to obtain the \n     support of China, Russia, and United States allies in the \n     Arab League in securing the compliance of the Government of \n     Sudan with the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers as \n     provided by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 \n     (2006);\n       (D) supporting full funding for the United Nations \n     Peacekeeping Mission in Sudan;\n       (E) securing the necessary support from United Nations \n     member states to schedule a special session on Sudan in the \n     United Nations Human Rights Council;
