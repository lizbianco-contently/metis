Mr. President, every morning we open the Senate by \nreciting, as we just did a few moments ago, the Pledge of Allegiance. \nHand over heart, we pay solemn tribute to the American flag, that \nsacred symbol of America's history, values, and principles.\n  We are reminded that we are but servants, momentary players in the \ngreat unfolding of the American story. The flag--transcendent, noble, \nstill--commands our humility and binds us in the common project of \nserving the body politic. It is with this understanding that, before \nCongress adjourns for the Fourth of July recess, I intend to bring the \nflag protection amendment to the floor.\n  The proposed amendment is simple. It is a one-sentence statement that \nreads: ``The Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the flag of the United States.''\n  Along with 80 percent of the American public and all 50 of our State \nlegislatures, I believe the Constitution should allow laws that protect \nour flag.\n  Unfortunately, in 1989, the Supreme Court overturned 200 years of \nprecedent and struck down all laws that prohibit flag desecration. I \nbelieve their decision was misguided. In my view, desecrating the flag \nis not speech but an act of physical assault. We know this when we see \nrioting mobs in foreign countries setting our flag on fire. We can see \nclearly that they are engaged in a specific act of physical aggression \nagainst our country and everything for which we stand. Whether inside \nor outside our borders, burning the American flag is intended to \nintimidate, not to engage in constructive speech.\n  I believe the amendment process is the appropriate remedy to the \nCourt's 1989 decision. As Harvard law professor Richard Parker \nexplains:\n\n       The amendment process is essential to the Constitution's \n     deepest foundation--the principle of popular sovereignty \n     affirmed in its first words, ``We the people.'' Making use of \n     this process reaffirms and thus preserves that foundation.\n\n  Since I first came to the Senate in 1995, I have supported a \nconstitutional amendment to protect our flag.\n  The flag is not only the physical symbol of our Nation, our pride, \nand our in history, but also of our values:\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\nfreedom, justice, independence, equality, and, ultimately, we the \npeople. Protecting the flag won't stop Americans from exercising their \nfirst amendment right to free speech.\n  Countless brave men and women have died defending the American flag. \nIt is but a small, humble act to vote to defend it.\n  In the words of our esteemed colleague, Senator Hatch:\n\n       Whatever our differences of party, race, religion, or \n     socio-economic status, the flag reminds us that we are very \n     much one people, united in a shared destiny, bonded in a \n     common faith in our Nation and the profound belief in \n     personal liberty that our Nation protects.\n\n  I look forward to bringing the flag protection amendment to the floor \nfor debate, and I am hopeful that we will be able to once and for all \ngive the American people the opportunity to defend this noble symbol of \nour shared legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1808-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1808-S1815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MAKING AVAILABLE FUNDS FOR THE LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE \n                             PROGRAM, 2006\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2320 which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2320) to make available funds included in the \n     Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 for the Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Program for fiscal year 2006, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Kyl/Ensign amendment No. 2899, to make available funds \n     included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 for allotments \n     to States for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     for fiscal year 2006.\n       Inhofe amendment No. 2898, to reduce energy prices.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour of debate equally divided between the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Snowe, and the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, or their \ndesignees.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the majority leader \nfor his considerable effort, patience, and perseverance in bringing \nthis legislation to the floor on the basis of the commitment which the \nleader made in December prior to our adjournment that we would have \nthis legislation to increase low-income fuel assistance for those \nStates that clearly need it, given the rising prices of home heating \noil and natural gas, given the fact that we are in the midst of the \nwinter, and given the fact that this has a major impact on families \nacross the country.\n  I hope we will get beyond today, beyond the cloture vote and be able \nto secure the additional funding that is so essential to so many of the \nStates and to so many individuals and families who depend upon it. It \nis absolutely critical that we provide these funds for this fiscal year \nin order to prepare for the summer and also to address the contingency \nnecessity of providing additional funding this winter.\n  I am joined in my efforts and I wish to thank my colleague, Senator \nColeman, my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Sununu, Senator Specter, and Senator Santorum, as well as \nSenator Smith and Senator Kerry. I express my deep appreciation for \ntheir support.\n  I first want to address some of the criticisms that were engendered \nlast week because I think there has been a lot of misunderstanding and \nmisinterpretation about exactly where we stand today and what the facts \nare.\n  First of all, my underlying bill shifts the funding from fiscal year \n2007 to 2006. There is an additional $1 billion for the purposes of \n``contingency'' funding, otherwise known as emergency funding for \nemergency purposes. So it is budget neutral. We are just advancing it 1 \nyear because of the unusual circumstances and because of events between \nrising oil prices and a difficult winter which have eroded the value of \nthe low-income fuel assistance. This would help to make it more \nconsistent with the authorization level because of the dire need in so \nmany States across the country, including my own.\n  It does nothing to modify how those funds are disbursed to the \nStates. The Senate decided 1 month ago when it passed the Deficit \nReduction Act that 25 percent of the $1 billion would be appropriated \nthrough a formula funding and 75 percent would go to emergency \ncontingency funding.\n  The Congress decided--including the Senate, and it became law just a \nmonth ago--that the President would continue to have the emergency \nfunding capability in order to disburse that part of the funding, 75 \npercent to those States that needed it at that moment in time because \nthere was an emergency. Emergencies are just that--emergencies.\n  What the critics are saying about my approach is they now want to \nchange it for the first time ever and take away the capability of \nhaving emergency funding under the low-income fuel assistance. It \ndoesn't make sense. Because the States are facing an emergency, they \nought to be able to have their funding. That would be taken away by the \nKyl amendment, and it would be distributed to States irrespective of \nwhether they need it, irrespective of the fact that no emergency \noccurred in their State.\n  I understand that under the low-income fuel assistance program, you \nhave part emergency and part formula. That is what it is all about.\n  All my underlying bill says is advance the funding from 2007 to 2006 \nfor $1 billion. So we are not increasing the net level of funding for \nlow-income fuel assistance. We have already agreed to it in the budget. \nIt is not increasing spending. It is budget neutral. I don't change the \nway it is distributed. I am doing just exactly what was dictated by the \nU.S. Senate, and it became law in the Deficit Reduction Act a month \nago.\n  Now we are saying let us change the entire formula, let us change the \nentire approach through the Kyl amendment by distributing all of the \nfunds through a formula and we will have no emergency funding.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that just last fall, we had four States \nthat benefited from the emergency funding as a result of the hurricane. \nAlabama received $2 million; Florida, $1.35 million; Louisiana, $12 \nmillion; Mississippi $11.75 million--exactly because it was an \nemergency. The President had the authority, had the discretion to \ndisburse those funds from the contingency funds under the low-income \nfuel assistance program. Under the Kyl amendment, the President \nwouldn't have that capability. It would be given to States that didn't \nexperience the hurricane, that didn't have an emergency. We would not \nbe able to have any emergency funding if we passed the Kyl amendment.\n  I hope the Senate will continue the way in which we have approached \nit in the past. I hope we pass the underlying bill at the very least to \nadvance that funding.\n  Emergency contingency funds exist because we cannot predict the \nweather, whether it is in the South or the Northeast or the West. We \ncan't predict. That is why we created an emergency fund under low-\nincome fuel assistance. Now, for the first time ever, we take away that \ncapability.\n  I think it is important for my colleagues to understand what is at \nstake. All of the funding under low-income fuel assistance would be \ndistributed according to a formula. There would be no separate funding \nfor emergency purposes as we provided in the gulf last fall. So four \nStates were able to benefit from the emergency distribution as a result \nof the President's action.\n\n  We need that discretionary capability because we are not weather \nforecasters. We do not know what will happen in America wherever it is \ngoing to happen. This is not a regional program. This benefits all 50 \nStates. In fact, in January 2005, in looking at the distribution, all \n50 States historically have benefited at some point from the emergency \nfunding.\n  Unfortunately, on Thursday night there was a chart distributed in the \nSenate that was misrepresentative of the facts. Even the Congressional \nResearch Service said it was misleading. The fact is, it did not \nportray the facts. It showed a distribution of the funds in January \n2005 according to the emergency funding at that moment in time. But if \nyou looked at it in February or March or April or this year, it might \nbe radically different because the emergencies might have occurred \nelsewhere. That distribution was for that moment in time because of the \nemergencies\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\nthat resulted. That is not a constant pattern of distribution. It was a \nmisleading chart. I don't blame my colleagues for voting for the \ninterests of their respective States, absolutely. But I want my \ncolleagues to realize and understand that chart was misleading. It does \nnot represent what the emergency funding is all about. We cannot \npredict an emergency. So there were emergencies back in January 2005 \nthat represented those distributions, but that is not the way it \nhappens all the time because we do not know when the emergencies are \ngoing to occur.\n  I regret that chart was distributed on the basis that it represents \nhow these funds are circulated and dispensed according to the States. \nThey are dispensed according to need and necessity. That is what the \nemergency funding is all about.\n  It is important to realize the value of the low-income fuel \nassistance program overall. In fact, it is one that many of the States \nhave come to depend on, rightfully. I was in the House of \nRepresentatives when we first created this program during an energy \ncrisis back in 1979 on the essential basis of helping to mitigate \npeople's fuel bills, particularly for the low income and those who are \ndisadvantaged who cannot possibly pay for the total cost of their oil \nbills, or in the summer for air-conditioning bills. We know it has \nprofound implications on people's budgets, their inability to meet the \nrising costs, and especially so this year with 30 to 50 percent \nincreases in their energy bills. That is in addition to the increases \nthat occurred last year that were 20 to 30 percent.\n  My constituents in the State of Maine cannot meet those rising \nprices. We are just attempting to hold them harmless with this funding, \nto hold them harmless to last year to maintain the status quo. What is \nthe status quo? It is about meeting maybe a quarter of their fuel bill \nduring the winter. Maybe. That depends on the rising price, and as we \nknow, it has been an unpredictable pattern of rising prices. It is a \nvery different thing when we have a price for a barrel of oil at $29 \ncompared to where we are today, with a fluctuation anywhere from $61 or \n$66 for a barrel of oil. That has a major impact on a family's budget. \nThe value of low-income fuel assistance today from where it was back in \nthe mid-1980s has declined to 19 percent of the real value of this \nprogram based on what we have provided under low-income fuel \nassistance.\n  Back in the 1980s it represented, in real terms, 50 percent to \nfamilies across this country. Now it has declined to more than 19 \npercent.\n  There was a survey recently conducted that illustrated this situation \nand why this program is so critical to so many families in my State and \nacross America. It illustrated this point. It is tragic. It said that \n73 percent of households would cut back and even go without other \nnecessities such as food and prescription drugs and mortgage and rent \npayments to pay for heat. We have seen that illustrated in the State of \nMaine. We have had some very dire and tragic situations where people \nhave had to be hospitalized because of hypothermia.\n  People say it is a mild winter. I invite Members to come to Maine and \ntell me about it. It has been a very cold winter.\n  But this is also about the price. In the State of Maine, the price \nhas risen 30 to 50 percent in addition to the price increases last \nyear. Yet the funding for low-income fuel assistance has maintained the \nstatus quo. So there has been an erosion of support for families who \ndepend upon this program just barely to meet, perhaps, a quarter of \ntheir overall fuel bills depending on the price.\n  That is why I have asked, along with my colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Coleman, my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and so many \nothers who have cosponsored this legislation, to advance the funding by \n1 year. It has already been provided for. It is budget neutral.\n\n  I heard one possibility of using TANF funds to pay for this. Let me \nremind my colleagues, under the law, TANF funds are to go for families \nwith children. It does not allow for the use of TANF funds for any \nother purpose. If States do so for ineligible individuals or families, \nthe State is penalized up to 5 percent. Using TANF funds cannot be \nallowed for low-income seniors, for example, who otherwise are not \neligible under the TANF law.\n  I remind my colleagues that it is important to look at the facts and \nhow the law works and what the implications are. I hope we can get \nbeyond the regionalization of this low-income fuel assistance program \nbill and look at what is in the best interest of America, irrespective \nof where the necessity lies. Whether it is in the North, East, South or \nWest, is it a need? Is it vital? Is it important? That is what this \nlegislation is all about.\n  That is why, in the wisdom of the Congress and the President, we \nestablished the contingency fund for emergency purposes so the \nPresident would have the discretionary authority to distribute those \nfunds on the basis of need at that moment in time. The other funding is \ndistributed according to a formula. I don't change any of that. I do \nnot change existing law. I do not change what this Senate and the House \npassed that became law a month ago. I do not change that.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Kyl changes all of that and places \n100 percent of the funding under the low-income fuel assistance program \non a formula basis so there is no emergency funding.\n  I hope my colleagues would vote for cloture so we can proceed. \nWhether we have amendments remains to be seen. But I am prepared to \nwork with my colleagues, those who have differences of opinion \nregarding this legislation, to work it out, work it out for their State \nand what is in the best interest of their State, our States, and for \nall of America. This should not be a North, South, East, West issue. \nThis should be an issue on the basis of what is right, what is fair, \nwhat is required, and what is needed. That is what this is all about. \nAn emergency is an emergency. That is what the emergency funding is. \nThat is what this contingency funding is.\n  I impress upon my colleagues how important it is. It would be a \ndramatic departure to accept the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona to redistribute all of the funds through a formula and have no \ncapacity whatever for the President to distribute it on an emergency \nbasis.\n  I remind my colleagues this is not just about Maine or the North, it \nis about the South and the East and the West. This shouldn't be about a \ncompass. This should be about America.\n  I hope Members will look at the facts. The facts are we distributed \nfunding under the emergency contingency fund last fall to help those \nStates in the gulf as a result of the hurricanes for four States, \nincluding Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. We gave them \n$15 or $14 million distributed by the President, rightfully, in \nresponse to an emergency.\n  Taking the emergency funding and distributing it on the basis of a \nformula means that States are going to receive funding when there is no \nemergency. How did that make sense? That was not the intent, ever. The \nintent was to maintain the separate funding for this capability. That \nis what it was all about.\n  Eleven States have totally obligated their winter heating fund for \nthis winter, including my own State: Arkansas, California, Georgia, \nIowa, Maine, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Rhode \nIsland, Utah, and many of the other States. In fact, 34 Governors have \nwritten requesting this additional assistance. They are facing a crisis \nbecause applications are up and the funding is down. Increases of at \nleast 20 percent are expected in 15 States alone.\n  The funds expended for the low-income fuel assistance is equivalent \nto the amount Congress allocated in 1983. That was 23 years ago. What \nabout the price of a barrel of oil? It is important to my State of \nMaine where 84 percent of the people qualify for low-income fuel \nassistance, and the State in general is around 80 percent; 80 percent \nfor those dependent on home heating oil. A barrel of oil in 1983 was \n$29.\n  By the way, the price should be going down as we go away from winter \nand toward the summer. But there is a dramatic change this year. The \nprice is actually going up. And the future price for oil is much higher \nin January of\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\n2007. That should raise a serious concern among all Members about the \npotential for price increases with respect to home heating oil and \nnatural gas.\n  A barrel of oil in 1983 was $29; today it is at least $61 a barrel. \nThat is a difference of $32. We are basically losing the value of low-\nincome fuel assistance because the funding has remained the same. It \nhas declined to about 19 percent of the real value of what it \nrepresented when we first created the program almost 27 years ago when \nI was serving in the House of Representatives.\n  I have offered the underlying bill to advance the funding based on \nthe recent formula. I do not change the funding. It is 75-25, 75 for \nemergency and 25 percent on formula. I am prepared to offer a 50-50 \nthat would actually allow many States to gain or stay the same if we \nwant to talk about the formula but do not do away with the emergency \nfunding. That would be the first time ever under this program, and we \nwill not have the capability and the President will not have the \nauthority or the prerogative to respond to those States that are in an \nemergency crisis, as was the case last fall with Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. That is the major departure, historically, from how we have \nobligated funds, both to formula and for emergency.\n  Mr. President, 54 percent of my colleagues have voted for an increase \nin funding for low-income fuel assistance last year, requiring 60 \nvotes. That was requiring 60 votes. We worked very hard. We got 66 \nvotes last week on proceeding to this vital issue.\n\n  So I hope my colleagues will support this cloture motion so we can \nmove beyond and get to the heart of the matter, so we can discuss the \ndifferences and the implications of the underlying bill versus the \namendments offered. I am prepared to work with my colleagues in any way \nto work it out. It is not, in my view, a matter of North versus South, \nEast versus West or whatever. It is not sectional interests we are \ntalking about.\n  What we are talking about is doing what is right for whoever needs \nthis program and depends upon it in a moment in time. That is what the \nemergency funding provides. It gives us that flexibility and that \ncapability that will be done away with by the Kyl amendment. I truly \nregret there was this chart that was distributed last week because it \ngave an erroneous picture of the accurate distribution of funding \nbecause with emergency funding you cannot have a fixed picture because \nit depends on the emergency. And unless someone around here is a \nsoothsayer, there is no way to know how that funding will be \ndistributed.\n  Yes, it was distributed at that moment in time that way. That is \nprecisely because there were emergencies. But you do not know what the \nemergency is going to be a year from now, a month from now, 6 months \nfrom now. We are coming upon the hurricane season again. God forbid if \nanything else happens. The fact is, we need to have that flexibility, \nas we did last fall. We need to have that capability similarly for our \nStates that need it, in Maine and the other cold-weather States \ncurrently.\n  If we need more funding, I am all for it. But I know there is \nresistance by many to increasing the funding, regrettably. But this has \nfallen far short of the real value of this program, as I illustrated. \nWe have not provided a real increase in the low-income fuel assistance \nprogram since it was created back in 1979 during my first term in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Those are the facts. So I urge my colleagues to vote to proceed to \nthe final consideration of this bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the efforts of the \nSenator from Maine. She has been our leader and our champion on this \nissue of funding LIHEAP. It has been a bipartisan effort, too. Senator \nJack Reed of Rhode Island, on this side of the aisle, and many others, \nhave spoken in favor of what she is attempting to do.\n  To describe it very briefly, for those who are following this debate, \nit would put $1 billion more in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram across America. We said we thought we would need $5 billion \nthis year. Then we only appropriated $2 billion. And in some parts of \nthe country the winter has been fairly mild, including the Midwest. In \nother parts it is still harsh and cold. But wherever you live, you have \nfound the cost of heating your home has gone up dramatically, between \n30 and 50 percent.\n  Now, imagine if you are on a fixed income, that you are a retired \nsingle woman, for example, a widow, and you turn to this program, as \nyou have in years past, and this year you need it more than ever. Or \nimagine you are a woman I met, a mother in the city of Rockford, with \nthree small children. She is divorced. She is working. She is trying to \nkeep this little frame house she is living in warm enough so her kids \ncan be well enough to go to school.\n  She needs a helping hand from this program. She is a minimum wage \nworker. She works as a waitress. She does not make a lot of money, but, \nGod bless her, she is trying. And this program says we will give her a \nhelping hand. The sad reality is, as the Senator from Maine told us, \nthere is not enough money in this program. So many of these people find \nthemselves without the helping hand that we have promised all across \nthe United States.\n  All the Senator from Maine and others are saying is, let's put enough \nmoney in this program to help the truly vulnerable people in America. \nThese people are our neighbors. These are fellow Americans, the parents \nand grandparents of people who made this the great country it is today.\n  You look at the situation and say, this has so many echoes and \nmemories of what happened in New Orleans. In New Orleans, when some of \nthe nicest people in this world, who happen to be caught up in a flood, \nhad nowhere to turn--and the Government was not there--the sad reality \nis that many of them suffered. We look back now, 6 months later, in \nhorror to think that great city is still struggling to get back on its \nfeet. Despite the best promises of President Bush and this \nadministration, it is not happening.\n  I wonder if that would have been the case anywhere else in America. \nWould that have happened anywhere else in America, that a city would \nhave been devastated, and 6 months later it is still not receiving the \nattention it needs because of a lack of leadership from this \nAdministration?\n  What the Senator from Maine is saying, what we are saying, is that \nfor individual families faced with the realities of life today, some of \nthese programs make all the difference in the world. And the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program is one.\n  I met with a woman in Rock Island, IL, a retired lady, a beautiful \nlady, who works down at the senior center now just doing volunteer \nwork. She counsels the seniors on how to apply for LIHEAP assistance so \nthey can pay their gas bills, which, of course, is what we use to heat \nthe majority of our homes in the Midwest.\n  So many of us believe that when we face these natural disasters and \nchallenges in America, that it is a challenge to each one of us to come \ntogether as the American family. I can understand how the Senator from \nMaine feels. People say: Oh, this is just a big New England problem. \nNow, don't worry me because I happen to live somewhere else.\n  It is an American problem, my friends. It was an American problem in \nNew Orleans. It is an American problem in New England. It is an \nAmerican problem when American families struggle for the basic \nnecessities to survive. Those who would divide us on sectional lines, \non lines of economic benefit, on lines of racial differences--those \npeople are just wrong because this country is strongest when it stands \ntogether. And we stand together when some members of the American \nfamily are in need, and they are in need today.\n\n  We need to stand behind the Senator from Maine on a bipartisan basis. \nWe need to say to this administration: Do not leave more Americans \nbehind--as happened in New Orleans. We cannot have it repeated in New \nEngland or in northern Illinois or anyplace across the United States. \nWe need to come together.\n  As I look at this bill, I think this is reasonable. It is reasonable \nfor us to\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\nstand up for our fellow Americans who need a helping hand with low-\nincome home energy assistance.\n  Let me add something as well. Wouldn't it be great if America had an \nenergy policy? Wouldn't it be terrific if we really had a plan that \nwould move us away from our dependence on foreign oil? When the Senator \nquotes oil prices, do you know what control we have over oil prices? \nNone. When the OPEC cartel and the sheiks decide production levels, and \noil prices go up, America reaches into its wallet for its credit cards \nand cash, and the money goes right on the line, and not just to them \nbut to the oil companies.\n  It is similar with natural gas. Wouldn't it be great if we had vision \nand leadership in America today that moved us toward less dependence on \nenergy from overseas? We wouldn't be caught when we stopped to fill up \nour cars, or provide energy to our homes and businesses, with \ndependence on oil cartels or fossil fuels that leave us dangling on the \nends of strings, as the producers control the dance like puppeteers?\n  That is the fact today because for too long we have let the national \nenergy debate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. For too long, we have focused this energy debate on where \ncan we drill for more oil. Can we go to a wildlife refuge in Alaska? \nThe honest answer is, all the oil in that wildlife refuge would not \nprovide the energy this country needs for more than 6 months over a 20-\nyear period. It is not an answer. It is not a solution. We control less \nthan 3 percent of the oil reserves in this world. Yet we consume 25 \npercent of the oil resources. There is no way we can drill ourselves to \na point of self-sufficiency.\n  We need leadership. We need innovative, sustainable, renewable \nsources of energy. We need better fuel-economy in our cars and trucks. \nAmerica should be moving forward as some other countries are with a new \nvision on energy. Instead, we are faced with these crippling bills to \nheat our homes, and at the gas station to fuel our vehicles.\n  Today, we need to vote to support the motion for cloture, bring the \nLIHEAP bill up, provide a helping hand to the most vulnerable \nAmericans, and then sit down and get down to business about an energy \npolicy that really works for our future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 6 minutes 52 \nseconds, and the Senator from Nevada has 30 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I just want to make a couple points, and then I will reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The Senator from Illinois mentioned Senator Reed, and I, too, would \nbe remiss if I did not mention Senator Reed from Rhode Island, who has \nworked mightily on this issue and seeking increases in low-income fuel \nassistance and, in fact, has worked on that throughout the last year \nand this year as well. So I thank him for all of his efforts in that \nregard.\n  Finally, regarding low-income fuel assistance contingency funds, \nunder the law--I would like to read it to my colleagues because I think \nit is important to understand the purpose that was underlying the \ndesign and how this program would allocate the funding in emergency \nsituations. The low-income fuel assistance contingency funds are \nreleased at the discretion of the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. I quote from the law, the law we all supported:\n\n      . . . to meet the additional home energy assistance needs of \n     one or more States arising from a natural disaster or other \n     emergency.\n\n  That is the purpose of the contingency fund that is currently in law. \nThat was supported by this Senate, by the House, and became law. It is \nwhat the White House wants. The President wants it. He wants to \ncontinue that authority and flexibility to be able to respond to \nemergencies when they arise. We have no way of predicting when they \nmight arise. Therefore, it is important to have those funds set aside \nfor exactly and precisely that purpose.\n\n  The funding distribution is not altered under the underlying \nlegislation that is pending before the Senate. It would be \nsignificantly altered by the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona because we would no longer, for the first time in the history \nof the low-income fuel assistance program, have emergency funding \ncapability, none whatsoever. So where we have provided millions of \ndollars to Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana and Florida as a \nresult of the hurricanes last fall, we would not have that capability \nin the future. We do not have any capabilities.\n  I want to reiterate the fact that the graph that was distributed last \nweek fundamentally misrepresented the allocation of funds. That was for \none snapshot in time because emergencies existed at that moment in \ntime. So if your State got that kind of money at that moment in time, \nit does not mean you get it the next time unless you had an emergency. \nThat is what it is all about. You want your State to have the benefit \nof emergency funding under this program when an emergency arises, in \nthe event it is necessary. If it is not, then you do not need that \nfunding at that moment in time.\n  We have the formula capabilities under the low-income fuel assistance \nprogram to provide and distribute the money to various States. That is \nanother part of the program. But to do away with the emergency \ncapabilities under this program, for the first time ever, is a dramatic \ndeparture from where we have been in the past, a dramatic departure \neven in the alteration of the funding formula, as represented by the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arizona. It would be a dramatic \ndeparture in all respects, and it would have implications all across \nAmerica.\n  Let me remind my colleagues. I quote:\n\n       [It is] to meet the additional home energy assistance needs \n     of one or more States arising from a natural disaster or \n     other emergency.\n\n  As I said earlier, 34 of our Nation's Governors have recognized the \ncrisis and have written to the Senate and House leadership respectively \nand said: Despite significant State contributions to emergency relief \nfunds or supplementing existing State-Federal programs, with the record \ncost of energy nationwide, the Federal fiscal year 2006 funding for \nLIHEAP reflects a net decrease from the previous year's total. Exactly, \nbecause of the rising prices. That is what it is all about. It has been \nthe status quo, as I said, for funding under LIHEAP, essentially since \nit was created, but most especially since 1983. That is a long time \nago.\n  I think we ought to do what is right. It will benefit all of our \nStates depending on the need and whether an emergency arises. Then we \nhave the formula to distribute the other funding according to the \nStates and to a formula upon which we have all agreed. And it is fair \nand equitable. What is underlying all of this is to do what is right \nfor all of America, for all of our States, and not to pit one State \nagainst another, one region against another. That is not what this is \nall about. This program is for all 50 States based on formula and based \non emergencies.\n  I hope we will not significantly alter this in a way that removes \nemergency funding capability that the President now has and what we \ncertainly need and depend on in the event that occurs in any one of our \nStates.\n  So with that, I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will please call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me say a few words about this before \nSenator Ensign comes to the floor. The first vote we will have shortly \nwill be the vote to proceed with the consideration of this legislation, \na so-called cloture vote. After that, the subject the Senator from \nMaine has primarily been addressing will be the pending business.\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\nIt is an amendment which would establish how this additional billion \ndollars would be made available to the States to meet their emergency \nneeds for either home heating or home cooling, as conditions warrant.\n  There has already been about $2 billion spent, almost all of which is \nfor the heating needs of those in the colder part of our country. Those \nof us who offered the amendment to provide a way in which the third \nbillion dollars would be distributed have had in mind some very \ndifficult circumstances in our home States over the last year or so. In \nfact, part of the problem is the fact that the money that is available \nin the fiscal year is used pretty much at the front end of the time to \ntreat the cold climate problems. By the time we get to the summer, when \nthe heavy heat requirements would authorize funding to be spent in \nStates such as Arizona and Nevada, there has been little money \navailable.\n  Last summer, in response to the heat emergency there, when air \nconditioning bills were skyrocketing and a lot of people could not \nafford to pay them, bills which are much higher per household than home \nheating bills frequently are, there was no money available. We tried to \nget a contingency amount of money to apply to the problem. We literally \nhad some people die. Yet by the time the money became available, it was \ntoo late.\n  One of the things we are trying to do with this amendment is to \npreserve some of the money pursuant to a formula so that it is not all \nsitting in a contingent fund to be spent in cold States in the \nbeginning of the year with nothing left at the end of the year.\n  Let me cite some statistics from the city of Phoenix, for example: \nArizona's LIHEAP program can only assist 4 percent of those who are \neligible; 73 percent of the homes have an elderly or disabled or child \nunder 5--this is in the city of Phoenix; these figures don't \nnecessarily apply to everywhere in the State--18 percent have an energy \nburden of over 25 percent of their income. This is what I think folks \ndon't realize. Air conditioning is a necessity when you have 115, 116, \n118-degree days. It is not optional. Especially if you are elderly or \nvery young, you have to have air conditioning. When you are paying 25 \npercent or more of your income for that air conditioning, it is a \nburden that too many people can't bear. That is why we are trying to \nget more of the funds allocated through a formula to the States that \nneed that kind of help at the end of the year and not have it all \nsitting in a contingency where it is not available, as was the case \nlast year.\n  We need to fix this problem. There is already appropriated for fiscal \nyear 2006 $2.183 billion--$2 billion pursuant to the existing formula, \nalmost all of which goes to the cold States in the Northeast and \nelsewhere, and $183 million for contingency. So to the extent that \nthere are contingency requirements, as the Senator from Maine has \nspoken to, there is funding currently available for that. What we are \ntrying to do is ensure that the next billion dollars not only provides \nfor that contingency funding and some additional contingency funding \nbut that about three-fourths of it be distributed pursuant to a formula \nwhich is much fairer to those States that have not gotten the money in \nthe past to assist their low-income folks to provide primarily for air \nconditioning. That is what the debate is all about.\n  The pending amendment is my amendment that would provide for a \nformula distribution of the next billion dollars. There is still \ncontingency money available but not as much as there would be under the \nproposal of the Senator from Maine.\n  There is probably somewhere between zero and 100 an opportunity to \ntry to work things out. It is my hope that in the time between now and \nthe time we begin debating my amendment, we will be able to do so. I am \ncertainly open to discussion about it. We need to make sure that \nwherever people are located, they are well taken care of. In the past, \nhowever, the way the money is distributed, virtually all goes to people \nin the colder States, with nothing left over for those folks who have \nto rely upon air conditioning. It is time we recognize that fact and \nmodify the formula for the additional amount of money that is going to \nbe spent if, in fact, money will be allocated, so it more accurately \nreflects the needs of the people in the hotter climates as well as \nthose who have been the recipients of most of the money that has been \nallocated so far.\n  I reserve the balance of the time for others, in particular the \nSenator from Nevada, when he arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 1 minute 18 \nseconds, and there is approximately 24 minutes reserved to the Senator \nfrom Nevada and counting.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we use an \nextra 3 minutes of the other side's time for my discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I rise to respond to my friend and colleague from \nArizona. We are in agreement on the idea that the money should go where \nit is needed. What I would disagree with is that there is nothing left \nfor those from other States, warm weather States. That is not what we \nare dealing with here.\n  Two things about LIHEAP: One, it is not just another Federal acronym; \nit is a lifeline. I held hearings on this in St. Paul, where I heard \nfrom a woman named Lori Cooper, a working professional wife, mother of \na 21-month-old baby. It is about scraping by on salary alone, and even \nwith assistance paying the heating expense, it was a real hardship. We \nhad a senior named Lucille Olson who told a story of the struggle to \nbalance the cost of high health insurance and prescription drugs with \never-rising heating bills that represent about 30 percent of her \nmonthly income.\n  We are not talking about a Federal acronym. It is a helping hand.\n  You may hear some of my colleagues contending that a warmer-than-\nusual winter has somehow lessened the need. It may be a mild winter by \nMinnesota's standards, but certainly not by Virginia's. It was about \nminus 19 in St. Paul a couple weekends ago. If it is only 25 degrees, \nmild by Minnesota's standards, you still have to put about an extra 40 \nsomething degrees in there to heat your home so seniors and working \npeople can live there with some measure of comfort.\n  We have 60 percent of all LIHEAP households in Minnesota heating \ntheir homes with natural gas. The price of natural gas has risen \nseverely. It is a severe winter by national standards. LIHEAP is \ndesigned to soften that. We have heard it firsthand.\n  I want to make clear the bill which I cosponsored would designate an \nadditional $250 million for formula funding. But due to the nature of \nthe formula governing allotments to States, this additional formula \nfunding for Minnesota would provide a negligible increase. The 25/75 \nsplit is exactly the same split the Senate approved a few months ago in \nthe Deficit Reduction Act. What we do is we change the date assistance \nis available from 2007 to 2006. Again, 25 percent of the funding goes \nto predominantly warm weather States.\n  This is about emergencies. It is about meeting the needs of \nemergencies. I have to say that we have been there. Senators from the \nnorthern States have been there when there has been flooding and \ntornadoes and hurricanes and other crises around the country. We \nhaven't divided up regions. We didn't do that with Katrina and Rita \nwhen they swept across the gulf. We didn't do it in areas of Florida \nhit hard by hurricanes. We didn't do it in western States affected by \nwildfires. We are one great Nation. We come to the aid of those in \nneed. This is about those in need. It is a severe winter where they \ncan't afford the cost of natural gas, a lifeline, a helping hand, not \nan acronym for a program.\n  The Senate has a tradition of putting aside its regional and partisan \ndivisions. When Americans face desperate situations, the Senate comes \ntogether in the name of the same Nation with the spirit of cooperation. \nI have heard the President speak eloquently about the spirit of \nAmerica, of what it is all about. That is what we are asking for today. \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita have already made natural gas prices worse. \nIn northern States such as mine,\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\nthis is about hardship. I have seen the faces of those who need this \nassistance, those who work hard to get back on their feet, to build a \nbetter life. A dramatic increase in heating costs like those \nexperienced in Minnesota this year is a cruel burden. They deserve a \nlifeline, a helping hand. Please support me in providing increased \nLIHEAP assistance designed to meet the needs of those who need it most.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I commend Senator Coleman for his \nleadership and all the efforts he has made in regard to the pending \nlegislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes 14 seconds, and the \nSenator from Maine has 57 seconds.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, my preference would have been that this \nbill not go forward simply because I believe this legislation is not \npaid for. It would be different if the proponents of this legislation \nhad truly paid for it, in other words, offset this spending. Instead of \noffsetting this spending, they take in the money from next year, bring \nit into this year and then will try next year to restore the money. If \nthey would have said: This is the priority, let's reset our priorities \nand let's cut some other type of spending to pay for this, the \nlegislation would have been a lot more acceptable.\n  That is the reason we raised the budget point of order last week \nagainst this legislation. We lost on that budget point of order. So now \nit looks as though the legislation has a chance of moving forward, and \nwe have to determine how the money is spent. Is it fair to spend it \nacross the country, or should it benefit some States at the expense of \nother States?\n  The LIHEAP program is set up with a very complex formula. It is \nassistance for those people who are low income, who need help with \ntheir heating oil or with air conditioning expenses--for those who live \nin hot States such as myself, or in Arizona, or some of the other \nsouthern States around the gulf coast.\n  The reason people are seeking this increase is because natural gas \nhas exploded in price. Obviously, heating oil has done the same. So \nthere is a need out there for assistance and we don't deny that. We \nthink there is legitimacy to meeting that need. But it is a question of \nhow do we now disburse this money fairly to the States.\n  Let me get back to the LIHEAP formula--how we determine how the money \ngoes to the various States. It was set up a long time ago when this \nprogram was first put in effect that it would benefit more of the \ncolder States. When it was set up, the first amounts of money would go \nin and mostly benefit those cold weather States; and then if there was \nmore money put into the program, it would be distributed more fairly to \nhelp States that are warmer. The proponent has put forward that three-\nquarters of the money would go to continue to help those States that \nare in the colder regions of the country, and 25 percent of the money \nwould then be distributed kind of equally across the country. That is \nnot the way the program was intended to be set up.\n  Additional moneys are supposed to be distributed fairly across the \nboard. Mr. President, 28 out of the 50 States would lose under Senator \nSnowe's bill; 22 States would benefit. Those same 22 States benefit \nunder the moneys that have already been spent this year--more than the \nother States benefit.\n  We are not going to win the cloture vote. We fully admit that. We \nlost on a budget point of order, so we know we are going to lose on a \ncloture vote. After the cloture vote, there will be at least one \namendment to change the formula so that other States are more fairly \ntreated in this program.\n  I believe this billion dollars should be more fairly distributed \nacross the country. So that is what we are going to attempt to do. We \nhope all of the Senators will look to see whether their States benefit \nmore under the amendment Senator Kyl and I are going to put forward or \nbenefit under Senator Snowe. If they look from a selfish perspective to \ntheir own States, they will vote with our amendment.\n  I think it is important when you are in the Senate to try to do what \nis best in the national perspective, but you also look to your State \nand your State's interest. When there is a pot of money out there, it \nis our responsibility to look to try to get our States' fair share of \nthat money. That is what I am going to do for Nevada, and I know the \nSenator from Arizona is going to do that for the State of Arizona.\n  While this cloture vote will go forward, that doesn't mean we won't \nhave germane amendments--which our amendment is--and that we won't have \ngermane amendments to vote on to more fairly distribute the money.\n  How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. KYL. A couple of minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, last year, we had a debate on increasing \nLIHEAP funding, but we had to pay for it last year. We paid for it by \nallowing drilling in ANWR. The ANWR provision got stripped out in the \nSenate. So the amount of money to pay for LIHEAP was no longer present. \nI would like to see drilling in ANWR. I think it is important to \ndiversify our energy supplies in America. The money would have been \nthere and people would not have had objections. I agreed to that last \nyear. This is purely deficit spending even though the proponents of the \nbill say it is not because of the phony budget games that are played \naround here. But because it is deficit spending, we are going to try to \nmake sure that the money is spent fairly across the United States. That \nis what this whole debate is going to come down to in the next day or \ntwo.\n  Mr. President, with that, I reserve the remainder of our time, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since I last spoke, I want to get a couple of \nthe specific numbers on moneys actually spent under the formula that \ncurrently exists for providing low-income energy assistance for both \nthe cold weather States and the warm weather States.\n  I have some statistics that relate to three of the States in \ncomparison with the State of Maine, for example. Nevada has about \n40,000 more people, or eligible households than Maine. Under the \ncurrent formula, it receives about $22.7 million less than Maine. In \nthe case of Arizona, with a population of about four times that of \nMaine, Arizona receives three times less money. In other words, Maine \nreceives more than three times the money of Arizona, with Arizona \nhaving more than four times the population. Georgia had to spend $10 \nmillion, up from $3 million last year, for its energy needs and for \nneedy families.\n  We are all interested in seeing that the low-income families have \nassistance. We want a formula that is fair. In the past, the formula \nhas not been fair. Growing States such as Nevada and Arizona, which \nhave far more population than some of the other States, receive far \nless money. As I said, in comparison of air conditioning bills versus \nheating bills, the air conditioning bills can be far greater--sometimes \nmore than 25 percent of the income. That is what we are talking about \nhere. We are trying to achieve fairness with the formula, not have the \nmoney all in a contingency fund which is spent early in the year on \nthe cold weather, with nothing left for the hot weather folks.\n\n  If the Senator from Oklahoma is ready, I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have been on the floor numerous times to \ntalk about priorities. We are on an unsustainable course in our \ncountry. The GAO says that. Anybody who looks at our books, our \nbudgets, and our deficits would realize that. We have before us a $1 \nbillion expenditure that I am\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\nsure we are going to do. I have done everything I can to keep us from \ndoing it. Without paying for it, we will transfer that money to our \nchildren.\n  I think it is important for the American public to know how awry we \nare in this body. I want to put forward and into the Record what the \ncosponsors of this bill did. They did, collectively, $777 million worth \nof earmarks last year. Those States of the cosponsors are going to get \n$145 million in LIHEAP money. The fact is, we spent over $770 million \non earmarks.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes reading some of them so we can see \nwhether the American people think it is a priority. Do we help people \nwho need heat with their homes or do we build the Katahdin Ironworks in \nMaine? Or do we build a new industrial park in Maine? Do we buy new \nland--the Rachel Carson land acquisition for $600,000? Do we pay for a \nnew building for the city of Brewer, an administrative building? I \ncannot find in the Constitution where that is a responsibility of the \nFederal Government. We are going to build a new Bangor waterfront park. \nWe spent $246,000 on earmarked lowbush blueberry research. Here is a \nGeorge and Barbara Bush cultural center at the University of New \nEngland, $300,000. Do we do that and charge it to our children and \ngrandchildren, or do we help people with their heat? To me, it is an \nobvious choice. But we refuse to make those hard choices here. We would \nrather spend the money and charge it to our children and grandchildren.\n  Here is a Franco-American Heritage Center renovation project in \nLewiston. And Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME, gets $100,000 for site \nplanning and renovation. Here is a purchase of land, Brainard Lakes, \nMN. Here is Midtown Greenway, Minneapolis, $1.5 million. Here is \nAugsburg College, in Minnesota, $1 million. I didn't know private \ncolleges were part of the responsibility of funding from the Federal \nGovernment. Next we have Grand Portage in Minnesota, to establish a \nheritage center, $4 million. We are going to establish a heritage \ncenter for $4 million and we cannot help people with their heating \nbills. We are going to try to do both because it is politically \nexpedient, but it is not politically expedient for our grandchildren.\n  We gave $200,000 to the Hmong American Mutual Assistance Association. \nWe gave $500,000 to the Minneapolis American Indian Center in \nMinneapolis. We sent $1 million to the Pine Technical College in \nMinnesota. We rehabilitated the Ames Lake Neighborhood, Phalen Place \nApartments, in St. Paul with $150,000 of taxpayer money. Here is the \nWillard Pond in New Hampshire, $550,000. Then we have Roseview, a \npurchase of land for $2 million. Here is the Hubbard Brook Foundation \nand the Daniel Webster College. Here is the city of Portsmouth, to \nbuild an environmentally responsible library. We are going to build a \nlibrary instead of paying for people's heating bills, and we are going \nto charge it to our children and grandchildren.\n  We spent $150,000 for site preparation for improvements to White Park \nin Concord. We are going to restore Temple Town Hall in the town of \nTemple, $225,000. That is not a Federal responsibility; it is a State \nresponsibility.\n  Yet the American people are right to ask the question: How is it that \nwe can have $775 million in earmarks from five States, and those five \nStates under this formula would get $145 million in LIHEAP?\n  I suggest that we shouldn't take it from our children and \ngrandchildren. I suggest that we ought to pay for it, and the way to \npay for it is either reduce the number of earmarks that are not \nlegitimate under the Constitution, but are very politically expedient, \nor find the money elsewhere.\n  I am not just picking on these items. This goes across this body \nthroughout. The culture of earmarks is killing our country in terms of \nhow much money we spend and who is paying for it. And who is actually \npaying for it is not us. We are shifting it to the next two \ngenerations.\n  I will show this document in the Record--it lists the earmarks by the \nfive cosponsors of this bill--and let the American public decide \nwhether they think we ought to take $1 billion from our grandkids or \ncut out some of these projects that are not necessary right now. We are \nin a time of tremendous fiscal severity, and it is time we start acting \nas grownups.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe document that lists earmarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      What Are Our Priorities--Earmarks or Low-Income Assistance?\n\n       (Estimated number and cost of earmarks in FY2006*; \n     additional LIHEAP funding based on estimate of an additional \n     $250 million allocated through the standard formula and $750 \n     million allocated through the contingency fund; contingency \n     fund allocation rates for each state are based on the average \n     distribution rate from the five previous releases from the \n     contingency fund)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     Number of        Cost of       Additional\n                              State                                  earmarks        earmarks     LIHEAP funding\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMaine...........................................................              38     $29,362,000     $16,277,940\nMinnesota.......................................................              85     127,383,000      29,089,755\nNew Hampshire...................................................              50      46,338,000       8,845,527\nOhio............................................................             171     238,005,026      39,060,740\nPennsylvania....................................................             286     336,210,500      52,561,169\n                                                                 -----------------------------------------------\n    Total.......................................................             630     777,298,526     145,835,131\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Note: The number and cost estimate of earmarks for each state likely underestimate the total number and cost of\n  earmarks.

Mr. President, I want to help those people who cannot \nhelp themselves, but I have also discovered that there is very limited \nauthorization for us in the Constitution for us to be paying the \nheating bills of people in this country. There is no such thing as \ncompassion when you are using somebody else's money to offer \ncompassion.\n  The real answer to heating bills is solving our energy crisis and \nlocal communities taking care of their local citizens with their \nassets.\n  I will not vote for cloture, although I know cloture is going to be \ninvoked, but I think this is a great time that everybody in this \ncountry ought to be questioning the process here and the utilization of \nearmarks which could have paid for the heating bill, but instead we did \nthings to help us back home, help us get reelected.\n  I remind the Members of this body, Mr. President, when they take the \noath of this body, they don't take an oath to protect their State or \nbring home the bacon. They take an oath to do what is in the best long-\nterm interest of this country, not what is in their best short-term \npolitical interest.\n  I believe, as the American people look at this--I know this recent \npolling said 69 percent of the people in this country think we ought to \neliminate earmarks, even if it hurts them. The only way we will get out \nof the financial mess we are in is start attacking the process of \nearmarks that greases the sled for spending that is out of control.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Maine yield back her 57 \nseconds?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to my \ncolleague, Senator Collins from Maine.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMaine have an additional minute and only 2 minutes be reserved on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation. I realize I need to talk very rapidly.\n  I understand that the Senator from Oklahoma listed earmarks that the \nSenator from Maine and I have jointly sponsored. I want to tell my \ncolleagues that I am very proud of those projects, and I will stand \nhere and defend every single one of them. But the fact is, that is \nirrelevant to the debate before us right now.\n  I think it is so unfortunate to see this breakdown as certain States \nin certain parts of the country oppose what is a program that is \nabsolutely essential to those of us who live in colder States.\n  I supported all of the aid for Hurricane Katrina's victims in the \ngulf region. I routinely support programs that benefit other regions of \nthe country. I think it is unfortunate and unfair and very \ndisappointing for colleagues to oppose a program simply because it \ndoesn't benefit their region as much as others.\n  This is a program that is a matter of literally life and death to \nthose of us\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\nrepresenting low-income and elderly constituents.\n  I realize my time has expired. I urge my colleagues to support the \nmotion to invoke cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will conclude by making two points. First \nof all, the question on cloture is not whether to allow the program to \ngo forward but whether it will be paid for or, in effect, the money \ntaken from next year, in which case then next year's money will have to \nbe taken from the year after that, and so forth. So it is a question of \nhow we pay for it.\n  The average temperature in July of last year in Arizona was just \nunder 100 degrees. It was about 98 degrees. It is a matter of life and \ndeath. Eighteen people died in Arizona, and there was no money \navailable in Arizona for this program. By the time we found we could \nget a contingency of $183 million, it was too late.\n  So while we would like to see the program continue, we would like to \nsee it paid for and also we would like to see the formula modified so \nthose people who suffer from the heat have as much of an opportunity to \nparticipate as those who have trouble from the cold weather. As a \nresult, assuming that cloture is invoked, what we will be urging is \nthat the next billion dollars be spent pursuant to a formula that more \nfairly divides the money among the various States, all of which have \nproblems, but they are just different kinds of problems. And we will be \nable to debate that at that time.\n  Mr. President, I yield back all of the remaining time so we can go \nahead with the vote.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 2320: a bill \n     to make available funds included in the Deficit Reduction Act \n     of 2005 for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program for \n     fiscal year 2006, and for other purposes.\n         William Frist, Lamar Alexander, Ted Stevens, Pat Roberts, \n           R.F.

Mr. President, I awakened this morning to some very, very \nsad news: the death of Dana Reeve last night at the age of 44. With her \ndeath, I lost a dear friend and our American family lost a very, very \nspecial member of our family.\n  The world will remember Dana in many ways--as a fine actress, as a \ntireless advocate for spinal cord and embryonic stem cell research, and \nas the wife who stood by her husband through incredible adversity. I \nwill remember her as a person of extraordinary grace and decency, \nalways thinking of others, passionately committed to making a \ndifference in the world.\n  Over the years, I was privileged to get to know and to work with both \nDana and Christopher Reeve. Whoever coined the phrase that ``life is \nunfair'' must have had the Reeve family in mind. But these two people \nfaced adversity with unflinching courage.\n  They taught us the most valuable of lessons. Christopher taught us \nhow to transcend suffering and to live life to its fullest and to make \nevery moment count. Dana taught us about the true meaning of love and \ncommitment and loyalty.\n  Together, Dana and Christopher Reeve expanded access to new \ntreatments and therapies for countless thousands of paralyzed \nAmericans. Through their Christopher Reeve Foundation, they were \ntireless advocates for medical research.\n  Dana Reeve was also a superb politician, and I mean that in the best \nsense of the word. She knew exactly which committees to target, which \nlevers to pull, which elected officials to cultivate and pressure and \nplead with. She also knew how to go over the heads of certain political \nleaders who got in her way, by taking her case directly to the American \npeople. That is how Dana--and Chris, too--did so much to put embryonic \nstem cell research front and center on the national agenda. That is how \nshe rallied support for spinal cord research.\n  But Dana spoke up passionately for all people living with \ndisabilities. She spoke up for Parkinson's and ALS research. She \nadvocated for more generous funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth. Of course, she wanted a cure for her husband, but she fought \nfor a cure for others as well, including all those children whom she \nand Chris met with spinal cord injuries. And, my friends, so must we. \nWe must fight\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\nalso. Dana continued full speed ahead because of her drive and \ndetermination, because of the incredible work of all the dedicated \npeople at the Christopher Reeve Foundation. And now Dana's work must \ncontinue full speed ahead because of our commitment and determination.\n  We must continue because we have an unfinished agenda. As long as \nmisguided leaders deny our best scientists access to embryonic stem \ncells, we have an unfinished agenda. As long as people with \ndisabilities are forced to live in nursing homes because Medicaid will \nnot cover home care, we have an unfinished agenda. As long as there is \nhope for a cure to spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's, ALS, and other \ndiseases, we have an unfinished agenda.\n  If we have just half of the commitment and tenacity and courage that \nDana Reeve and her husband had, then we will complete this agenda.\n  Helen Keller, who knew plenty about adversity and disability, said \nsomething that applies very much to Dana Reeve in her last months. \n``Life,'' said Helen Keller, ``is either a daring adventure, or \nnothing. To keep our faces toward change and behave like free spirits \nin the presence of fate is strength undefeatable.''\n  That is the Dana Reeve I will always remember and cherish. Even when \nher husband was gravely injured and then taken from her, even a few \nmonths after that when she was cruelly stricken with lung cancer--a \nperson who had never smoked in her entire life--she never gave up her \nfight for a better world and a better future for other people, \nespecially those struggling with disabilities.\n  Dana Reeve was an extraordinary person, a passionate advocate, a \nwonderful mother, a loyal, committed, loving wife. As I said, she has \ntaught us a lot about what commitment really means. We are grateful to \nGod for the many gifts she shared with the world. We are grateful for \nall she has done to enrich our lives and to instruct us in how to live. \nToday, we grieve her passing.\n  May she rest in peace, and may her work continue.\n  Just on behalf of the Harkin family, Ruth and I and our children send \nour condolences to Will and to all the other members of the Reeve \nfamily. May they know we are going to continue the work. Through the \nChristopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, we will find a cure for \nparalysis and spinal cord injuries. We cannot afford to give up. Dana \nReeve never gave up. We cannot afford to either.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we heard the sad news of the death of \nDana Reeve. My wife Marcelle and I got to know, first, Christopher \nReeve, who often traveled to Vermont. We met with him there, did things \nwith him there, and with members of his family; and then, subsequently \nthrough Chris, with Dana Reeve. We know they had only been married for \n3 short years when Christopher Reeve had a terrible accident which left \nhim paralyzed from the neck down.\n  Like so many of the friends of both of them, we saw how Dana kept by \nhis side. They raised their young son, she encouraging Chris at every \nstep along the way.\n  It was my privilege to see and be with the two of them many times \nthroughout that, as she helped him with his foundation, to help those \nwith spinal cord injuries. And I heard him say so many times he could \nnot have possibly done this without her steadfast help.\n  She said at one point that she learned that life does not take the \nturns you might think it would but that she would continue to stay with \nChris and help him.\n  I remember when the sad time came for the end of his life, and the \nfuneral and the eulogies and discussions that I had with her after \nthat, and her commitment to go forward to help with the foundation and \nto raise their son.\n  Then, with the stunning news just a few months ago that she had lung \ncancer, in typical fashion, she said she felt she could beat that and \nwould do--she had the best doctors--all the steps possible. Then in the \nlast few days she got more and more ill. And, of course, today we \nreceived the news she had died.\n  I think of her talking about her years at Middlebury College in \nVermont, going to Vermont with Chris--the two of them giving us so \nmuch.\n  A devoted wife and mother, a talented singer and actress, a \ndetermined and dedicated activist, Dana Reeve was the embodiment of \ngrace and courage in the face of so many staggering challenges.\n  A graduate of Vermont's Middlebury College, Dana pursued both acting \nand singing, appearing on television programs, on Broadway, and on \nother stages across the country. When she married Christopher Reeve, a \ndear friend of so many of us across this land, she could not know what \ndirection her life would take.\n  I first met Chris in the 1980s and had the good fortune of spending \ntime with him in my home State of Vermont. Over the years, Marcelle and \nI came to count Chris among our friends. I am privileged to say that \nDana became a dear friend of ours as well.\n  When tragedy struck Chris and Dana's lives in 1995, just 3 short \nyears after their marriage, Dana's love and courage became the focal \npoint of so many stories. Left a quadriplegic in a tragic equestrian \naccident, Chris repeatedly credited Dana's constant care, \ncompanionship, and love with bringing him out of shadowy sadness he \nfelt in the first months after the accident. Together they opened the \nChristopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Resource Center, designed to teach \nparalyzed people to live more independently. They also chaired the \nChristopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, which provides funds for \nresearch on paralysis.\n  When Chris died in 2004, Dana--her courage never wavering--assumed \nthe foundation's chairmanship, and she came to the Halls of Congress to \nmake the case for easing the restrictions on stem cell research. Her \nunrelenting efforts to improve the quality of life for sufferers of \nparalysis have led to the distribution of more than $8 million in grant \nfunding to support programs designed to improve the daily lives of \nparalyzed people. Despite being diagnosed with lung cancer in 2005, \nDana continued her advocacy efforts. In 2005, the American Cancer \nSociety named her Mother of the Year.\n  Both Chris and Dana instilled in so many a hope and inspiration that \ncan only come from conquering adversity. Their generous, vibrant, and \ncompassionate souls have touched an entire nation. Their young son Will \nwill no doubt look to that strength as he continues through life. Two \nyears ago, I mourned the loss of my friend, Chris Reeve. Today, I join \nso many in mourning the loss of Dana, his inspiration, and ours as \nwell.\n  It is sad when two good people like this are taken so early. I know I \nspeak for so many tens of thousands of their friends not just around \nthis country but around the world.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a remarkable \nwoman who has shown Americans what courage is all about. That woman is \nDana Reeve.\n  I knew Dana as a smiling, beautiful woman standing behind Christopher \nReeve's wheelchair, accompanying him to DC to testify in support of \nadvancing stem cell research. Since Chris's death, Dana was the face of \nthis fight on behalf of patients across the country with spinal cord \ninjury, Parkinson's, juvenile diabetes and countless other illnesses.\n  I thought that after everything Dana had gone through with Chris that \nshe would have time to smell the flowers and be in the sun. But \napparently that was not meant to be.\n  My heart goes out to Dana and Chris's son William, Dana's \nstepchildren Matthew and Alexandra, and the entire Reeve and Morosini \nfamilies during what is and has been a very difficult time.\n  Dana was the picture of steadfast loyalty and compassionate care. She \nand Chris taught us all that life is short and that we should all have \nthe courage and hope to ``go forward.''\n  Dana carried that spirit with her in her drive to push Congress to \nexpand embryonic stem cell research and to expand access to new \ntreatments and therapies for thousands of Americans with spinal cord \ninjuries.\n  Dana was an activist, actress, singer, motivational speaker and \npublished author. Dana was a founding board member of the Christopher \nReeve Foundation and succeeded her late husband as chairperson in 2004. \nShe created and led the Foundation's Quality of Life initiatives.\n\n[[Page S1817]]\n\n  She received numerous awards for her work, most notably the Shining \nExample Award from Proctor & Gamble in 1998, an American Image Award \nfrom the AAFA in 2003, and the American Cancer Society named her Mother \nof the Year in 2005.\n  Dana, the person, was a tireless advocate for people with spinal cord \ninjuries. For me personally, she and Chris will forever be the shining \nlights in the great national debate for advancing medical research.\n  It is with sadness that I stand before this body, more than 9 months \nafter the historic vote in the House to expand Federally funded \nembryonic stem cell research, and still there has been no vote in the \nSenate.\n  With each day that passes the research that could one day lead to \ncures and treatments for millions of Americans with deadly and \ndebilitating diseases is being held up.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that we have a bill, which has already \npassed the House, that may help millions of Americans but instead is \njust sitting, languishing in the Senate despite some overtures or \npromises that it would be taken up by this body.\n  It is time for the Senate to do exactly what the House did. It is \ntime for the Senate to take up and pass the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act, the Castle-DeGette bill, with no amendments and no \nalternatives. I believe we have the votes to pass this bill today and \nsend it to the President.\n  I want to take a moment to acknowledge Dana's last struggle, her \nbattle against cancer. This terrible disease is a very personal one for \nme. I have lost many loved ones to it. The elimination of death and \nsuffering due to cancer has been one of my highest priorities since \ncoming to the Senate.\n  Dana died of lung cancer and, as many of you have read in the papers, \nDana was a non-smoker. I believe she had stage one metastatic lung \ncancer. In fact, over 60 percent of new lung cancers are diagnosed in \npeople who never smoked or who managed to quit smoking even decades \nago.\n  While cigarette smoking is by far the most important risk factor for \nlung cancer, many other factors play a role.\n  Lung cancer remains the deadliest form of cancer. In 2006, it will \naccount for more than 162,000 cancer deaths, or about 29 percent of all \ncancer deaths. Since 1987, more women have died each year of lung \ncancer than from breast cancer.\n  Screening for lung cancer is years behind screening for other \ncancers, which means that when it is diagnosed, the disease is often \nalready in its late stages, which is what I suspect happened to Dana \nReeve.\n  The 5-year survival rate for all stages of lung cancer is only 15 \npercent. Compare this to the overall 5-year survival rate of 65 percent \nfor all cancers diagnosed between 1995 and 2001.\n  Clearly we can and must do better. Increased NIH research for lung \ncancer is essential and we must press for better screening tools for \nlung cancer. I plan to address both of these issues in comprehensive \ncancer legislation I plan to introduce shortly.\n  In closing, it is my sincere hope that the love Dana and Chris shared \nfor each other will reunite them wherever their journeys take them from \nhere. Dana left us far too soon--in her mid-40s--but she left us with \nher fighting spirit and the will to push forward so that one day we may \nfind treatments and cures for those living with spinal cord injuries \nand other disabling conditions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Kirby Puckett\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to note with sorrow the \npassing of one of Minnesota's greatest sports heroes, Kirby Puckett, \nwho suffered a stroke on Sunday and died yesterday at the age of 45. \nKirby Puckett was born and raised in Chicago, but he became a \nMinnesotan when he was drafted at the age of 22 by the Minnesota Twins.\n  After two seasons in the minor leagues, he played his first major \nleague game for the Twins on May 8, 1984, where he became the ninth \nplayer in baseball history to get four hits in his first game. Three \nyears later, he appeared in the first of eight consecutive All Star \ngames during which time he also won the American League's Most Valuable \nPlayer honors and Most Valuable Player in the American League \nchampionship series.\n  When his great career was cut short by blurred vision caused by \nglaucoma in 1996, he sported a lifetime major league batting average of \n.318 with 2,304 hits, 207 home runs, and 1,085 runs batted in in 1,783 \ngames. But even those extraordinary statistics comprise only part of \nKirby Puckett's greatness. He played baseball with an enthusiasm, a \ndevotion, and an excitement that was thrilling to watch. Whether at bat \nor in center field, where he was a Golden Glove outfielder, he brought \nTwins fans out of their seats with spectacular game-winning plays.\n  No Minnesota Twins fan old enough to remember our team's two world \nchampionships will ever forget Kirby Puckett. In 1987, with the Twins \ntrailing the St. Louis Cardinals three games to two, Kirby tied World \nSeries records by reaching base five times and scoring four runs to \nlead the Twins to victory in game No. 6. The next night the Twins won \ngame 7 to win their first world championship and a Minnesota team's \nfirst professional world championship in almost 30 years.\n  Four years later in another World Series game 6 with the Twins, this \ntime playing the Atlanta Braves three games to two, Kirby Puckett was \nunbelievably even more spectacular than before. His over-the-wall catch \nsaved the game-winning Braves home run and sent the game into extra \ninnings which he then won with a home run in the bottom of the 11th \ninning. The next night the Twins won another game 7 and another World \nSeries.\n  During those years, Kirby Puckett was a wonderful representative of \nthe Minnesota Twins and Major League Baseball. He hosted celebrity \nevents for local charities, made countless appearances for others, \nsigned endless autographs, all with his infectious Kirby Puckett smile. \nAndy MacPhail, now president of the Chicago Cubs, and general manager \nof the Twins during those World Series years, said yesterday:\n\n       Kirby Puckett was probably the greatest teammate I've ever \n     been around. You always felt better when you were around \n     Kirby. He just had that way about him.\n\n  The years following his retirement from baseball stardom were more \ndifficult ones with his sterling reputation tarnished by marital \ndiscord and other public incidents. When his contract as executive vice \npresident for the Twins expired at the end of 2002, Kirby Puckett \nretired from baseball and later moved to Scottsdale, AZ where he passed \naway. He is survived by his two children Catherine and Kirby, Jr. and \nhis fiance Jodi Olson, to whom I extend my deepest condolences.\n  The Kirby Puckett I will remember, as will a generation of Minnesota \nTwins fans young and old, will always be wearing a Minnesota Twins \nuniform, No. 34, leaping for flyballs, racing around the bases, making \nhis greatest plays in the most important games, and doing so with a \nzest for the game and for life that was unmistakable and unforgettable.\n\n[[Page S1818]]\n\n  Thank you, Kirby, for those treasured moments, now forever our \nmemories. Thank you, Kirby. May you rest in peace.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Dana Reeve\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, we learned of the unbelievably \ntragic passing of a remarkably courageous, strong, and dedicated woman, \nDana Reeve. Most Americans knew Dana as the wife of Christopher Reeve, \nand most Americans new Christopher as Superman and, as this \nunbelievable figure, capable of overcoming so many obstacles.\n  I think the whole Nation was shocked and touched when they learned \nthat Dana, not too long after the loss of Chris, herself was battling \nlung cancer. She was always ebullient and strong in that effort. At \ntimes, she was filled with doubt about her kids and the future, as \nanyone would be, but always unbelievably courageous. She was a \npassionate advocate after Chris passed away, and even before. She was, \nherself, an accomplished actress and singer, appearing off Broadway and \non Broadway. She was, above all, a loving mother and a stunningly \nsupportive and nurturing wife.\n  Through her very selfless effort to be part of Chris's life in \ngigantic ways, bigger than most people could describe, after his \naccident, she became an inspiration to millions of Americans. This is \nno way for anybody who was touched by that family to adequately express \nour shock and our sorrow to her immediate family--to Will, age 13, and \nher stepchildren, Matthew and Alexandra, and to her friends, who were \nwith her until the end.\n  Dana was always a crusader, but with Chris's accident, she became an \neven more tireless, passionate crusader for the particular promise of \nmedical research into stem cell treatments. After Chris's paralysis, \nshe and Chris together created the Christopher Reeve Foundation, which \nhas raised and distributed over $55 million in research grants, much of \nit aimed at speeding the development of stem cell treatments.\n  I can remember visiting Chris at his home in New York. He had this \nelaborate exercise setup, which he went through, I think, almost every \nday, or whenever possible, always keeping his muscles as alive and \ngrowing as possible under the circumstances, with the belief that he \nwas going to walk again. Dana believed in him and she believed in that \npossibility. Together with Chris she was deeply involved in the fight \nfor increases in medical research funding, and she was an active \nadvocate for the rights of the disabled.\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate had the opportunity to get to \nknow her or talk with both she and Chris in the course of that \nadvocacy. After Chris's death in 2004, Dana courageously kept up the \nbattle to advance medical research. She became the chairwoman of the \nfoundation, picking up where Chris had left off. She was responsible \nfor developing the foundation's Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis \nResource Center and for a program that has now distributed more than $8 \nmillion for projects that improved the daily lives of people with \nparalysis.\n  In October of 2004, I was particularly honored and moved to be joined \nby Dana on the campaign trail in Ohio. I cannot tell you how incredible \nit was that within 2 weeks of Chris passing away--less than 2 weeks--\nDana took the time, found the strength and courage and the sense of \npurpose somewhere, which she described to me as coming directly from \nChris himself, to come out on the trail and fight for what he had been \nfighting.\n  I will never forget the grace and the strength that she showed that \nday, and even a glow that she exuded in her love for Chris and her \npassion about the issue.\n  Let me share, if I may, a few of the words that she spoke that day \nwhich I found so moving, but I also find important for all of us to \nfocus on today. She said:\n\n       Chris struggled for 9\\1/2\\ years, but it was essential to \n     him that every day bring some kind of forward progress, \n     either personally or globally. Despite the enormous \n     challenges he faced each morning, he awoke with focused \n     determination and a remarkable zest for life. Chris was able \n     to keep going because he had the support of his loved ones, a \n     dedicated nursing staff, the belief of his fans, and members \n     of the disabled community, and because he had hope--hope that \n     one day science would restore some of his function. Chris \n     actively participated in clinical trials. He was on a strict \n     exercise regimen and was recently in a clinical trial right \n     here in Ohio to breathe on his own. Chris could breathe off \n     his ventilator for hours at a time, thanks to science, and \n     scientists taking bold steps.\n       Chris understood that all journeys begin with a single \n     step, and to take that first step one needs hope. His \n     vision of walking again, his belief that he would reach \n     this goal for himself and others in his lifetime was \n     essential to the way that he conducted his life.\n\n  Dana went on to describe that while Chris led the crusade for \nresearch, she in turn put her energy into improving the quality of life \nfor people who were living with diseases, inspired by individuals who \ncould still benefit from research. She talked about how right there in \nOhio, where we stood that day, the Christopher Reeve Paralysis \nFoundation had funded a number of items that kept people healthy and \nactive despite the challenge of living with a disability. She did all \nof this because both she and Chris imagined living in a world where \npolitics would never get in the way of hope.\n  Dana shared that vision and she worked tirelessly to help achieve it. \nToday, the whole country will again remember this couple. They will \nremember them together and their dedication to furthering stem cell \nresearch. Here in the Senate, we have an opportunity to honor their \nmemories and that work by fighting to advance stem cell research. We \ncan do it. Mindful of all the ethical considerations that we \nunderstand, there is a way to do it and to respect life. We have the \nopportunity to take the steps that Dana and Chris would have been so \nthrilled to see, worked so hard to achieve, to finally see a stem cell \nbill passed through the Senate.\n  In the end, none of their efforts, nor their lives were about policy. \nIt was about hope and it was about values. It is about honoring their \nlives now that we should set about that task. They shared an \nunquenchable belief in the genius of America when we put our minds to \nit. They drew strength from the talent and dedication of the scientists \nthey met and, in turn, they inspired them to go out and do even more. \nChris stunned doctors by regaining some sensation in over 70 percent of \nhis body and moving most of his joints, which people said he would \nnever do. He did that because of science.\n  Dana and Chris never lost faith that America and American science was \nthe greatest hope for humanity. That is a faith that all of us should \nshare for Chris and Dana and the millions of people who believe in the \npossibilities of this remarkable time and our remarkable country. A lot \nof people ask, How can we do that? The answer is simple. How can we \ncommit ourselves to anything less?\n  So to Will, Matthew, Alexandra, and Dana and Chris's friends and \nfamilies, colleagues and supporters, I say the best thing we can do to \ncomplete their journey is by doing our best in ours. If we do that, we \nwill give even greater meaning to two remarkable lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Foreign Trade and National Security\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in news reports last evening and this \nmorning there was a suggestion that some sort of deal was being reached \nin the Congress, between the Congress and the administration, on the \nissue of the Dubai\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\nPorts World Company managing six of America's large seaports. Let me \npoint out there is no deal that I am aware of, but if there is a deal, \nit is being made by people who have not consulted many of us in the \nCongress.\n  In any event, I think this proposal still lacks basic common sense. I \nwant to speak about it for a couple of minutes.\n  In the Wall Street Journal, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Mr. \nChertoff, says: ``U.S. ports takeover''--again, by the Dubai Ports \nWorld, the United Arab Emirates-owned company--the head of our Homeland \nSecurity Chertoff says: ``U.S. ports takeover would tighten grip on \nsecurity.''\n  So he actually makes the case, the head of our Homeland Security \nagency, that allowing the management or the takeover of our six major \nport facilities, seaport facilities, would strengthen America's \nsecurity. That is an unbelievable statement. I will describe why he \nsays it. He said:\n\n       Assuming the deal would go through, we intend to have a \n     deep look into their practices, certainly in the U.S. ports.\n\n  That is a direct quote. That is almost unbelievable. So they \napparently haven't had a deep look into their practices before the deal \ngoes through. This is a circumstance where most of the American \ncitizens understand what is being proposed and very strongly react to \nit in opposition.\n  This country is the subject of many terrorist threats. We understand \nthat terrorists from around the world want to strike inside this \ncountry. We have all this security in this country--some judged to be \nquite good, some very deficient. Go to an airport and see what happens \nwhen you want to board an airplane. You are going to have to go to a \nline and you are likely to have to take off your shoes and you are \nprobably going to have to take off your belt and wristwatch and then \nthey are wanding some little 6-year-old boy, spread eagle against a \nwall someplace because he set off the buzzer. So all of that happens \nbefore you get on an airplane. Why? Because airport security is very \nimportant.\n  So is seaport security. We don't have seaports in my home State, but \nwe are recipients of those containers that come on ships into our \nseaports. Somewhere between 5.7 million and 5.9 million containers a \nyear come into our seaports at 5 or 6 miles an hour to go into the dock \nwhere those containers are lifted off by that crane and trucked off all \nacross the country. All of us are recipients of what is coming into our \nseaports.\n  Seaport security, frankly, is miserable; 5.7 to 5.9 million \ncontainers come into this country and 4 to 5 percent is inspected, all \nthe rest is not inspected, and we believe somehow we are protecting our \ncountry?\n  You will recall shortly after 9/11, there was a fellow from the \nMiddle East, from Egypt I believe, who decided to put himself in a \ncontainer, get it nailed up and put on a container ship, shipping \nhimself to Canada. He had all the amenities you would need to travel in \na container: he had a cot, a GPS locator, a radio, apparently, and a \nheater. He was in a container on a ship. He was a fellow they thought \nto be a terrorist shipping himself into Canada in a container for the \npurpose of coming into the United States.\n  So seaport security is critically important. We have had vote after \nvote in the Senate to improve seaport security but the majority doesn't \nwant to spend the money to do that.\n  Now, with respect to the issue of seaport security, we are told that \na United Arab Emirates wholly owned company called Dubai Ports World \nhas been approved by something called CFIUS, one of those God-awful \nacronyms, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. \nThey have approved the takeover and management, which would include \nsecurity, by the way, of ports, six major seaports in this country, \nincluding New York and New Jersey and Baltimore and New Orleans, and so \non.\n  CFIUS, which is 16 or 18 of the agencies of the current \nadministration getting together, said they think this will be just \nfine, so they approved it. They approved it without even the 45-day \nextension you would normally have if someone expressed some concerns \nabout it.\n  Now Mr. Chertoff, the head of Homeland Security, says our security \nwill actually be better if the United Arab Emirates company takes over \nour ports. Chertoff says, ``U.S. ports takeover would tighten grip on \nsecurity.''\n  I don't know. Maybe he's not drinking the same water most Americans \nare drinking. I don't know how you come to this conclusion. Allowing a \nUnited Arab Emirates company to manage our ports is going to manage and \nimprove our security? I don't think so. That doesn't make any sense.\n  Let me describe the United Arab Emirates. I will do it in terms that \ndo not suggest this is a bad country. That is not my point, although I \nmust say that two of the hijackers who attacked this country on 9/11/\n2001 came from the United Arab Emirates, a substantial portion of the \nfinancing for those terrorist attacks came through the financial \ninstitutions of the United Arab Emirates, Dr. Kahn from Pakistan, who \nwas moving nuclear materials and nuclear knowledge and knowhow around \nthe world, did that through the UAE ports. There are serious questions \nto be asked.\n  But let me make another point; that is, the relationship of the \nUnited Arab Emirates to Osama bin Laden. The 9/11 report described a \ncircumstance in which we had discovered, in 1999, where Osama bin Laden \nwas at that time and our country was attempting to target Osama bin \nLaden. This is in early 1999. The CIA learned that Osama bin Laden \ncould be found at a camp in the Afghan desert, and the U.S. military \nbegan to plan a strike against that camp. But the strike was called off \nbecause Osama bin Laden was apparently being visited by members of the \nroyal family of the United Arab Emirates.\n  In fact, let me read to you from the 9/11 Commission report. You will \nfind this in the booklet published by the\n9/11 Commission:\n\n       No strike was launched.\n\n  This is the strike against Osama bin Laden whom our Intelligence \nCommittee said they had discovered. They knew where he was.\n\n       No strike was launched. . . . According to the CIA and \n     defense officials, policymakers were concerned about the \n     danger that a strike would kill an Emirati prince or other \n     senior officials who may be with bin Laden.\n\n  That is on page 138 of the 9/11 report, the former CIA Director \nGeorge Tenet explaining why an attack against Osama bin Laden at a \nAfghan camp was called off said:\n\n       You might have wiped out half of the royal family in the \n     United Arab Emirates in the process, which I'm sure entered \n     into everyone's calculation in all of this.\n\n  The administration says the UAE has been helpful to our country in \nthe fight against terrorism. If they have, and there is some evidence \nthey have since 9/11, then this company appreciates that. But that \nappreciation, in my judgment, should not and will not extend to \ninviting the United Arab Emirates-owned company to manage America's \nseaports. It just defies common sense.\n  The administration says: What about offending the United Arab \nEmirates by saying no? We would offend this country by saying no? What \nabout offending common sense by saying yes? Most of the American people \nunderstand. They understand if you are going to have security in this \ncountry, security includes the United States deciding to provide \nsecurity at its seaports. The United States can't manage its seaports? \nI don't understand that.\n  I was interested in a piece yesterday in the Washington Post by \nSebastian Mallaby. I don't know Sebastian Mallaby, but he is a pretty \ngood reflection of those who are pushing this issue, saying that those \nwho oppose having the United Arab Emirates company manage our seaports \nare demagogs. He said:\n\n       The demagogs are poised to strike again.\n\n  He said:\n\n       If demagogs can turn a tiny ally such as Dubai into a \n     villain, you can bet they will do that with China.\n\n  He's talking about China trade.\n\n       The Dems will next play the China card.\n\n  One of the things he points out, he says we have a trade deficit with \nChina. He doesn't seem to care much about that. But he says if we are \ngoing to get serious about dealing with the trade deficit, we need to \nget serious about balancing the Federal budget. This person must have \nmissed Economics 101. We did balance the trade deficit under the final \nyears of the Clinton administration and the deficit continued\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\nto rise. We keep hearing these folks say the reason we have a trade \ndeficit is because we have a fiscal policy budget deficit, which is not \ntrue. We actually created a surplus here before President Bush took \nover, and the trade deficit continued to rise. Now we have the highest \ntrade deficit in history and a substantial portion of that trade \ndeficit is with the Chinese.\n  It is interesting to me, all of these columnists, of course, tend to \nbe apologists for public policies that don't work. But to suggest that \nsomehow those who stand and oppose the management of American ports by \na United Arab Emirates company are demagogs is elitist and it is wrong.\n  The so-called group called CFIUS, which, by the way, almost turns \ndown nothing. They have reviewed lots and lots of proposals, and they \nhave approved them all, virtually. I think they disapproved eight of \nthem out of many proposals. But the Coast Guard had written a \nclassified memo to CFIUS--on February 27 that was disclosed publicly by \nSenator Collins, I believe, at the hearing. The report said the \nfollowing:\n\n       There are many intelligence gaps concerning the potential \n     for the UAE company's assets to support terrorist operations \n     and that precludes an overall threat assessment on the \n     potential DPW and P Ports merger.\n\n  In fact, the Coast Guard restored a large number of potential \nvulnerabilities. That is directly from the Coast Guard's memorandum.\n  One of the so-called intelligence gaps that the Coast Guard referred \nto was that no one had checked the backgrounds of the people in charge \nof the UAE company that would manage our ports. So when the Coast \nGuard's secret report was made public, the administration said the \nCoast Guard ought to say something pleasant. So the Coast Guard came \nout and issued a statement the next day saying:\n\n       Upon subsequent and further review, the Coast Guard and the \n     entire CFIUS panel believe the transaction, when taking into \n     account strong security assurances by DP World, does not \n     compromise American security.\n\n  Interesting--the Coast Guard statement doesn't say anybody had \nchecked out the backgrounds of the officials at the UAE company. That \nis what their secret memo had said represented the vulnerability. But \nthe highest ranking official in the Department of Homeland Security, \nwho was part of this group and who reviewed this port deal, said this:\n\n       The CFIUS review did not include background checks on the \n     senior managers of the company.\n\n  It is quite clear the Coast Guard, in a classified memorandum, \nexpressed concerns about the terrorist threat, about vulnerabilities as \na result of the takeover of American ports by a UAE-owned company and \nthen the Coast Guard, when the classified memo became public, was \nordered--the Coast Guard, of course, works for the President, the Coast \nGuard said something softer, but the Department of Homeland Security's \nranking official, Stewart Baker, quite clearly said:\n\n       The CFIUS review did not include background checks on the \n     senior managers.\n\n  This is a fascinating description of trying to put a patch on a hole \nthat is too big. None of this adds up very much.\n  I do want to make another point. This is about offshoring and \noutsourcing, and so on. The question is, Why would we be contracting \nwith a foreign government, essentially--through a foreign company they \nwholly own--to manage our ports? This is the new global economy, we are \ntold. If you don't get it, you are an isolationist, xenophobic stooge \nwho can't figure it out. This is all part of the global economy.\n  President Bush went to India last week. If you are asking the \nquestion: How is it that the management of American seaports should be \ndone by the United Arab Emirates company and you don't understand it, \nyou won't understand what the President said last week in India either. \nWhat the President said in India, in several speeches, was you need to \nunderstand this global economy of ours. He said things have changed. \nThis is about outsourcing of jobs.\n  I have some quotes from the President. The President says, about \nglobalization: I guess generally outsourcing--you know outsourcing is \nnot bad. People do lose jobs as a result of globalization, and it's \npainful to those who lose jobs, but the fundamental question is how \ndoes a government or society react to that? One of two ways. One is to \nsay losing jobs is painful, therefore lets throw up the protectionist \nwalls and the other is to say losing jobs is painful so let's make sure \npeople are educated so they can find or fill the jobs of the 21st \ncentury.\n  I have news for the President. Those 21st century jobs for educated \nAmericans--he was visiting them in India. He was looking at them. He's \nlooking at the engineers who are now working at jobs American engineers \nused to have. Why did those engineering jobs go to India? Because you \ncan hire an engineer in India for one-fifth the cost of an American \nengineer. So the solution is not to say let's have an American lose his \nor her job and then get better educated. How better educated than going \nto school to get a degree in engineering and then losing it to somebody \nin the country of India who is able to work for one-fifth the price?\n  So he said:\n\n       You don't retrench and pull back. You welcome competition. \n     Understand globalization provides great opportunities.\n\n  It is fascinating to me, the people who always talk about this are \npeople who will never be outsourced. The President of the United States \nis never going to be outsourced. Do you think they are going to move \nhis job to India? I don't think so--or China or Bangladesh or Sri Lanka \nor Indonesia? I don't think so.\n\n       Our first great purpose is to spread prosperity and \n     opportunity to people in our own land and to the millions of \n     people who have not known it.\n\n  How does that fit, spreading prosperity and opportunity by moving \nAmerican jobs to China and to India?\n  How does it spread prosperity and opportunity by deciding that a \nUnited Arab Emirates country will come and manage American seaports? \nHow does that spread opportunity?\n  The President says the United States will not give into \nprotectionists and lose these opportunities. So the President, very \nmuch like the columnist, Mr. Sabastian Mallaby from the Washington \nPost, all use the same language. It is code language. They all \nunderstand it. It is elitist language: protectionist, building walls, \nisolationist xenophobes.\n  We have a trade deficit of some $720 billion. Every single day, 7 \ndays a week, all year long, we actually import $2 billion more in goods \nthan we export to the rest of the world. Every single day, 7 days a \nweek, we sell $2 billion worth of our country to foreigners.\n  I am not suggesting we shouldn't trade. I believe expanded trade is \nbeneficial. But I am suggesting that we have a backbone, nerve, and a \nlittle will to stand up for our country's economic interests.\n  Can we not tell China, for example, that they can't have a trade \nrelationship with us that has a $202 billion surplus every year? Last \nyear it was a $202 billion deficit with China. Do we not have the nerve \nto say to China trade is mutually beneficial, a two-way street, that is \nthe way we insist on it, and if they are going to sell to us then they \nare going to buy from us? Don't we have that nerve and will. If not, \nwhy not?\n  The same is true with others, especially Japan. With Japan it has \nbeen a couple of decades where we have had very substantial deficits \nyear after year after year. And our country doesn't have the nerve or \nwill to do anything about it.\n  We still have folks walking around thumbing their suspenders and \npuffing on their cigars talking about globalization and how wonderful \nit is. No one ever lost a job to outsourcing--it is just American \nworkers who lose those jobs.\n  It is not just the jobs that are gone. It is the jobs left here that \nbecome priced by the China price--downward pressure on wages, downward \npressure on benefits, stripping away retirement benefits and health \ncare benefits. That is what is happening all across this country.\n  The issue I started talking about--the issue of managing an American \nport by a United Arab Emirates firm--wouldn't even have been discussed \nhere 20 years ago. It would have been laughed at. Are you kidding me? \nAre\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\nyou really serious? We will have America's ports managed by the United \nArab Emirates given the climate we face today?\n  Twenty years ago, you wouldn't be talking about a $700-plus billion \ntrade deficit. Things have changed a lot.\n  We have a President who cheerleads now for that trade strategy \ndespite the evidence--all of the evidence year after year--that this is \na bankrupt trade strategy. It is bankrupting this country. It is \nselling part of America piece by piece of every single day. All of \nthese things relate.\n  I only wanted to speak briefly--it turned out not to be so briefly--\nabout those who announced to the press or those who talked to the press \nresulting in news stories last evening that there is a deal in the \nworks; perhaps the United Arab Emirates company could buy an American \nsubsidiary and actually run the ports through a U.S. subsidiary. There \nis no deal in the works that I am aware of.\n  I have introduced legislation that would overturn this decision. In \none way or another we are going to vote on these things. I believe \nthere are other colleagues who believe the same.\n  We are going to go vote on these things no matter what kind of deal \nsomebody else comes up with. I think there needs to be a good healthy \ndose of common sense expressed on some of these issues, and that is \ncertainly lacking on trade, on national security, and on port security.\n  I hope, perhaps, we can get those before the Senate soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              lobby reform\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to again address the very \nimportant issue of lobby reform and to applaud the efforts of many, \nparticularly the bipartisan working group on which I was proud to \nserve--coming together and working hard to produce good lobby reform \npackages that will very soon be on the floor of the Senate.\n  As I have said since the beginning of this discussion spanning \nseveral weeks, in so many ways there is no more important threshold \nissue to the functioning of our democracy and the health of this \ninstitution of Congress than these important reform issues. Clearly, \nthey go to the heart and soul of our integrity and our own credibility.\n  How can we address any other major national issue, whether it is \nhealth care, prescription drugs, foreign policy, or defense unless we \nhave that core, central principle of integrity and credibility with the \npeople?\n  Unfortunately, we have lost that credibility to some significant \nextent over the past years because of some horrible situations and \nscandals that have developed.\n  It is very appropriate and very necessary that we act as an \ninstitution to address these abuses and potential abuses which we need \nto stop from happening in the future.\n  As I said, I was very proud to serve on an informal working group--\nRepublicans and Democrats coming together with this common purpose to \naddress these central questions, to bring real meaningful, strong \nreform to our institutions, to develop consensus, not to play political \npartisan games but to develop real consensus and pass important \nlegislation that could have major support on both sides of the aisle.\n  I very much enjoyed that work with leaders on this issue--Senators \nCollins, Lott, McCain, Santorum, Kyl, and Isakson--of course, all those \nRepublicans--joined by Senators Lieberman, Obama, Dodd, and Feingold, \nDemocrats, as well as myself, a Republican, coming together to address \nthis very crucial issue.\n  We are about to put this legislation on the floor of the Senate, \nhopefully, very soon, later today. I encourage all of my colleagues--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--to again come together for an \nimportant debate, to make a proposal about how to improve this \nlegislation but to support the underlying bills which include major \nsystemic reform. That is what I am going to do. That is why I joined \nthis working group from the very beginning. That is why I participated \nin the discussions and debate which led to the bills coming to the \nfloor.\n  In addition to that, I am going to do what I mentioned a little while \nago, participate in the debate on the floor and make some proposals to \nstrengthen the bill, to make it even better before we report it out \nfrom the Senate.\n  In doing that, I am going to make three specific proposals in areas \nwhich I think we need to address that are not in the underlying bill. I \nagain want to outline those three proposals very briefly.\n  The first has to do with an unfortunate scenario which has happened \nin the past of spouses and children of Members of Congress, House \nMembers, Senators, getting a paycheck off that Member's reelection \ncampaign. This has happened in the past. It is not some theoretical \nissue. In fact, family members have made substantial sums in the past \nin some instances off the campaign of the family member who is also a \nMember of Congress.\n  I talk to folks back home in Louisiana all the time. When these \ncircumstances made the newspaper a few months ago, I can tell you what \nthe universal reaction was. The universal reaction was this is abuse. \nThere was no discussion about what these family members were doing, \nweren't doing, what hours they were lobbying, weren't lobbying. The \nuniversal reaction was this was a way for the Member of Congress to \nbasically increase his family income through the political process and \nis an abuse.\n  I think the solution is really simple. I will have an amendment that \nproposes that solution. It is simply this: Ban it; to say a Member of \nCongress, the House, or the Senate can't have a spouse, can't have a \ndependent child on the campaign payroll. That is the simplest way to \naddress it. That is the most direct way to address it. That will put \nthe whole issue to rest for once and forever.\n  Certainly, the huge majority of Members should embrace this idea \nbecause it would never cross our minds, quite frankly, a huge majority \nof Members, to do this. Let us put this potential abuse and real abuse \nin the past to rest forever.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to \nsupport this floor amendment.\n  The second floor amendment addresses another very important area of \ncampaign finance that has also been in the news; that is, with regard \nto Indian tribes.\n  Again, this is not some theoretical discussion. This is not dreaming \nup a problem. This has been at the heart of the recent scandals and \ncontroversies which bring us to where we are today.\n  In my opinion, a central problem is the fact that in current law \nIndian tribes, with regard to campaign contributions to Federal \ncandidates, are treated in a whole different way than similar entities \nsuch as corporations, such as labor unions.\n  With regard to corporations and labor unions, there are very clear \nand very strict laws that apply in terms of how those entities can \nraise PAC money, campaign funds that they can turn into political \ncontributions and the overall limit that applies to a single \ncorporation--a single labor union with regard to political \ncontributions that election season. Those rules don't apply to Indian \ntribes.\n  When it comes to Indian tribes, those rules I just referenced are out \nthe window and basically no rules apply. There is no governance of how \ntribes collect and raise funds to give to political candidates. In \nfact, with so many having very lucrative casinos now, what they do is \nreal simple. They write a check out of the casino operation and fund \nthe entire political operation from which they give campaign \ncontributions. Corporations can't do that--absolutely not. Labor unions \ncan't even do that. I think the rules should be the same for Indian \ntribes.\n  Likewise, the limits on campaign contributions should be the same as \nwell. There should be an aggregate, an overall limit for what a \nspecific tribe can give to Federal candidates just as there is for \ncorporations through their PACS, just as there is for labor unions \nthrough their PACs.\n  Again, I will offer a floor amendment that is pretty darned simple \nand pretty easy to understand. It will basically\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\nsay those same rules that apply with regard to the sources of funds and \ndisclosure and aggregate limits that apply to corporations and labor \nunions, those exact same rules will apply in exactly the same way to \nIndian tribes.\n  Third and finally, I will propose on the floor another amendment \nwhich relates to Members' families and the ability in some \ncircumstances of a Member to increase his family income through \ninvolvement in lobby shops by a spouse.\n  I think it is very important in this instance to distinguish between \nwhat I consider two pretty different cases. The one case is where a \nspouse was a registered lobbyist, a professional with expertise and \nprofessional background well before the Member was ever elected to \noffice, or well before the marriage between the Member and the spouse \never occurred. In my mind, that is a very different situation than when \na spouse gets into the lobbying business after the Member is elected or \nafter the marriage occurs with a Member already being elected.\n  In the first case, that spouse was a professional with background and \nexpertise in this area well before the marriage happened or the Member \nwas elected. In the second case, the cart came way before the horse. It \nis that second case I am concerned about, and it is that second case on \nwhich I believe we should pass a blanket ban that such a person \nshouldn't get into the lobbying business even after the Member was \nelected.\n  Again, I think people back home view that sort of case pretty darned \nsimply. It is a way for direct family members to get involved in lobby \nshops, and through that route directly supplementing that Member's \nfamily income.\n  That absolutely tears at the integrity, at the credibility of our \ninstitutions, and I believe we must act to restore that credibility and \nintegrity.\n  Again, this is not some theoretical discussion. I wish it were. This \nis not some problem made up out of the blue. This is a practice that \nhas happened before, that has been in the headlines, that has been in \nthe news. So let us address it directly, boldly, and be done with it.\n  In closing, I thank all of the leaders who came together in the \nimportant working group on lobby reform that I mentioned, particularly \nSenators Collins, Lott, McCain, Santorum, Kyl, and Isakson, and \nSenators Lieberman, Obama, Dodd, and Feingold. I worked closely with \nthem. I believe the product we will bring to the Senate very soon, \nunder the leadership of the two committee chairs, Senators Collins and \nLott, is a strong, meaningful, worthwhile product.\n  I hope we all come to this important debate with additional ideas. I \nhope we add to the bill and improve it, including through the three \nfloor amendments I just outlined, and then report an even stronger and \neven better bill out of the Senate to address this crucial issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       ETHICS AND LOBBYING REFORM\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the ethics and \nlobbying reform bill we will be considering this week.\n  Over 100 years ago, at the dawn of the last century, the Industrial \nRevolution was beginning to take hold in America, creating unimaginable \nwealth and sprawling metropolises all across the country.\n  As factories multiplied and profits grew, the winnings of the new \neconomy became more and more concentrated in the hands of a few robber \nbarons, railroad tycoons, and oil magnets. In the cities, power was \nmaintained by a corrupt system of political machines and ward bosses. \nIn the State of New York, there was a young Governor who was determined \nto give government back to the people.\n  In his first year, he had already begun antagonizing the State's \npolitical machine by attacking its system of favors and corporate \ngiveaways. He signed a workers' compensation bill, and even fired the \nsuperintendent of insurance for taking money from the very industry he \nwas supposed to be regulating.\n  None of this sat too well with New York's powerful party bosses, who \nfinally plotted to get rid of the reform-minded Governor by making sure \nhe was nominated for the Vice Presidency that year.\n  What no one could have expected is that soon after the election, when \nPresident William McKinley was assassinated, the greatest fears of the \ncorrupt machine bosses and power brokers became true when that former \nGovernor became President of the United States and went on to bust \ntrusts, break up monopolies, and return the government to its people.\n  His name, of course, was Theodore Roosevelt. He was a Republican. \nThroughout his public life, he demonstrated a willingness to put party \nand politics aside in order to battle corruption and give people an \nopen, honest government that would fight for their interests and for \ntheir values.\n  I think today we face a similar crisis of corruption and a similar \ncrisis of confidence. I believe we need similar leadership from those \nin power as well.\n  The American people are tired of a Washington that is open only to \nthose with the most cash and the right connections. They are tired of a \npolitical process where the vote you cast is not as important as the \nfavors you can do. They are tired of trusting us with their tax dollars \nwhen they see them spent on frivolous pet projects and corporate \ngiveaways.\n  It is not that the games that are played in this town are new or \nsurprising to the public. People are not naive to the existence of \ncorruption. They know that over the years it has worn both a Republican \nand a Democratic face.\n  Moreover, the underlying issue of how extensively money influences \npolitics is the ``original sin'' of everyone who has ever run for \noffice, including me. In order to get elected, we need to raise vast \nsums of money by meeting and dealing with people who are \ndisproportionately wealthy. This is a problem that predates Jack \nAbramoff.\n  So I agree with those on both sides of the aisle who believe we \nshould not let half measures and partisan posturing on campaign finance \nreform derail our current efforts on ethics and lobbying, but I also \nthink this is an issue and a conversation we are going to have to have \nin the months to come--the conversation about campaign financing. That \nis not, however, the topic that is before us this week.\n  While people know that both parties are vulnerable to these problems, \nI do not think it is fair to say that the scandals we have seen most \nrecently under the current White House and Congress--both legal and \nillegal--are entirely predictable or the standard fare. They are worse \nthan most of us could have imagined.\n  Think about it. In the past several months, we have seen the head of \nthe White House procurement office arrested. We have seen some of our \nmost powerful leaders of both the House and the Senate under Federal \ninvestigation. We have seen the indictment of Jack Abramoff and his \ncronies. And, of course, last week, we saw a Member of Congress \nsentenced to 8 years in prison for bribery.\n\n  Now, there are some in the media who dismiss these scandals by \nsaying: Everybody does it. The truth is that not everybody does it. We \nshould not lump people together--those of us who have to raise funds to \nrun campaigns but do so in a legal and ethical way with those who \ninvite lobbyists into their offices to write bad legislation. Those are \nnot equivalent. And we are not being partisan by pointing that out.\n  The fact is, since our Federal Government has been controlled by one \nparty, this kind of scandal has become, unfortunately, a regular order \nof business in this town. For years now, some on the other side of the \naisle have openly bragged about stocking K Street lobbying firms with \nformer staffers to increase their power in Washington--a practice that \nshould stop today and never happen again.\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\n  But what is truly offensive to the American people about all of this \ngoes far beyond people such as Jack Abramoff. It is bigger than how \nmuch time he will spend in jail or how many Members of Congress he ends \nup turning in. It is bigger even than the K Street project and golf \njunkets to Scotland and lavish gifts for lawmakers.\n  What is truly offensive about these scandals is they do not just lead \nto morally offensive conduct on the part of politicians; they lead to \nmorally offensive legislation that hurts hard-working Americans.\n  When big oil companies are invited into the White House for secret \nenergy meetings, it is no wonder they end up with billions in tax \nbreaks while most working people struggle to fill up their gas tanks \nand heat their homes.\n  When a committee chairman negotiates a Medicare bill one day, and \nafter the bill is passed is negotiating for a job with the drug \nindustry, it is hardly a surprise that industry gets taxpayer-funded \ngiveaways in the same bill that forbids seniors from bargaining for \nbetter drug prices.\n  When the people running Washington are accountable only to the \nspecial interests that fund their campaigns, it is not shocking that \nthe American people find their tax dollars being spent with reckless \nabandon.\n  I have to point out that since the current administration took \noffice, we have seen the number of registered lobbyists in Washington \ndouble. In 2004, over $2.1 billion was spent lobbying Congress. That \namounts to over $4.8 million per Member of Congress.\n  How much do you think the American people were able to spend on their \nSenators or Representatives last year? How much money could the folks \nback home, who cannot even fill up their gas tanks, spend on lobbying? \nHow much could the seniors forced to choose between their medications \nand their groceries spend on lobbyists? Not $4.8 million--not even \nclose.\n  This is the bigger story here. The American people believe that the \nwell-connected CEOs and hired guns on K Street who have helped write \nour laws have gotten what they paid for. They got all the tax breaks \nand loopholes and access they could ever want. But outside this city, \nthe people who cannot afford the high-priced lobbyists and do not want \nto break the law are wondering: When is it our turn? When will somebody \nin Washington stand up for me?\n  We need to answer that call. Because while only some are to blame for \nthe corruption that has plagued this city, we are all responsible for \nfixing it.\n  As you know, I am from Chicago, a city that has not always had the \nmost stellar reputation when it comes to politics. But during my first \nyear in the Illinois State Senate, I helped lead the fight to pass \nIllinois' first ethics reform bill in 25 years. If we can do it in \nIllinois, we can do something like that here.\n  But we have to pass a serious bill that has to go a long way toward \ncorrecting some of the most egregious offenses of the last few years \nand preventing future offenses as well. This is not a time for window \ndressing or putting a Band-Aid on a problem to score some political \npoints. I think this is a time for real reform.\n  I commend the work the two committees that have dealt with this issue \nhave already put in under the leadership of Senator Lott and Senator \nDodd, Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins. I want to note that the \nHonest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was originally \nsponsored by those of us on this side of the aisle, has 41 cosponsors \nand, I think, established a good marker for reform. I commend my \nleader, Harry Reid, and his staff for their hard work in putting it \ntogether.\n  But real reform means making sure that Members of Congress and senior \nadministration officials are dealing with this in as thoughtful and \naggressive a fashion as is possible. Let me give you some examples of \nsome provisions that are already in, but also some provisions I would \nlike to see included.\n  Real reform means making sure that Members of Congress and senior \nadministration officials wait until they leave office before pursuing \njobs with industries they are responsible for regulating.\n  I understand that former Congressman Billy Tauzin has said he was not \nnegotiating for a job with the drug industry at the same time he was \nnegotiating the Medicare bill, but the fact is this: While he was a \nMember of Congress, he was negotiating for lobbying jobs with not one \nbut two different industries that he was responsible for regulating--\nthe drug industry and the motion picture association.\n  That is wrong. This should not happen anymore. Real reform means \nensuring that a ban on lobbying after Members of Congress leave this \noffice is real and includes behind-the-scenes coordination and \nsupervision of activities now used to skirt the ban. Real reform means \ngiving the public access to now secret conference committee meetings \nand posting all bills on the Internet at least a day before they are \nvoted on so the public can scrutinize what is in them. Real reform \nmeans passing a bill that eliminates all gifts and meals from \nlobbyists, not just the expensive ones. And real reform has to mean \nreal enforcement because no matter how many new rules we pass, it will \nmean very little unless we have a system to enforce them.\n  I commend Senators Lieberman and Collins for their efforts to create \nsuch an enforcement mechanism through an independent office of public \nintegrity. While this proposal doesn't go quite as far as my proposal \nfor an outside ethics fact-finding commission, it is still very good, \nand I am looking forward to working with them to try to get it included \nin the bill that has been marked up. But to truly earn back the \npeople's trust, to show them we are working for them and looking out \nfor their interests, we have to do more than just pass a good bill this \nweek; we are going to have to fundamentally change the way we do \nbusiness around here.\n  That means instead of meetings with lobbyists, it is time to start \nmeeting with the 45 million Americans who don't have any health care. \nInstead of finding cushy political jobs for unqualified buddies, it is \ntime to start finding good-paying jobs for hard-working Americans \ntrying to raise a family. Instead of hitting up the big firms on K \nStreet, it is time to start visiting the workers on Main Street who \nwonder how they will send their kids to college or whether their \npension is going to be around when they retire.\n  All these people have done, our constituents, to earn access and gain \ninfluence is to cast their ballot. But in this democracy, that is all \nanyone should have to do.\n  A century ago that young, reform-minded Governor of New York, who \nlater became our 26th President, gave us words about our country that \neveryone in this town would do well to listen to today. Here is what \nTeddy Roosevelt said back then:\n\n       No republic can permanently endure when its politics are \n     corrupt and base . . . we can afford to differ on the \n     currency, the tariff, and foreign policy, but we cannot \n     afford to differ on the question of honesty. There is a soul \n     in the community, a soul in the Nation, just exactly as there \n     is a soul in the individual; and exactly as the individual \n     hopelessly mars himself if he lets his conscience be dulled \n     by the constant repetition of unworthy acts, so the Nation \n     will hopelessly blunt the popular conscience if it permits \n     its public men continually to do acts which the Nation in its \n     heart of hearts knows are acts which cast discredit upon our \n     whole public life.\n\n  I have come to know the Members of this body and know that the people \nwho serve here are hard-working, thoughtful, and honorable men and \nwomen. But the fact is, the entire Congress has been marred and is \nunder a cloud. Our consciences have been dulled by the activity of the \nfew. We have to make certain we are sending a strong signal to the \nAmerican public that we are no longer going to tolerate that kind of \nactivity, that our conscience has been sharpened, and we are willing to \ntake the steps necessary to restore credibility to this August body.\n  I hope this week we in the Senate will take the first step towards \nstrengthening this Nation's soul and bringing credit back to our public \nlife.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Frist pertaining to the introduction of S. 2381 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. For the information of my colleagues, we should have a \nvote somewhere in 25 minutes or so. Depending on the outcome of that \nvote, there may be another vote, either a roll call or voice vote, \nafter which we will go back to lobbying reform. I need to talk to the \nfloor managers. I would expect we will not have more rollcall votes \nafter we finish these next two votes shortly. But I do want to talk to \nthe managers. So what I will do is ask unanimous consent which, in \nessence, will be 20 minutes of debate equally divided and then we \nshould have a rollcall vote. And then I will be talking to the managers \nabout what we will be doing after that tonight. I don't expect rollcall \nvotes after we handle these next two.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there now be 20 minutes equally divided \nbetween Senator Snowe or her designee and Senator Ensign or his \ndesignee on the pending second-degree amendment, followed by a vote in \nrelation to the amendment with no intervening action or debate; \nprovided further that immediately after that vote, the Senate proceed \nto a vote in relation to the underlying Kyl amendment, as amended, if \namended, with no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we are now engaging in a debate over an \namendment. The amendment has to do with the LIHEAP proposal that has \nbeen brought forth. This first amendment would say to Senators that \ninstead of the original proposal that Senator Snowe put forward, where \n75 percent of the money went through the contingency fund, 25 percent \ngoes through the regular formula, that now she has brought forward an \namendment that would be 50-50, 50 percent through the contingency fund, \n50 percent through the regular formula. If we defeat this amendment, \nthe underlying amendment would say 100 percent of the money goes \nthrough the regular formula.\n  Why is that important? It is important because the 50 percent versus \nthe 100 percent going to the regular formula, this is how it breaks \ndown across the country. The red-colored States--this isn't Republican \nor Democrat, this just happens to be red-colored States in this case--\nall would get more funding under the underlying amendment, the one \nwhere 100 percent of the money goes through the regular formula. The \n50-50 or the underlying bill that Senator Snowe has put forward, \nbasically the white-colored States, 21 of them, would do better under \nher formula. So it really is a question of fairness. Because the \nunderlying formula in the LIHEAP provisions, the way it is implemented, \nbenefits those 21 States right now. So the first $2 billion that is \nspent per year benefits 21 States. That is historically what has \nhappened. And what we are saying is: If you are going to put an \nadditional billion dollars to help low-income people around the \ncountry, it should benefit people from all over the country and be more \nfairly allocated. That is really what the 100 percent of the money \ngoing through the regular formula does. It makes it fairer.\n  Senator Snowe will make part of her arguments, and we had this \ndiscussion at lunch today. She will say that this is an emergency fund. \nThis contingency fund is an emergency fund to be directed toward \nemergencies. That is not the way it has worked in the past. In the \npast, it has been divvied out earlier in the year when the cold States \nneed it. And so when the warm States need it for air-conditioning in \nthe summertime--and by the way, they need that air-conditioning, and in \nmany cases it is a life-or-death situation because people can die from \nheat prostration and that is the real issue--the money is gone because \nit has been spent out of the contingency fund. That is why the only \nfair way to do it is to put it through the regular formula, divvy it \nout through the States. And then low-income people who need either \nheating or cooling assistance can receive that fairly.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment that essentially \npreserves the emergency funding that has been consistently part of the \nlow-income fuel assistance program. I am offering my amendment as a \nsecond degree to the Kyl amendment that removes the emergency funding \nthat has been part of this program for the last 5 years. So it would be \na marked departure from historical practice and, unfortunately, a 100-\npercent appropriation through a formula for low-income fuel assistance \nwould not allow the President to respond to any situation that is \nclearly an emergency.\n  Last fall, the President had the discretion, because we had an \nemergency funding under the legislation, under low-income fuel \nassistance, that, in fact, was supported by the Senate and the House \nand the President, and it became law a month ago that basically \nembraced the approach that we have here today pending before the \nSenate.\n  The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Nevada are suggesting \nthat somehow we no longer need any emergency funding, that we will \ndistribute all of those funds through a specific formula. But we cannot \npredict where or when that emergency will occur, denying the President \nthe ability to respond to an emergency. Last fall the President had the \ndiscretion, because he had this emergency funding, to provide $14 \nmillion to Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and to Florida as a result \nof the hurricane damage. The President had that capability. That will \nbe removed by the underlying amendment. It simply does not make any \nsense to say that we should have a formula in the distribution of \nemergency funding when we don't know where the emergency is going to \noccur and when. We cannot predict that. That is why the President has \nit in a contingency fund so in the event that there are such \nemergencies, we can release that funding. That is what it has always \nbeen about.\n  This is a historical departure from previous precedent, policy, and \npractice; in fact, a practice and policy that was embraced and endorsed \nby the Senate and by the House of Representatives and the President a \nmonth ago that became law in the Deficit Reduction Act.\n  I am surprised we are here today to suggest that somehow we should \nnow no longer have emergency funding, no longer have any contingency \nfunding. In fact, the Senator from Nevada says that there is no \nremaining funding for warm States. I should mention to the Senator from \nNevada that the President has set aside $101 million in fiscal year \n2006 emergency funds. This money has not been released. In fact, it is \nat the disposal of the administration to release in the event that \nthere are potential emergencies this summer, so that there is money. \nAnd certainly we can address the concerns of the Senator from Nevada if \nhe feels it is not sufficient.\n  I, for one, felt we should increase the funding for the low-income \nfuel assistance program because the real value of this program has \neroded over the last two decades. It essentially has the same value as \nit did in 1983. In 1983, it provided 50 percent of the cost of energy \nfor a family. Today it provides 19 percent. That is not accommodating \nall the demands, all the people who are on\n\n[[Page S1825]]\n\nthe list in various States across this country. Thirty-four Governors \nwrote a letter to the leadership of both the House and Senate saying \nhow they have run out of funds. Even in addition to the significant \nState contributions for this purpose, they have run out of money. And \nrightfully so, understanding the cost of energy today. Now some have \nsuggested--and they have suggested it from their positions in Arizona, \nin Nevada, in Alabama--that it has been a mild winter. But come to \nMaine and tell us about it being a mild winter. Then add to that the \n30- to 50-percent increase in the cost of home heating oil and natural \ngas, in addition to the increases this last year.\n  The amendment I am offering today preserves the emergency funding. It \nprovides for the formula funding as supported by the Senator from \nNevada which I supported. It has two tiers of funding. One allows for \nemergencies and the other allows for emergency distributions. I regret \nthat last week there was a chart distributed that misrepresented the \ndistribution of funds. That was for that snapshot in time when there \nwere emergencies so those States benefited from the release of funding \nbecause they had emergencies. But if you looked at it the next month, \nyou would have discovered that there would have been a different \ndistribution because we don't know when or where, nor can we possibly \npredict where, the emergencies will occur.\n  So the White House supports this approach, supports the emergency \nfunding. It supports the 50-50 distribution in my amendment that I am \noffering as a second degree to the Kyl amendment which essentially does \naway with the emergency funding and provides 100 percent through a \nformula. So any State that requires support from the emergency funds \nunder this program would be denied if such an emergency should arise. I \nbelieve my second degree is a positive step in providing additional \nassistance for those in need of energy assistance this year.\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services supports this amendment to \nadvance the funding, the 2007 funds to 2006, in order to provide for \nthis billion dollar increase. We are just advancing the funding. This \nis budget neutral because there is no net increase in Federal spending. \nIt is important to understand the facts. There is no net increase in \nFederal funding. We are advancing the billion dollars. We have \ncompromised. We asked for $2 billion, which is what I thought we agreed \nto before we adjourned for the Christmas recess on December 23, that we \nwould have a 50-50 percent allocation, 50 percent to emergency, 50 \npercent to formula.\n  Here we are today, now having to say: You know, we can't afford the \nbillion dollars because it increases spending, which it does not, and \nnow we decide that we don't need emergency funding for this purpose, \nand we will allocate all the funding through a formula so that the \nStates that depend upon this money in the event there is an emergency \nwill not be able to have it.\n  I hope the Senate will support my amendment to the Kyl amendment. My \namendment is fair. It is equitable. It is reasonable. This legislation \nshould not be divisive. This isn't regional legislation. It is for all \nof the country. It is to benefit any region of the country. It is \ndesigned to ensure that regardless of where you live in America, if for \nsome reason you have an emergency that affects your ability to have \naccess to natural gas, to propane, to home heating oil, to the need for \nair-conditioning, for electricity, that this emergency funding will \nhelp to mitigate the impact of those disasters. That is what this is \nall about.\n  I should add, it is very specific in the mandate in law in terms of \nhow the contingency funds are used and where do these go. I should \nquote from the law and what it means. It says: To meet the additional \nhome energy assistance needs of one or more States arising from a \nnatural disaster or other emergency. That is why it simply makes no \nsense to distribute emergency funds through a formula because how do \nyou know who is going to have an emergency? Why would you be \ndistributing money to States that don't have an emergency for that \ndistribution?\n  That wasn't the attempt of this program. I would hope that we could \ncome to an agreement on this question. At the very least, I would hope \nthat the Senate would endorse my approach, which is a second-degree \namendment that preserves the emergency funding and provides for a 50-50 \nallocation between emergency and formulas. I think that is patently \nfair to all of the States, all of the regions in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first of all, I wonder if the Senator from \nMaine would be willing to answer a question on my time. She says that \nthis is offset. We have already had this argument, and we lost it. But \nit would be curious to get an answer to a question I have. You say that \nit is not going to increase the deficit at all because a billion \ndollars is taken out of next year's funding. I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Maine would be willing to agree not to come back and try to refill \nthat money next year?\n  In other words, there is $1 billion taken out next year and she is \nsaying it is deficit neutral. Would the Senator be willing to commit to \nnot going after more money next year?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am glad to answer the Senator's question. Obviously, I \ncannot forecast the future in terms of the extent of the needs that are \nrequired by any State. But I remain unchallenged when it comes to my \nfiscal credentials in the Senate. I have been more than happy to work \nwith the Senator in terms of meeting our fiscal responsibilities on \nthis issue and on any other question that benefits every State in \nAmerica. From that standpoint, I would be more than happy to work with \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reclaiming my time. I will answer the question because I \ncan predict the future because I have seen it here enough. If you watch \nand learn from the past, you can predict the future. People will be \ngoing after this money and probably even more. These kinds of budget \ngames are played all the time.\n  I wish to make a couple of points to respond to what the Senator from \nMaine has talked about. First, there is $183 million in the contingency \nfund this year, and $100 million has been spent so far. There is $83 \nmillion left in the contingency fund. She said this is for \nemergencies--the contingency fund is for emergencies. Well, other than \npost-Katrina, every other allocation since 2004 from the contingency \nfund has gone to all 50 States. She says it is only for emergencies. So \nall 50 States must have had emergencies every year.\n  That is not what the contingency fund has been. It has gone to every \nState. Our point is that the contingency fund has not been allocated \nfairly. I mentioned the $183 million, and there is $83 million left for \nthis year's contingency fund. Has anybody noticed that it is all being \nallocated in the wintertime, so when the warmer weather States need \ntheir contingency fund, there won't be any left? That is the point.\n  She had problems with our numbers the other day. So we redid the \nnumbers. We looked at the last 5 allocations of the contingency fund. \nAs it turns out, in the last 5 allocations, 29 States do worse under \nher formula than if you adopt the underlying Kyl amendment--29 States. \nWe are going to be passing this chart out to every Senator. The 29 \nStates are the red States on the chart I have here. If you see your \nState there in red, your Senator should be voting with myself and \nSenator Kyl to more fairly allocate this money that is for LIHEAP.\n  The allocations that go out for LIHEAP are there for a very noble \npurpose. All we are asking is, if we are going to spend this money, \nlet's do it fairly. For too long, the formulas have benefitted some \nStates at the expense of others. The Senator from Maine is looking out \nfor her State. I have no problem with her doing that. It is one of the \nthings we are elected to do--to look out for the interests of our \nStates--also the country, but particularly for our home State.\n  I think the people in my State and the people in the other 28 States \nthat are unfairly treated in the way that she has her amendment drafted \ndeserve fair treatment, and we as Senators should fight for the people \nin our States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 40 seconds.\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is enough to respond.\n  The Senator from Nevada is incorrect with respect to my amendment and \nthe way in which States it would benefit. Twenty-nine States would gain \nunder my amendment. Unfortunately, the information the Senator is \nproviding is inaccurate, as was the chart distributed last week that \nfundamentally misrepresented not only how this funding was distributed, \nbut the fact is it was done on the basis of an emergency. If all 50 \nStates had the benefit of the emergency funding, it is because \nemergencies existed in those States. That is the point. It is at the \ndiscretion of the President to distribute and release that funding in \norder to enable the President to respond immediately to any natural \ndisasters or emergencies. That is what it is all about.\n  Under a formula for funding, States would receive it irrespective of \nwhether an emergency occurred in their States. So 29 States would gain \nunder my amendment. It is unfortunate that we are where we are, talking \nabout this in that fashion, because the Senator released a chart last \nweek that suggested this is the historical pattern. If it is the \nhistorical pattern, it is because there were emergencies. It wasn't \ndistributed just for the sake of distributing it that way. It was done \nbecause there were emergencies in those particular States.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine had a problem with \nthe way we did this. It was the Congressional Research Service that did \nthis. She said it was just a spot in time. So we said, OK, let's look \nat the last 5 allocations historically. How have these funds been \nallocated? She said 29 States would benefit under her formula. That is \ncorrect, 29 States would benefit under her amendment compared to her \nunderlying bill. But 29 States would benefit more with the Kyl \namendment than with the Snowe amendment. That is according to data from \nthe Congressional Research Service. That is what we have to go from. \nThat is our expert source we turn to for unbiased information. The \nchart I have is accurate if the people at the Congressional Research \nService have done their jobs right. I have no way of knowing, other \nthan they provide pretty good information to all Senators in a \nnonpartisan way. To say they are inaccurate--I don't believe that is an \naccurate statement; I will leave it at that.\n  To sum this up and close this argument, it is about fairness. The \nunderlying LIHEAP program was set up a long time ago, and it was set up \nto be biased toward many of the northern States, especially in the \nNortheast. The LIHEAP formula is drafted so that when we start adding \nmoney in, then it is going to be distributed more fairly to all States \nfor heating and cooling. This is an additional billion dollars. Those \nother 29 States that are not treated as fairly in the original program \nneed to be treated more fairly.\n  Whether you are Republican or Democrat, you should look at our charts \nto find out how your State is treated under the Snowe amendment versus \nthe Kyl amendment. Senators from the 29 States should, I believe, vote \nagainst the Snowe amendment, and then support the Kyl amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2913.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, I understand that we are now prepared to \nagree to the Kyl first-degree amendment without a rollcall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nagreed to as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2899), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. May I have just 30 seconds to thank all of those who \nparticipated in this debate, including the Senator from Maine and the \nSenator from Nevada. I think this 50-50 compromise that has been \nadopted will allow the various States to try to find a way to take care \nof the folks in their States who need this assistance. I appreciate the \nefforts of all involved to get it done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2898\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I now make a point of order that the Inhofe \namendment, No. 2898, is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained and the \namendment falls.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of greater \nfunding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP.\n  As I have traveled around Illinois this winter, I have heard from \nmany low-income families and senior citizens about the burden of rising \nheating costs. These families are being forced to spend considerable \nportions of their incomes on gas bills, and many of them simply cannot \nafford it. Some families are having to keep their thermostats low just \nso they can buy groceries. It is essential that States have the funding \nthey need through LIHEAP to help these families pay their heating bills \nduring the cold months.\n  That is why, last year, I joined a number of my Senate colleagues in \nsending a letter to the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nrequesting $3 billion in funding so that low-income families, disabled \nindividuals, and senior citizens who live on fixed incomes have access \nto affordable energy when they need it most. We also asked that advance \nfunding be allocated in the budget for LIHEAP. This would allow States \nto plan more economically in preparing for the winter heating season by \npurchasing fuels during the spring and summer months. Unfortunately, \nour request was denied.\n  Months later, during consideration of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \nCongress reauthorized the LIHEAP program from fiscal year 2005 to 2007, \nproviding for a yearly appropriation of $5.1 billion. However, in the \nfiscal year 2006 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations Act, Congress provided $2.2 billion for LIHEAP funding--\nthe same allotment\n\n[[Page S1827]]\n\ngiven to the program in fiscal year 2005. During Senate consideration \nof several bills in the final weeks of 2005, I voted for a number of \namendments providing more funding for LIHEAP, but those amendments were \ndefeated.\n  Funding for LIHEAP has remained level for the past 20 years, but \nenergy prices are at an all-time high. According to the Department of \nEnergy, DOE, natural gas prices in the Midwest were expected to rise \nbetween 69 percent and 77 percent during the winter heating season. The \nNational Energy Assistance Directors Association estimates that for \nfamilies using natural gas, heating bills would average well over \n$1,500 per consumer, an increase of over $600 per consumer as compared \nto the winter of 2004-2005. As a result, we have seen an unprecedented \nrise in requests for LIHEAP assistance across the country. In Illinois, \nrequests in 2005 were up 41.4 percent from the year before. That is \nnearly a quarter of a million Americans asking for help in my State \nalone.\n  I think we often forget how much our working families need this \nprogram, and just how heavy the burden of heating one's home can be \nthese days. In a thank-you note to the staff at Illinois LIHEAP, a \nwoman in Lake County, IL, wrote:\n\n       Having you help me and my mother this year with our utility \n     bill was a godsend. It was over my head and I didn't know \n     what I was going to do . . . My mother is on oxygen 24-hours \n     a day, and we couldn't be without electricity, so you see it \n     was a matter of life and death also for me.\n\n  I commend Senator Snowe for her tenacity in pushing this legislation, \nand I commend Senator Jack Reed for his longstanding commitment to this \nissue.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance of this problem \nand support this measure, as well as greater LIHEAP funding in the \nfuture. With natural gas prices increasing so severely, more Americans \nthan usual are expected to apply for LIHEAP assistance in paying their \nheating bills.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I rise to address the rising costs \nfaced by Americans as they try to heat their homes this winter. \nObtaining affordable heating assistance each winter, and cooling \nassistance during the summer months, is critical to hundreds of \nthousands of Pennsylvanians and millions of Americans. Unfortunately, \nprojections from the Energy Information Administration this January \nshow that on average, consumers will spend nearly 35 percent more for \nnatural gas this winter than they did last winter.\n  The primary Federal heating assistance program is the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program. I represent a Commonwealth that depends \nheavily on this program. My State also has a high percentage of elderly \ncitizens; they are especially vulnerable to cold winter temperatures. \nOverall, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare reports that it \ndistributed LIHEAP funds to approximately 462,000 households during the \n2004-2005 winter, with 128,000 of these recipients being elderly.\n  While I am pleased that my Commonwealth ranks second in the Nation in \nthe total Federal LIHEAP assistance distributed, more has to be done to \nhelp Pennsylvanians in need. At current funding levels, only 15-percent \nof LIHEAP-eligible households are served in my home State.\n  As a member of the Special Committee on Aging, I am pleased that \nChairman Smith has recognized the importance of this program for many \nlow-income senior citizens. This past June, my colleague from Oregon \nconvened a hearing to examine the effect of energy prices on the \nelderly. However, much has changed across the national energy landscape \nsince that hearing. The tragedies of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita put \nsevere pressure on our energy industries, increasing costs of oil and \nnatural gas. Now that the winter has arrived, the increasing cost of \nhome heating fuel weighs heavily on the minds of the elderly and low-\nincome individuals, and it is time for the Senate to further address \nthis vital issue.\n  In the beginning of January, I chaired a field hearing for the \nSpecial Committee on Aging near my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA, to \nrevisit this critical issue and hear from a variety of witnesses about \nways in which the Government and private sector are helping the elderly \nand others stay warm. Representatives from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, Department of Energy, Pennsylvania State Department of \nPublic Welfare, and private sector organizations and utilities \ntestified in support of LIHEAP.\n  The testimony of Pennsylvania State secretary of public welfare \nEstelle Richman was especially troubling. Secretary Richman testified \nthat, by December 30, 2005, her agency had received over 320,000 LIHEAP \napplications. This is a 5 percent increase over 2005, which means that \nover 17,000 additional Pennsylvania households have requested heating \nassistance already this winter. Furthermore, the Pennsylvania \nDepartment of Public Welfare has already seen a 15-percent increase in \ncrisis home heating assistance applications.\n  Pennsylvania is not alone in facing such difficulties. According to \nAssistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, \nWade Horn, his agency assists nearly 5 million households each year. \nHowever, those who are eligible for these benefits far outnumber those \nwho receive this assistance.\n  As a Senate, we need to address this growing national problem. Each \nwinter, our Government is faced with distributing emergency LIHEAP \nfunds, while millions of Americans are stuck out in the cold. This past \nyear, we tried, in a bipartisan fashion, to appropriate additional \nfunding for LIHEAP. Unfortunately, we were not able to garner enough \nsupport for those provisions to pass.\n  This year we find ourselves in a worse situation than we did last \nyear. When I travel throughout Pennsylvania, I continually hear from my \nconstituents their concerns about rising energy costs and what we, the \nCongress, are doing to help. Now we have our chance to provide \nadditional assistance that will benefit millions of Americans in the \nshort term. However, while we need to pass this additional LIHEAP \nfunding, we also need to look toward long-term solutions for our \nNation's energy needs.\n  As we are all aware, there is no one solution to our Nation's energy \nproblems. However, by increasing our domestic supplies and production \ncapacity, we can take steps towards lowering the cost of energy for all \nAmericans. We also need to promote alternative energy solutions that \nutilize state-of-the-art technological advancements like coal-to-liquid \nfuel advancements. Without this combination of current and new \ntechnologies, the costs faced by consumers at the pump and in their \nhome heating bills will only continue to increase.\n  While this is clearly a long-term problem that we, as a body, need to \naddress, I am proud to support my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, \nin her effort to provide additional LIHEAP funding this winter. This \nmeasure will assist thousands of Pennsylvanians and millions across the \ncountry. For this, as well as the reasons I have cited, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure that assists countless senior \ncitizens and low-income Americans.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Today's Senate action adding $1 billion for the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program for this winter is a step in the \nright direction. It is the best we can do, and it deserved to pass. But \nno one should be under the illusion that we have now provided adequate \nassistance to millions of struggling families around the country, many \nof whom are elderly and disabled. The additional $1 billion is less \nthan half what is needed to fully fund LIHEAP and guarantee the \nassistance these families need and deserve. A small step is better than \nno step, but it is still far from meeting the obvious need.\n  Countless citizens in communities throughout America live year-round \nin constant fear of power shutoffs because they can't pay their energy \nbills, and they have no confidence that either Congress or the \nPresident is on their side.\n  According to a report by the National Energy Assistance Directors' \nAssociation, since the winter of 2001-2002, the average yearly cost of \nheating oil has soared from $627 to $1474, natural gas from $465 to \n$1000, and propane from $736 to $1286. Yet the Republican Congress and \nthe Bush administration continue to ignore the fact that millions of \nAmericans can't afford these steep increases.\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\n  Democrats have pressed for months to fund LIHEAP at the authorized \nlevel of $5.1 billion for the current fiscal year. We have urged \nCongress to act, but the Republican majority has blocked our efforts at \nevery turn, and they continued to try to block our efforts to obtain an \nadditional $1 billion for the program today. Families are paying a \nsteep price for this neglect. The average LIHEAP grant has decreased by \nalmost 10 percent since 2002 and is now only $288.\n  In Massachusetts, the State government has provided $20 million in \nadditional funds for LIHEAP this year.\n  Low-income families are more fortunate in our State than in most \nother States on this issue, but we have exhausted all Federal funds, \nand need is still great. Even the poorest households with the highest \nbills will get no more than $840--less than half what is needed to get \nthrough the winter.\n  As Self Help, a community action program in Avon, MA, ``Many of our \nclients have exhausted their benefits . . . The bottom line is that we \nneed some kind of relief, as quickly as possible.''\n  ABCD, a community action agency in Boston, reports that as of January \n17, the number of applicants applying for fuel assistance for the first \ntime increased by 26 percent. Its clients are currently exhausting all \nof their fuel assistance benefits. Even a benefit of $765 buys only one \ntank of oil at today's price of $2.40 per gallon, when at least two or \nthree tankfuls are needed to get through the winter, and no other \nsource of funding is available.\n  These aren't just numbers. They represent real people facing real \nhardships.\n  For example, an elderly couple lives in a modest home on the \noutskirts of Haverhill and both receive Social Security benefits. Their \nhome is heated with oil, and they use an old woodstove in the basement \nto supplement their steam boiler. Their $525 LIHEAP grant covered one \ndelivery of 256 gallons of oil in late November. Attempting to cut wood \nfor the woodstove, the husband fell from a ladder and was injured. If \nLIHEAP had been funded fairly, his injury could have been prevented. \nWith this bill, the chances are 50-50 that his injury could have been \nprevented. We could have done better, and we should have done better. \nIt is wrong to let people like this suffer.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join Senator Snowe and others in \nsupporting this legislation to provide additional funding for the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP.\n  This legislation will shift the $1 billion in fiscal year 2007 \nfunding, which we recently enacted in the budget reconciliation bill, \nto the current fiscal year, so it can be used this winter. Providing \nthese needed funds in this way is not the best approach to get this \ndone, but with Vermonters facing record heating bills and no other \nchoices available to us at this crucial juncture, we cannot allow the \nperfect to be the enemy of the good. The fact is the burden of record \nheating prices this winter could financially wipe out many families and \nelderly Vermonters. No family in our Nation should be forced to choose \nbetween heating their home and putting food on the table for their \nchildren. No older American should have to decide between buying life-\nsaving prescriptions or paying utility bills. Unfortunately, these \nstark choices are a reality for too many Vermonters and for too many \nother Americans across the Nation.\n  This legislation will bring the total funding available for LIHEAP in \nfiscal year 2006 up to nearly $3 billion. Certainly more is needed. \nThat is why I have voted four times to increase LIHEAP funding to $5.1 \nbillion. Bipartisan amendments offered to the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill, the Transportation, Treasury, and HUD \nAppropriations bill, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations bill, and the tax reconciliation bill received \na majority of the Senate's support. Unfortunately, the majority party \nwould not allow these amendments the opportunity for straight up-or-\ndown votes, and we were blocked from securing these needed supplements \nfor LIHEAP in our earlier efforts.\n  The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households heating with \nnatural gas will experience an average increase of 35 percent over last \nwinter. Households heating with oil will see an increase of 23 percent, \nand households using propane can expect an increase of 17 percent. \nCompounding these difficulties for families needing this help, wages \nare not keeping pace with inflation. The Real Earnings report by the \nBureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly earnings of \nproduction and nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls were \nlower in December 2005 than they were a year ago, after accounting for \ninflation. Working families are continuing to lose ground, meaning more \nfamilies also need LIHEAP assistance this year. Paychecks are being \nstretched thinner as families face higher prices for home heating, for \nhealth care, and for education. Vermont families and seniors need this \nrelief from high energy costs, and they need it now.\n  As I have said, this is not my preferred approach to providing LIHEAP \nfunding, but Vermonters cannot wait for a better option. This help is \nneeded now. I call on the leadership in the House of Representatives \nand on President Bush to support this legislation and to ensure its \nimmediate enactment. I also urge the administration to join the \nbipartisan majority in Congress to replenish LIHEAP funding for next \nwinter.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, recent press reports reveal that despite \nits creation more than a year ago, the Privacy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Board has yet to hire any staff members or even hold a single \nmeeting. This board was established by a law signed in December 2004 in \nresponse to recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. Now, several \nmonths into 2006, we learn from a Newsweek article that the board's \nmembers will finally be sworn in at the White House this month. I will \nask unanimous consent that a copy of this article be printed in the \nRecord. Starting up the work of this important board, particularly in \nthis time of unprecedented intrusion into the privacy of Americans by \nthe executive branch, is shamefully overdue.\n  On December 14, 2004, the President signed into law the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Section 1061 of this act \nimplemented a 9/11 Commission recommendation to establish an \nindependent board within the Executive Office of the President to fill \na clear void in Government for protecting Americans' liberties.\n  Creating the board was no easy feat. The Bush-Cheney administration \ninitially resisted the 9/11 Commission's recommendation for a privacy \nboard, unpersuasively asserting that it was already protecting privacy \nand civil liberties. The administration then tried to circumvent a \ncongressionally authorized, independent board by issuing an Executive \norder establishing an anemic alternative. That entity was not \nindependent, had no authority to access information, had little \naccountability, and was comprised solely of administration officials \nfrom the law enforcement and intelligence communities--the very \ncommunities in need of oversight. It was the proverbial case of the fox \nguarding the henhouse. But many of us in Congress were committed to \ncreating an effective board in keeping with the 9/11 Commission's \nrecommendations.\n  We succeeded, and the President signed the bill creating the board \nwell over a year ago, but the White House's delays and resistance \ncontinued. Last May 11, I joined Senators Durbin, Collins, and \nLieberman in writing to the President to inquire why there had not yet \nbeen any nominations and to urge him to nominate board members as soon \nas possible. We also expressed concern about the inadequate funding in \nthe White House budget proposal, which would only have provided an \nunderwhelming and insufficient $750,000 for its operations. \nFortunately, the Transportation, Treasury, and HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee, on which I serve, raised the amount to $1.5 million to \nensure a better start for the board.\n   President Bush waited until June of last year to appoint three \nmembers of the board, and to nominate the chairman and vice chairman of \nthe board, who were confirmed by the Senate last month. No board \nmembers have yet been sworn in. Meanwhile, as Newsweek reported, the \nWhite House's new budget, released last month, listed no money for the \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. Administration officials \nhave said that this omission came only because they decided not to \nitemize funding for offices within the White House, but they could not \nexplain why other White House offices were individually listed, yet \nthis board was not.\n  Regrettably, the delays and insufficient funds suggest that the Bush-\nCheney administration is simply going through the motions, rather than \nfollowing through on a meaningful commitment to the Privacy Board. As \nthe Chairman of the 9/11 Commission said, ``The Administration was \nnever interested in this.''\n  This board is too important for us to simply go through the motions. \nPrior to the board, there was no office within the Government to \noversee the collective impact of Government actions and powers on our \nliberties. This is a critical blind spot. We have increased and \nconsolidated the authority of an already-powerful Government in an \neffort to address the realities of terrorism and modern warfare. As Lee \nHamilton, Vice Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, noted in a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing on August 19, 2004, these developments represent ``an \nastounding intrusion in the lives of ordinary Americans that is routine \ntoday in government.''\n  In the months since Mr. Hamilton made this statement, we have learned \nof reports of far more disturbing and unprecedented intrusions into the \nlives of Americans, including warrantless wiretapping in violation of \nthe laws of the land, as well as surveillance of ordinary Americans \nthat may include a group of Quakers in Vermont. It is more important \nthan ever to have a meaningful entity ensuring that the Government \npursue crucial antiterrorism efforts without giving up the privacy and \ncivil liberties so important to all Americans.\n  The delays in setting up the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \nBoard and the failures to properly fund it show that the Bush-Cheney \nadministration does not take this responsibility seriously. We must \nmake sure that we do take it seriously, on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Newsweek \narticle to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Newsweek, March 13, 2006 issue]\n\n       Watchdog: What Ever Happened to the Civil Liberties Board?\n\n                          (By Michael Isikoff)\n\n       For more than a year, the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n     Oversight Board has been the most invisible office in the \n     White House. Created by Congress in December 2004 as a result \n     of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, the board has \n     never hired a staff or even held a meeting. Next week, \n     NEWSWEEK has learned, that is due to finally change when the \n     board's five members are slated to be sworn in at the White \n     House and convene their first session. Board members tell \n     NEWSWEEK the panel intends to immediately tackle contentious \n     issues like the president's domestic wiretapping program, the \n     Patriot Act and Pentagon data mining. But critics are furious \n     the process has taken this long--and question whether the \n     White House intends to treat the panel as anything more than \n     window dressing. The delay is ``outrageous, considering how \n     long its been since the bill [creating the board] was \n     passed,'' said Thomas Kean, who chaired the 9/11 Commission. \n     ``The administration was never interested in this.''\n       Renewed concerns about the White House's commitment came \n     just a few weeks ago when President Bush's new budget was \n     released--with no listing for money for the civil liberties \n     board. Alex Conant, a spokesman for the Office of Management \n     and Budget, denied to NEWSWEEK the White House was trying to \n     kill the panel by starving it of funds. ``It will be fully \n     funded,'' he said, explaining that the board wasn't in the \n     budget this year because officials decided not to itemize \n     funding levels for particular offices within the White House. \n     When a reporter pointed out that funding for other White \n     House offices such as the National Security Council were \n     listed in the budget, Conant said: ``I have no explanation.''\n       The funding snafu is only the latest setback. Kean said the \n     9/11 Commission had pushed hard for the board to ensure that \n     some agency within the government would specifically review \n     potential abuses at a time vastly expanded powers were being \n     given to U.S. intel and law-enforcement agencies. But the \n     White House, and congressional leaders, resisted and sharply \n     restricted its scope, denying the board basic tools like \n     subpoena power. Bush didn't nominate members of the board \n     until June 2005--six months after the panel was created--and \n     they weren't confirmed until last month. The chair of the \n     board is Carol Dinkins, a former senior Justice official \n     under Ronald Reagan and former law partner of Attorney \n     General Alberto Gonzales. Dinkins did not respond to requests \n     for comment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1829-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1829-S1830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF H.R. 32\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to compliment my friends in \nthe House of Representatives for passing expeditiously H.R. 32--the \nStop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act--as amended by the \nSenate.\n  In addition to a few technical changes, I am pleased that the bill \nincluded the entirety of S. 1095, the Protecting American Goods and \nServices Act, introduced last year by myself and Senator Leahy.\n  I am particularly pleased to work with the senior Senator from \nVermont in our continued bipartisan effort to protect intellectual \nproperty rights as well as to work on other important issues. Last \nyear, we worked together on a matter near and dear to my heart--good \ngovernment legislation related to the Freedom of Information Act, and \nit indeed has been a pleasure to work with him again. His staff has\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\nworked tirelessly with mine--especially Susan Davies, whose hard work \nand dedication to the goal of making good public policy is a testament \nto her, to Senator Leahy, and to good legislative process.\n  The combined package passed today in the form of H.R. 32 represents \nimportant, bipartisan legislation designed to combat the trafficking of \nillegitimate goods throughout the world. The rampant distribution of \nillegitimate goods--be it counterfeited products, illegal copies of \ncopyrighted works or any other form of piracy--undermines property \nrights, threatens American jobs, decreases consumer safety and, \noftentimes, supports organized crime and terrorist activity.\n  Amazingly, it is estimated that between 5 percent and 7 percent of \nworldwide trade is conducted with counterfeit goods and services. \nAccording FBI estimates, counterfeiting costs U.S. businesses as much \nas $200 to $250 billion annually--and that costs Americans their jobs--\nmore than 750,000 jobs according to U.S. Customs.\n  In recent years, this plague on global trade has grown significantly. \nAccording to the World Customs Organization and Interpol, the global \ntrade in illegitimate goods has increased from $5.5 billion in 1992 to \nmore than $600 billion per year today. That is $600 billion per year \nillegally extracted from the global economy.\n  But for me, as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, \nBorder Security and Citizenship, I find it most troubling that the \ncounterfeit trade across our borders and throughout the world threatens \nour safety and our national security. Most frighteningly, evidence \nindicates that the counterfeit trade supports terrorist activities. \nIndeed, al-Qaida training manuals recommended the sale of fake goods to \nraise revenue.\n  Further, counterfeit goods undermine our confidence in the \nreliability of goods and service. For example, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration estimates that 2 percent of the 26 million airline parts \ninstalled each year are counterfeit. And the Federal Drug \nAdministration estimates that as much as 10 percent of pharmaceuticals \nare counterfeit.\n\n  And the reach of counterfeiting runs deep in my own home State of \nTexas. Data is difficult to collect, but a 1997 piece detailing \nMicrosoft's efforts to combat counterfeiting and piracy--while dated--\npointed out that this type of activity costs Texas over 10,000 jobs and \nalmost $1 billion. Today, we know those numbers are much higher.\n  We must act to stop this illegal activity. The legislation we passed \ntoday will help us do just that. It is not complicated--nor is it long, \nbut its global impact will be significant. The legislation is designed \nto provide law enforcement with additional tools to curb the flow of \nthese illegitimate goods and it is perhaps even more critical for \nbusinesses, large and small, throughout America and for ensuring the \nsafety of consumers around the globe.\n  Those who traffic in counterfeit goods put Americans in danger, \nsupport terrorism and undermine the health of our Nation's economy. S. \n1095--or the ``PAGS Act''--as included in the legislation passed \ntoday--fills certain important gaps in current counterfeiting law by \nclarifying the term ``trafficking'' to ensure that it is illegal to:\n  Possess counterfeit goods with the intention of selling them; give \naway counterfeit goods in exchange for some future benefit--in effect, \nthe ``bartering'' of counterfeit goods in such a way that avoids \ncriminality; import or export counterfeit goods or unauthorized copies \nof copyrighted works.\n  This bill will protect property rights, protect consumer safety, \npreserve American jobs, and bolster the American economy by cracking \ndown on the trade of illegal counterfeit goods and services.\n  Each of these items was highlighted by the Department of Justice in \nits October, 2004 report on its Task Force on Intellectual Property. In \nit, the Department describes the significant limitation law enforcement \noftentimes faces in pursuing counterfeiters and offers, among others, \nthe principles embraced in the Protecting American Goods and Services \nAct, as possible solutions to these obstacles.\n  This legislation, and other reforms, will help turn the tide of the \ngrowing counterfeit trade. The legislation is critically important to \nlaw enforcement--but it is even more critical for businesses, large and \nsmall, throughout America--including in my home State of Texas--as well \nas for ensuring the safety of consumers around the globe. Those who \ntraffic in counterfeit goods put Americans in danger, support terrorism \nand undermine the health of our nation's economy. It is time to put an \nend to this scourge on society.\n  I look forward to the President signing this legislation into law, \nand in so doing, protecting property rights, protecting consumer \nsafety, preserving American jobs and bolstering the American economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1830-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1830-S1831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OFFICE OF THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an organization \nwith which many of my colleagues have some personal familiarity, the \nOffice of the Attending Physician. Many of my colleagues have come to \nrely upon the Attending Physician's Office here in the Congress as the \nsource for support and medical advice. Most of us are personally aware \nof the fine work performed by Dr. Eisold and his staff in providing \ncare for the Members of Congress, but there is much about the office \nwhich we don't think about regularly.\n  The Senate has been served by the Attending Physician since 1930, a \nlittle more than a year after the office was established by the House \nof Representatives. The first Attending Physician, Dr. George Calver, \nserved this body for approximately 37 years. He was known for offering \nhealth tips to Members of Congress such as ``eat wisely, drink \nplentifully (of water). Play enthusiastically and relax completely. \nStay out of the Washington social whirl--go out at night twice a week \nat most.'' And, perhaps most importantly. ``Don't let yourself get off-\nbalance, nervous and disturbed over things.'' Each of these remains \ngood advice all these years later.\n  My colleagues and I know we can count on the expertise of the \nAttending Physician in many areas of medical advice. On average, the \noffice successfully treats more than 50,000 patients annually. They \nregularly track the spread of infectious disease so that they can \ndetermine which inoculations and other medications will be required \nwhen Members travel to foreign locations. Members of the Senate rely on \nthe physician's office for our annual flu shots and for assistance on \nminor medical problems. We also count on them, as do our staff and \nvisitors to the Capitol, for handling medical emergencies.\n  The Office of the Attending Physician also provides unique \ncapabilities that are very important to the success of this institution \nwhich are not well known. The office is poised for crisis response. In \nrecent years, it has responded to the anthrax outbreak in the Hart \nBuilding and to the ricin scare. The physicians, nurses, and other \nmedical staff have the capability and training to respond to many \npotential emergencies up to and include terrorist response.\n  The office is equipped with mobile medical vehicles designed to allow \nfor deploying medical support throughout the region, if necessary, for \noffsite operations. These vehicles are well equipped to handle many \nmedical emergencies that could arise. Each has a fully functioning \nlaboratory and two examination rooms complete with most modern \nequipment. As the Congress considers its continuity of Government \nrequirements, the Office of the Attending Physician is well positioned \nto support emergency legislative operations which could be required \nfollowing an attack.\n  Mr. President, the Office of the Attending Physician provides a \ncritical capability to the legislative branch. The services they \nprovide serve as a convenience to busy Members of the Congress, but \nthey are much more. They are a vital piece of emergency response in the \nCapitol. They are ready, when called upon, to play a key role in \nensuring continuity of the legislative branch, they serve to handle any \nmedical emergency which might arise at the Capitol.\n  We owe a great deal to Dr. Eisold and his team of fine specialists. \nMay I suggest all of my colleagues thank them for their great service \nthe next time we\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\nsee them in action. They deserve our gratitude and support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1831-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VETERANS HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am concerned that the President's \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs fiscal year 2007 budget request does not \ninclude adequate funding for VA health care. Specifically, this budget \nrequest would require certain veterans to pay a $250 enrollment fee in \norder to access the health care system each year. In addition, the \nbudget proposes to more than double prescription copayments from $7 to \n$15, further burdening the limited resources of those who have served \nour country.\n  The VA estimates that these measures will save the Department an \nestimated $795 million in 2007. This savings estimate is based not only \non collections but on increasing the number of veterans who will opt-\nout of the service due to the higher fees. The VA estimates they will \nforce over 1 million veterans, almost half of the Priority 7 and \nPriority 8 veterans, to drop out of the VA health care system.\n  Do we really want our veterans to be faced with the difficult choice \nof either dropping out of the VA health care system or bearing these \nadditional costs? Those who do not drop out of the VA health care \nsystem will be forced to pay hundreds more for their health care. \nVeterans who receive prescription drugs from the VA and who fill a \ntypical number of prescriptions a year could face new fees amounting to \nnearly $600. I realize that agencies such as the VA must look for ways \nto save dollars, but our Nation's veterans deserve adequate and \naffordable health care.\n  While I understand the need to reduce Federal spending, I urge my \ncolleagues to reject these proposals to reduce spending for VA health \ncare in the fiscal year 2007 budget. I believe it is absolutely \ncritical that the VA health care system be fully funded. The Congress \nhas rejected these proposals in the past, and I hope it will do so \nagain this year. Our veterans should not be faced with these choices \nnor forced to bear this burden. We must keep our promise to care for \nthe veterans who made so many sacrifices to ensure the freedom of so \nmany.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1831-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, March 7, 2006, we celebrate the 16th \nannual National Sportsmanship Day. Begun in 1991 by the Institute for \nInternational Sport at the University of Rhode Island, this initiative \npromotes the highest ideals of sportsmanship and fair play among \nAmerica's youth. In 13,000 schools, across all 50 States, and in \ncountries around the world, students, teachers, administrators, \ncoaches, and parents will engage in discussions on the issues of \nsportsmanship and fair play. The theme of this year's National \nSportsmanship Day is ``Defeat Gamesmanship!'' and participants will \ntalk about appropriate tactics and strategies when participating in \ngames and sports.\n  This year, in addition to promoting the values of sportsmanship and \nfair play, the Institute for International Sport will recognize schools \nacross the country that have exceptional sportsmanship programs with \nthe new All-American Sportsmanship School Award. A minimum of 64 awards \nwill be given out to elementary, middle, and high schools as well as \ncolleges that participate in National Sportsmanship Day and honor its \nprinciples year round.\n  I am proud that Rhode Island is home to the Institute for \nInternational Sport and National Sportsmanship Day. For 16 years, this \ninitiative has had a positive influence on our Nation's youth in \npromoting the best in athletics, and I know it will continue to do so \nthis year and in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1831-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE 45TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on March 1, 1961, President Kennedy signed \nan Executive order that established the Peace Corps whose mission would \nbe to promote peace, mutual understanding, and friendship between \nAmericans and the people of the world. Back then, the world was viewed \nas engaged in a cold war with the United States and its allies pitted \nagainst the Communist bloc. President Kennedy envisioned the Peace \nCorps as an agency that would create opportunities for Americans to \nreach out to the rest of the world, and make positive contributions to \ncommunity development and nation-building overseas.\n  As we celebrate the Peace Corps's 45th anniversary, all Americans can \nbe proud of what the agency has accomplished and continues to do. \nThrough its hardworking and committed volunteers who now number nearly \n8,000, the Peace Corps provides assistance today in 138 host countries \nin such fields as education, healthcare, environmental preservation, \nand business development.\n  Last year, the Peace Corps's Crisis Corps Volunteers helped with \nrebuilding efforts in tsunami-ravaged areas of Sri Lanka and Thailand. \nAnd, for the first time in its history, volunteers were deployed at \nhome as approximately 270 volunteers assisted with recovery efforts \nalong the U.S. gulf coast in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita.\n  I am also proud to report that the Peace Corps continues to attract \nVolunteers from Hawaii. At this moment, 12 volunteers from Hawaii are \nserving in 12 different host countries that include Bulgaria, China, \nMorocco, Nicaragua, Swaziland, and Tanzania.\n  It is a pleasure to join all Americans in congratulating the Peace \nCorps and its volunteers past and present for their outstanding work, \nand for their invaluable and effective civic contributions to \ncommunities throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1831-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to \nArnold Friberg, a gifted American artist.\n  For more than eight decades as a painter, Mr. Friberg has set down a \nprofound and varied body of work, including magazine covers and \nillustrations, World War II depictions, the Northwest Mounted Police, \nBook of Mormon illustrations, portraits, including Her Royal Highness \nQueen Elizabeth of England, and many rich and dramatic depictions of \nthe Old West. This year marks the 30th anniversary of his revered \nPrayer at Valley Forge, which shows George Washington at prayer. Along \nwith Emanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware, Friberg's \nPrayer at Valley Forge is one of the great American patriotic \npaintings.\n  In 1953, Arnold Friberg was summoned to Hollywood by Cecil B. DeMille \nfor a 1-month consultation on costume design for a film he was going to \nremake. DeMille became so impressed by the artist that soon afterward \nMr. Friberg was called back to Hollywood and began a warm, personal \ncollaboration with the storied director that lasted for 4 years.\n  Mr. Friberg became DeMille's chief artist-designer for the well-known \nmovie ``The Ten Commandments,'' which brought the artist an Academy \nAward nomination. Half a century later, ``The Ten Commandments'' still \ndraws sizable audiences to television broadcasts and DVD sales. \nBecoming the visual designer for what DeMille and his set decorators \nand cameramen put on film, Mr. Friberg painted major scenes of the \nsalient episodes in the Old Testament including The Finding of Moses, \nMoses and the Burning Bush, First Passover, Exodus Begins, Orgy of the \nGolden Calf, Moses Receiving the Law, and Crossing of the Red Sea. \nVisually, the film was built around these scenes, along with major \ncostume designs created by the artist.\n  After completion of the film, Mr. Friberg's original paintings were \nwidely exhibited wherever the film opened, and more than 1 million \ncopies of a catalog depicting them were sold.\n  The golden anniversary of the release of the film is being celebrated \nthis\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\nmonth at an exhibition of these marvelous paintings, along with \nartifacts from the film, at the Utah Cultural Celebration Center in \nWest Valley City, UT.\n  I am honored today to acknowledge the work of Arnold Friberg and add \nmy name to the long list of Americans who are grateful for his \noutstanding contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1832-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING THE RUTGERS UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and \ncongratulate the Rutgers University women's basketball team for its \nthrilling victory against the University of Connecticut on February 27. \nBefore a sold-out crowd of over 8,000 fans, the tenacious Scarlet \nKnights achieved one of college basketball's most coveted titles: Big \nEast Conference champions. In the process, Rutgers also became only the \nthird team in history to finish its regular season undefeated.\n  This victory did not come easily, but the Scarlet Knights came ready \nto play, thirsty to win, and eager to give the Connecticut Huskies a \nrun for their money. Despite trailing UConn by 18 points in the first \nhalf, Rutgers refused to give up. Instead, they regrouped, refueled, \nand used strong defense and solid teamwork to make up the point \ndeficit. Led by head coach C. Vivian Stringer and senior standout \nCappie Pondexter, the Scarlet Knights played a flawless second half \nthat capped an outstanding season. By the time the final buzzer rang, \nthe Rutgers women had proven that they can compete with any team in the \nNation. More importantly, after winning their second straight \nconference title, the Scarlet Knights confirmed that hard work, \nperseverance, and desire remain the keys to success.\n  With four New Jersey natives on their roster, including Big East \nDefensive Player of the Year Essence Carson, these young women have \nbecome a source of pride for my home State. Coach Stringer, in \nparticular, deserves special recognition for the strong coaching and \nleadership skills she has demonstrated over her 10 years at Rutgers \nUniversity. As one of the most recognized and most respected coaches in \nthe game, she was inducted into the New Jersey Sports Hall of Fame in \n2005. I think I speak for both the Scarlet Knights and the Rutgers \ncommunity when I say how pleased I am to have Coach Stringer leading \nthis remarkable team.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the entire State of New Jersey, I am \nproud to congratulate the Scarlet Knights once again for their second \nconsecutive Big East Conference title. As the Scarlet Knights begins \nthis year's NCAA tournament, we hope they are able to maintain the \nmomentum that carried them so well through the regular season. We wish \nthem the best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1832-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO REDFORD AVENUE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate Redford Avenue Presbyterian Church on 100 \nyears of worship and service to the community. This milestone was \nrecently commemorated with 2 days of events, culminating in a dance and \ndinner celebration that took place on March 6, 2006. This momentous \noccasion provides the perfect opportunity to reflect on Redford's rich \nhistory and to remember the integral role Redford has played in the \ncommunity over the years.\n  Redford Avenue Presbyterian Church was established in March 1906 by a \nsmall congregation that served what was then known as the Sand Hill in \nDetroit. The church's membership grew rapidly, and as a result, in \n1929, a separate addition was built to accommodate the larger \ncongregation. Unfortunately, in 1945 the sanctuary was completely \ndestroyed by a fire. However, this tragedy provided an important \nopportunity for the congregation and community to work together to \nrebuild the church, and by 1954, a new sanctuary, educational wing and \nfellowship hall was constructed. By the late 1960s, the membership had \ngrown to more than 3,600 people.\n  Today, Redford Avenue Presbyterian Church has a smaller congregation \nbut has maintained its strong spirit, deep faith and unwavering \ncommitment to serve and minister to the greater Detroit community. For \nthe last 30 years the church has run a daycare center that helps to \nmeet the needs of many working parents in the community. In addition, \nRedford's educational building is currently being leased to a charter \nschool and is also used by a local division of Sea Cadets.\n  Redford Avenue Presbyterian Church also continues to make its \nbuilding available to many groups and organizations in the \nneighborhood. Considered a cornerstone of the community, Redford \nconsistently provides meeting space for groups such as Narcotics \nAnonymous and Metro Detroit Deaf Senior Citizens. And, for 1 night each \nJanuary, the church opens its doors to house, feed, clothe, and \nminister to the homeless.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating Redford \nAvenue Presbyterian Church and wish its members, volunteers, and \nministerial staff many more years of fellowship and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1832-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1832-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1832-5", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1832-S1833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n       EC-5921.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for health and long-term care insurance costs of individual \nnot participating in employer-subsidized health plans; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould provide an above-the-line tax deduction for individuals who \npurchase their own health insurance and are not receiving it through \ntheir employer. An above-the-line tax deduction would allow a taxpayer \nto take the deduction even if they don't itemize their taxes. Current \nlaw allows those individuals who are self-employed and purchase health \ninsurance to take an above-the-line tax deduction. My legislation would \nmake the tax code fairer by allowing those people who are not self-\nemployed to take the same deduction.\n  An estimated 17.4 million Americans in 2005 were covered by \nindividually purchased health insurance policies. Some of these people \nare self-employed and can currently take this deduction. However, based \nupon these statistics, I estimate that up to 2 million families who \nhave purchased health insurance do not have access to this deduction. \nMy legislation seeks to correct that. Additionally, the legislation \nwill make it cheaper for uninsured people to purchase their own health \ninsurance policies. Health care costs in general are expected to rise \n7.2 percent per year for the next ten years, so it is important for \nCongress to pursue steps to attempt to rein in this inflation and also \nto try to make health care and health insurance more accessible and \naffordable. This legislation is a part of those efforts.\n  Another important aspect of the legislation is that it would also \nallow individuals to take an above-the-line deduction for the purchase \nof long-term-care insurance. Most employers do not offer any subsidized \nlong-term-care insurance to their employees, so those who need this \nprotection often have to purchase it in the individual market. It is \nvery important for Americans to purchase this insurance, since many \npeople assume that Medicare covers long-term-care costs when people \nturn age 65. However, this is not true. Often, seniors will find \nthemselves on Medicaid, the low-income federal health care program, \nwhen they have long stays in nursing homes that they cannot pay for. \nLong-term-care insurance is a far better alternative to having seniors \ngo onto Medicaid. It is important for Congress to incentivize people to \npurchase this insurance, and my legislation is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I want to urge my colleagues to look at this legislation. It is short \nand to the point, but helping people to have private health insurance \nand long-term-care insurance is an important part of improving our \nhealth care system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2380. A bill to add the heads of certain Federal intelligence \nagencies to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, \nto require enhanced notification to Congress and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I have introduced a bill entitled the \nU.S. National Security Protection Act of 2006. This legislation would \nenact some critical reforms with respect to the Committee on Foreign \nInvestment in the United States, CFIUS. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues in the coming days on this bill.\n  One thing is clear. The importance of reforming CFIUS has been \nbrought into sharp focus by the proposed acquisition of P Steamship \nNavigation Company's U.S. port operations by Dubai Ports, DP, World, a \ncompany based in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, UAE. The reason so \nmany people are concerned about that particular deal is obvious: while \nsecurity threats are dynamic, assets such as our ports are, and always \nwill be, a national security concern.\n  CFIUS's role is to vet these deals for possible national security \ndangers. But the problem here is that the CFIUS process is broken. \nIndeed, the DP World deal was approved in less than 30\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\ndays--even though U.S. law clearly required there to be a full 45-day \ninvestigation.\n  Many of us here in Congress have for a while now expressed concerns \nover whether the current CFIUS structure is adequately protecting our \nnational security. The GAO also expressed these concerns in a report it \nreleased last September. So again, it's not like the cat has suddenly \nbeen let out of the bag that the CFIUS process needs reform.\n  Yet despite all the evidence to the contrary--most prominently, the \nDP World-P deal--the administration does not seem to believe that \nthere is anything wrong with the CFIUS process.\n  The bill I introduced today--the National Security Protection Act of \n2006--goes to the heart of three very simple principles. First, since \nCFIUS is set up to protect our national security, the intelligence \ncommunity--whose fundamental purpose is to promote national security--\nneeds to have a formal and expanded role in CFIUS. Second, \naccountability and transparency need to be made a permanent part of the \nCFIUS process. And third, when critical U.S. infrastructure might be \nacquired by a foreign government-controlled entity, CFIUS must perform \na full 45 day investigation--no exceptions.\n  My bill would address these issues by doing the following: First, it \nwould add the Director of National Intelligence, DNI, and Director of \nthe CIA, DCI, to the CFIUS panel.\n  Second, it would create a CFIUS Subcommittee on Intelligence whose \nmembers would represent the heads of all of the intelligence agencies \nof the U.S. government. That subcommittee, chaired by the Director of \nNational Intelligence, would review and provide comments on matters to \ncome before CFIUS--including comments on 30 day reviews which do not \nresult in 45 day investigations and comments on the results of 45 day \ninvestigations. This subcommittee would also conduct 15 day initial \nreviews of all cases filed with CFIUS.\n\n  Some might ask why the DNI would need to serve on both the full CFIUS \npanel and on the subcommittee. The reasoning behind this is simple--the \nDNI has two important roles in the process. On the full committee, the \nDNI should fill a role of providing policy advice from the perspective \nof the intelligence community. On the subcommittee level, the DNI \nshould oversee the collection, analysis, and reporting on specific, \ncase-related intelligence that is vital to the CFIUS process.\n  Third, the National Security Protection Act would create two Vice \nChair positions on the full CFIUS panel, to be filled by the \nSecretaries of Defense and Homeland Security. That will help to ensure \nthat economic, intelligence, and security matters are given appropriate \nweight in the decision making process. Economic interests, while \nimportant, must never come ahead of the protection of our national \nsecurity.\n  Fourth, this legislation would mandate that only the CFIUS chair, \nwith the concurrence of the two Vice Chairs, or the President acting on \nhis own authority, can sign off on a 30-day review which concludes that \na potential deal poses no security threat. In addition, it would \nrequire that this determination be made in writing with the appropriate \nsignatures, and mandate that the CFIUS Chair and Vice Chairs who make \nsuch a determination be at the level of Secretary so that this \nresponsibility is not delegated to subordinates. Furthermore, if either \nof the Vice Chairs dissent with respect to the decision to not conduct \na 45-day investigation, my bill would mandate that the matter be sent \nto the President for a final determination.\n  Fifth, my bill would require the President or CFIUS to notify \nCongress not later than 15 days after paperwork is submitted by \ncompanies for CFIUS review, and not later than 15 days after the \ncommencement of all 30-day reviews and 45-day investigations.\n  Sixth, this bill would also require the President to provide \nquarterly reports to Congress detailing all 30- and 50-day actions. \nThese reports would include the intelligence subcommittee's comments on \neach case, and they would be submitted in unclassified form with a \nclassified annex.\n  Seventh, for any transaction where a foreign-owned company is seeking \nto acquire U.S. critical infrastructure, this bill would mandate that \nthe company provide the appropriate notification to CFIUS of the \nproposed transaction as well as the required information for CFIUS to \nexamine the case. Currently that process is voluntary and it shouldn't \nbe.\n  Eighth and finally, the National Security Protection Act would amend \nexisting U.S. law, which governs under what conditions the President \nmust conduct a full 45-day investigation. Currently, U.S. law requires \na full investigation if ``an entity controlled by or acting on behalf \nof a foreign government'' attempts to acquire a U.S. entity engaged in \ninterstate commerce that could affect U.S. national security. My bill \nwould clarify this provision by requiring a 45-day investigation \nwhenever the U.S. entity to be acquired controls, owns, or operates \ncritical infrastructure in the U.S.\n  I don't want anyone to misinterpret what I am saying here. Foreign \ninvestment in the U.S. economy provides an important influx of capital. \nIn today's globalized world, we would do tremendous damage to our \neconomy by cutting off foreign investment. And I do not think anyone \nhere is talking about that.\n  Just to provide some reference, according to the Commerce Department, \nin 2004, foreigners invested $113 billion in U.S. businesses and real \nestate. But that amount is only about half as much as U.S. firms \ninvested abroad. So while we rightly have concerns about outsourcing \nand enforcement of fair trade practices, the U.S. obviously gets \nsignificant benefits from participating in the global economy.\n  But supporting free and fair trade, and working to protect the \nnational interest, are not mutually exclusive. Because we are not just \nworking to protect the American worker, we are also trying to protect \nhis or her family, and the generations to come.\n  Simply put, national security should never be subordinated to \ncommercial interests.\n  Some would suggest that this is an issue of race-baiting, ill will, \nor bias toward the Arab world. Let me be clear on that point. Nothing \nwe say with respect to DP World or the situation in the UAE--or any \nother potential deal--should be construed as such.\n  To that end, I wholly reject the views of those who suggest that our \nconcern with the DP World acquisition, and with other foreign \ngovernment acquisitions of U.S. critical infrastructure, is somehow \nrooted in a xenophobic ideology.\n  Rather, when it comes to international business, there are two main \nissues that I think we as Americans are concerned with. One is the \nprotection of the U.S. economy, our industrial base, and American \nworkers. The other is the safeguarding of our national security. With \nrespect to the DP World-P deal, we're mainly talking about that \nsecond issue.\n  According to United Press International, UPI, operations at up to 22 \nU.S. ports would come under the control of DP World if it is allowed to \nacquire P's U.S. port operations. This includes critical ports in New \nYork, New Jersey, Baltimore, Miami, New Orleans, Mississippi, and \nTexas. And it reportedly includes two ports in Texas used by the Army, \nand through which approximately 40 percent of equipment shipped to our \ntroops in Iraq has flowed.\n  Yet, CFIUS decided in less than 30 days that this deal did not pose a \nsecurity threat to the U.S. There was no full and thorough 45 day \ninvestigation, which in my view was mandated by law. Indeed, the Byrd \nAmendment to Exon-Florio requires a full 45 day investigation if two \nconditions are met: first, that the acquirer is controlled or acting on \nbehalf of a foreign government; and second, if the acquisition could \naffect U.S. national security. Both of these conditions are clearly met \nin this case.\n  There also appears to have been no consultation with Members of \nCongress on the DP World issue. In October, Deputy Treasury Secretary \nKimmitt testified that he and his agency support more effective \ncommunication with Members of Congress to enhance the transparency of \nCFIUS. I ask where that communication was with respect to DP World.\n  Certainly, I understand the desire for protecting privacy, but that \ndoes not\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\nexcuse the lack of any real consultation with Congress and the \nresulting lack of transparency. This is an issue of checks and \nbalances, which exist to protect Americans. And the protection of \nAmericans must never be subordinated to foreign interests.\n  But there are other problems with CFIUS that have become apparent \nthrough the DP World case. Indeed, we recently learned that neither \nSecretary Snow nor President Bush knew about the DP World acquisition. \nNot even Secretary Snow's deputy knew about the matter while it was \nundergoing the initial 30 day review.\n  Now, given Secretary Snow's history with CSX, whose port operations \nwere acquired by DP World in 2004, his lack of involvement was the \nright thing. I only wish that it had been intentional.\n  And when it comes to the President, I would simply ask this question: \nWhen operations at 22 critical U.S. ports are to be sold to a company \ncontrolled and owned by a foreign government, one with a questionable \nsecurity history with respect to terrorism and WMD proliferation, why \nwasn't the President made aware of the deal?\n  In a March 1 New York Times article, the President was quoted as \nsaying that ``If there was any doubt in my mind, or people in my \nAdministration's mind, that our ports would be less secure or the \nAmerican people endangered, this deal wouldn't go forward.''\n  I frankly have no idea how the President could reach this conclusion. \nThere has been no thorough investigation, as required by law. The \nPresident did not even apparently know about the DP World deal until \nvery recently. It is precisely this kind of superficial determination \nthat has the American people so worried about their security--and \nrightly so.\n  If all of this is not evidence of a broken CFIUS process, then I do \nnot know what is.\n  I know that some people would argue that the issue is not CFIUS--that \nthe real issue is having adequate measures to protect our ports. \nFrankly, I think that both of these are major Issues.\n  And if we look at the pathetic security situation at our Nation's \nports today, that becomes quite clear. Only about 5 percent of the \ncargo that comes through our ports is actually inspected. Indeed, the \nresources available to the Department of Homeland Security to undertake \nport and container security are woefully inadequate. According to \nreports, U.S. Customs has only 80 inspectors to monitor the compliance \nof nearly 6,000 importers, who are currently charged with maintaining \nthe security of their goods during transit. The Coast Guard is even \nworse off with 20 inspectors dedicated to assessing worldwide \ncompliance with relevant international shipping and port facility \nsecurity codes. That's 100 people for the whole world. And it is a \nproblem that needs to be fixed.\n  But CFIUS reform is an indispensable part of the process of \nstrengthening U.S. national security. Indeed, the current problems are \nevident in other cases besides DP World. Most recently we learned about \nanother deal with a Dubai-based company. That company, Dubai \nInternational Capital is seeking, as part of a $1.2 billion deal, to \nacquire London-based Doncasters Group Ltd. Doncasters has operations in \nthe U.S.--primarily in my home state of Connecticut and in Georgia.\n  True, in this case, CFIUS has decided to perform the full 45-day \ninvestigation. I'm glad that they have, because Doncasters is involved \nin the production of components for some of our most critical military \nequipment, including the M1 Abrams tank.\n  But while I'd like to think that the Doncasters investigation was \nbegun on its own merits, I must admit that I find the timing of this \ninvestigation highly suspect. In fact, it appears that this \ninvestigation was not even launched until the DP World issue became \npublic and stirred up some very legitimate concerns.\n  So as we can see, it is critically important that we reform the CFIUS \nprocess. We can not afford to sit and wait on this. The U.S. National \nSecurity Protection Act of 2006 would significantly strengthen CFIUS \nand thus our national security. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill, the U.S. National \nSecurity Act of 2006, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2380\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974 to provide line item rescission authority; to the \nCommittee on the Budget.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Legislative Line \nItem Veto Act of 2006. I am proud to say there are over 20 Senators who \nhave joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation, including \nour colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry. I wish to thank \nSenator Kerry for his support, and for the support of all of the other \noriginal cosponsors who have joined me on this significant legislative \nreform proposal.\n  The legislation itself is long overdue. It is an authority provided \nin one version or another to 43 Governors today. It is an authority \nthat has been requested by at least 11 Presidents, including Franklin \nRoosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, and Bill \nClinton.\n  The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, first outlined by \nPresident Bush yesterday, when enacted will provide the President and \nthe Congress with a tool to surgically remove specific spending and \ntargeted tax benefits from broader enacted legislation. Unlike the line \nitem veto legislation that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional in \n1998, this is clearly constitutional.\n  The legislation builds upon current Presidential rescission \nauthorities changing the current process to require Congress to act, \none way or the other, on the President's proposed removal of items in \nenacted law. This new procedure guarantees an up-or-down vote on the \nPresident's proposed rescissions, without amendments.\n  I was trying to think how to describe this procedure when people ask, \nand one might think of it as similar to the Armed Forces BRAC \nCommission process. I am really talking about the approach, the \nprocedure itself. By that, I mean that the President proposes and the \nCongress, under expedited procedures, within 10 days, approves or \ndisapproves of the legislation that rescinds spending, including both \nappropriation items or entitlement spending. The one spending program \nwhich would be exempt from this process is Social Security.\n  The legislation is balanced in that it would also allow the President \nto eliminate revenue-losing provisions that provide Federal tax \nbenefits to 100 or fewer beneficiaries or provide temporary or \ntransitional relief to 10 or fewer beneficiaries.\n  I am encouraged by the broad bipartisan support for this reform \nlegislation. I hope this Congress will act on the bill to provide us \nanother tool to control unnecessary and wasteful spending in tax \nexpenditures. It is just good government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. --\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I join with Senators Frist, McCain, and \nothers as a cosponsor of legislation to establish a Presidential line \nitem veto. This is a fiscally prudent measure which could reduce \nwasteful spending and bring down our Nation's deficit.\n  The proposal would give the President the authority to strike \nwasteful spending measures from legislation, to ensure that the \nAmerican taxpayer is not footing the bill for projects that are not \nnational priorities. I applaud President Bush for putting forth this \ninitiative, which would be significant progress in the fight to reduce \nnonessential spending.\n  Throughout our country's history, the line item veto has enjoyed a \nlong line of bipartisan support, with Presidents such as Ulysses Grant, \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton calling for \nthe authority. Additionally, the power has been given to Governors in \n43 of the 50 States.\n  I am pleased that the proposed legislation would require the \nPresident to send recision proposals back to Congress for final \npassage. Not only does this make the legislation consistent with the \nConstitution, it also limits the scope of any President's veto \nauthority, as proposed changes will need congressional approval.\n  I am heartened to see this call for fiscal responsibility from \nPresident Bush. I have joined as a cosponsor of this legislation \nbecause it will be impossible for us to reduce our national debt and \nbalance the Federal budget unless we curb wasteful spending. I have \nbeen an advocate for the pay-as-you-go budget rule, which would require \nCongress to pay for any new spending or tax cuts, and will continue to \npress for its adoption.\n  Since chronic deficits add to the burden of debt we are bequeathing \nto future generations, congressional spending must be reigned in, and I \nam pleased to support this proposal which is one tool that can improve \nspending discipline in Washington.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Reid, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Carper, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Nelson of Florida, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Rockefeller, \n        and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2382.

In interpreting Article \n     III of the Constitution, the Supreme Court in Muskrat v. \n     United States defined the term ``judicial power'' to mean \n     ``the right to determine actual controversies arising between \n     adverse litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper \n     jurisdiction''.\n       (2) In 1996, a holder of a trademark registration issued by \n     the Patent and Trademark Office asserted trademark \n     infringement and other claims in a United States district \n     court against an alleged infringer. The plaintiff's claims \n     for relief were based upon laws and treaties of the United \n     States, including the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 \n     et seq.) and the Inter-American Convention for Trademark and \n     Commercial Protection.\n       (3) In October 1998, just prior to commencement of the \n     trial, the alleged infringer procured an amendment to the \n     Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act, 1999 (as contained in section 101(b) of division A of \n     Public Law 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681-88). That amendment is \n     commonly referred to as ``section 211'' and has been of \n     singular benefit to that defendant in the courts.\n       (4) Subsections (a)(2) and (b) of section 211 provide that \n     ``No United States court shall recognize, enforce, or \n     otherwise validate any assertion of rights'' of certain \n     trademarks or commercial names of the type at issue in the \n     litigation referred to in paragraph (2). Subsection (a)(1) of \n     section 211 also rescinds the general authority permitting \n     payment of the fees necessary for registration and renewal of \n     such trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark \n     Office.\n       (5) The intended and actual effect of section 211 is to \n     strip United States courts of the authority to decide the \n     ownership and enforceability of such trademarks and trade \n     names, including those at issue in the litigation described \n     in paragraph (2). As a result of section 211, the plaintiff \n     in the litigation was prevented from asserting the \n     plaintiff's infringement claim. By preventing the payment of \n     fees for trademark registration and renewal in the Patent and \n     Trademark Office, section 211 also denies parties the ability \n     to preserve claims of ownership in such trademarks pending \n     judicial determination of enforcement rights.\n       (6) Section 211 is not needed for the courts to reach \n     equitable results with respect to the United States trademark \n     and trade name rights of foreign nationals who have suffered \n     from confiscation of their businesses at home. It has been \n     the longstanding practice of the Federal courts to do equity \n     in adjudicating disputes involving such rights.\n       (7) Repeal of section 211 is necessary and desirable to \n     restore to the courts the power to determine the ownership \n     and enforceability of all trademarks and trade names and to \n     preserve trademark registrations pending such determinations.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to restore to \n     the judiciary the power to decide all trademark and trade \n     name cases arising under the laws and treaties of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n       (c) Restoration of Judicial Powers.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 211 of the Department of Commerce \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (as contained \n     in section 101(b) of division A of Public Law 105-277; 112 \n     Stat. 2681-88) is repealed.\n       (2) Regulations.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out the \n     repeal made by paragraph (1), including removing any \n     prohibition on transactions or payments to which subsection \n     (a)(1) of section 211 of the Department of Commerce and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 applied.\n       (3) Authority of courts.--United States courts shall have \n     the authority to recognize, enforce, or otherwise validate \n     any assertion of rights in any mark or trade name based on \n     common law rights or registration or under subsection (b) or \n     (e) of section 44 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S. C. \n     1126 (b) or (e)) or based on any treaty to which the United \n     States is a party.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2927.

Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs will hold a hearing on March 14, 2006, \nentitled ``GSA Contractors Who Cheat on Their Taxes and What Should Be \nDone About It.'' The March 14 hearing will be the third hearing on \nFederal contractors with unpaid tax debt. In February 2004, the \nsubcommittee held a hearing entitled ``DOD Contractors Who Cheat on \nTheir Taxes, which examined the IRS' failure to collect $3 billion in \nunpaid taxes owed by contractors doing business with the Department of \nDefense, DOD, and getting paid with taxpayer dollars. In June 2005, the \nSubcommittee held a hearing entitled ``Civilian Contractors Who Cheat \non Their Taxes'', which identified an additional $3.3 billion in unpaid \ntaxes and demonstrated that the problem of tax delinquent Federal \ncontractors is not confined to DOD. Because of the potential revenue \nthat could be collected by the Federal Payment Levy Program from non-\nDOD contractors, the subcommittee expanded the coverage of the \ninvestigation to include contractors at other Federal agencies who \nreceive Federal contract payments and are delinquent in paying their \ntaxes. In the continuing investigation of Federal contractors who do \nnot pay their taxes, the subcommittee plans to hold a hearing on March \n14 on the General Service Administration's contractors who are tax \ndelinquent. Federal contractors who owe taxes are still allowed to do \nbusiness with the Federal Government. The hearing will explore the \nextent to which these contractors are tax delinquent and what can be \ndone about it.\n  The subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, March 14, 2006, at \n9:30 a.m. in room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For \nfurther information, please contact Raymond V. Shepherd, III, Staff \nDirector and Chief Counsel to the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1850-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      Committee on Armed Services\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I send an amendment to the desk.\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2932.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when we returned from the winter recess, \nthis Democratic minority acted decisively by introducing S. 2180, which \nwe call the Honest Leadership Act. We put reform to paper and \nestablished the baseline for the Senate by getting caucuswide support \nfor what we believe is a very tough and comprehensive reform piece of \nlegislation.\n  Much of what we worked for as a caucus has now gained bipartisan \nsupport. I appreciate the work done by Senators Lott and Dodd. I \nappreciate the work done by Senators Lieberman and Collins. I \nespecially appreciate the work of the committee members, both Democrats \nand Republicans.\n  What we have now is a molding of both the bill that came out of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Rules \nCommittee. That bill included a significant portion of the bill we \nintroduced. I compliment and applaud the two committees for getting us \nto the point where we are.\n  There are aspects of the reported bills that need to be strengthened. \nAs far as these measures now before the Senate, we want them to be \nconsistent with legislation we introduced earlier this year. The \namendment I have offered does that.\n  The amendment would make a number of changes to the pending bill. It \nwould prohibit sitting Members of the Senate and senior legislative and \nexecutive branch employees from negotiating for private sector \nemployment where a conflict or appearance of a conflict exists.\n  This amendment would impose criminal penalties in order to put a stop \nto the system of what many believe is a system of corruption that \ndeveloped under the so-called K Street project. The K Street project \nwas a form of institutionalized corruption in which Members of Congress \nlimited access to government offices and influence over policy matters, \nor threatened to do so, as a means of forcing corporations, trade \nassociations, and lobbying firms to hire Republicans and to tilt their \npolitical contributions to Republicans. It is a pay-to-play scheme as \nblatant and arrogant as anyone has seen in Congress.\n  This amendment increases civil and criminal penalties under the \nLobbying Disclosure Act for individuals who knowingly and willingly \nfile false information.\n  This amendment puts an end to the dead-of-night legislating and the \npractice of shutting Members and the public out of conference committee \nproceedings.\n  One of our real complaints since we have become a minority is the \nmajority does not even go through the sham of holding a conference. \nThey just march over in someone's office and say: This is what the bill \nis going to be.\n  That is not the way things previously were done. We had public \nmeetings where there were debates and votes in public. That is what we \nwant to be the future of this Senate. This amendment requires the \nconference committees hold regular formal open meetings and that each \nmember of the conference be afforded an opportunity to vote on the full \ntext of the bill in open session.\n  This amendment prohibits all gifts from lobbyists, including meals. \nThis amendment goes beyond simple disclosure and prohibits outside \ninterests who advocate before the Congress from paying for travel for \nMembers and staff, and bans most privately funded travel by companies, \ngroups, business associations, and other special interests that lobby \nCongress. There would be a limited exemption for travel sponsored by \n501(c)(3) tax-exempt charities and educational groups that would be \nrequired to certify that lobbyists did not finance, organize, or \nparticipate in the travel.\n  We worked hard to get this bill to the Senate. I hope this amendment \nwill give us the bipartisan support we need to strengthen this \nlegislation now before the Senate.\n  I am disappointed we have heard today that the House Republican \nleaders have stated that they prefer a partisan approach, something \ndifferent than we have had in the Senate to this point. The House \nRepublican leaders have said they intend to tack regulation of 527 \ngroups onto their yet-to-be-seen lobbying reform bill. They also want \nto pair regulation of 527 groups with measures to weaken McCain-\nFeingold laws in a way that would principally benefit the majority.\n  In fact, these are the only clear priorities House Republican leaders \nappear to have for their bill. That is where the House Republicans' \nnarrow interest lies. Theirs is a partisan goal of changing the rules \nof our campaign finance system to hedge against the possibility of \nRepublican election losses this fall. They think if you cannot win \nunder the rules, then change them. That is what the House Republican \nleaders plan.\n  What we have in the Senate, to this point, has been bipartisan, \nDemocrats and Republicans. What has been talked about in the House \ntoday is anti-reform legislation. Our Senate leaders--and I am \ndirecting my attention principally to the two committees--have rejected \nthis effort and, again, I congratulate them for that.\n\n  As Senator Dodd so aptly put it yesterday, campaign finance reform is \nmuch larger than the narrow question of 527 groups. The House \nRepublican leaders want to shut those down because of the perception \nthat these groups benefit Democrats. But what about trade associations \nwhich engage in the same types of activities? What about these \nfoundations that we have heard so much about lately that pay relatives \nand friends and campaign workers? We know these trade associations \nengage in activities because we have seen their handiwork in \nadvertisements, political advertisements for Republican candidates up \nthis cycle. They were also active in 2004.\n  Yet the trade associations engaging in these activities are even less \nregulated than 527 groups. They are not required, as 527s are, to \ndisclose their expenditures and their donors. They operate in the \nshadows. These groups principally benefit Republicans.\n  We also need to crack down on abuses of foundations, as I mentioned, \nand charities which are used by Members for personal gain or for \ncampaign purposes. Curiously, we do not hear Republican calls to \nregulate any of these activities.\n  So what Senator Dodd and I say is, if we are going to have a debate \non foundations, trade associations, and 527s, let's have a debate on \nthat and not try to bury what we have on the floor, an Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act. I understand it is a way that the \nHouse thinks it will take this bill down. But as Senator Dodd said, if \nthis comes back from a conference and this is the issue, there will not \nbe lobbying reform. That would be very unfair, wrong for this \ninstitution.\n  As important as these campaign finance issues are, they are on the \nperiphery, really, of the big issue; that is, how do we pay for \ncampaigns? Is public financing--which some Senators believe is the \nright way to go--where we need to go? That is why a debate should be on \ncampaign finance reform and not trying to muddle up and confuse the \nSenate on the issue now before us.\n  Lobbying reform, of all things, should not be twisted into a vehicle \nexploited by one party to gain electoral advantage. If that is a path \nwhich is chosen, it will be a poison pill. The legislation will come \ndown. I hope this does not happen. We have worked with Republicans so \nfar to make sure this issue does not get entangled with campaign \nfinance reform, such as the public funding of campaigns or the \nregulation of these 527 groups. I hope we can continue to do that.\n  This amendment is, in effect, an effort to plug the holes that were \nnot placed in this legislation by the Rules Committee and the Homeland \nSecurity Committee. I hope we have a good debate on this issue. This is \nnot something that should take a long time. I have told the \ndistinguished majority leader this is no attempt to stall this \nlegislation. I have told the majority leader that unless there are \nissues outside of what the two committees did that are within their \njurisdiction, we\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\nhave no intention of offering a myriad of issues we have Members \nclamoring to offer--issues on the port security deal, minimum wage, all \nkinds of things dealing with health care. There is a long list of \nissues we want to bring up as soon as possible, but we are not going to \ndo it on this legislation. We believe this should be for lobbying \nreform. So I think it needs the good faith of both parties to see if we \ncan move down that road.\n  I have asked my caucus, if they want to speak on this issue, to do it \nas soon as they can, hopefully in the morning when we come in. It would \nbe good if we could have a vote before we go to our respective lunches. \nThe majority has a Steering Committee meeting every Wednesday. We have \na special caucus tomorrow. It would be good if we could wrap up the \nvote before then.\n  Mr. President, I wish everyone a good evening. Good night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/07/senate-section/article/S1852-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
