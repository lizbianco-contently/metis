Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4297, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4297) to provide for reconciliation pursuant \n     to section 201(b) of the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, in just a short while, we will begin \nconsideration of the House-passed tax reconciliation bill. As Senators \nremember, the Senate passed our bill, the Senate bill on November 18. \nWe considered the bill for 3 days and after 17 votes, passed the bill \nwith a 64-to-33 vote. With the two bills now complete, we would \nnormally reach agreement to send them to conference to produce a final \nconference report. I have had a number of conversations with the \nDemocratic leader on this matter. I know Members on his side of the \naisle will object and desire to start the House bill with the 20 hours \nremaining under the statute. That is their right and that is what we \nwill be doing.\n  We have already considered the Tax Relief Act of 2005, and it is not \nmy desire to take up any more of the Senate's time on this bill. We do \nneed to move forward and get both bills to conference in order to reach \nan agreement on final language. That would take unanimous consent and, \nwith objection from the other side, we have no choice but to proceed in \nthe manner that we will, under statute over the next 20 hours. I do ask \nthat Senators on both sides of the aisle use restraint and try not to \nuse their entire block of time.\n  Much of the discussion that carried on in the quorum call is how we \ncan organize that in such a way to consider amendments appropriately \nand in a reasonable way. But we should not have to use all 20 hours. We \nhave a lot of other important issues to consider.\n  In the meantime, we will be on the reconciliation bill throughout the \nday and the evening and the rest of the week until we finish the \nmeasure.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that after the House bill is reported, we \nbegin a period of morning business, as under the order from last night, \nand further, that following the scheduled morning business period, the \nbill be open for debate only until later today when either I or the \nassistant majority leader is recognized.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I haven't talked \nspecifically to either one of the Republican leaders about this, but I \nwould like that to be amended. We did not clear time for Senator Durbin \nto speak as in morning business. I ask unanimous consent that he be \nallowed to speak in morning business for 15 minutes, and another 15 \nminutes would be added to the time of the majority, and that the only \nthing that would be out of the ordinary is that Senator Durbin would be \nrecognized. The Republicans are to have the first half hour. I ask that \nSenator Durbin be recognized for 15 minutes. He has to give a speech. \nHe could be recognized to use his additional 15 minutes when we start \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. We understand that additional half hour would come out of \nthe time on the resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. As I understand it, all morning business time, including \nthis additional 30-minute increment, would be part of the 20 hours.\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \nDemocratic leader?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right, the recognition prior to Senator \nDurbin would be to Senator Bond?\n  Mr. REID. I am trying to get to Senator Durbin so he can go downtown \nand give a speech. How long will the Senator from Missouri be talking?\n  Mr. FRIST. We have the initial 30 minutes. Is the request made to \ntalk within our 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair understands the request is for \nSenator Durbin to speak before the 30 minutes commences.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to the Senator from Missouri, how long \nwill you be speaking?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, responding to the distinguished minority \nleader, I plan to speak about 10 minutes. I would be happy to allow \nSenator Durbin to go first. I have some obligations.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if after you complete your speech, could he \ngo ahead and do his?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we had 30 \nminutes. Our people are not here, but they were lined up. The plans had \nbeen scheduled. I request that the Senator from Illinois speak right \nafter our 30 minutes, the first part.\n  Mr. REID. That is OK. I didn't want to use leader time, but we will \nwork it out. We have an extra 15 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The agreement is to add 30 minutes to the \noriginal hour?\n  Mr. REID. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. And the Republicans' 45 minutes is first.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be a \nperiod for transaction of morning business for up to 90 minutes, with \nthe first half of the time under the control of the majority leader or \nhis designee, and the second half of the time under the control of the \nDemocratic leader or his designee, with the time counted against the \nunderlying statutory time limitation on the bill.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                    Commending Our Military Overseas\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and commend the \nvaliant efforts of our men and women who are serving overseas. Almost \n4\\1/2\\ years after the dreadful events of September 11 seized our \nNation, brave Americans continue to serve overseas in our response to \nthose attacks. During the past 2 months, I have visited with our \ntroops, agency operators, and aid workers in two areas I believe are \nthe two fronts of the war on terrorism, the Near East and Southeast \nAsia. Those I met with in the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and Pakistan all relayed to me, on the whole, very \nencouraging reports. In Iraq, our congressional delegation, which \nincluded Senator Bayh, Senator Obama, Representative Ford, and I, was \ntold by intelligence officials that in spite of the increasing numbers \nof IEDs, improvised explosive devices, attacks, they see more reason \nfor optimism this year than they did in the previous year, and they see \nit as no small achievement that many of the insurgent groups are \njoining the political process. From Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, to \nU.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzan, to U.S. military commanders, \nintelligence officials, aid workers, and the Iraqi people themselves, \neveryone told us that this year will be a bellwether year for Iraq in \nwhich we see the potential for great achievements. But we need to make \nprogress in three key areas:\n  First, the Iraqis must ensure that a national unity government reigns \nin Baghdad. This was emphasized by President Talabani. The Sunni, Shia, \nand Kurds have to work together to incorporate all three parties in one \ngoverning structure. We were all greatly encouraged by the 77-percent \nvoter turnout in the December general elections, as it evidences that \nmore and more Iraqis are buying into the wonderful concept of \ndemocracy. Now they need to show us they are willing to work together \nas we provide them assistance and stability.\n  Second, we need to focus our primary efforts in standing up Iraqi \npolice and domestic forces this year. Civilian authority must reign in \nIraqi cities for citizens to gain confidence in their new democratic \nform of government.\n  Third, we must continue to provide maximum assistance for \nreconstruction efforts so that more Iraqis may gain access to \nelectrical power, use water and sewer systems, and drive safely on \ntheir roads.\n  This is not to say we have not already made significant gains in \nthese areas, for everywhere I went our troops and workers expressed to \nme their disappointment that the tremendous achievements we have made \nhave gone largely unreported in the U.S. media. One phrase I heard used \noften in our major networks is: If it bleeds, it leads. They talk about \nthe tragedies and the losses, but they somehow fail to talk about the \nprogress we have made. A few suicide bombings per day executed by \nwayward individuals, mindless terrorists, who are willing to sacrifice \nthemselves, is apparently a higher priority in the media than acts of \nsacrifice, courage, and commitment by several hundred thousand \ncoalition workers and over 26 million Iraqis. To be sure, Iraq is a \ndangerous place--the day before we arrived at one base, five of their \nmarines had been killed--but it is also a place of tremendous \ntransformation, and over the past year our progress is often crowded \nout on the evening news.\n  But we must not lose our resolve. As the President said last night:\n\n       In all these areas, from disruption of terrorist networks, \n     to victory in Iraq, to the support of freedom and hope in \n     troubled regions, we need the support of friends and allies. \n     To draw that support we must always be clear in our \n     principles and willing to act. The only alternative to \n     American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and more \n     anxious world.\n\n  The President also addressed his terrorist surveillance program. He \nsaid:\n\n       This program has helped prevent terrorist attacks in our \n     country. It remains essential to the security of America. If \n     there are people inside our country who are talking with al-\n     Qaida, we want to know about it because we will not sit back \n     and wait to let it happen again.\n\n  That is what I hear from the people I talk to in my home State.\n  In Afghanistan, also, phenomenal progress has been made. Yet what we \nhear about on the daily news are the incidents of terrorism that grab \nheadlines. Today in London, the international community is coming \ntogether to chart the course for Afghan assistance for the next few \nyears. This is a vital meeting where peace-loving nations will commit \nto invest in Afghanistan's newfound democracy. Afghanistan is in a very \ndifferent situation from Iraq, yet it currently has two of the same \npressing needs: the standup of strong, reliable, civil-controlled \ninterior security forces and infrastructure development.\n  I also heard from our leaders on the ground, including President \nKarzai of Afghanistan and our commander of that region, General \nEikenberry, that Afghanistan desperately needs a viable agriculture and \nfarm credit system. We need to get the farmers back on their feet so \nthey do not turn to poppy production to feed their families. We have \ntremendous agricultural resources in our country, as the occupant of \nthe chair knows. We can leverage these resources to help gain leverage \nfor international security in Afghanistan. I have written the U.S. \nSecretaries of State, Defense, and Agriculture to encourage their \ncooperation in developing a joint venture to put Afghan farmers back on \ntheir feet. I envision a corporate venture between State, USAID, the \nDefense Department, the Department of Agriculture, land grant colleges \nand universities, and private sector volunteers, working together to \nprovide Afghanis with viable forms of agriculture. This endeavor would \ncounter the significant drug problems in Afghanistan and destroy the \nincentive that many farmers face in deciding to grow poppy. Existing \ncounternarcotics funds in the Defense budget would be well spent in \nthis area by giving farmers a way out of drug production. I am more \nthan willing to encourage assistance from the colleges and universities \nin Missouri and to work legislatively with my colleagues on a \nproposal to move this initiative forward.\n\n  In Afghanistan, there is now enough security in many areas to put \nless of an\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\nemphasis on warfighting and more emphasis on the livelihoods of the \nAfghan people we are there to serve. This is one of the most effective \nways to invest in our national security for the future--making an \ninvestment in their infrastructure and assisting them to develop a \nviable economic means of earning a living, without turning to the \nproduction of poppy, which leads to the production of dangerous drugs.\n  Finally, I will address an issue of great frustration to me. Over the \npast year, there seems to have arisen in our national security \ncommunity an apparent absence of fear of punishment in regard to the \narbitrary and senseless divulging of our most secret and classified \nintelligence information. I am talking about individuals who have taken \nsolemn vows to protect our Nation, who are breaking these vows for \ntheir own particular purposes. In taking a vow to protect classified \ninformation, one must acknowledge that he or she will be privy to \ninformation that, if divulged, could be very harmful to their fellow \nAmericans. They acknowledge a solemn trust by the people of the United \nStates to protect classified information and thereby to protect their \nneighbors and themselves. I myself am under an obligation as a Senator, \nand particularly as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to \nprotect classified information. I believe the access I have to such \ninformation is a privilege and a solemn trust, and how I handle that \ninformation has repercussions.\n  For example, it has come to my attention from a variety of \nintelligence officials on the ground, on the front lines, who have told \nus that the leaks in the past year have adversely and significantly \naffected our intelligence operations and thus diminished our national \nsecurity. It is my view that we are much less safe in our homeland \nbecause of some of the actions we have taken, some by legislation, but \nprimarily by individuals disclosing information that has been \nclassified for good reason. Potential sources in the regions I have \nvisited are now refusing to speak with U.S. officers or to cooperate \nwith them for fear of their information leaking. They see some of our \nmost sensitive programs on the front pages of our newspapers and \nconclude that we are a nation that has no respect for classified \ninformation. As a result, we are less likely to get information we need \nbecause sources are rightfully fearful that disclosure of their \ninformation could lead to their identification and the assassination of \nthe sources themselves and probably their families.\n  Would you or I want to put our lives and the lives of our families in \nthe hands of a nation that we believed could not keep a secret? Of \ncourse not. Last month, the Arab news network al-Jazeera aired a tape \nby Osama bin Laden warning the U.S. of future terrorist attacks planned \nfor our Nation. On Monday of this week, his deputy, the infamous and \ndeadly Ayman al-Zawahiri, taunted President Bush on videotape for not \nkilling him at Damadola, a village in Pakistan--in the ungovernable and \nunreachable areas of Pakistan. These tapes demonstrate that the threat \nfrom al-Qaida is present and very real. From my personal visit to that \narea, I can tell you that that area of Pakistan, the tribal areas in \nwhich they operate, is truly a hostile environment to all foreigners, \nand not just to the United States, or British, or Australians, but to \nrepresentatives of the Pakistan Government. When we drove out toward \nthe tribal areas, we were faced with a sign that said ``foreigners not \nallowed.'' When we drove up to that checkpoint, five men with AK-47s \nstepped out in the road in front of us. I thought this was a good \nsignal to turn back.\n  We have a great difficulty in getting information on what is going on \nin that area. But leaks of our secrets and our top sensitive programs \nare killing one of our last lines of defense against pending terrorist \nattacks. I think any reasonable person would agree.\n  This is an election year. Some may be content to play politics with \nour national security. I am not one of them. I don't think the people \nof America appreciate that. For me, I will do all in my power to ensure \nthat we move forward in the work that needs to be done to strengthen \nour national security. I invite my colleagues, no matter their \npolitical persuasion, to join me in this endeavor. This, to me, is a \nvery significant challenge, a challenge from which we cannot retreat. \nWe must persevere and we must remedy the costs to our intelligence \ngathering that is so essential in a war against terror. We must help \ncountries develop strong economies and democratic structures, \nrecognizing human rights and civilian control of forces. This is a \nchallenge that is ours to keep and we must not slack from that effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Missouri \nfor his excellent comments. I join with him in talking about some of \nthe issues the President brought up with respect to the State of the \nUnion and, in particular, some of the issues confronting us overseas.\n  Before I do that, I congratulate the President for focusing like a \nlaser beam on the crucial issues we have to deal with on the domestic \nside--the issues of health care, doing something to curb health care \ncosts, improving the efficiency of the system through technology, \nexpanding access through both health savings accounts and tax credits \nto those health savings accounts to let more people who do not have \nemployer-provided health care purchase health insurance; his \ninitiatives on competitiveness and education, preparing all of our \nstudents, K-12 as well as in college, for the new technology jobs that \nwill be available; and an emphasis on improving the quality of \neducation through teacher training, as well as providing opportunities \nand incentives for folks who get into the areas of math and science--\nvery important initiatives.\n  Obviously, there was a lot of focus on energy. It has profound \nnational security implications, as the President laid out.\n  The President cited our addiction to oil and laid out a charge for us \nto reduce our dependency. It is a great aspirational goal for a \nPresident to lay out and charge all of us, on both sides of the aisle, \nto come forward with our best ideas to create more energy in the United \nStates using the great minds and the technologies being developed in \nour university communities and in our laboratories.\n  We are going to work very diligently on trying to address energy \nagain in this session of Congress, to build on what we did last year.\n  We bring up the tax bill, what I call the Tax Increase Prevention \nAct, which is to continue the presence of progrowth policies that have \nresulted in dramatically increasing revenues to the Federal Government \nbecause we have seen dramatic improvement in the health of the economy, \nmore jobs being created, stronger investment, more capital investment \nwhich has led to more capital gains taxes than otherwise anticipated. \nWe actually have seen an increase in capital gains taxes over what was \nanticipated prior to reduction. Here we reduced the rate and got more \nrevenue. It is something many of us here have been arguing for a long \ntime, and we see it borne out with the issue of capital gains.\n  Again, one of the hindrances of our economic system right now is \nlawsuit abuse and the horrific trauma some of these unscrupulous trial \nlawyers--there are a lot of good trial lawyers, but there are some \nunscrupulous ones, a small percentage, who are wreaking havoc on our \nsociety, which we will deal with after the Tax Increase Prevention Act, \nand also medical liability, frivolous lawsuits in a whole host of other \nareas, obesity lawsuits and the like. We need to get our arms around \nthat and have a much more rational system. The President called for \nthat.\n  Finally, there is the issue of fiscal responsibility, tighter \nspending. I think he is going to propose a very tough budget for next \nyear. It will be tough to get done, but I think many of us are looking \nforward to the kind of fiscal discipline we believe this country needs \nas we enter a period of time when the baby boomers are going to start \nto retire and the pressure on us is going to grow dramatically, \nexponentially.\n\n\n                 U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS' SUCCESS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the reason I have come to the Chamber to\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\nspeak is because I received a letter recently, which was passed on to \nme, from a soldier in Iraq. This was passed on to me by his parents. \nThis is not a letter he sent to me; he sent it to his parents and his \nfriends telling about his experience in Iraq.\n  The letter was written on December 15 of last year. His parents \nwanted me to see it to share their son's experience of what is going on \nand to juxtapose that with what some in this Chamber have been saying \nis going on in Iraq, as certainly many in the national media say. It \ndovetails nicely with what the President said last night and the \nadvances and the progress that are being made in Iraq. Instead of \nhearing my words, I will read what this fine soldier--this fine \nPennsylvania soldier--said to his friends in writing from Baghdad. It \nsays:\n\n       Friends, I apologize in advance for this mass email. I felt \n     I had to gather every email address I had and send a message. \n     . . . I am writing this from outside of Baghdad, and this is \n     how I see the war from my small corner. This is my opinion \n     only, and not the position of the U.S. Army or government (I \n     think I have to say it).\n       The bottom line is that I have witnessed enormous progress \n     in just my short four months in Iraq. We are on the right \n     path, and we must complete our mission here.\n       Democracy is Winning:\n       The election today was a great success with more voters and \n     less violence than anyone imaged. I sat in our operations \n     center watching reports come in. I think the biggest \n     emergency was getting a busload of students to the polls \n     despite the ban on driving (Iraqi police escorted them). \n     Building democracy is a slow process that must be \n     shepherded along the way, but clearly the majority of \n     Iraqis want to participate in a democratic process and \n     have a democratic government. This is evident all the way \n     from the neighborhood councils to these national \n     elections. The choice is between terrorism and democracy . \n     . . and 15 million chose democracy.\n       We are Defeating the Enemy:\n       Our battalions in our area have routed out much of our \n     enemy, forced them to ground, or forced them to flee. The \n     Marine and Army actions in the west have cut off new recruits \n     and supplies. If a bad guy does something, nine out of ten \n     times, he pays for it. The threat is shifting from terrorism \n     to one that is more criminal in nature, but make no mistake, \n     the insurgency is not over. This is driven by the casualties \n     we have taken in our unit, though they have been gratefully \n     few. The insurgency will continue even as Iraqis take over \n     the fight, and it may continue for years, but it is waning, \n     there is no doubt.\n       The Iraqi Army is Effective:\n       I can only speak for our area, but here the Iraqi Army \n     units are motivated and effective. We continue to turn over \n     more and more of the city to the Iraqi Army and they have \n     done well at continuing to defeat the insurgents. The Iraqi \n     Army and police successfully provided all of the security for \n     the elections in our area, with our units acting only as a \n     quick reaction force if required. We continue to partner U.S. \n     soldiers with Iraqi units and they continue to improve. It is \n     inevitable that they will be able to carry the full burden \n     securing their country in the near future.\n       Consequences:\n       The consequences of pulling out too early are enormous. It \n     would likely lead to a civil war and terrorist haven in Iraq, \n     possibly dragging the entire region into further turmoil. Al \n     Qaeda would be encouraged to continue to attack America, at \n     home and abroad. Staying to finish this fight, though more \n     soldiers will lose their lives, is a much smaller price to \n     pay. The benefits of creating a modest democracy in Iraq are \n     also enormous. The people of Iran, Syria, and Saudi Arabia \n     will witness the benefits of an open democracy and, \n     hopefully, pressure the governments to change. What was a \n     swelling of jobless, dissatisfied Arab young men, easily \n     recruited to the ideology of terror just a few years ago, \n     will soon have nonviolent outlets through democracy and an \n     economic future through open markets.\n       Negative Political and Media Comments are Damaging our \n     Efforts:\n       I want to make it unequivocally clear that political \n     comments about pulling out of Iraq or losing this war does \n     hurt soldier morale and absolutely gives hope and \n     encouragement to our enemies. The only way the terrorists can \n     win in Iraq is if the American people lose the will to finish \n     what we started and withdraw early. Now our battered enemies \n     have been given a sliver of hope by weak politicians, so they \n     will fight on and gain additional recruits. This political \n     mistake will cost more blood than any military error yet made \n     in this war. Of course the crime is worsened by an alarmist \n     media always willing to tell everyone the sky is falling. \n     Well, it is not. The great thing is that the support regular \n     American citizens show for their soldiers is overwhelming and \n     counters the negative political and media comments. Care-\n     packages, cards, e-mails, and letters are abundant, and send \n     a strong message to those of us in the fight.\n       There is a Plan:\n       And the plan is that we pull U.S. soldiers out as Iraqis \n     become strong enough to secure themselves. We are doing this \n     little by little, slowly withdrawing and turning security \n     over to the Iraqis. Slow and methodical is the key, not a \n     rushed abandonment of our allies and friends. A vacuum in the \n     wake of a rapid U.S. pullout would only be filled by chaos.\n       Like almost all soldiers here, I would like to go home. For \n     me it would be to see my young children and wife. However, in \n     the end I would prefer to stay until the job is done, or \n     return for a second tour. I say this because I recognize that \n     we are making progress, and that we will win . . . and I \n     recognize the cost of failure. I do not want my family to be \n     a target of terrorism in my homeland, nor do I want my son to \n     have to fight the war I should have finished.\n       Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope it helps \n     balance what you are hearing in the media.\n\n  This soldier wrote this letter on his own. No one called him or wrote \nhim or asked him to write this letter. He did it, obviously, because he \ncares a lot about his country, his family, and the future security of \nour country.\n  I can tell you that this is not an unusual letter I have received or \nan unusual comment I have been given by soldiers who have returned from \ntheir duty in Iraq. It is almost unanimous. The sentiments expressed in \nthis letter are the sentiments I hear, whether it is talking to folks \nback in Pennsylvania, talking to folks at Walter Reed or Bethesda. I \nhear it over and over--the optimism, the high morale, the sense of \naccomplishment, and the fact that we are, in fact, winning this \nconflict in Iraq.\n\n  I will tell you that I agree with him, that we are making progress, \nthat we have a plan, that democracy is winning, we are defeating the \ninsurgents, the Iraqi army is becoming more capable and effective each \nday, and, as he said, there are real consequences of losing, of \nwithdrawing before the job is finished, and that the defeatist rhetoric \nand the media bias do have an impact on our ability to accomplish this \ntask.\n  It is far too often in this country, now that we are 4\\1/2\\ years \nremoved from the events of 9/11, that we forget what happened there and \nwhat happened before; that we were not antagonizing our enemy, we were \nnot out there riling up the insurgency, we were not threatening \nterrorists around the world. We were ``minding our own business,'' and \nthey hit us and hit us hard.\n  My wife and part of my family watched the A special the other night \non flight 93. I encourage every American to watch that just to be \nreminded of, obviously, the incredible heroism of the members of that \nill-fated flight but also of what we are up against and what they are \nwilling to do to take down our way of life.\n  We have a job to do, and we need to finish it, and that includes we \nhave a job to do in the U.S. Congress. We have to pass the PATRIOT Act. \nIt is absolutely irresponsible for us to have every few months or few \nweeks the PATRIOT Act potentially not being extended, out there hanging \nover our law enforcement people. We need to improve the PATRIOT Act, \npass it, improve both civil liberties and our ability to protect \nourselves, and we need to do it now.\n  We also need to stand behind our President in his efforts to make \nsure we are intercepting communications between suspected al-Qaida \nterrorists and those who want to coordinate from places all over the \nworld.\n  I hear often in reference to the events of 9/11 that the critics of \nthe administration are saying they failed to connect the dots. I don't \nknow how many times I have heard that the President or the \nadministration or the intelligence community failed to connect the \ndots. And these very same people today want to erase the dots. They \ndon't even want us to have the dots to connect. They don't want us to \nget the intelligence so we can, in fact, proceed in having those dots a \nlittle closer together so we have an idea of in what direction they are \ngoing.\n  This is not a political folly of the President, to track down enemies \nof the administration and eavesdrop on them. This is a targeted program \nrun by professional people of suspected al-Qaida terrorists who are \ncommunicating overseas. I find it almost incredible that this has \nbecome a political football in this overtly and, I believe, extreme \npolitical environment we are in right now.\n  I am hopeful that the rhetoric will back off and that we will focus \nagain on what this soldier said. We have a mission to accomplish--to \nprotect\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\nAmerica and to secure our freedom in the future--and we need to do so \ntogether, in a bipartisan manner, without snipping at each other's \nheels trying to get political advantage. Simply support the mission \nthat is best for the long-term future of our security.\n  I have one final comment on the NSA program of trying to uncover \nterrorists who are potentially planning and plotting further \ndestruction in America.\n  It came from an op-ed that I read in the Wall Street Journal the \nother day, from the sister of Charles Burlingame. He was one of the \npilots on American Airlines flight 77. He was from my State. I had the \nopportunity to meet his wife and members of his family.\n  Debra Burlingame writes in the Wall Street Journal this week:\n\n       NBC News aired an ``exclusive'' story in 2004 that \n     dramatically recounted that how al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar, the \n     San Diego terrorists who would later hijack American Airlines \n     flight 77 and fly it into the Pentagon, received more than a \n     dozen calls from an al Qaeda ``switchboard'' inside Yemen \n     where al-Mihdhar's brother-in-law lived. The house received \n     calls from Osama Bin Laden and relayed them to operatives \n     around the world. Senior correspondent Lisa Myers told the \n     shocking story of how, ``the NSA had the actual phone number \n     in the United States that the switchboard was calling, but \n     didn't deploy that equipment, fearing it would be accused of \n     domestic spying.'' Back then, the NBC didn't describe it as \n     ``spying on Americans.'' Instead, it was called one of the \n     ``missed opportunities'' that could have saved 3,000 lives.\n\n  It is a classic case in point where people complained about \nconnecting the dots, but in this case we simply did not have the dots \nbecause we were afraid to go out and find the information we needed to \nprevent the loss of lives in America.\n  Don't hamper our ability to do that in the future. Quit playing \npolitics with the safety and security of the American public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on the majority \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 12\\1/2\\ minutes on the majority \nside\n\n\n                           Affordable Energy\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes this \nmorning to speak to the issue of affordable energy that the President \nraised last night in his State of the Union Address. He said that \nkeeping America competitive requires affordable energy. I think all of \nus across the country are certainly keying in to the terminology that \nhe used, ``affordable energy.''\n  Right now what we are seeing is causing us to choke a little bit at a \ntime when world oil prices are back up to nearly $68 a barrel for crude \noil. Yesterday, it was $67.95 for a barrel of crude oil. This is after \neven an unusually warm winter in the Northeast.\n  Gasoline prices nationally are averaging $2.34 a gallon. This is up \nnearly a quarter in the past several weeks, according to the Automobile \nClub of America. So when we are talking about energy supplies, it is \nthe prices that people in the United States are really focused on. It \nis not just when it comes to paying the price at the pump, it is also a \nvery heavy reminder to us as we receive our utility bills every month \nand as we look at the ever-increasing price of natural gas and what it \nis costing to heat our homes. The cost of home heating fuel in my State \nof Alaska is through the roof. We have families, we have whole \ncommunities that are struggling to make their payments, wondering how \ncold this winter is really going to be and what it is going to mean to \nthem in terms of the availability of fuel and their ability to pay. It \nmight be warm here, but it is the coldest January that interior Alaska \nhas seen in probably 30 or 35 years or so. The average temperature in \nFairbanks this past month has been--I think it was 22 degrees below \nzero, but that is just the average. So it is cold there. So when we \ntalk about the cost of home heating fuel and what it means to people, \nit really does hit home.\n  The President said last night that we must reduce our reliance on \nMiddle Eastern sources of oil. He is setting a goal for us to reduce \nthat reliance by 75 percent. He suggests the way we need to do it, the \nway we have to get there, is to utilize technology to promote new \nenergy sources and new efforts at energy efficiency. But, really, it \ncomes down to the technology.\n  As we all know, just last year we finally were successful in moving \nforward a comprehensive energy bill that promotes ethanol production, \npromotes hydrogen fuel cell development, promotes energy from biomass, \nocean currents, new generation of nuclear power--we took positive steps \nlast year through that bill. The President has clearly recognized that \nand is seeking to move forward on that agenda and improve on that. He \nspoke specifically to enhanced wind, solar, ethanol through saw grass. \nHe is looking to that technology that will reduce our reliance on \nforeign sources of oil.\n  He said, further, we must also change how we power our automobiles. \nThis is significant. It is important. We agree we must work toward this \nparticular goal. We must change how we power our automobiles. But we \nalso have to keep in mind that it is not just the automobiles that \nare using the oil that we consume as a nation. Think about how we get \nhere, through the airplanes, the aviation fuel, the diesel products, \nthe petrochemical products that we consume as a nation--whether it is \nBand-Aids or CDs or cosmetics. So much of what we utilize in our daily \nproducts is petroleum based.\n\n  While we must be honest and say we must figure out another way to \npower, to fuel our vehicles, we have to recognize that to a certain \nextent we will still need oil in our society. We will still need these \npetroleum-based products. We will still need aviation fuel for our \naircraft.\n  So how do we get to where the President wants to get, which is a \nreduced reliance on foreign sources? It is all about what we do \ndomestically. It is all about what we do with our innovation to provide \nfor additional resources domestically so we are not reliant on Middle \nEastern oil, we are not reliant on the OPEC countries. We have to do \nmore in a balanced way to use the new technology to increase the \ndomestic energy production from conventional sources. This means \nproducing more oil, more natural gas, and more coal from American land.\n  Last night, the President specifically mentioned coal and the use of \nzero-emissions coal. This is what we need to be doing, where we need to \nbe going. But when it comes to oil production, you have heard me on the \nfloor of the Senate, and Senator Stevens on the floor of the Senate, \ntalking about what the potential is up north in Alaska on a tiny \nportion of Alaska's coastal plain; the opportunity on the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge for additional sources of oil that could help \nAmerica reduce its reliance on foreign sources.\n  When the President talked about the key to America ending its \naddiction to oil, often imported from unstable parts of the world, it \nis through utilizing this new technology. He said: Go there. He might \njust as well have used ANWR. He didn't use it. All the newspaper \narticles this morning noted the fact that he didn't use that. But we \nhave already developed and continue to develop a host of new \ntechnologies that will permit oil development from the Arctic coastal \nplain without harm to the environment or the wildlife.\n  There was an energy conference in Anchorage just a couple of weeks \nago where the industry unveiled this new directional extended-reach \ndrilling. It is technology that will be tested this year. It should \npermit the oil deposits to be tapped from up to 8 to 10 miles away from \na well site, 8 to 10 miles away from that well site. This is almost \ndouble the 4 miles that drilling currently accesses oil at the nearby \nAlpine field up on the North Slope. So the technology is moving at an \nincredible rate.\n  Further improvements in extended-reach drilling--what this does is \nallows us to have less disruption on the surface. This means that \npotentially you are looking at almost a 100-square-mile area that is \ngoing to be absolutely undisturbed on the surface so animals can range \nfreely, undisturbed by drilling sites. A 100-mile area is a lot of \nroom, whether you are a caribou or muskoxen--or a lot of caribou. We \nhave also new three-dimensional and four-dimensional drilling \ntechnology that will identify small oil pools without the disturbance \nto wildlife that once was caused by the old seismic technology. We have \nnew equipment that allows oil wells to be drilled within a few feet of \none another, thus reducing\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\nthe size of the pads by as much as 88 percent. Compare this to what we \nare currently doing on the original Prudhoe Bay oilfield, which is \nabout 90 miles to the west. It is something worth seeing. I hope to \nhave the opportunity yet again this year to invite other Senators to \ncome up north to see for themselves what the technology means as far as \nreducing disturbance to the land, preventing pollution, and preventing \nany environmental degradation.\n  With this new technology--this is according to the latest estimates \nthat we received last year from the USGS--we can develop the nearly 10 \nbillion barrels of oil that we anticipate will be found on the coastal \nplain. When you look at the prices we are at now and you estimate $55 a \nbarrel, the opportunity for us as a nation to provide for America's \nneeds, and thus reduce reliance on foreign sources, is incredibly \nsignificant.\n  When we look at where we are receiving our oil from now, America \ntoday is importing 4.7 million barrels of oil a day from OPEC nations--\n1.47 million from Saudi Arabia, 1.43 million from Venezuela. These are \njust the names of the OPEC nations on which we are relying now. ANWR \nproduction--given the estimates I just cited from USGS, given the \nestimates I have of the prices--we estimate we would likely see 1 \nmillion barrels per day, potentially as much as 2 million barrels a \nday. This, again, is according to USGS estimates. This will \ndramatically reduce our dependence in the future on OPEC and should \nhelp to lower world oil prices.\n  We understand that the President is going to have more to say on \nseveral of the measures that he discussed last evening, including \nenergy and his proposal for the national security as well as economic \nsecurity when it comes to reliable, affordable energy. He understands \nour concerns and understands that in order to be a competitive nation \nin a global economy, we must have reliable, affordable energy; an \nenergy source that does not cause us to be vulnerable.\n  Some may think that ANWR was settled just a few weeks ago at the end \nof December when we missed by just several votes in the Senate from \nbreaking a filibuster on the issue. But I want to assure Senate Members \nthat the issue of ANWR is far too important for us as a nation to not \nbring forward again. For the good of this Nation we need a balanced \nenergy solution, one that both increases domestic production of \nconventional sources and that produces new energy from alternative \nsources and improves efficiency, improves energy conservation. It has \nto be all three. I will not stand before you and say it just is the \nproduction piece.\n  That is not a balanced approach. That is not the approach for the \nfuture. The approach for the future is to make sure we use our \ntechnology and our innovation to get us to the point where we have \nenergy independence. That ought to be a goal for us as a nation, energy \nindependence, and we can get that. But it does have to be a solution \nthat is comprehensive and balanced.\n  For the good of the Nation, we need to get moving forward quickly in \nutilizing our new technology to produce more energy from both ANWR and \nnew energy sources.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nif in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Rockefeller pertaining to \nthe introduction of S. 2231 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are back at taxes once again. What \nthe people of this country are going to be hearing in the debate for \nthe most part is very similar to what we discussed in this Chamber back \nin the second and third week of November of last year. Thinking of how \nto give a picture to this debate, I picked as a starting point the fact \nthat tomorrow is Groundhog Day. I think you see a portrait of \nPunxsutawney Phil, the famous groundhog. Tomorrow, is he going to see \nhis shadow? If he does, then we have 6 more weeks of winter. If he \ndoesn't, then spring is here. I guess that is the way it has been for \n100 years or maybe longer.\n  Punxsutawney is in Pennsylvania, and Phil is the name of the \ngroundhog. In thinking of Phil and his impending weather report, I also \nthought of a popular film entitled ``Groundhog Day,'' which starred \nBill Murray, in which a man relives the same day, Groundhog Day, over \nand over and over. This film has taken on greater significance for me \nas I seem to be in a similar situation. More than just a sense of deja \nvu, I feel I am reliving a past experience because starting this hour, \nwe are going to begin debate on a Senate tax reconciliation bill. Yet I \nseem to remember that we had this debate. I referred to these debates \nin the first words of my time when I said that we did this starting \nWednesday, November 16, 2005. That was at 3:35 Wednesday afternoon. We \ntook up S. 2020, the Tax Relief Act of 2005. I want to hold this up \nhere. This isn't just any little document we took up; it is a tax bill, \nexpiring provisions. Everything in this, when we were discussing this \non November 16, was reenacting provisions that sunset December 31, \n2005, so that there would not be an automatic tax increase on the \nAmerican people. We are in a situation that if we don't get this done \npretty soon and a year from now people are filing their taxes for 2006 \nand 2007, they are going to have big tax increases. One that is very \nobvious to everybody is the alternative minimum tax, which I will \ndiscuss in a minute. The alternative minimum tax is going to hit no \nfewer than 14 million people and maybe as many as 19 million people who \nwould not otherwise be paying the alternative minimum tax. All these \npeople would be basically middle-income Americans. The alternative \nminimum tax was meant to hit very wealthy people who took advantage of \nevery tax relief available or every tax loophole that was legally \navailable within the Tax Code and still didn't pay any taxes, that they \nought to pay some tax. So it was referred to as the alternative minimum \ntax so that everybody, regardless of how wealthy they might be or how \nhigh their income might be, paid a little something into the income tax \nfund for the privilege of living in America. That privilege is a \nconstitutional right, but everybody contributes something to it. That \nwas the theory behind it.\n  Well, that was not indexed. And since that wasn't indexed, we have to \nchange the Tax Code from time to time so it doesn't apply to more \npeople. Actually, the thing ought to be repealed because it is not \nserving the purpose it was intended to serve.\n  First of all, it was not meant to hit middle-income taxpayers. \nSecondly, a lot of people today, because they hire the right people to \ndo their income tax, have legally found ways of avoiding the \nalternative minimum tax. So it is not even hitting the people it was \nsupposed to hit. Yet it is hitting millions of people it was never \nintended to hit. How you keep tax policy like that on the books, I \ndon't know. I would like to repeal it. If I could get 51 votes to \nrepeal it, that would be my first amendment. But under the way we do \nthings in the Senate and the points of order that can be made, I am not \napt to get that sort of an approach. So what we do is, we kick the can \ndown the road.\n  I wish to get back to this history--deja vu--of seeing the shadow and \nthe Groundhog Day and all that stuff to give you the history of why the \nquestion is, Why are we going through this now on February 1 and 2, and \nit will probably carry over into next week, to February 4, 5, and 6? \nWhy are we going through this when we spent all that time back in \nNovember doing exactly the same thing?\n  The rules of the Senate provide the minority--or maybe I should say \nnot just the minority, every Member, but in this case it looks to me as \nif it is mostly the minority which is taking advantage of it--certain \nmotions that have to be given to get to conference to iron out the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate. In this case, the \nminority is going to take full advantage of that even if we redo all \nthe debate.\n  I will bet you can take speeches out of November 2005 and you will \nread the same speeches today and tomorrow and next Monday and Tuesday \nin the debate on this bill. If you take out\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\nspeeches of a month ago and can repeat them, there is no end to the \nspeech-making you can do in this body. We started this debate at 3:35 \non Wednesday, November 16, 2005. We took up this bill, S. 2020. As we \nwere considering this bill, we dealt with 80 different amendments. They \nwere filed. Maybe we didn't deal with 80, but at least there were 80 \nideas out there by people who wanted to change this bill. They were \nfiled. Now, seven of them were agreed to. It was a very lively debate. \nIt culminated in 18 rollcall votes about whether amendments ought to be \nincluded in the bill or whether there ought to be final passage. We \nfinally got to final passage at 12:05 a.m., Friday, November 18.\n  According to the Secretary of the Senate, at least 97 of us were \nthere at that midnight hour to vote on this bill, so I am not the only \none reliving this experience. There are going to be 97 Senators who \nwere there at midnight on November 18--or I guess you would say that \nFriday morning at 12:05 a.m. As we considered the Senate amendment to \nthe House version of this bill--the House version is the Tax Relief \nExtension Reconciliation Act of 2005--I have to ask myself--but in a \nsense, I am asking each of the Members--why are we still here? Didn't \nwe already go through this exercise? Are we not finished with the \nSenate debate?\n  I conclude that there is no rational reason for still being here \nbecause, normally, it would be a unanimous consent motion that we ought \nto go to conference to work out the differences between the House and \nSenate. Unless you do that, you never get anything to the President. It \nhas to pass both bodies in identical form. That is usually a pro forma \noperation here. We could have done that in 5 minutes--Senator Baucus \nand I--or the leaders could have done that, but we are still here \nbecause maybe people want to slow up the process. Maybe they don't want \nto get to the asbestos bill next week, which is very important to get \nto. The fact is, we already went through this exercise, and we ought to \nbe finished with the Senate debate, but we are not.\n  In the face of a multitude of other important issues this body needs \nto deal with, does the Democratic leadership really want to reenact \nrecent debates and resuscitate old talking points? Our tax \nreconciliation bill already passed, and not just by Republican votes \nbecause 64 of us voted for that, including 15 Democrats. The only way \nyou get anything done in the Senate, because of protection of minority \nrights, which the Constitution allows, is by bipartisanship; otherwise, \nnothing gets done. So we had bipartisanship on this bill.\n  While I believe this legislation is extremely important, and I will, \nas chairman of the committee and manager of the bill, debate it as long \nas is necessary, quite frankly, as I have indicated in my points, I \nquestion the necessity of going through a long process that resulted in \nthe bipartisan passage of the same bill just 2 months ago. So that is \nmy first point.\n  This is a very curious exercise. It is an exercise with no purpose, \nno apparent purpose other than simply delay. Is the delay on the part \nof the Democratic leadership important? The answer is yes. Ask the \nAmerican taxpayers, and you will get an answer. The answer is yes, if \nyou are one of almost 20 million families waiting for certainty that \nyou are not going to be caught up in the clutches of the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  We hear a lot about the AMT, the alternative minimum tax. You will \nhear about it in this debate over the next few hours. This bill does \nsomething about the AMT: it extends the hold-harmless provisions so \nthose 14 million, up to 19 million Americans won't get hit with it. I \nhave a chart here that will tell you exactly the number of people in \nthe respective States, based upon the previous year, 2003, so it \ndoesn't add up to the 14 million to 19 million people we think will be \nhit by 2006. But the number of people who will be hit by it in my State \nof Iowa is 65,813.\n  In the State of Nevada, even more people--68,273 people--are going to \nbe hit by it. Why would anybody from Nevada not want to do something \nyesterday rather than tomorrow about the alternative minimum tax? As I \nsaid, these numbers understate what this problem is today because there \nare going to be a lot more people getting hit by it.\n  The basis of the bill the Senate passed, and the bill that is once \nagain before us, is an extension of the alternative minimum tax hold-\nharmless provision. So every Member who is participating in this \ndeliberate strategy of delaying--delaying our entrance into the \nconference with the House of Representatives is delaying the certainty \nthese millions of American taxpayers deserve.\n  I emphasize the word ``certainty'' as far as the Tax Code is \nconcerned. There is nothing that does more economic good than knowing \nwhat the future holds in the way of taxes as it affects spending and \ninvestment. So if you want to improve the economy of this country, if \nyou want to keep this economy strong, certainty of tax policy is very \nimportant.\n  These are the facts on the AMT. Look it up in the Internal Revenue \nCode. The AMT relief provision expired already, on December 31, 2005. I \nask my friends in the Democratic leadership to take a look at the \ncalendar. One month now has passed, and the AMT hold-harmless provision \nhas not been extended. That is the cornerstone of this very massive \npiece of legislation. It also happens to be the cornerstone of a bill \nthe Democratic leadership is delaying. So I don't want to hear folks \ntalk about some sort of AMT problem and at the same time delay real \naction to help those millions of taxpaying families.\n  This bill goes way beyond helping people who would be hurt by the \nAMT. It also includes popular and broadly applicable tax benefits. I \nwish to talk about some of them and talk about them individually and \nuse charts as I move along.\n\n  For instance, the deductibility of college tuition is a very \nimportant part of that 2001 tax bill. This is a benefit for families \nsending their kids to college. By definition, this benefit is geared \ntoward helping middle-income families who always have a hard time \neducating their kids. They might not qualify for Pell grants or \nguaranteed student loans, yet they need help to send their kids to \ncollege because they are not millionaires. These are not high-income \npeople. They get the full benefit of the deduction if they make up to \n$65,000 as a single person and up to $130,000 as a couple. Beyond these \nlevels, the benefit phases out. A lot of these folks are paying \nsignificant Federal, State, and local taxes, and they get no help in \ndefraying the high costs of a college education for their kids. This \ntax deduction helps provide and helps these hard-pressed, middle-income \nfamilies with a benefit, and it furthers a very important national goal \nof supporting higher education--not an end in itself, but to keep \nAmerica competitive in the global economy.\n  This deduction runs out at the end of this year. It did run out \nDecember 31, 2005, but we have to be ahead of the curve as people plan \nto send their kids to college. Will this be around for 2007? Not unless \nthis bill passes. So these folks are going to face a tax increase \nwithout even a vote of the Congress. Automatically, taxes are going to \ngo up if we don't enact this piece of legislation which we already \npassed back in November.\n  Here I have a chart that shows for each Member how many families in \ntheir respective States are going to be hit next year if we don't enact \nthis legislation. Again, I will speak to my State of Iowa, where the \nnumber is 37,364 taxpayers. In Nevada, it is 25,776 taxpayers. Why \nwould anybody want Nevada taxpayers to pay more taxes? And why would \nyou not want them to know that today rather than tomorrow? Why not get \nthis bill to conference and get this issue behind us so that the \ntaxpayers in Nevada know that in the year 2007, their families are \ngoing to be able to take advantage of the college tuition exemption \nfrom the income tax? Once again, in that particular State, it is 25,000 \nfamilies.\n  There is another benefit that is addressed in this bill, S. 2020. It \nis called the small savers credit. Here I am talking about a tax credit \nfor low-income people to save through an IRA or a pension plan. We are \ntalking about people who don't know about saving or don't have the \nability to save, that we are going to give an incentive to save and can \nget an ethic for saving because saving for retirement is something not\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\nenough Americans have done and particularly not enough low-income \nAmericans have done. So as a matter of public policy, to encourage \nsavings for people who cannot afford to save or don't have the ethic to \nsave, give them an incentive to save through the small savers credit. \nWe all think that savings is important. We all want low-income people \nto save for retirement.\n  I have a chart that shows the number of low-income savers who benefit \nin this bill on a State-by-State basis, which benefit won't be there if \nwe don't pass this, or it is being delayed by 4 or 5 days because we \nhave to go through the same debate we went through back in November.\n  Again, in my State of Iowa, there are 95,000 people who could take \nadvantage of this small saver's credit but who will not be able to.\n  Let's take another State, Nevada. There are 36,923 people who are low \nincome who will not be able to take advantage of this provision.\n  Again, if you want to establish an ethic for saving, you should not \npass tax policy to encourage that ethic for saving and then sunset it \nand expect people to establish a lifelong pattern of saving. You cannot \nstop and start tax policy and expect people to develop an ethic to \nconform to saving, and I believe we all think the ethic of saving is \nvery important.\n  The bill before us will also extend a tax deduction for teachers who \nbuy their own supplies for their students. I think this provision was \ndeveloped in the 2002 tax bill by Senators Warner and Collins to give \nteachers who go that extra mile by paying out-of-pocket expenses some \nhelp through the Tax Code.\n  Who is going to argue with that? One might argue that we ought to pay \nteachers more, so they don't have to do that. We ought to appropriate \nmore money for schools so they don't have to buy the supplies out of \ntheir pockets. But we have 40,000 school districts in the country, and \nwe are not going to be able to make policy here for every school \ndistrict. We know that some teachers are so devoted to their students \nthat they are going to spend some of this money out of their pockets, \nso Senators Collins and Warner came up with this idea of a tax credit \nfor teachers who pay for supplies out of pocket.\n  Again, on a State-by-State basis, I have a chart that shows how many \nteachers benefit from this provision. I will pick out Nevada again. \nNevada has 21,853 teachers who took advantage of this provision. In \nIowa, we had 33,812 teachers take advantage of this provision. Why \nwouldn't you want teachers who devote a life to a profession at \nrelatively low pay--compared to what other people with the same amount \nof education get in other segments in the economy--because they are \ndevoted to doing good or they wouldn't be teaching in the first place--\nwhy would you want to question this so they won't have it this year?\n  Right now those teachers are buying supplies and probably don't think \nthe least bit that Congress would have sunsetted this legislation on \nDecember 31, 2005. So they are going out and buying all these supplies \nthinking they are getting a deduction, and then when they file their \nincome tax a year from now, they are going to be surprised.\n  I wish I could tell every one of them that the Democratic leadership \nwon't let us go to conference so we can keep that provision. I am not \ngoing to be able to tell all 33,000 teachers in Iowa. They are going to \nfind it out the rude way when they go to file their income tax. I would \nreally like to tell the teachers in Nevada about this as well.\n  We don't have to have this problem. All we have to do is get to \nconference. We can get to conference in 5 minutes and work these \nprovisions out, and by next week, we can have this bill to the \nPresident of the United States, or give us another week to work out the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate. We can get this all \nworked out, get the bill to the President, and we don't have to worry \nabout that.\n  There is another point. We all think of small business. There are \nsmall business provisions in this bill, S. 2020, that passed the Senate \nby a bipartisan vote at the midnight hour way back in November, and \nhere we are piddling around with procedural motions to get to \nconference.\n  Everybody advocates small business because it creates 70 to 80 \npercent of the new jobs in America. This bill would extend the small \nbusiness expensing. Many small businesses use this benefit to buy \nequipment on an efficient aftertax basis. It is good for small \nbusiness, it is good for small business workers, and it is good for \neconomic growth.\n  I have a chart on a very important issue, at least to the people of \nAlaska, Florida--and Nevada, again, is going to benefit--South Dakota, \nTennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. This is because we \nestablished in the tax bill the deductibility of State and local taxes. \nThis bill will help 12.3 million taxpayers in these States--Alaska, \nFlorida, Nevada, Washington, Texas, South Dakota, Tennessee, and \nWyoming. Tennessee is involved. It is the home of our distinguished \nleader. Senator Frist has worked very hard to get this bill to the \nfloor, and for the second time. He is frustrated because we can't move \nthis along.\n  Nevada is one of these States. It is the home of my friend, the \nDemocratic leader. Unfortunately, the Democratic leader has fought this \nbill tooth and nail, even though his constituents benefit from it, \nparticularly in this instance with the deductibility of State and local \ntaxes.\n  I ask them to focus on the taxpayers of their respective States, \nwhether they are from Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, \nTexas, Washington, or Wyoming, to get this bill passed so their \ntaxpayers will know their local and State sales taxes can be deducted. \nI hold out hope that the Democratic leadership will see the light. I \nhope they will work with me to see their folks in their State will be \nable to deduct these State and local taxes this year and know they can \ndo it very soon this year.\n  These provisions are bipartisan and millions of American taxpayers \nrely on them. Every Senator ought to help us pass this bill for these \nprovisions alone.\n  The bill before us addresses expiring business and individual \nprovisions that I have not talked about yet, what we call extenders. \nThese provisions include research and development tax credits and the \nwork opportunity tax credit, just to mention a couple.\n  This bill also includes many of the charitable incentives that were \nintroduced in what we refer to as the CARE Act and which have \npreviously passed the Finance Committee and previously passed the \nSenate. I appreciate the work of Senator Santorum and Senator Baucus in \nworking with me to balance these incentives with several of the much \nneeded reforms that are supported by the charitable sector, the \nTreasury Department, the IRS, the donors, and the taxpayers to make \nsure charitable giving and the tax exemption for it serves the purpose \nintended and that charitable organizations use the money that was \ndonated to them for the purpose they asked for it.\n\n  Beyond the CARE Act, this bill contains loophole closures and tax \nshelter fighting provisions that raise revenue.\n  This bill is bipartisan. I have not thanked my friend and ranking \nmember, Senator Baucus, for his cooperation. We had cooperation going \nway back when we first started working on this bill in the summer of \nlast year so we could be ahead of the curve. He and I, when we first \nstarted, were not partners, but we teamed up in the Finance Committee. \nWe teamed up in the first Groundhog Day floor debate and, as always, \nhis cooperation and, more important with something as serious as this, \nhis good humor makes a difference.\n  I thank those Democratic Senators, and that is 13 others besides \nSenator Baucus, who joined me in a bipartisan effort on our first floor \njourney. I ask them to help me persuade their leaders to let this bill \nproceed. I ask them to ask their leaders to focus on taking care of the \nlegislative business and put a damper on the political games that \nappear to me to be nothing but going through what we went through last \nNovember. We waste enough taxpayer money. There is no point wasting it \nagain, duplicating the debate of 3 days back in November.\n  We can move on to other important items, including a lot of items the \nDemocrats want us to bring up on the floor of the Senate. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last evening at 8:30, the Senate assembled \nas a body to proceed to the House\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\nChamber to sit together as one Congress. We did so because every year \nabout this time, we meet to hear the President deliver his State of the \nUnion Address. We also meet together in the House--all Members of the \nSenate and Members of the House of Representatives--for an address to \nthe Congress, for example, by a foreign leader. We did so for the \naddress last July by the Prime Minister of India. But it is the \nexception rather than the rule when the House and Senate sit together.\n  Our country's Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, created a bicameral \nlegislative branch; that is, the House and Senate separately. Carrying \ninto practice the ideas of Montesquieu and Madison, our Constitution \ncreates a very separate House of Representatives and Senate, two \ntotally, entirely different bodies.\n  Oftentimes when confronted with the same task, the House and the \nSenate come to very different solutions. That is certainly the case \nwith the bill before us today, the tax reconciliation bill.\n  We have something called a budget resolution which we take up every \nyear. That resolution gave the House and the Senate the same task. On \nApril 28 of last year, the Congress adopted that resolution, and the \nconference report was adopted by a narrow margin of 52 votes. That \nbudget resolution instructed both the House Ways and Means Committee \nand the Senate Finance Committee to report legislation that would cut \ntaxes by a net of $70 billion.\n  Underlying that budget resolution was the assumption that the two \ncommittees--the Ways and Means Committee in the House and the Finance \nCommittee in the Senate--could cut taxes on capital gains, cut taxes on \ndividends, prevent tax increases by virtue of the alternative minimum \ntax, otherwise known as the AMT, and extend a series of expiring tax \nprovisions.\n  The chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee and the Finance \nCommittee each set out to do those things, and each of those able \nchairmen found that it was not easy to assemble the votes to do all of \nthose things. Faced with that reality, faced with that task, the House \nand the Senate came to very different solutions.\n  The Senate is a place where Members often work together across party \nlines. The Senate is a place that often requires a supermajority, which \nhelps encourage Senators to work together. Chairman Grassley, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, often works with me, the senior \nDemocrat. We meet together every Tuesday the Senate is in session, and \nI might say, those Tuesday meetings are terrific. We get an awful lot \ndone at those weekly meetings. It is essentially bipartisan, working \ntogether to get solutions.\n  Last year, Chairman Grassley worked together with many Democrats and \nproduced the Senate's version of the reconciliation bill. The Senate \nreconciliation bill included continued alternative minimum tax \nrelief. The Senate bill included extensions of expiring tax provisions. \nThe Senate bill, however, did not include capital gains and dividends \ntax cuts. And the Senate included offsets--that is some increases, \nbasically the so-called loophole closers--to pay for some of the bill.\n\n  In keeping with the traditions of the Senate, that was also a \nconsensus solution, because in November of last year the Senate passed \na bill with 64 votes.\n  Contrast that with the House of Representatives, which took a \ndifferent path. The House is a body where the majority rules. There is \nno requirement of supermajority. And often the majority rules \nabsolutely. It is often a place where the slimmest of majorities rules. \nSome on the House side of the Capitol, I believe, too conveniently and \ninappropriately believe any votes more than needed for a majority are \nwasted votes. That is a mistake. But that is the House. That is their \ndecision.\n  When the House considered this tax bill that is under the same \ninstructions the Senate considered it, the House did something \ndifferent. It did include capital gains and dividend tax cuts. The \nHouse did not, however, include AMT relief as contained in the Senate \nbill. And the House bill did not include any offsets to pay for any of \nthe bill for them.\n  In keeping with the House traditions, that was a partisan solution. \nIn December of last year, the House passed that bill with 234 votes, 16 \nmore than the 218 needed to pass the bill.\n  Confronted with the very same task, the House and Senate came to very \ndifferent solutions. At the heart of this debate today is the \ndifference between alternative minimum tax protection for working \nfamilies and capital gains tax cuts for investors.\n  What is AMT, alternative minimum tax? For 17 million American \nfamilies the year 2006 came in with an unwelcome surprise; that is, a \nstealth tax, a new tax, an additional tax called AMT. The temporary \nprotection from the AMT expired on December 31 of last year. That means \n17 million more American families will be subject to this additional \ntax in the tax year 2006. That is an increase from 3 million people to \n20 million people in 1 year alone. Three million last year paid it. \nThis next year, if Congress does not act, 20 million Americans will be \npaying the additional AMT stealth tax.\n  Many families will not see this higher tax bill until later this year \nor next April. But saying, Don't worry, we will fix it, probably will \nnot reassure those families when they hear there is nothing--that is \nright, nothing--in the House bill to fix the alternative minimum tax; \nthat is prevent that tax from going into effect. The House tax \nreconciliation bill before us today chooses to extend capital gains and \ndividends cuts. However, those tax cuts do not expire until January \n2009. AMT protection expired 3 weeks ago. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to reject the House solution and insist on the Senate \nversion, remembering we have an enforcer here, a limitation of $70 \nbillion. We cannot lower taxes in the net, the aggregate, more than $70 \nbillion, so it is almost impossible to do all the provisions lowering \ntaxes so many Members have in mind. We have to choose.\n  I think the better choice is to prevent the tax going into effect \nnext year rather than worrying about a tax increase that may go into \neffect in the year 2009. We do not have the luxury to do it all right \nnow, today.\n  The House proposal says the extension of capital gains and dividends \ntax cuts is a priority over AMT. If that House proposal fails, then \ntaxpayers will have reason to worry. If Congress does not extend the \nalternative minimum tax protection, then the AMT will hit a family with \nthree children earning $63,000 this year. The AMT is a family-\nunfriendly tax and the AMT creeps deeper and deeper into the middle \nclass each year. Protection from the AMT should be a priority for all \nin both Houses of Congress, and especially for the American people.\n  Instead, however, the House has passed a separate AMT bill that is \noutside the context of the budget resolution. That bill does not have \nthe procedural protections of this reconciliation bill. This other \nHouse bill purports to protect families from the AMT, but under that \nother House bill there would still be 600,000 additional taxpayers \npaying higher taxes next year due to this stealth AMT tax.\n  Some called the House AMT tax a hold-harmless provision, but that \nprovision does not hold everyone harmless. Under existing tax law, 3.6 \nmillion American taxpayers paid this alternative minimum tax in 2005. \nUnder the House bill, 4.2 million taxpayers would pay the alternative \nminimum tax in 2006, an increase of 600,000 taxpayers and an increase I \nhope we can avoid. The House gave alternative minimum tax relief \nsecond-class status--not first-class status, second class, although it \nexpired last year. Not only that, the House bill pokes a hole in the \npatch. Instead, this House bill allocates $50 billion over the next 10 \nyears in order to extend for 2 years the capital gains and dividends \ntax cuts--again reminding all present, Senators especially, that need \nnot be done because the current provision with respect to dividends and \ncapital gains, that is the provision that was in effect last year, is \nalso in effect next year and the next year up until, as I mentioned, \nJanuary 1, 2009.\n  In summary, I think it makes sense for us to reject the House \nsolution. Let us remember what our priorities are, especially the \npriorities of the American people, given the limitations we have in the \nbudget reconciliation instructions, and let us protect the millions of \nworking families now subject\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\nto a tax increase courtesy of the alternative minimum tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I don't believe there \nis any order of speaking rather than the normal trying to rotate back \nand forth, so I wish to make a few brief remarks now.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sounds good.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Grassley for his speech \nthis morning. I thought it was extraordinarily good. I thought there \nwas a little bit too much emphasis on Iowa--we need a little more \nmention of Mississippi in the process--but it was very good. My \ncolleague touched on every important issue I had actually thought I \nmight mention, but I will not belabor those points. He made it very \nclear that this is tax legislation that has broad support: 64 Senators \nvoted for it back in December and there were at least 2 who missed it \nwho would have supported it, so 66 at least are for this. This is a \nclassic case where there are some people, I guess, who are opposed to \nmoving on to conference because of something they think may be in \nconference or some other things which I suspect, which I will talk \nabout in a moment. But there has been good leadership. It is time to \nget into conference.\n  I thank Senator Grassley's partner and helpmate on most legislation, \nSenator Max Baucus, for what he has had to say and for the support he \nhas given on good tax policy over the years. They are examples of what \ncan happen in this institution, how we can work together across the \naisle, in committees, as individuals. I commend them both for their \nposition on these issues.\n  Of course, you can go through every bill and find some piece or some \nportion or some section you don't necessarily agree with or would like \nto have more or all kinds of arguments. But this one is amazing to me. \nI will talk a little bit about the substance in a moment, but I want to \ntalk about what is happening here.\n  Some people have said to me, Why are we doing this? Have we done this \nin the past? Have we had extended debate and the opportunity for 20 \nhours of time and a vote-arama at the end and amendments ongoing to \nconfront? No, we have not. This is unusual.\n  Why are we in this position? This is a case where the Senate got sort \nof--we didn't want to wait forever on the House. We moved first. \nBecause of the way it was taken up, procedurally, we now have to go \nthrough this extra motion to take up the House bill and all of that. I \ndon't want to get into the details because it is irrelevant, but I will \nmake this point: This is an administrative proceeding. This is a \nquestion dealing with the fact the Senate acted before the House and \nusually the House acts first on a tax bill. Maybe we should not do \nthat. Yet we get criticized quite often because the House is waiting on \nus. This is a case where we were waiting on the House. We passed good \nlegislation, with broad support. We should go to this conference. We \nshould have done it earlier today. This is a voice-vote thing. There \nshould not be any debate.\n  So what is happening here? I think it is sort of the sign of the \ntimes. We just went through the Supreme Court confirmation of Sam \nAlito. A lot of us scratched our heads and said, How did it come to \nthis? How low do we go? When do we stop the partisanship?\n  Some people look at us and say, Why is this? Here is an example. \nThere is no call for this. When are we going to end the tit for tat, \nand I will get you here or I got you there, delaying the process? \nObstructionism--I don't get it. Why we do not have an agreement of how \nto deal with this now is beyond me. Why our leadership--I am not \ncriticizing either one of them. There is just the fact that there has \nnot been an agreement to do it by voice vote, no agreement to limit the \ntime or agreement to limit the amendments--no agreement.\n  Here we are, on an administrative proceeding to go to conference on a \nvery important tax package, action if we do not take will cause \npeople's taxes to be raised.\n  We need to stop. We need to work out an agreement how this is going \nto proceed. We should be through this by sundown tonight. But, no, what \nis going to happen is we are now headed--we are going to be on this \nnext week. Some people say we ought to be doing this, we ought to be \ndoing that, why aren't we debating--whatever--because we are messing \naround like this.\n  As a Republican and in support of the bill, my attitude is, fine; \nthrow me in the briar patch. I love to talk about this. This is a \npositive agenda. This will help the economy. This will help the \nfamilies with children. This will help my State. This will help most \nSenators' States. Why don't we just do it? If we want to talk about it, \nwe can do that. But I urge both sides of the aisle, find a way to get \nan agreement on how to do this.\n  What is going on here beneath the surface is two or three things. It \nis kind of a general anger right now, unfortunately, between both \nsides. We need to get over that. But, also, there is a plan, I am sure, \nto offer other agenda items, nongermane, ``gotcha'' kind of amendments. \nThat is what is going to happen. I don't like that. I think it \ncontributes to the bad atmosphere around here. But I am a realist. We \ncan deal with that. Tell us what the amendments are and identify a \nlimited number and let's get it on, let's have a vote, and let's be \ndone with it.\n  We can't even get that done. That is what is going to happen. We are \ngoing to have ``gotcha'' amendments on a whole variety of subjects. I \ndon't want to talk about them right now because I maybe know what they \nare going to be and maybe I should not know, but that is OK. If you \nwant to have a debate on some nonrelevant amendment coming out of the \nstratosphere to put people on the spot, OK, but let's at least agree to \nhow we get that done.\n  There is another reason behind this. There are some people who fear \nthat, in conference, we might eventually also include something to do \nwith holding down capital gains rates--capital gains taxes and dividend \ntaxes. I hope so. I certainly hope we will do that because it is \nimportant to individuals, it is important for the economy. But it is \nnot in this bill. This is another case where we are having a huge \nargument over what is not in a bill. This is a classic example of why \nthe atmosphere here is so bad. I hope we will find a way to do it. We \nshould all assume some of the blame. We ought to all root around and \nsay to each other, ``Can we work this out? Can we find a way to kind of \nget through this process?'' Let's do it and get on to the next subject. \nI know the next bill we go to is going to cause a fracas--and probably \nit should.\n  Asbestos reform? I have been trying to figure a way to do asbestos \nreform for 20 years and haven't been able to do it. We have not been \nable to do it.\n\n  Do we need it? Yes.\n  Is the bill which the judiciary reported out a perfect solution? I am \nnot saying it doesn't have some good benefit. I know the committee has \nworked hard on it, and I know Arlen Specter has worked hard on it. But \nit is tough. We should at least do that.\n  If we are going to be attacked by the Democrats, that would be a good \nplace to do it. It will be a bipartisan fight, I am sure.\n  I don't understand. I wish we could get over it.\n  This is good legislation. It has been coming for a long time. It is \nready for conference. The conference probably won't be that \nacrimonious, and it probably won't take that long. I hope and expect \nthat it will be bipartisan. It probably will be.\n  But this procedural, dilatory action which will drag us out for the \nrest of this week and into next week probably is holding up a number of \nimportant issues.\n  Do the Democrats really oppose the centerpiece of the bill? The \nbiggest chunk of it--$30 billion--is for ensuring the AMT doesn't hit \nmore than 9 million middle-income families this year. Do they oppose \nthat?\n  Do Democrats oppose the research and development tax credit, a 1-year \nextension which costs nearly $10 billion?\n  Do they oppose small business expensing?\n  We all stand here on the floor of the Senate and praise the small \nbusinesses in this country as to how important they are to the economy \nand the jobs they create. They do. It is true. Why wouldn't we want to \nextend small business spending? Why would we want that to end? It will, \nif we don't act.\n  Do Democrats oppose the work opportunity tax credit?\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\n  Do they oppose extending the welfare-to-work tax credit?\n  Do they oppose allowing above-the-line for teacher classroom \nexpenses?\n  Do they oppose the provisions in here that would be beneficial to \nStates which do not have a sales tax, such as Nevada and Florida?\n  The answer is no, they don't oppose those things. They are for them. \nAn overwhelming majority support 98 percent of what is in this bill. \nYet we are going to ding round here the rest of this week, and we are \ngoing to even have to go through an extra motion of sending it back to \nthe House, and having the House kick it back over here. I think we \nshould not be proceeding in this way.\n  I also want to make it clear that I think it is very important for us \nto take another look at what is in the House version in conference \nwhich would support the progrowth policy of tax and capital gains and \ndividends at 15 percent or at 5 percent for individuals in the 10- or \n15-percent tax brackets.\n  I am disappointed that we don't have a 2-year extension in this bill. \nI believe if we did that it would spur and encourage economic growth \nand would bring in more revenue to the Treasury.\n  The CBO has indicated that the capital gains and dividends tax relief \npolicies generated an additional unanticipated $26 billion into the \nTreasury.\n  This is not what has caused the deficit. The deficit is caused by us \nspending more money. A lot of it is justified. We have the war in \nAfghanistan, the war in Iraq, the war on terror. I have been here \npleading with my colleagues to help those of us in the Katrina area. It \ncosts lots of money; both of them hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  But we also have not been able to check our appetite for spending. \nThere is no offsetting reduction in spending.\n  If we don't have these progrowth tax incentives, we will have a worse \ndeficit because the revenue they generate will not come in.\n  I don't want to mislead anybody. I am absolutely hoping that I will \nbe a conferee, and I will be pushing for holding down these capital \ngains and dividend rates.\n  We need to look at what is happening in the economy. What is \nhappening is good. It is not perfect. But we need to think about ways \nto continue the growth we have seen and create the jobs. Millions of \njobs have been created in the last 3 years. Unemployment is 4.9 \npercent. The gross domestic product growth is strong. Household wealth \nis at an all-time high, reaching $51.1 trillion in 2005. Seventy \npercent of Americans now own their homes. The American dream is \nbecoming a reality. Income is rising. Inflation remains in check. There \nis a lot to be proud of. But that is not good enough.\n  We need to look at where the problems exist and at how we can provide \nincentives for growth and create better paying jobs and to pay \nattention to people's retirement needs and their health care needs. \nThere is a lot we need to do.\n  I wish we could find a way to agree more on how we can move \nlegislation in this body--not how we can drag it out or get the drop on \neach other.\n  I remember when I used to talk to Tom Daschle when we were in \nleadership positions. We would get tangled up in arguments--heated \nones. And I used to fill up the tree every now and then where \namendments could not be offered, which he didn't appreciate, and he \nsaid as much. But many times we would come together and say in the end: \nGood politics means good policy. If you do things that help the people, \neverybody benefits--Democrats and Republicans.\n\n  Do we need to do something about the delivery of health care in \nAmerica and the accessibility and affordability of it? Yes.\n  Do we need to find a way to deal with border security and all of the \nramifications of immigration? Absolutely.\n  Do we need to find more ways and better ways to deal with the future \nenergy needs of this country? Yes.\n  Would it be good if we could find reform on asbestos that would \nactually help the people who are truly injured and not have all the \nmoney go to my friends in the plaintiffs' bar? Yes. We ought to do \nthat. We ought to find a way to do it in a bipartisan way.\n  I plead again with the leadership of the Democratic side. Let us get \nan agreement on how to finish this. Let us not have a shootout when it \nis not even necessary on this bill. There will be plenty of time for a \nshootout. In fact, let us arrange a time. OK, at 12 noon we are going \nto meet at the OK Corral next Tuesday and get it over with--but not on \nthis bill.\n  Can we do a few things together before we fight like cats and dogs \nbecause it is an election year? We ought to find a way to do that.\n  But if we are not going to get an agreement, I will say repeatedly, \nas long as we are on this bill, this is our territory. I am glad to \ntalk the rest of this year about going to conference on tax relief for \nworking Americans, for teachers, for families with children. \nHallelujah. I would just as soon let us stay on this for the rest of \nthis month. I will be a happy camper. Politically, I don't know who is \nwinning. Maybe we are. That suits me fine, too. I have my speech ready \nto talk about the substance over and over again. We can do that. But we \nalso can go to conference and get this work done, and then we could go \non to the next issue.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for this time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I must say it is delightful to listen to \nthe Senator from Mississippi. I wish sometimes he could come to the \nfloor more often. He makes a good point, that we have to work together. \nAnd we all know that we try hard to work together. At the same time, \nSenators have the right to offer amendments. We will work together the \nvery best we can.\n  I want to say how much I appreciate the comments he made and how much \nI appreciate the addition he is making to the discussion.\n  As I noted in my opening statement, one of the weightiest differences \nbetween the underlying House bill and the pending Senate substitute \nbefore us is that the House bill includes capital gains and dividend \ntax cuts. The Senate didn't include them. The Senate chose instead to \nfavor AMT protection for working families. We couldn't do both. The \nSenate chose to apply the AMT relief.\n  There are several reasons the Senate did not include the capital \ngains and dividend tax cuts. One among the many good reasons is that \nthe Senate's rules make them hard to include.\n  In a moment, I will propound a series of parliamentary inquiries to \nthe Presiding Officer on this point. But let me first take a moment to \nexplain.\n  The Senate's Byrd rule--actually, we know there are several Byrd \nrules--section 313 of the Congressional Budget Act contains what a \nreconciliation bill can include. The rule is named after the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. Senator Byrd and those \nwho joined him in writing the Byrd rule recognized that the budget \nreconciliation process is a powerful engine. And the Byrd rule keeps \nreconciliation bills more on the purpose for which they were intended.\n  One subparagraph of the Byrd rule deals with the worsening deficit in \nthe outyears; that is, years beyond the budget resolution. Section \n313(b)(1)(E) of the Budget Act says that a provision is out of order if \nthe title that includes it would worsen the deficit for any future \nfiscal year after the fiscal years covered by the reconciliation bill. \nThe provision was designed to prohibit legislation that would make our \ndeficit problem worse by hiding the costs in the future.\n  The capital gains provision in the House bill is one such provision. \nThe dividend provision in the House bill is another. The capital gains \nprovision in the House bill would worsen the deficit by close to $13 \nbillion in fiscal year 2012 alone. This is because lower capital gains \ntax rates in the short run will induce holders of property to sell \ntheir assets earlier than they otherwise would have. As a result, the \nU.S. Treasury may realize some increased revenues in the short run as \nproperty holders pay capital gains on those sales. But the Treasury \nwill lose revenue in the long run because the property holders will not \nsell that asset at the later time which they otherwise would have sold \nthe asset. And the Treasury will also lose revenue in the long run \nbecause the Government will tax capital gains at a lower rate.\n  A similar phenomenon takes place with dividend tax cuts. The dividend\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\ntax cuts in the House tax bill would worsen the deficit by more than $9 \nbillion in 2011 alone.\n  I have been citing numbers provided by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full table setting forth the Joint \nCommittee's estimated revenue effects of the House bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S399]]\n\n\n\n                                   ESTIMATED REVENUE EFFECTS OF H.R. 4297, THE TAX RELIEF EXTENSION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2005, AS REPORTED BY THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS--FISCAL YEARS 2006-2015\n                                                                                                          [Millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Provision                              Effective                2006         2007         2008         2009         2010         2011         2012         2013         2014         2015       2006-10      2006-15\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI.

Section 312(a) of the \nBudget Act provides in relevant part that ``the levels of . . . \nrevenues for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis of \nestimates made by the Committee on the Budget . . . the Senate, as \napplicable.''\n  In practice, this means that the Presiding Officer will turn to the \nchair of the Budget Committee for projections of dollars and cents \neffects of the legislation. In practice, the chair of the Budget \nCommittee tends to rely on the Joint Committee on Taxation for revenue \nestimates.\n  I have let the chairman of the Budget Committee know that I was going \nto propound this inquiry. I believe the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee concurs that the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that I \nhave just cited are authoritative.\n  I have a series of parliamentary inquiries. Is it not true that by \nvirtue of section 313(b)(1)(E) of the Budget Act, section 313(b)(1)(E) \nof the act--part of the Byrd rule--applies to conference reports?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, if the conference committee on the \nlegislation before us today were to return a conference report that \nincluded the capital gains and dividends tax cut provisions in the \nunderlying House bill before us today, is it not true that a point of \norder would lie under section 313(b)(1)(E) of the Budget Act against \nboth of those provisions?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is again correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, if a Senator raised that point of order \nagainst the provisions just cited, and the Presiding Officer sustained \nthe point of order, is it not true that the offending provisions would \nbe deemed stricken from the conference report and the Senate would then \nhave before it an amendment between the Houses consisting of the rest \nof the conference report not so stricken?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, is it not true that a motion to waive a \npoint of order raised under that section of the Budget Act or an appeal \nof the ruling of the Chair under that section would require the \naffirmative vote of 60 Senators to succeed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I believe this set of inquiries has established an important point. \nThe capital gains and dividend provisions in the House bill worsen the \ndeficit in the outyears. The conference committee thus must remove \nthose provisions from the bill, pay for them in the outyears, or plan \nfor needing 60 votes to waive the violation of the Budget Act. Those \nare the alternatives.\n  I might note that in the waning days of the last session, the Senate \ndemonstrated that it is capable of employing the Byrd rule against \nreconciliation conference reports. For example, Senator Conrad raised a \npoint of order under the Byrd rule against several provisions in the \nspending reconciliation bill, and the Presiding Officer sustained the \npoints of order under the Byrd rule. That is why the House of \nRepresentatives, this very day, in 2 or 3 hours, is voting on that \nspending reconciliation bill again.\n\n  So there are good reasons for the conference committee on this bill \nnot to include the capital gains and dividend tax cuts the House bill \nincludes. One of those good reasons is the Senate rules.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nreviewing for our colleagues the rules that relate to points of order, \npoints of order that may lie because of Byrd rule violations with \nrespect to this legislation. It is critically important we do this \nwithin the rules.\n  I commend the ranking member and the chairman for putting together an \nexcellent package. I have other business now, unfortunately, that will \ntake me away from the Senate, but I intend to come back and at some \npoint offer a substitute that will be paid for with the same package. \nThe chairman and ranking member have done an excellent job of \npresenting a package that is very much in the interest of the country. \nAlso, I will offer a pay-go provision. I don't think we can give up on \nthe notion that any new spending or any tax cuts need to be paid for. \nOur deficits and debt are running amok.\n  I again alert my colleagues what concerns me the most, even though \nthe deficit gets all the attention in the press, the far more serious \nthreat is the exponential growth of the debt. Last year, the deficit \nwas some roughly $320 billion, but the growth of the debt was $550 \nbillion.\n  For this year, when we put back things that have been excluded, we \nsee a deficit in the $360 billion range, but the growth of the debt we \nnow estimate is more than $630 billion, every penny of which has to be \nrepaid.\n  The budget that we are still working on from last year will increase \nthe debt of this country--by the estimates of the authors of the \nbudget--will increase the debt more than $600 billion a year each and \nevery year of the 5 years of its life. That is a $3 trillion increase \nin the debt. The first 5 years of this administration the debt has \nalready increased more than $3 trillion.\n  Looking ahead to the next 5 years, there is another $3 trillion \nincrease. We are now headed, we believe, for a $12 trillion debt by the \nend of this 5-year period, a doubling of the debt in a 10-year-period. \nForeign holdings of our debt have doubled in 5 years.\n  It took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 trillion of debt held \nabroad, U.S. debt held by foreigners. In the last 5 years under this \nPresident, we have doubled that amount--in fact, more than doubled that \namount. That is an utterly unsustainable course. It is absolutely \nincumbent on us to get hold of our budget deficits and our trade \ndeficits that are requiring this unprecedented foreign borrowing. I \nwill have more to say about this when I offer a substitute and when I \noffer a pay-go provision.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay close attention. Together we have to deal \nwith this burgeoning deficit and debt. It is threatening our country. \nIt threatens our economic security. It threatens our national security. \nIt certainly threatens our financial security. In my substitute, I \nalert my colleagues, I will take the very provisions the chairman and \nranking member proposed--they have done an excellent job of putting \ntogether a package that makes sense for the country. It has the right \npriorities. They have done an excellent job. I have taken those \nprovisions, and I have added some more pay-fors so we cover the cost.\n  Again, clearly, some of these tax reductions need to be extended. \nGoodness knows we have a whole series of things on which the American \npeople rely. We ought to extend them. The chairman and the ranking \nmember have done a terrific job of putting this package together in a \nbipartisan way. I will offer a substitute that takes their package and \nadds some pay-fors so the cost is covered.\n  With that, I indicate to my colleague that we will try to work out \nwith his staff when it is most appropriate to return. I have another \nobligation at 12:30.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I very much thank my good friend from \nNorth Dakota. More than any other Senator, he is constantly reminding \nMembers that our budget deficit is getting out of control. It is \na message I wish more Senators and the public would heed. I hear the \nproblem constantly.\n\n  I was in India and China for 10 days earlier this month. We all \ntravel overseas, and we all talk to the leaders privately and publicly \nworldwide. I heard this constantly. We Americans have to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. We have to do it right away. The earlier we begin the \nbetter. There is no doubt, all mainstream economists agree, after a \nwhile it makes it very difficult for the United States to compete, and \nwe have such a low savings rate, our national savings rate and our \npersonal savings rate.\n  I thank the Senator again. I want him to know how much I appreciate \nall he is doing to try to get some attention to this very important \nsubject.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, our personal savings rates are negative. \nWe consume more than we save in America\n\n[[Page S401]]\n\ntoday. Our national savings rate is low today because our fiscal \ndeficit is so high. Corporate and private debt is high.\n  We have a great country, no doubt about that, a wonderful country. I \nam saying as clearly as I can say it, we run a great risk as a country \nof squandering what we now have as Americans if we do not, sooner \nrather than later, get our act together and get the deficits down. I am \nnot being partisan.\n  It was not too many years ago we had projected surpluses. President \nClinton bit the bullet. It was tough, very tough. He sent a budget to \nthe Congress which included spending cuts and included some revenue \nincreases only on the most wealthy. It was 50-50, 50 percent revenue \ncuts and 50 percent revenue raises on only the top 2 percent income \nearners in America, and it got through the Congress, one vote in each \nbody.\n  Guess what. As a consequence, we projected surpluses, about $5 \ntrillion in surplus over the following 10 years. I know that gave a \ngreat boost of confidence to businesses, to investors, that we would \nhave a surplus in America, that we would be a strong country. It did \nnot adversely affect the overall economic factors we face today.\n  With that huge deficit, I remind everyone, who is financing the \ndeficit? Foreigners. Foreign governments by and large are financing \nthis deficit. China's reserves at the end of the year will be $1 \ntrillion, surpassing Japan's foreign reserves. They are building up \ntheir bank accounts to such a great degree, loaning dollars to the \nUnited States with treasuries and other instruments. They are financing \nthis.\n  We have to begin to get this budget deficit down right away. There is \nno alternative. The sooner we begin the better. I thank the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and others who are working very hard to try to get \nthe job done and get our budget deficits reduced.\n  The Senate is now considering, to remind my colleagues, the House tax \nreconciliation bill, the bill before the Senate now. The Senate \nsubstitute is not yet pending. Thus, I encourage Senators who wish to \nspeak on the tax provisions--that is, the House bill before the \nSenate--to come to the floor and deliver their statements. At some \npoint in midafternoon we expect the majority leader or the assistant \nmajority leader to offer the Senate substitute and the Grassley-Baucus \nperfecting amendment, essentially taking the House bill before the \nSenate now and substituting the Senate-passed reconciliation bill. We \nhope the Senate will adopt the Grassley-Baucus perfecting amendment by \nvoice vote. Thereafter, I encourage tax-related amendments.\n  Just to review the situation now, this is a good time to make \nstatements on the bill. I also encourage Senators who have tax-related \namendments to offer those first. I would like the tax-related \namendments brought before the Senate, debated, and dealt with. \nAfterwards, we can deal with the non-tax-related amendments, amendments \nwhich will be nongermane and, if offered, against which points of order \nwill be made, we are in a 60-vote situation.\n  That is where we are today. It is Wednesday noon. We have a total of \n20 hours on the whole bill. I am hopeful we will not have to use that \n20 hours, but it is 20 hours. The clock is ticking. I urge Senators to \ncome to the Senate now.\n  Like the budget deficit, earlier is better than later. Senators can \noffer their amendments now, and they have a better chance of getting \nfull debate. Later, they probably will get squeezed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise out of concern for our \ngeneration and also for the generations of our children and \ngrandchildren and the legacy we leave them.\n  It has been said that the real test for a moral society is the kind \nof world it leaves to its children. With that in mind, I speak about \nthe reconciliation tax bill before the Senate.\n  First, I comment on the larger context of what I and others see as a \ngreat threat to our future way of life. Comptroller General David \nWalker has said that the greatest threat to our future is our fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  He also says:\n\n       America suffers from a serious case of myopia or \n     nearsightedness both in the public sector and the private \n     sector. We need to start focusing more on the future, we need \n     to recognize the reality that we are on an imprudent and \n     unsustainable fiscal path and we need to get started now.\n\n  In November of last year, Alan Greenspan testified before the Joint \nEconomic Committee and told Congress:\n\n       We should not be cutting taxes by borrowing. We do not have \n     the capability of having both productive tax cuts and large \n     expenditure increases, and presume that the deficit doesn't \n     matter.\n\n  I, for one, am taking this warning very seriously, and I have since I \nhave been a Member of the Senate. I strongly believe deficits do \nmatter. I do not know how anyone can say with a straight face that when \nwe voted to cut spending in December to help achieve deficit \nreductions, we can now turn around a short while later to provide tax \ncuts that exceed or cancel out the reduction in spending. I voted to \ncut spending in the reconciliation bill, but I voted against the tax \ncuts that were part of the reconciliation effort. In my opinion, it is \nthe only responsible course of action.\n  There are three reasons we should oppose tax cuts at this time. It is \nsimple. First of all, we cannot afford those tax cuts; two, we do not \nneed these tax cuts; three, we should be working on tax reform rather \nthan tax cuts.\n  Let's look at some of the looming problems or liabilities that our \nFederal Government will have to face in the near future. There is the \noften quoted but perhaps not recognized statistic that 77 million baby \nboomers, about whom the President talked last night--he is one of them; \nso is Bill Clinton--will begin to retire in just a couple of years, and \nthey will be a tremendous drain on our entitlement programs. It has \nbeen called a demographic tsunami that will never go away.\n  By 2030, the Congressional Budget Office projects Social Security \nspending as a share of the U.S. economy will rise by 40 percent. The \nbottom line is the predictions are that by 2030 almost the entire \nbudget will be used for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and we \nwill not have anything left for anything else.\n  At the size of the Federal budget today, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the prescription drug benefit will cost \n$155 billion a year by 2016, and taken together with Medicare and \nMedicaid will cost us $1.3 trillion or about one-third of Federal \nspending.\n\n  On top of this, we must consider the pension liabilities taxpayers \nmay soon take on. The Pension Guaranty Corporation has assumed 1.3 \nmillion pensions, which adds up to about $23 billion more in \nobligations than its premiums can cover. That shortfall could grow to \nmore than $100 billion in the near future, considering that about 1,100 \ncompanies are at high risk of defaulting on their plans. All that may \nbe added to the Government's bill to pay. We are going to have to pick \nup the tab on that if this happens.\n  The war on terror has cost us over $350 billion since it began. This \njust happens to be the size of the tax cut we enacted in 2003. I took a \nlot of heat for holding the line on that $350 billion, but the costs of \nthe war were not clear at that time. Consider where we would be today \nhad we not limited the scope of the tax cuts. Where would we be in \nterms of our budgets being in balance and our national debt? I voted \nfor funding for the war on terror because it is the Federal \nGovernment's primary duty to provide national security. However, \nconsidering these large increases in spending, it certainly does not \nmake sense to give away large tax cuts.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that Defense spending will \nrise from $420 billion in 2006 to $461 billion in 2011. This is \nexcluding supplemental appropriations. And, of course, we must look at \nthe Federal spending for Hurricane Katrina. While not as expensive as \noriginally thought, relief spending will amount to about $101.5 \nbillion--the total cost of the supplemental appropriations, targeted \ntax relief, and other Katrina-related bills we have passed.\n  Now add to that we are already operating in a deficit. In case anyone \nhas forgotten, the deficit for fiscal year 2005 was $319 billion. In \nOctober of last year, the gross Federal debt climbed past $8 trillion. \nThe debt has grown from $5.5 trillion, when I first came\n\n[[Page S402]]\n\ninto office, to a staggering $8.1 trillion. The debt service alone \nthreatens to gobble up revenues in the near future. According to CBO, \nin fiscal year 2005, interest on the public debt grew more rapidly than \nany other major spending category, rising 14 percent above the fiscal \nyear 2004 level.\n  Let's face it, we have been lucky. Interest rates have been very low \nso our interest costs to the debt have been relatively modest. But as \nwe move up the chain and interest rates start to rise, they are going \nto take a much larger share of our expenditures.\n  Without major spending cuts, tax increases, or both, the national \ndebt will grow by more than $3 trillion through 2010, to $11.2 \ntrillion, according to the General Accounting Office. In other words, \nit is going to grow more than $3 trillion through 2010. According to \nthe General Accounting Office, that will be nearly $38,000 for every \nman, woman, and child. The interest alone would cost $561 billion in \n2010, the same as the budget of the Pentagon. In other words, the \ninterest costs in 2010 are going to be the same cost as to entirely \nfund our Defense budget.\n  However, we all know the real problem is our long-term debt. By the \nGeneral Accounting Office's own estimates, about 35 years from now, \nwhen my grandchildren have their own children to care for, balancing \nthe budget could require actions as large as cutting total Federal \nspending by 60 percent. We had a tough time with our modest reduction \nin terms of cutting expenses 1 percent. We went through all kinds of \nfuror around here.\n  By passing these tax cuts into law, I believe we are increasing the \ndeficit and thus the Nation's debt, which results in a future tax on \nour Nation's children. I believe it is immoral to bequeath trillions of \ndollars in debt to our children and grandchildren. This will not be \npolitically easy, and I understand that. But the simple, undeniable \nfact is we cannot have it all. We have to make hard choices. We have to \ndecide we cannot say to them: You pay for things we wanted and were not \nwilling to pay for. We should either pay for them or be doing without \nthem.\n  I learned this lesson while I was mayor of Cleveland for 10 years and \nas Governor of Ohio for 8. You have to balance budgets. You have to \ndeal with deficits.\n  In the words of Robert J. Samuelson in a Newsweek article called \n``Capitalism vs. Democracy'':\n\n       So it is that budget deficits persist; any combination of \n     spending cuts and tax increases arouses a coalition of the \n     angry. And so it is that--despite a gradual aging of the \n     population that will require huge and, probably, damaging tax \n     increases--no one has seriously attempted to contain these \n     costs. It is easier to pretend that there will be no ill \n     effects.\n\n  It is time to recognize a simple fact, and that is this: Tax cuts do \nnot pay for themselves. We have heard all of this about: Did the tax \ncuts generate more revenues than what we had expended? The red bars on \nthis chart show the revenue projected before we cut taxes in 2003. In \nother words, these are the revenues we expected to get if we had not \ncut taxes. The blue bars show the revenue projected after we cut taxes. \nThe green bars show the revenue actually collected. The green bar shows \nthe most important thing.\n\n  The blue bar shows what we thought we were going to get, and we did \nget more revenue than we expected in 2003. We expected this, as shown \nby the blue bar, in 2004, and we got the green. We expected what is \nshown with the blue bar, as projected, and we were able to get added \nrevenue, as shown by the green bar. The revenue came up, but there is a \nbig debate.\n  Particularly, we were talking about that yesterday in a meeting, \nabout what caused the increase in revenues. Some were arguing it was \nbecause of reducing the tax on dividends and lowering the capital gains \ntax. I asked the question: Did the lowering of interest rates have \nanything to do with the fact that we had added revenues? We talk about \nthe stock market. Did the fact interest rates were down impact on the \nfact that the stock market has gone up?\n  So there are a lot of things that come into play. I am sorry, but so \nmany of my colleagues say these two tax reductions made the difference \nfor America and fail to realize there were a lot of other things that \nwere happening in our economy. The 2003 tax cuts, yes, were not as \nexpensive as we feared, but the fact is, they still did not pay for \nthemselves in terms of what we projected the revenues to be if we did \nnot have the tax cuts.\n  The Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Budget \nOffice have both stated we cannot simply grow our way out of the \nproblem. The Congressional Budget Office said last year:\n\n       [E]conomic growth alone is unlikely to bring the nation's \n     long-term fiscal position into balance.\n\n  What I am saying is we have to make some tough choices around here. I \nvoted for tax cuts in 2001, 2002, and 2003 because the country needed \nstimulative medicine. It has worked. The economy has grown. But like \nany other medicine, an overdose of tax cuts can, and in my opinion \nwill, do more harm than the original disease.\n  In 2003, I said that $350 billion in tax cuts would be enough to get \nthe economy moving, and it worked. Now I am saying that any more would \nbe an overdose. It is time to put the tax cut medicine back on the \nshelf, particularly in light of the war in Iraq, our spending on \nhomeland security, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and all the other \nmandatory spending I have mentioned earlier.\n  The second reason to put the tax cut medicine back on the shelf is \nthat many important tax extensions do not have to happen today. They do \nnot. For instance, the reduced rates on dividends and capital gains do \nnot expire until 2008. As a matter of fact, we could wait until 2009 to \ndeal with it in terms of the 2008 tax year. That is 3 years from now. \nIf we wait to look at these extensions, perhaps it would give us a \nchance to find offsets to pay for them or even look further at \nsomething that is long overdue, tax reform. I am going to discuss that \nin a moment.\n  When Alan Greenspan testified before the Joint Economic Committee at \nthe end of last year, a member of the committee asked if he supported \nextending the current 15-percent tax rate for capital gains and \ndividends. Former Chairman Greenspan replied he could only support \nextending these tax cuts if they were paid for. According to Chairman \nGreenspan, large budget deficits will drive up interest rates over \ntime, raising the Government's debt-service costs, which I referred to \n5 minutes ago; that is, interest costs go up, and we end up paying a \nlarge portion of our budget on interest costs. Chairman Greenspan said: \nunless the situation is reversed, at some point these budget trends \nwill cause serious economic disruptions.\n  The fact is if these taxes are so important, we should pay for them, \nwhich is why I supported the pay-go amendment to the budget resolution \nin March and supported it again in November. We have pay-go that says \nif you want to spend more, you have to find some way to pay for it. We \nshould do the same thing with tax cuts. No, we decided not to do that.\n  I also supported the Deficit Reduction Act when it passed the Senate \nin December because I believe controlling the growth of entitlement \nspending is essential to dealing with our fiscal challenges. The \nDeficit Reduction Act has been presented as an important step toward \nputting our fiscal house in order.\n  However, adjusting the balances on the pay-go scorecard to reflect \nthe passage of the reconciliation bill would give credence to the \ncriticism that we voted to restrain entitlement spending to allow for \nlarger tax cuts, not to reduce the deficit. In other words, you guys \ncut your expenses so you could pay for your tax reductions, and you did \nnothing for the deficit.\n  Furthermore, even though the budget resolution adopted last April \nallowed for legislation increasing the deficit by $75.6 billion, the \nfiscal and political environment is very different now than it was when \nthe budget resolution was adopted. As I mentioned before, the costs of \nresponding to Hurricane Katrina have had a substantial impact on the \nbudget deficit. Katrina hit the United States on August 29, well after \nwe passed the budget resolution. We had no idea this was coming. This \nwas the worst natural disaster we have had, and we have to say: Well, \nwe will take care of it. We will find some way to fudge it and pay for \nit. But we know fudging it means our budget for 2006 is going to be \nmore unbalanced and we are going to add to the national debt.\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\n  The Office of Management and Budget recently announced that the \ndeficit will exceed $400 billion once again in fiscal year 2006, $60 \nbillion higher than projected last summer.\n  Another important step toward fiscal responsibility is to have honest \naccounting for the Social Security surplus. We have borrowed over $1.9 \ntrillion from Social Security to finance the rest of the Government. I \nwant to make this point clear. When I first came to the Senate, we were \ntalking about ``unified budget'' and ``on budget.'' All of a sudden, we \nare now back to the unified budget. In those days, we were saying: We \ncannot spend the Social Security surplus. Now we do not even talk about \nthe Social Security surplus. The real number is masked by borrowing \nfrom the trust funds of other programs. When you add the off-budget \nsurplus of $175 billion from the Social Security trust fund and Postal \nService outlays, the real, or on-budget, number is $494 billion. The \nAmerican people do not understand that. We report $319 billion. The \nfact is, it cost us almost $500 billion. The Government's accounting \nfor total trust fund surpluses is actually $226 billion. That would \nincrease the total deficit to $545 billion.\n  In other words, we talk about the Social Security surplus we spent. \nWe do not tell the American people that we are also spending the other \nmoney that is in the trust funds. So if you add them all up, we are \ntalking about a deficit of $545 billion, when you include spending the \nmoney that is in Social Security and the other trust funds.\n  It is time to stop the raid on Government trust funds. That is why I \nhave introduced the Truth in Budgeting Act. I am happy Senator Conrad \nis willing to work with me on this important budget reform. The \nlegislation would stop the Federal Government from using surplus trust \nfund revenues to hide the true size of the Government's deficit \nspending and highlight the true size of the Federal debt by forcing the \nGovernment to increase borrowing from the public to cover general fund \nexpenses.\n  I have introduced this bill not as a Social Security reform measure \nbut as a budget reform measure. It is important to have an honest \naccounting of where we are and where we are headed from a fiscal \nperspective.\n  If you look at a study by the Heritage Foundation on Western European \neconomies, you get a glimpse of where we are going. Many older European \nnations have been forced to impose large tax increases on workers to \nfund benefit systems mainly for retirees. Overall government spending \nin the 15 nations comprising the European Union averages 48 percent of \nGDP, and tax revenues average 41 percent of GDP, which has placed a \nsignificant drag on their economies. Compared to the United States, per \ncapita income is 30 percent lower in these countries. Economic growth \nrates are 34 percent lower than the United States, and unemployment is \nsubstantially higher. As their populations continue to age, the \neconomies of countries such as Germany and France risk collapsing under \nthe weight of their unrealistically generous retirement and welfare \nsystems. We can't allow that to happen here.\n  I am pleased that President Bush, in the State of the Union Address \nlast night, called for a bipartisan commission to examine the full \nimpact of baby boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid. He said the commission ``should include Members of Congress \nof both parties and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put aside \npartisan politics and work together and get this problem solved.'' I \ncouldn't agree more. We have ignored this issue. It is time that we sit \ndown in a bipartisan basis and face up to this pending disaster and \ndeal with it now before it is too late.\n  My third reason for opposing tax cuts at this time is that the \nPresident's Advisory Panel on Tax Reform released its final report in \nNovember of last year. All of us have heard from families and \nbusinesses in our States lamenting the complexity and frustration with \nthe current Tax Code. I don't know about the Presiding Officer, but I \nknow my wife and I spend hours getting our papers together, and we have \nto take them to an accountant. I used to do my tax return. I am a \nlawyer. I wouldn't touch my tax return today with a 10-foot pole.\n  I am disappointed that the administration seems to have put tax \nreform on the back burner. Why extend tax reductions, which we are \ntalking about now, piecemeal when we should be considering fundamental \ntax reform instead? The goal of any government revenue program should \nbe to raise sufficient funds to operate public programs with the least \namount of disruption to the economy. Our tax structure should be \nsimple, fair, and honest. Our current Tax Code achieves none of these \nobjectives.\n  Last year, the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, estimated \nthat Americans spent more than 6 billion hours doing their taxes and \nthat complying with the current Federal income tax code costs U.S. \nindividual businesses and nonprofits $265 billion, which is 22 cents \nfor every dollar of income tax collected. This is equivalent to the \ncombined budgets of the Departments of Education, Homeland Security, \nJustice, Treasury, Labor, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, Health and \nHuman Services, and NASA.\n  Individuals and businesses lose money they could otherwise save, \ninvest, spend on their kids' education, or enjoy an extra evening out \nwith the family. But the Federal Government gains nothing from this \natrocious tax system we have. It is the equivalent of stacking money in \na pile and lighting a match. It doesn't do anything for anybody.\n  We all recognize the need for a simple, fair, and honest Tax Code. \nThis would be a win-win goal for everyone. We will soon be considering \na bill that would cut taxes by about $60 billion. Simply cutting tax \ncompliance costs in half, from 20 percent to 10 percent, would have the \nimpact of a much larger tax cut in the amount of $130 billion. In other \nwords, if we could get a fair, simple, understandable Tax Code and \neliminate this enormous amount of money it costs all of us to pay our \ntaxes and reduce that by half, we could save the American people $130 \nbillion. That is real money. This tax cut we are talking about is $60 \nbillion. We are talking about $130 billion out there that we have in \nour pockets. It doesn't impact the revenues to the Federal Government \none iota. However, it would be a tax cut that doesn't reduce our \nrevenue.\n  We all know that fundamental tax reform is critical. I cannot \nunderstand why some of my colleagues want to make so many provisions of \nthe Tax Code permanent or add new tax cuts when we very well may be \neliminating precisely the same provisions as part of fundamental tax \nreform.\n  The problem we have is this, if you want to be practical: When I got \ninvolved in this whole business in 2003 of the $350 billion tax \nreduction to stimulate the economy, and we started talking with some of \nthe high leadership in the House of Representatives, I was saying to \nthem: When I was Governor, what we did is we looked at tax reductions \nthat stimulate the economy, and then we looked at other areas where we \ncould increase taxes that would have less impact on the economy. We had \nto be concerned about balancing our budget.\n  What I heard from the leadership on the other side of the Capitol \nwas: We can't increase taxes because we all took the pledge that we \ncan't increase taxes.\n  I said: Even if you could increase taxes that don't have that much \nimpact on the economy so that you could decrease taxes that would help \nstimulate the economy?\n  No way.\n  Where are we going? If that is the deal, we will never get anything \ndone around here.\n  It is my opinion that it is not time for piecemeal tinkering. No \nhomeowner would remodel their kitchen and bathroom a year before \ntearing down the house to build a newer and better one. We need to tear \ndown the house.\n  If you look at that Tax Code, consider it to be a Christmas tree. If \nyou look at all the ornaments on that tree, you would sit back and say: \nWho in the devil ever decorated this tree? They must have been under \nthe influence of alcohol or drugs. That is what it is today. We just \nkeep adding things, one after another, another bell, another whistle, \nthis and that. It is time for us to look at this.\n  I wish to reiterate the three reasons I think we should oppose these \ntax cuts at this time.\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\n  No. 1, we cannot afford them because of our soaring deficit and the \nnational debt. Putting our spending on the credit cards of our kids is \nunconscionable, particularly because they are going to have to work \nharder and smarter to compete in a global marketplace just to maintain \nour current standard of living. Don't think they are not worried about \nthat. And as a parent, don't think I am not worried about the kind of \nenvironment in which my kids are going to live. They are going to have \nto work very hard in this new competitive world. We better wake up to \nit. It is the most formidable competition we have ever had in my \nlifetime; from China, India, you name it. What we are basically saying \nto our kids is: You are going to go into this competitive society and \nhave to work harder than you have ever had to before. And by the way, \ndown the road, you are going to have to pay for things we weren't \nwilling to do without or pay for. God bless you.\n  I can't do that. I cannot do that. I don't think any of us can do \nthat.\n  Second, we don't need tax cuts at this time. If this body believes we \nmust have them, then follow Alan Greenspan and David Walker's advice \nand let's pay for them.\n  Third, from a public policy point of view, these tax cuts are \npremature because in the very near future we may well change them as \npart of fundamental tax reform and simplification.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and urge them to consider \nthe ramifications of additional tax cuts at this time and reaffirm a \nprinciple we have held dear over the years and that I have adhered to \nas mayor of Cleveland and governor of Ohio. That is to balance budgets \nand reduce deficits and, yes, when the circumstances warrant it, cut \ntaxes, as I did the last 3 years as governor of Ohio.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am informed that it is not appropriate \nat this point to offer an amendment or to call up my amendment and \noffer it, but I do wish to speak to one of the amendments, which is at \nthe desk, that I have filed. It is an amendment that is cosponsored by \nSenators Rockefeller, Murray, Cantwell, Clinton, Kennedy, Kohl, \nLieberman, Schumer, Menendez, Kerry, and Leahy.\n  This amendment relates to the prescription drug problem which all of \nus hear about when we return to our home States. It is an immediate \nissue and an immediate concern for our constituents. I have an \namendment that tries to address a substantial amount of that concern.\n  On January 1, 2006, just a month ago, senior citizens and people with \ndisabilities were promised and fully expected to begin enjoying savings \non their prescription drugs through the Medicare program. For many, the \ndrug bill has been a lifeline and is working. But for millions of \nAmericans, the transition to this new prescription drug benefit has \nbeen nothing short of a disaster.\n  The sad reality is that implementation problems with the Medicare \ndrug benefit are widespread. What is especially troubling is that the \nproblems are adversely affecting the most vulnerable--low-income \nbeneficiaries who have lost comprehensive drug coverage they previously \nhad under Medicaid and have found themselves without coverage for \ncertain drugs they previously had or have fallen completely through the \ncracks and have no coverage for any kind of drugs.\n  It is unacceptable that this benefit is costing taxpayers hundreds of \nbillions of dollars over the next 10 years and yet has left many of our \nNation's most vulnerable citizens actually worse off. Consequently, I \nwill offer at the appropriate time this critically important amendment \nto address the crisis.\n  The amendment simply ensures that our Nation's seniors and \npharmacists and States, many of which have come forward to fill the \ngap, are not left holding the bag for mistakes and problems caused by \nthe Federal Government's failed implementation of the program.\n  This legislation ensures that senior citizens and people with \ndisabilities are getting the prescription drugs and services they need \nand that both States and pharmacists are being compensated for the \ncosts they are absorbing whenever either Medicare or the drug plan has \nfailed to cover those costs.\n  While it is impossible to know the exact number of senior citizens \nand people with disabilities who are facing problems, we do know that \nat least 300,000 low-income seniors are paying far more in drug costs \nthan they are supposed to be paying. We understand that up to 100,000 \nseniors showed up at their local pharmacy and were not in the new \nMedicare system at all.\n  Further, we know that the Health and Human Services Inspector \nGeneral's Office confirmed last week that millions of the dual-eligible \nindividuals who were automatically enrolled in the new program were \nplaced in drug plans that did not cover the drugs they used. For some \nsenior citizens and for the disabled, it was a cruel lottery that has \nleft them without the drugs they need. Fortunately, as Americans of \ngood conscience always do, both the pharmacists and States all across \nthe Nation have stepped up to fill the gaps. But their good deeds \nshould not be punished. We should make sure they are fully compensated \nfor their effort, and this amendment will, in fact, do that.\n  I appreciate all that Secretary Leavitt has committed to do to \naddress the multifaceted problems that have been identified. I do \nbelieve things are getting somewhat better. However, we are a long way \noff from having these problems resolved, and promises of better times \nahead are not adequate.\n  A pharmacist in Carlsbad, NM, reported to my office yesterday the \nproblems, in his words, that are still prevalent. As he says:\n\n       We call the processor; they say call Medicare. We call \n     Medicare; they say call the drug plan. It is just a \n     continuous circle of finger pointing with no resolution.\n\n  Therefore, I rise today, at the first opportunity we have had in this \nCongress, to offer this critically important amendment to fix some of \nthese immediate problems with the Medicare prescription drug bill. The \nlanguage of the amendment comes largely from legislation introduced by \nmy good friend, Senator Jay Rockefeller, in a bill which is entitled \nthe ``REPAIR Act.'' Who are the people we are talking about?\n  In a New York Times article entitled ``Medicare Woes Take High Toll \non Mentally Ill,'' an article published on January 21, a little over a \nweek ago, reporter Robert Pear profiles Mr. Stephen Starnes, who begged \nfor medication he had been receiving for 10 years to combat paranoid \nschizophrenia. His pharmacy could not get approval for this medication \nfrom the new Medicare drug plan. The result was that he was \nhospitalized, and he was treated by a fee-for-service Medicare provider \ndue to failure of the private drug plan.\n  So in effect, Medicare pays private drug plans for coverage and then \nit pays again for their failure to provide that coverage in a much more \ncostly way.\n  Clearly, immediate action is needed. This is one of dozens and dozens \nof newspaper reports nationwide. I have a chart that makes the case \nfairly dramatically. We have taken some of these headlines from around \nthe country: ``Medicare Woes Take High Toll'' is the one I mentioned \nbefore; ``Patience Only Remedy For Drug Plan Confusion''; Pharmacists \nDeal with Medicare Confusion''; Pitfalls No Surprise in Drug Benefit \nLaunch''; ``Seniors Denied Prescription Drug Benefits.'' There are is a \nwealth of these stories throughout country. The problems are legion, \nand we all hear about them on a daily basis when we are in our home \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I know that some will likely speak in opposition to \nthis amendment and point out that the underlying legislation on the \nfloor is a tax reconciliation bill. They will raise the objection that \nthe amendment is nongermane. However, this crisis dictates that we \nshould not let Senate procedural motions prevent our Nation's senior \ncitizens from getting the prescription drug benefit they were promised. \nI urge my colleagues not to take parliamentary steps to keep us from \nconsidering and dealing with this issue.\n  Others might say that the administration has promised to fix the \nproblems. Yet we know they have had the opportunity to fix the problems \nalready, but they have not done so. Here are some examples:\n  On November 3 of last year, a couple of months ago, our colleague, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\nMurray, traveled around her State and foresaw many of the problems we \nare witnessing today. Consequently, at that time in November, she \noffered an amendment that would have provided a 6-month transition \nduring which dual eligibles--people both on Medicaid and eligible for \nMedicare--could continue to receive drug coverage through Medicaid. \nThis would have given the administration more time to work through the \nmany problems that confront these dual-eligible individuals. \nUnfortunately, the administration opposed that amendment and it was \nrejected.\n  The CMS had a second opportunity when Medicare rights centers and a \nnumber of other senior and disability organizations filed suit to \ncompel the Secretary to continue Medicaid drug benefits ``for any dual \neligible who is not then enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug plan \nor otherwise receiving Medicare drug coverage.'' But again, the \nadministration fought that suit by arguing that the ``remedy is \nunnecessary and it runs counter to the public interest because of the \nconsiderable obstacles and confusion it will generate in the few \nremaining days between January 1, 2006.'' They further argued that they \nwould be in a position to quickly rectify any problems that might \narise.\n  I think we can all agree that it is unfortunate that both Congress \nand CMS failed to take advantage of clear opportunities to slow the \ntransition of the 6 million dual-eligible individuals from the Medicaid \nsystem to Medicare and that CMS was clearly way off in its assessment \nof how smoothly that transition would occur.\n  Unfortunately, we have missed both of those opportunities that I \nmentioned. But we have a third chance, and that chance is being \npresented by this amendment I am offering today to provide immediate \nhelp to seniors and people with disabilities who are being adversely \nimpacted by problems that have arisen with the implementation of the \ndrug benefit.\n  We had a meeting in the Finance Committee this last week. Chairman \nGrassley asked a question of Secretary Leavitt, who was meeting with us \nthere, and CMS Administrator McClellan. Chairman Grassley asked whether \nlegislation was needed to fix some of these problems. Dr. McClellan \nsimply responded ``no.'' The administration continues to take the \nposition that Congress is not needed as part of the solution, that \nlegislation is not needed, and that these problems will resolve \nthemselves.\n  Two weeks ago, CMS announced that States that had stepped into the \nbreech to provide vulnerable citizens with the prescription drugs they \nneeded would not be reimbursed by CMS because they didn't have the \nlegal authority to help these States. Legislation was introduced \nimmediately in the House and the Senate, and less than a week later CMS \nreversed itself and said it would be working to ensure that States \nwould be fully reimbursed.\n  Public opinion polls indicate that approval ratings for the Congress \nhave sunk to the lowest levels in a decade. Part of that is due to the \nrepeated failure of Congress to act when action is clearly called for. \nHundreds of thousands of our citizens are calling out for help to \naddress the many bureaucratic snafus that we are witnessing in the \nimplementation of this Medicare prescription drug program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, when it is offered \nlater today, to ensure that senior citizens and pharmacists and States \nget the support they need to get through this immediate crisis.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all quorum \ncalls be counted equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Message\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I was joking earlier with the occupant of \nthe chair, and I said I would like to be recognized so I could tell you \nwhat I thought of the President's State of the Union message last \nnight. I appreciate the chance to offer some thoughts and comments.\n  First of all, the Presiding Officer may recall that when he kicked \noff his speech, he called for a return to civility. That is called for \naround here from time to time. Sometimes it is called for earnestly and \nother times it is something that we just say. I hope that it was \noffered in earnest and that all of us, Democrats and Republicans, will \nrespond in like kind. I always found that in my old job in Delaware as \nGovernor, I got a lot more done when we were civil to one another. \nRegarding the kinds of issues before us that the President talked about \nlast night, if we are going to be successful, we need to do that.\n  One of things I have been calling for, for I guess about a year or 2 \nnow, ever since the President laid out his Social Security reform \ninitiatives, was the notion of, if we are making progress on something \nas politically explosive as Social Security reform, it would be helpful \nto go back in time maybe 23 years to when President Reagan was \nPresident and Tip O'Neill was Speaker of the House. At the time, I was \nelected to the House of Representatives, where the Presiding Officer \nalso served. In 1982, when I got there, we learned that Social Security \nwas about to go bankrupt and that we needed to do something not to ward \noff the problem in 10, 15, 20, or 25 years but that next year, in 1983, \nbecause we were going to run out of money to pay benefits to our \nseniors. What President Reagan and Tip O'Neill did and maybe the \nDemocratic leader of the Senate, who may have at the time been our \ncolleague, Robert Byrd--I am not sure--they created a commission \nchaired by Alan Greenspan.\n  The members included people such as Senator Robert Dole, whose wife \nserves with us now, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now deceased. \nHe was chairman of the Finance Committee, either then or at a later \ntime. It also included Claude Pepper, from Florida, chairman of the \nAging Committee in the House, and a number of other notable people. So \nAlan Greenspan chaired the Commission. They went to work in 1982 and \ncame up with a whole raft of ideas. The Commission endorsed them in \ntotal.\n  We endorse all these ideas to raise revenues, to slow the outflow of \nspending from the Social Security trust funds. Because they embraced \nthe ideas in total, it gave the rest of us cause to believe that maybe \nthere is some merit to them.\n  Not only that, President Reagan said we are going to take the \npolitics out of this. If you, the House and Senate, pass this package, \nI will sign it. Ronald Reagan, a Republican President, gave political \ncoverage to the Democrats in the House and Senate. Tip O'Neill and the \nmajority leader of the Senate gave political coverage to the \nRepublicans. I describe it as drinking the Kool-Aid together, holding \nhands and jumping off the bridge together.\n  We passed a major overhaul of Social Security, and the President \nsigned it into law. It put Social Security on firm footing, not just in \n1983 but for a couple of decades to come. We know, looking down the \nroad in 20, 30 years, we will have a serious problem with Social \nSecurity. The sooner we get started on it, the better off we all will \nbe.\n  It reminds me a little bit of compounded interest. Save a little, and \nas time goes by, it adds up to a lot of savings. To the extent we can \nget started on Social Security sooner rather than later, it will help \nus more quickly than we might imagine.\n  As worrisome as the Social Security trust funds may be, the Medicare \ntrust fund is an even greater, more urgent problem that needs to be \naddressed. I was very pleased to hear the President say last night not \nonly a blue-ribbon commission with an eye toward the\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\nboomers and their effect on retirement but also Medicare and Medicaid. \nAs you know, more than half the money we spend in Medicaid ends up with \nsenior citizens in long-term care facilities. So I think that was a \nvery good thing.\n  Going back to the President's call for civility, a bipartisan \napproach, unless we have it, this kind of deal may see the light of \nday, but we will never make any progress on it. And, frankly, we need \nto make progress on it for the sake of our parents and for the sake of \nour children and grandchildren, some of whom are the ages of the pages \nsitting in front of me today.\n  The President also lamented the fact that we have this terrible \naddiction to imported oil and that we have to do something about it. \nThat was great. In fact, when John Kerry was running for President, one \nof the centerpieces of his campaign was energy independence I think by \n2020, or something such as that. The President echoed some of the same \nconcerns last night in his speech. I welcome those. People on our side \nwelcome them as well.\n  It is important we not just say the words but we go forward and make \nsure we fund the technology initiatives and other initiatives that will \nhelp make renewable energy a reality, not just biodiesel and ethanol, \nbut that we do a better job than we are doing now on solar energy, \nwind, and geothermal.\n  The President also mentioned last night a new generation, not just \nencouraging more wind, solar, soy, diesel, ethanol, and so forth, but \nhe also called for a new generation of nuclear powerplants. I know \npeople have concern about the waste, and we should, but I also think we \nought to be smart enough to figure out in the next 10 to 20 years what \nto do with the waste, how to recycle and better control it and reduce \nthe threat that someone will get hold of it and turn it into nuclear \nweapons. We are too smart a people not to solve that problem.\n  The President mentioned in his speech--I was kind of concerned by \nthis--I think he said let's replace 75 percent of our oil dependence on \nthe Middle East by 2025. I don't think all our oil comes from the \nMiddle East. I think 60 percent is imported today, not all from the \nMiddle East. A lot comes from other places around the world. To say we \nare going to reduce our oil from the Middle East is not good enough and \nI don't think good enough to do it by 2025. It is my hope that we can \nmove up that timetable sooner and maybe eradicate not only our \ndependence on oil from the Middle East but from other places outside \nour borders as well.\n  The President talked about affordable health care. The cost of health \ncare is killing our competitiveness as a nation. One of the reasons--\nnot the only reason--but one of the reasons why GM and Ford are \nstruggling, losing money, laying people off, and closing plants is the \nhuge legacy costs they carry with their pensions and health care costs \nfor their employees today and for people who are retired.\n  GM alone provides health insurance for about a million people--folks \nworking in the plants and their families, people who used to work in \nthe plants and are retired. It is about a million people. Some folks \ndescribe GM and some of these auto companies as basically a health care \nprovider that happens to build cars and trucks on the side. I know they \nsay that with tongue in cheek, but it is not far off the mark.\n  A couple things the President mentioned I think made a lot of sense. \nOne was electronic records. For a lot of people, it doesn't mean much. \nI will use an example.\n\n  We had hearings this morning on Katrina, a followup to what went \nwrong and what didn't go wrong on the heels of Katrina in New Orleans. \nWhen most people were evacuated--and we spent a fair amount of time \nthis morning talking in our hearing about the evacuation of people who \nwere in nursing homes and how it didn't go well. A lot of times people \nwho were in nursing homes ended up in places outside Louisiana. \nFrankly, the people who received them in other nursing homes and other \nhospitals did not have a clue what medicines these folks were taking, \nthey didn't know what their lab tests were, they didn't know the \ncondition they were in. They had no real record of their x-rays or \ntheir MRIs. Basically, all these older people were dumped in the laps \nof these nursing homes and hospitals outside the gulf coast. It was a \nmess.\n  Compare and contrast that with the folks who are veterans and are \nbeing cared for by the VA in VA nursing homes and hospitals in the same \narea. When they were transferred to their new sites and other States \nsurrounding the gulf coast, going with them, figuratively and \nliterally, were their electronic health records. When they ended up in \na new hospital or nursing home, the receiving entity knew they had the \nmedical history of this veteran. They knew what medicines they were \ntaking. They knew what their lab tests were, MRIs, x-rays. They had a \nrunning history of the health care provided to these veterans. The \nveterans had an electronic health care record.\n  We have a similar system put in place for Active-Duty folks in the \nDepartment of Defense. When I was in the Navy, we carried around manila \nfolders that literally had our health care records. We would take them \nfrom station to station, base to base, as we were transferred. We don't \ndo that anymore. Frankly, we do something similar to that in civilian \nlife. We ought not do it.\n  My little State of Delaware is trying to provide something similar to \nthat. It is called the Delaware Health Information Network. That would \nallow everybody in our State to have an electronic health record. If \nyou go into a hospital or doctor's office, they can figure out a little \nbit about your health history and how they can provide better care for \nyou.\n  We obviously need to do that for our country. The Congress and the \nPresident can do something to help that. It is not just money either. \nIt is having standards so we are basically singing off the same sheet \nof music. People who go to a hospital in South Dakota, North Dakota, or \nDelaware can have standards that are interoperable, systems that are \ninteroperable and using the same standards so we can get good care, \nbetter care because the folks receiving us know something about our \nmedical history.\n  The President talked about health savings accounts. They are about a \nyear or so old. He talked about ideas to make them better. I know not \neverybody is crazy about health savings accounts. I know it is not a \nsilver bullet, but it is part of the solution to provide health care \nhelp for those who don't have health care insurance, which is about 45 \nmillion people. It is an option that we can try to improve.\n  I want to mention one last point. Here on the Senate floor not too \nlong ago, I was with our colleague, Lamar Alexander from Tennessee. He \nis a very thoughtful guy. Senator Alexander shared with me an idea that \ngrew out of the National Academy of Sciences. It is an idea of looking \nahead and figuring out how we are going to provide job opportunities \nfor children who are the same age as my children--15, 17, the age of \nthese pages. I guess they are about 15, 16, 17 years old as well.\n  The folks at the National Academy of Sciences came up with this idea. \nSenator Alexander was good enough to give this to me, Mr. President. I \ndon't know if you have seen this. It is titled ``Rising above the \nGathering Storm.'' It is the executive summary, a quick read. I commend \nit to everybody. When I heard the President talking about his idea last \nnight of making sure our young people coming out of our high schools \nare better steeped in math and science and making sure the people \nteaching in our schools can actually teach math and science--I think \nthe President said double the investments in technology that lead to \ninnovation. I said that sounds vaguely familiar to me.\n  As it turns out, it is basically in the recommendations shared with \nme by Senator Alexander that came out of the work done by the National \nAcademy of Sciences. It is good stuff.\n  As we look forward, trying to figure out how we are going to be \ncompetitive with the rest of the world in this century, I am not sure \nwe have all the answers. Part of it is, frankly, making health care \nmore affordable for our people and employers. That is part of it. Part \nof it also is making sure our kids, our students, our young people who \nwalk out of our high schools and colleges and go off into the world can \nread, write, think, they can do math, they know science, and are \nfamiliar with technology. There are a lot of good ideas in this \npublication, and I\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\nthink the President has embraced this proposal and we, as Democrats and \nRepublicans, might want to do the same.\n\n  P.S., sometimes we say things in speeches that sound good and a lot \nof people stand up and applaud and say: That is right, that is good, I \nlike that. But the followthrough is not always there. It is important, \nif we are going to go down this road--and we probably should--that the \nfollowthrough be there.\n  What do I mean by that? The President is going to submit a budget \nproposal to us in about a week or so. It will be interesting to see how \nthe administration funds these initiatives. When we go through the \nbudget process, at the end of the day--we will adopt our appropriations \nbills later this year--it will be interesting to see how hard the \nadministration pushes for these kinds of provisions outlined in the \nproposal from last night and from the National Academy of Sciences. It \nwill be interesting to see what the administration proposes next year \nand the year after that and the year after that and how hard they push \nfor funding.\n  I will be watching, and to the extent the administration wants to \nsupport these proposals, I suspect they will have my support and \nprobably the support of other Democrats and Republicans. It would be \nnice not just to hear words from the President but deeds as well.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I don't know how he felt about the \nPresident's speech last night. I didn't catch his interviews. I know he \ndid them. I did them back in Delaware, and they don't cover much in \nSouth Dakota either or in Washington, for that matter. I heard \nencouraging things in what the President said. I wanted to mention \nthose.\n  I will close. I know the Senator from North Dakota is waiting for me \nto get out of his way so he can take the floor as well. I will close \nwith this. Just about every Member of the Senate has been over to Iraq \nin the last year or so. I was in Iraq in December. I met with our \nmilitary leaders, I met with our civilian leaders, and I met with Iraqi \nmilitary leaders and Iraqi civilian leaders. I was encouraged on \nseveral fronts.\n  It was just before they had their elections. It was encouraging we \nhad so many people wanting to run for the parliamentary seats--275 \nseats and 7,000 candidates. That is a pretty amazing outcome in terms \nof participation, trying to put a coalition government together, stand \nit up, rewrite their constitution, build the economy. That is a whole \nlot to do at once in the middle of an insurgency.\n  One of the more encouraging comments I had was from GEN George Casey. \nWe were talking about whether the Iraqis are able to stand up, take on \nmore of the fight, cover the responsibilities geographically and \notherwise. We got an encouraging report, not one that said we are going \nto be able to leave in 6 months, 12 months, or even 24 months. But in \nGeneral Casey's words, what he said with reference to our presence in \nIraq is it is time for us, the United States, to start moving toward \nthe door.\n  Our President has said consistently that when the Iraqis are ready to \nstand up militarily, we, the United States, will be ready to stand \ndown. He has been pretty consistent in saying that. What I heard from \nour own military leaders there, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff is that the Iraqis are able to militarily stand up in ways this \nyear that they could not a year ago: Battalions can lead the fight, and \nthere are some that can actually go out and fend for themselves; how \nthe Iraqis control the border with Syria, control roughly one-third of \nBaghdad; have taken over a bunch of the bases where the United States \nused to be.\n  They are standing up, and as they stand up, at least in the words of \nour own military leaders, maybe it is time for us to head toward the \ndoor. The President said last night--this is almost a quote--those \ndecisions as to troop level will be made by our military commanders and \nnot by politicians in Washington, DC. I heard that last night.\n  Most people applauded, but I thought, what our military commanders in \nIraq are telling me is that it is time for us to begin moving toward \nthe door--not to leave, not to close the door, but to begin moving \ntoward the door.\n  I was a little disappointed last night. I think the President may \nhave missed an opportunity to signal that we are in a position to begin \nreducing, to some extent, our troop presence there.\n  In a way, a perverse kind of way, what that is likely to do is, as \nthe Iraqis move up and stand up and the other Arab nations come to \nsupport this new government in Iraq, in a perverse kind of way our \nbeginning to reduce our presence undercuts the latent support the \ninsurgency enjoys.\n  I could not understand why there is this latent support for the \ninsurgency over in Iraq, but one of the reasons is when the Iraqi \npeople hear--or at least a lot of them hear--our President say or us \nsay we are there until we have complete victory, we are there for as \nlong as it takes, what they hear is: The Americans are here for our \noil, and they are not going to leave until they get it all or at least \ncontrol it all. Hence this latent support for the insurgency.\n  I hope we will look for opportunities--not to pull out lock, stock, \nand barrel by the end of the year; that doesn't make any sense--we are \ngoing to be there for some time--but to find a way for us to be, in the \nwords of one Iraqi I heard over there, less visible and less numerous. \nTo the extent we are able do that and they stand up and assume the new \nresponsibilities, maybe we will be able to enable them to do a bit more \nwith a bit fewer of us, which would please the American people; I \nbelieve it would please the Iraqi people; it would help reduce, a \nlittle bit, our budget deficit and maybe actually promote the day when \nIraqis are running the show on their own and making them proud and us \nproud of them.\n  I have gone on long enough. Thank you for the opportunity today to \nshare some reflections from last night.\n  With that having been said, I yield the floor. I see my friend from \nNorth Dakota is ready to take the floor and say a few words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my colleague from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, the issue that is going to be debated now and voted on \nlater today and perhaps tomorrow is the revenue piece of the \nreconciliation bill. I know that sounds a little like a foreign \nlanguage to some people, but we have a process here called \nreconciliation. One part of that is spending, and the other part is \nrevenue. This is the revenue side.\n  For all of us, the question is, As we legislate here, are we gaining \nground or losing ground? Are we moving our country ahead, or are we \nfalling behind?\n  I listened attentively last night to the President's State of the \nUnion Address. He described some of these issues, although he did not \ndescribe domestic policy in much detail. The first half hour or so was \nabout foreign policy. There is no question that Iraq is very important. \nThe war on terrorism and national security are issues that are very \nimportant to our country. But I also believe it is important as well to \nbegin taking care of things here at home, and we have a lot to take \ncare of.\n  I have told my colleagues before about a wonderful man in North \nDakota called the Flying Farmer from McCody. McCody is a town of about \n80 people. The Flying Farmer from McCody goes out to county fairs and \nState fairs and he takes an old car he fixed up--he works in a machine \nshop--then he puts up a ramp and jumps other cars; a daredevil kind of \nthing. The Flying Farmer from McCody. He jumps cars at county fairs.\n  But he is also in the Guinness Book of Records. John Smith, the \nFlying Farmer from McCody, is in the Guinness Book of Records. He is in \nthere because he drove a car in reverse 500 miles, averaging 36 miles \nan hour. I don't know who would want to drive a car in reverse 500 \nmiles or who would want to set a record for a reverse speed of 36 miles \nan hour for 500 miles, but he owns the record.\n  That is probably a perfect metaphor for the U.S. Congress--setting \nrecords for going backward. The question for us is, Can we move \nforward? Can we take this country forward, move ahead, and advance this \ncountry's interests?\n  As we talk now about the revenue side of reconciliation, we are \ntalking about taxes. So let me talk a bit about the tax system and \nwhere we are.\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\n  In recent days, we have had an announcement by Ford Motor Company \nthat they are deciding to cut 30,000 more jobs. They cut 10,000 last \nyear. They are going to cut 30,000 more workers. This follows on the \nheels of General Motors. General Motors announced it was going to cut \n30,000 workers.\n  By the way, the top guy in General Motors who is in charge of \nacquiring parts called all the suppliers of General Motors together, \nsome 300 of them, the CEOs of the parts companies, and said to them \nthis last year: You need to start outsourcing your parts production to \nChina to bring your costs down. The parts for General Motors, Ford--\nshut down the jobs, move jobs to China. Is our country moving ahead or \nbackward when we see these things?\n  The reason I mention this Ford announcement is Ford announced that at \nthe same time it was cutting 30,000 jobs, from the Washington Post, \nFord said:\n\n       Repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the American \n     Jobs Creation Act of 2004 resulted in a permanent tax savings \n     of about $250 million.\n\n  Let me describe that in English. What Ford said is they picked up a \nquarter of a billion dollars in tax breaks under the act Congress \npassed that they called the American Jobs Creation Act. They announced \nthat same day, we are cutting 30,000 people. How is it that Congress \npasses something called the American Jobs Creation Act and the company \nthat announces it gets a quarter of billion dollars of benefit under \nthat act at the same time tells us it got that benefit that it cuts \n30,000 jobs? How does that work? Does that make sense to anybody? Do \npeople who pass this kind of legislation and call it the Jobs Creation \nAct, do they seem embarrassed when they see this?\n\n  It is not just Ford Motor. I should not pick on Ford Motor. But \nHewlett-Packard brought $14.5 billion back from abroad and cut 14,500 \nworkers. Colgate Palmolive, Motorola--I could go on.\n  What was this little scheme called the 2004 American Jobs Creation \nAct? Here is what it was. It said for those companies which have parked \nincome overseas and have not repatriated their income yet back to this \ncountry--which when they do, they will owe on it with a credit for \nforeign taxes paid--we will give you a special deal under this Jobs \nCreation Act. If you bring your money back to this country, you can pay \na 5.25 tax rate. That is one half the tax rate of the lowest income \nAmerican who pays income taxes. So we said to the biggest companies in \nthe world: If you bring your income back, we will give you a deal--5.25 \npercent. That is the income tax rate you pay.\n  We now know they repatriated somewhere around $350 billion. By my \ncalculation, this Congress--not with my vote by the way awarded those \ncompanies $104 billion in tax breaks.\n  I don't know of anybody who actually stands up and boasts about that \nhere on the floor of the Senate. They do it because they believe in \nthis sort of thing, but they don't want to brag about it. But I hope \nthose who talked on this issue, when this American Jobs Creation Act \nwas passed, would come to the Chamber and recite for us what they said \nthen and what we know now.\n  They said if we give these biggest companies huge tax breaks, it will \ncreate jobs in this country. Now what we know is--and Ford is the best \nexample of it--they announced: We got a quarter of a billion--thank \nyou, Congress--and we are going to cut 30,000 workers. It is right on \ndown the line. I could spend some time talking about these companies. I \nwill not do that, only to say those who believed this was a jobs \ncreation act now should be disabused of that notion.\n  We talk about our Tax Code and suggest what is the best way to use \nour money. They decide the best way to use our money would be to go to \nsome of the largest corporations in America that are doing business \noverseas and say to them: If you bring that money back, you can pay the \nlowest income tax rate in America--yes, it is lower than your neighbor, \nlower than the person down the street, lower than the person up the \nblock, lower than the person out on the farm. You get to pay the lowest \ntax rate in America. That is almost unbelievable. It is stranger than \nfiction. But that is exactly what the majority in this Congress did. \nOne would think it should be profoundly embarrassing when we see the \nresults.\n  Let me also say that this is not just about providing big tax cuts to \ncompanies. It is a situation where, with these kinds of tax policies, \nwhen we say, Put up a slice of bread here and let us slather some \nbutter all over it, what we are saying to these companies is, We want \nto encourage you to actually take jobs and move them overseas. We want \nto tell you that, if you will fire your American workers, padlock the \nfront gate on your American manufacturing plant, and move it all to \nChina or India or Sri Lanka or Bangladesh or Vietnam, we will give you \na tax cut. I know people must listen to that and say: That cannot be \ntrue. That would be absolutely nuts; you cannot possibly be accurate. \nBut I am. I am. We actually offer a tax cut for companies that get rid \nof their American workers, outsource their production, and then ship \nthe production back into this country for sale on our store shelves in \nToledo and Pittsburgh and Los Angeles and Fargo. Produce it in China, \nsell it back here, and we will give you a tax break.\n  I want to draw a circle around all this because it all relates. I \nwant to show a picture of a building. I want to show you what is \nhappening because this relates to taxes and jobs.\n  This building is a little five-story building in the Cayman Islands. \nIt is a white building. It is called the Ugland House. According to \nBloomberg News, this building on Church Street in the Cayman Islands is \nthe official address of 12,748 companies. Let me say that again because \nsomeone would say that is kind of crowded. That would be crowded if \nthey were all there. They are not there, of course. This is just their \naddress. 12,748 companies claim this little white building as their \nofficial address in the Cayman Islands on quiet Church Street. Why \nwould that be the case? I will tell you why. Because companies these \ndays want to do the following: They want to produce in China by paying \npeople 30 cents an hour, working them 12 to 14 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek; they want to ship the products to the store shelves of the United \nStates of America to sell to American consumers because that is where \nthe money is; and they want to run their income through the Ugland \nHouse in the Cayman Islands so they can avoid paying U.S. taxes on \ntheir profits. It is perfect symmetry, isn't it?\n  Of course, it doesn't involve saying the Pledge of Allegiance. You \ncan't really say the Pledge of Allegiance and do this: say, I want all \nAmerica has to offer, all the protection of our country, the ability to \nbe chartered in America as an American corporation, the ability to be \nprotected by American military might, the ability to be protected by \nAmerican laws and courts, but I also want this for my company: I want \nto be able to produce in China, sell in Cincinnati, and run my money \nthrough the Cayman Islands. I am telling you, you don't say the Pledge \nof Allegiance when you do that. You weaken this country. You pull the \nrug out from American workers. And you also weaken those who are not \nleaving this country and who are deciding to continue to manufacture \nhere.\n  There are some wonderful companies that do stay here and do \nmanufacture here. I have told stories of a number of them. I will not \ndo that today. This is not a broad-brush of all companies, but it \nis increasingly the activities we see in some very large companies that \nno longer think of themselves in any terms of economic nationalism. \nThey are world enterprises, citizens of the world who want to produce \nwhere it is cheap, sell into an established marketplace in the United \nStates, and run their income through a tax haven country. It does not \nwork, in my judgment, in the long term. What do we do about all that?\n\n  In addition to talking about the Ugland House, I wish to make sure \npeople understand, from other speeches I have given, that these \ncompanies which are leaving America are real companies.\n  This company, by the way, was a company in this country for over a \ncentury. For over 100 years, this company made little red wagons, and I \nguarantee most American kids have sat in a little red wagon called \nRadio Flyer. Radio Flyer wagons were originally created by a guy in \nChicago, an immigrant. The ``Radio''? That was after\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\nMarconi. He was so enthused about Marconi. And the ``Flyer''? That is \nbecause he loved flying. So he built a little red wagon called Radio \nFlyer, and I bet every kid in this country at one time has seen it, and \nmost of them have ridden in one.\n  After 100 years in this country, the Radio Flyer is gone. This is \ngone. They don't make Radio Flyers in America anymore; they make them \nin parts of the world where you can pay 30 cents and 40 cents an hour \nfor labor. So the company that makes Radio Flyers still aspired to sell \nthem in the United States, it is just that they don't make them here \nanymore.\n  I could go through a list of dozens and dozens of companies that \nrepresent exactly the same story.\n  We have all seen these ads over many years, the guys who are dressed \nas grapes--you know, green grapes, red grapes. They dance and they \nsing. What a playful bunch of people. Who on Earth thought you could do \na little television commercial with a bunch of people singing dressed \nlike grapes? Fruit of the Loom underwear.\n  Now Fruit of the Loom underwear is gone. It is all gone. They are in \nother parts of the world where you can produce shorts and t-shirts and \nunderwear for much less cost. The people who used to work for Fruit of \nthe Loom used to have good jobs, the same as the people who worked for \nRadio Flyer. They worked there for a lifetime, loved their jobs, but \nthen they were told: You cannot compete with 30 cents an hour. So long. \nSee you later. Yet the grapes still sing, and the workers weep for \ntheir jobs.\n  I only point out Huffy bicycles because Huffy bicycles just announced \nit was becoming Chinese in nationality, which was, in fact, just a \nformality because they don't make Huffy bicycles here anymore; they \nhave been making them in China. All the people in Ohio lost their jobs \nmaking Huffy bicycles. They lost their jobs because they were told they \nmake $11 an hour plus benefits, and that is way too much money, and we \nare going to make Huffy bicycles at 33 cents an hour in China, for \npeople who work 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day.\n  The last job, by the way, for the folks in Ohio was to put this decal \non. This is a decal of the globe. This used to be a decal of the \nAmerican flag, when Huffy bicycles were made by Americans here in \nAmerica. They changed that because all the Huffy bicycles workers were \nfired. Huffy bicycles are made in China, and now the flag decal was the \nlast job those workers performed before losing their jobs and having to \ndrive out of that plant for the last time. They put the decal of the \nglobe on it.\n  So if you want to buy a Huffy bicycle at Wal-Mart, Kmart, or Sears, \nunderstand they used to be made by people in this country making $11 an \nhour. No longer. It is all in China. And incidentally, this company \nalso decided it cannot pay the retirement benefits that were owed to \nthe workers, so now the American taxpayer is going to pay that.\n  The company declared bankruptcy. Now they have announced it is going \nto be a Chinese company, a Chinese brand and style of Huffy. It is \nstill a Huffy, of course.\n  One last thing: Lest some think this doesn't matter, the people at \nHuffy, I was told by someone who on the last day of work, when they \nleft their parking space, those workers who lost their jobs making \nHuffy bicycles, on the last day in their jobs, those workers left a \npair of shoes in the space where their cars used to park. It was their \nway of sending a message to the company that you can move our jobs to \nChina but you are not going to fill our shoes. It is what those jobs \nmeant to those people.\n  It is going on all over this country.\n  When you hear that Ford is going to lay off 30,000 workers, you don't \nthink much; you think 30,000 jobs is not much; it is too big to \nunderstand. But the fact is think this country is losing jobs all over, \nand they are being replaced by jobs that pay less with fewer benefits.\n  American workers are now discovering downward pressure on wages \nbecause this strategy doesn't pull American workers up. It pushes \nAmericans workers down as it exploits foreign workers.\n  We are in a situation where we have the largest trade deficit in \nhistory--$740 billion last year, we believe. That is $2 billion a day, \n7 days a week above that which we export from other countries. We are \nselling America. Every single day, we sell $2 billion worth of this \ncountry to foreigners with this insidious trade strategy.\n  The people who listen to me talk about this will say this is another \nprotectionist, xenophobic, isolationist stooge who doesn't get it. What \nI get is the need to stand up for the economic interests of this \ncountry.\n  I support trade, the more the better. But it must be fair trade. If \nit is not fair trade, and if this country doesn't have the guts to \nrequire other countries to pull their standards up, then all we are \ninevitably going to do is continue do push standards down in our \ncountry. That is not what we should aspire to in the long term in this \ncountry.\n  It is my intention to offer an amendment that will once again deal \nwith this perverse tax break that pays people to actually shut American \nplants down and move their jobs overseas. I hope to do that on this \nbill.\n  Let me also say I have offered that amendment four times. Members of \nthe House and Senate decided they wanted to continue a tax break for \nthose companies that ship their American jobs overseas.\n  I hope that one of these days there is a big, old klieg light that \nshines on all of these votes so people have to answer to those votes. \nAt the very least, we ought to have some sort of neutrality. We ought \nnot be giving tax breaks or benefits to those companies that decide to \nship their jobs outside of this country.\n  If I may make one final point, I talked a bit about these tax issues \nand running income through the Cayman Islands. We ought to shut that \ndown.\n  By the way, I have introduced a bill that says if your purpose for \nsetting up operations in a tax-haven country is for the purpose of \navoiding taxes, we are going to treat you for tax purposes as if you \nnever left this country. You have a responsibility to pay taxes in this \ncountry. We can shut all of that down very quickly, if we have the guts \nto do it.\n  If you can't take the first baby step in the right direction to shut \ndown tax breaks for people who are getting rid of American jobs and \nshipping their jobs overseas, how can you do something more complex?\n  We will have another vote on that. It will be the fifth vote on that. \nIf some have not seen the light, they can perhaps feel the heat and \nchange at some point.\n  I have described all of this not in terms of Democrats or \nRepublicans. All of us, I think, want this country to do well. I want \nthe President to do well. I want this country to do well. I want there \nto be less partisanship. I want there to be more cooperation. But I \nalso want us to take a look at public policy that is wrongheaded and \nchange it.\n  If we say we have a jobs creation act out there and we give $100 \nbillion in tax breaks and we see fewer jobs as a result of it, \nsomething is wrong with that. We ought to understand it.\n  I want to make one final point about the tax issue. One of the things \nhanging up the revenue side of the reconciliation bill is the issue of \ndividends and capital gains, and a 15-percent top tax rate for both \ndividends and capital gains income.\n  There are some people who look at the issue of taxation and they \nthink this: We have the opportunity to levy taxes on several different \nthings. We can tax work. We all know what work is. That is when \nsomebody gets up in the morning, puts on a pair of shoes, and clothes, \nand goes to work. We can tax work. We can tax investment, we can tax \nrents, and so on. We have people who have decided with respect to \ndividends and capital gains, that investment income, dividends and \ncapital gains should have a much lower tax rate than tax on work.\n  Ask the question: Where do you stand on taxation? Some of them say, \nWell, you know what I think we ought to do. We ought to tax work and \nexempt investment.\n  Say you have two people living side by side. One is a \nmultimillionaire who makes all of his or her money on dividends and \ncapital gains. The other one lives next door and wears steel-toed boots \nand goes to work every day. He\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\nworks hard, sweats, comes home and feels he has earned a good day's \nincome. We have people in this Chamber who believe the way that ought \nto be taxed is the person who works should be taxed, the person who \nearns it only in capital gains and dividends should have no tax. I \nknow. It is 15 percent. But there are a lot of people in here who would \nlike it to be zero.\n  We have a circumstance where we say let us tax work, and let us give \na benefit to investment. I don't know, what value system is that? Is \ninvestment worthy? Of course it is, absolutely. There is no question \nthat people who are investors are good people. They help run this \neconomic engine. I understand that. What value system is it that says \nwork ought to be taxed higher than investment? Work reflects the labor \nof the American people. I will not go through the list, but it was, I \nthink, in 1943 when Stalin turned to Roosevelt when he was meeting with \nRoosevelt and Churchill, and he pointed out that we wouldn't have a \nchance to win this war without American manufacturing. He was talking \nabout the productivity of the American worker. ``The Glory and The \nDream'' by Manchester describes what this country did, what American \nmanufacturing did to turn out massive products in the form of liberty \nships, airplanes, tanks, and trucks; unbelievable. The American worker \nis an unbelievable force in this country.\n\n  When we come to the side of taxation, tell me the value system that \nsays, by the way, let us tax work but let us exempt investment. There \nis a fairness issue here that this Congress has a requirement to \nconfront, in my judgment. I know this issue is actually hanging up this \nbill between the House and the Senate. The House is insisting no, no, \nno, you have to substantially extend this lower tax rate for investment \nincome. I do not know.\n  Who is standing up here on the floor of the Senate saying I am \nstanding up for work, for the people who earn a wage? I am standing up \nfor the person who has to shower after work, people who sweat, work \nhard, earn an honest day's pay?\n  Finally, let me say this. Part of this is all about the noise of \ndemocracy, about debate, about coming to the same point from several \ndifferent intersections and different perspectives. I feel passionately \nand strongly about my perspective about trade. Our trade is way off \nbalance. It is going to injure this country. We are going to become a \nnation of sharecroppers. Warren Buffet makes that point. He is \nabsolutely dead right. Our fiscal policy is way off track.\n  People say the budget deficit is only $340 billion next year. \nNonsense. We will borrow $650 billion in additional debt. That is what \nour obligation is to our kids.\n  Trade is out of balance and our fiscal policy is way off track. I am \nnot suggesting there has to be a Republican or Democratic way to fix \nit. I am just suggesting that we ought to look truth right in the eye, \nthe President and the Congress, and say we have trouble here and we \nneed to fix it. Let us find a way to come together to fix it, get \ntogether with what everybody has to offer, that works for each, but \nfind a way to move this country forward.\n  I am pleased we are having this discussion today about our fiscal \npolicy, and I wanted to come over at least briefly today and weigh in \non some thoughts that I think are very important on trade and fiscal \npolicy, about the economic direction of this country, about the \ndirection we are headed, about things we can do--we, the President and \nCongress--all of us together can do to fix them so we have a brighter \nfuture and a future of expansion, of opportunity not just for some but \nfor all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to respond directly to my friend from \nNorth Dakota on a couple of points which he made in the context of the \ndiscussion of the legislation before us.\n  I wish to begin by quoting what the President said last night in his \nState of the Union Speech, and then I think we will see how it fits \ninto comments just made.\n  Last night, the President reported in his State of the Union Speech \nin terms of our economy.\n  He said:\n\n       Our economy is healthy, and vigorous, and growing faster \n     than other major industrialized nations. In the last two-and-\n     a-half years, America has created 4.6 million new jobs--more \n     than Japan and the Europeans Union combined. Even in the face \n     of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American \n     people have turned in an economic performance that is the \n     envy of the world.\n\n  Then he went on to say:\n\n       Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy \n     growing. And our economy grows when Americans have more of \n     their own money to spend, save, and invest. In the last five \n     years, the tax relief you passed has left 880 billion dollars \n     in the hands of American workers, investors, small \n     businesses, and families--and they have used it to help \n     produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic \n     growth. Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few \n     years. If we do nothing, American families will face a \n     massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome.\n       Because America needs more than a temporary expansion, we \n     need more than temporary tax relief.\n\n  Part of what is in the bill before us is designed to continue that \nsame tax policy.\n  There are, for example, funds to do what the President talked about \nlast night to stimulate research and development. There are tax \nprovisions that encourage people to do that. This legislation would \ncontinue those tax policies.\n  The President last night talked about educating our young people. \nWhen you pay college tuition, if you are not an itemizer, we believe \nyou should still have a tax deduction for that. As a result, this bill \nwould continue that tax policy. Those are the kinds of provisions that \nare embodied in the bill that is before us.\n  I ask my colleagues, almost two-thirds of us who voted for this very \nsame bill before, has something changed where we would not want to \ncontinue those kinds of tax policies, the kind of things that have \nhelped us to stimulate and continue this economic growth? It seems to \nme we want to continue those policies.\n  One of the things that has been discussed is not in the bill; that \nis, the tax on capital gains and dividends my friend from North Dakota \ntalked about. That is not in the bill before us. Nevertheless, it is a \ngood discussion to have because, as the President noted last night, \nthis is part of that tax package that has provided this great economic \ngrowth, and it is part of what the House of Representatives has passed.\n  When the bill goes to conference with the House of Representatives, \nit is very likely, and I think very desirable, that the continuation of \nthe tax rates on capital gains and dividends be included in the final \nconference report we will approve. Those rates expire in 2008. When \npeople are making investments today, they want to know what the tax \nrate is going to be when they invest. Is there a return on the \ninvestment, let us say in 4 years--4 years from now is 2010. What we \nwant to do is extend those rates from 2008 to 2010. If we don't, what \nwe are going to find, as the President said, is tax increases the \nAmerican people do not expect, do not appreciate, and it certainly \nwon't be good for the economy.\n  My friend from North Dakota said people who work hard and have a tax \non their wages get one set of taxes, but presumably people who do not \nwork hard and receive dividends or capital gains should not have a \nlower tax rate. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Tax Code \nand the way our economy works.\n  Take the person who put on his boots every day and went to work and \nfor 40 or 50 years paid income taxes, tried to save some money along \nthe way, and when he could invested that money because upon retirement \nhe does not want to be dependent upon Social Security benefits. He has \na small pension or he has invested in the stock market. He retires and \nhe is now faced with a situation where he is not receiving a wage \nanymore that he is paying taxes on. Instead, his income now is coming \nthrough the deferred gratification of the investment he made throughout \nthe years when instead of spending money he saved it and invested it. \nNow there are rewards coming to him in the form of dividends or capital \ngains--in other words, a return on his investment. That, plus Social \nSecurity, is now all he has to live on.\n  He paid income tax on that money. Make this point very clear: All his\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\nworking life he paid his income tax and his aftertax dollars went into \nthese investments. Now he is being taxed a second time on that money \nwhen he begins to get the return, when he gets dividends from his \ninvestment or capital gains. Yes, the tax rate is a little lower \ndepending upon what his taxable bracket is. It could be the same, but \nthe tax currently is 15 percent. Thank goodness, because the reduction \na few years ago from 20 percent down to 15 percent means we have had a \ntremendous stimulation for the economy. So this person has paid his \nincome tax and now he is paying another tax on capital gains or on \ndividends.\n  Actually, this is not just the second time this money is taxed; this \nmoney was also taxed when the corporation or the entity that earned the \nmoney earned it and had to pay its taxes. So the corporation pays its \ntaxes and then what is left over it either takes as profit or returns \npart of that profit in the form of dividends to the shareholders--our \nfriend now, the senior citizen we are talking about.\n  This money has been taxed at least three times now: When the income \nwas earned by the individual, when the corporation paid the tax on the \ninvestment, and when it provided the dividend to our senior citizen, \nthe retired fellow living in Sun City, AZ. And he now has to pay 15 \npercent on that again.\n  You can only tax this so many times. Yet we have found that by having \na Tax Code that tries to keep these taxes as low as possible, we are \nable not only to continue to stimulate investment, create jobs, and \nprovide a living for people, and then a retirement income, but also to \nprovide enough money for our Government to grow. We are spending a lot \nof money in this Government now. We are not standing still. We are \nspending far too much money, according to some--and I put myself in \nthat category. Revenues are not the problem with respect to our \ndeficit; we are spending too much. Our revenues exceeded the \nprojections last year by something like $270 billion or more. It was \n$100 billion more than we assumed at the beginning of last year. So we \nhave gotten far more in revenues than we ever expected. Why? Because \nour economy is growing so rapidly. What is one of the reasons it is \ngrowing? Because of the tax structure we have. That tax structure is \npart of what the legislation before the Senate intends to continue so \nwe cannot only leave more money in the hands of the people who provide \nthe growth for our country and provide for our families and small \nbusinesses but also provide the revenue for the Government to provide \nwhat they need, as well.\n  There was something else my friend from North Dakota said that is \nquite wrong. That is the comment that we provided tax relief for rich \npeople, that these dividends and capital gains are not for the average \nworking person, and that the tax policy we are promoting in this \nlegislation, therefore, does not help most Americans, that somehow it \nonly helps the wealthy.\n  I noted before the legislation before the Senate does not even \nmention the words ``capital gains'' or ``dividends,'' but we are \nassuming when the bill comes back from conference it will have those \ntaxes in it. One of the taxes we are seeking to ameliorate the effect \nof in this bill is the AMT. Almost everyone believes we either ought to \neliminate the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, or significantly reduce \nits impact on taxpayers. Let's take a look at what the AMT does to the \npeople in the country versus capital gain and dividends since, \naccording to my colleague, the latter two are good ways to raise \nrevenue and the AMT is a bad way.\n  Of all of the taxpayers in the AMT in 2003, the last year we have \nstatistics, 9.7 percent had an adjusted gross income of under $100,000. \nWe are talking about relief in the bill before the Senate that \npresumably most of my friends on the other side of the aisle are very \nmuch for, relief here for 9.7 percent of the filers having income of \nless than $100,000. The other people we are providing relief for were \nabove that, obviously.\n  Let's compare that with the people who are paying capital gains or \ndividends. Of all the taxpayers reporting capital gains income in the \nyear 2003, 67.5 percent had adjusted gross income under $100,000. Of \nall the taxpayers reporting dividends income in 2003, more than 70 \npercent had an adjusted gross income under $100,000.\n  If we are talking about trying to provide relief for the average \nAmerican family--maybe a two-worker family; their income, in any event, \nis less than $100,000--the AMT relief we are providing, 9.7 percent of \nthe folks we are providing relief for are in that under $100,000 \ncategory, whereas the relief we would be providing if we included the \ncapital gain and dividends would apply to 67.5 percent with respect to \ncapital gains and 70 percent with respect to dividend income. These are \nthe people, 70 percent, who report incomes of $100,000.\n  The fact is we have become a nation of investors. Over half of the \nAmerican people now are invested in the stock market. When we talk \nabout providing tax relief, we are providing tax relief for average \nfamilies, for small businesses and investors in America who rely on \nthese kinds of investments in their retirement years. More than half of \nall Americans own stock either directly or through mutual funds. In the \n2003 marginal rate on investment, marginal rate cut on investment \nincome worked by giving these investors an incentive to put more of \ntheir money at work in the markets. That is what stimulated the great \neconomic recovery we are enjoying now. At the lower rates, the tax \npenalty imposed on the additional investment earnings--the reward for \ntaking the additional risk--the penalty is smaller and thus the risk is \nmore attractive. That is why we have had this great economic recovery \nbecause people have been willing to invest more of their money getting \na greater return for that investment.\n\n  It is interesting that all of the guesses about what kind of income \nour economy would derive from capital gains, to take one of these \ntaxes, turned out to be incorrect. What we find is instead of the \ncapital gains rate cut cutting revenues, the capital gains rate cut \nfrom 20 percent to 15 percent in 2003 has actually increased revenues \nto the Treasury. In other words, this tax cut has more than paid for \nitself.\n  This is not just me saying it; this is according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the CBO. Its annual Budget and Economic Outlook, just \nreleased, shows the 2003 tax cut on capital gains has more than paid \nfor itself. What the CBO did was compare the estimated revenues from \ncapital gains with the actual revenues from capital gains. The actual \nliabilities from capital gains were $71 billion in 2004, $80 billion in \n2005 for a 2-year total of $151 billion. What was originally estimated \nto be the return from this tax? The sum of $125 billion. So there was \nan actual increase in revenue to the Federal Treasury of $26 billion. \nInstead of costing the Government $27 billion, which was originally \nestimated, the tax cuts actually earned the Government an extra $26 \nbillion.\n  The bottom line is that sometimes raising tax rates does not raise \ntax revenue. If you want to think of this in simple terms, say we want \nto bring in the maximum amount of revenue. Say we will put a tax on of \n100 percent. One cannot get any higher than that. How many of us would \nwork if 100 percent of our earnings would be taxed? I daresay not very \nmany. How about 90 percent? How about 80 percent? We still will not get \nmany takers. The point is, people will not work or invest, put their \ncapital at greater risk, if the tax penalty is so great it is not worth \nit. The object is for Government to find that level which produces the \nmost revenue to the Treasury with the least amount of damage to the \neconomy. In other words, it encourages people to work or encourages \npeople to invest to the maximum extent and that extent, then, produces \nthe maximum amount of revenue.\n  Basically, one thing we found from the tax rate reduction from 20 \npercent to 15 percent with capital gains is 20 percent was still too \nhigh. With 15 percent people were far more willing to invest. It put \ntheir money at risk. And because so much of that activity occurred, the \nrevenues, even with lower rates, far exceeded the revenues at the \nhigher rates. That is why the House of Representatives has included in \nits legislation a 2-year continuation of this same 15-percent rate for \ncapital gain and dividends because it will actually produce more \nrevenues to the Treasury because more Americans will invest\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\nand will save, because this will provide more job creation and provide \ncontinued economic growth in our country.\n  Since over half of Americans are investors in our stock market, since \nmore than 70 percent of those earning $100,000 or less receive this \nbenefit with respect to capital gains and with respect to dividends, \n67.5 percent, clearly this is designed to help most Americans.\n  I find it ironic my colleagues who are so insistent on doing \nsomething to fix the problem of the AMT are talking about only 9.7 \npercent of the people with adjusted gross incomes under $100,000. When \nsometimes people loosely say, your tax cuts are only for the rich, I \nguess I would say to my friends, your tax cuts are for the rich, if you \nare focusing mostly on the alternative minimum tax.\n\n  Now, I happen to think we should provide relief in all of those \nareas. That is why I think what we are doing in this legislation--to \nprovide relief from the alternative minimum tax; and then, assuming the \nHouse of Representatives includes it in the conference, for dividends \nand capital gains, when the bill comes back to us--we will ensure that \nnot only will we be able to continue to help our families and our small \nbusinesses but also to ensure that we will continue to have economic \ngrowth in this country. That is why I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the legislation before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank our leader on the \nDemocratic side on this committee for his leadership on this issue and \nso many others. I thank also my colleague from Iowa, the chairman of \nthe committee, who always tries to work things in a bipartisan way. In \nfact, on this issue which I will be speaking about, the alternative \nminimum tax, we have tried in the Senate to work in a bipartisan way on \na proposal that passed earlier.\n  I rise in support of two amendments that I have filed with my \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, on the important issue of \nthe alternative minimum tax.\n  It is unclear right now when the majority will let us bring up either \nof these amendments for a vote. But the issue is an extremely important \none. It cannot be swept under the rug. I want to alert my colleagues to \nwhat we will do.\n  AMT relief is a critical part of the Senate's version of this bill, \nand we all must do everything we can to ensure that this tax--which \naffects middle-class and upper-middle-class taxpayers, above all--is \naddressed this year.\n  In fact, this body will have a choice: whether we take the money we \ncan use for tax cuts and give it to the person who is in the middle \nclass or slightly above middle class or give it to people whose income \nis above $1 million. That is the choice that faces us.\n  Our first amendment would substitute the Senate-passed AMT relief for \nthe 2-year extension of the tax cuts on dividends and capital gains \nwhich were signed into law in 2003 but do not expire until the end of \n2008. The amendment contains the necessary offsets so that the overall \nbill stays within the parameters in the budget resolution.\n  The second amendment is a sense of the Senate. Senator Menendez and I \nwill be joined, I believe, by Senators Feinstein and Kerry on that one \nas well. It simply states that providing relief from the alternative \nminimum tax should be a higher priority for the Congress than providing \na tax cut on dividends and capital gains in 2009.\n  It is simple, straightforward, and, in my view, should hardly be \ncontroversial because whatever your views are on the preference of \nwhich tax, the alternative minimum tax will go up this coming fiscal \nyear; whereas, the dividends and capital gains do not expire until \n2009.\n  Now, it would be nearly impossible to overstate the AMT issue in its \nimportance and its urgency. The individual alternative minimum tax was \nenacted in 1969 as a supplemental tax on wealthy tax evaders, but, \nunfortunately, as incomes have risen, it has evolved into a tax on \nmillions of middle-class working families, particularly families in \nwhich both parents work and families with two or more children--hardly \npeople we would want to penalize.\n  Some people say it has evolved from a ``class tax'' into a ``mass \ntax.'' Other people say it has evolved from a ``wealth tax'' into a \n``stealth tax.'' But whatever you call it, it is something that catches \nunsuspecting middle-class families by surprise. And starting next year, \nit will explode in significance if Congress fails to act.\n  In fact, by the end of the decade, the AMT will ensnare more than 30 \nmillion taxpayers, the majority of whom will have incomes below \n$100,000. The National Taxpayer Advocate at the IRS has identified the \nalternative minimum tax as the most serious problem facing individual \ntaxpayers.\n  There is an important point I want to make for my colleagues. The AMT \nis often portrayed as a tax that is most problematic for residents of \nso-called blue States, such as New York, California, Massachusetts, New \nJersey. It certainly affects my State. But that is not the truth, the \nwhole truth, that it just affects ``blue'' States. There are a whole \nlot of ``red'' States or ``purple'' States that have a significant \npercentage of taxpayers affected by the AMT, including States of \ncolleagues from across the aisle: Oregon, Virginia, Minnesota, Ohio, \nMaine, Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. So this problem is \nnot a ``red'' State or ``blue'' State issue or a partisan issue. It is \nsimply an issue of national importance.\n\n  Here are a few statistics I want to mention to my colleagues. They \nare quite astounding. The year 2006 is the ``tipping point'' for the \nAMT. The number of taxpayers affected will explode from 3.6 million to \nmore than 19 million, if the Congress fails to act. A family with two \nchildren will become subject to the AMT at about $67,500 of income in \n2006. That is hardly anybody who is wealthy. People with that income \noften struggle. I know many of them myself. And a family with five \nchildren will start owing in the AMT at about $54,000 of income this \nyear, if Congress does not act.\n  In 2004, only 6.2 percent of families earning between $100,000 and \n$200,000 a year were subject to the AMT. It will explode to 50 percent \nthis year. Half of all people making above $100,000 but below $200,000 \nwill be affected. They are hardly rich.\n  And starting in 2008, the average married couple with two children \nearning $75,000 will find that more than half of the tax cuts they have \nbeen expecting from the laws passed since George Bush became President \nwill be taken back via the AMT, if Congress fails to act.\n  There are two main reasons why the AMT relief should be a high \npriority for the Congress rather than extending the cuts on dividends \nand capital gains. The first has to do with fairness, the second with \ntiming.\n  If the AMT relief is extended through 2006, about two-thirds of the \nbenefits will be realized by families earning under $200,000. It \naffects people whose income is between $50,000 and $200,000--not the \npoorest people in our society but people who get clobbered by taxes, by \nlarge expenses, and who do not simply have the necessary income.\n  More than half of the total benefits will go to families with incomes \nbetween $100,000 and $200,000. In New York, and many other States, \nparticularly in or near major cities, a combined income of $100,000 or \n$150,000 does not make you rich.\n  Contrast this with the tax relief for dividends and capital gains, \nwhere more than half of the total benefit goes to families with over $1 \nmillion in income. This is more than 50 percent of the benefit going to \nless than one-half of 1 percent of all the taxpayers in the country. So \nwe are faced with a choice here. This is not our classic tax cuts \nversus spending. This is, rather, tax cuts for the very wealthy versus \ntax cuts for the middle- and upper-middle-income range.\n  Now, some Members say some people do not like it when we point out \nthese lopsided statistics. They say it is ``class warfare.'' This is \nnot class warfare. This is just the obvious truth of prioritizing tax \ncuts. And a dividend and capital gains cut put ahead of AMT relief \nhurts the hard-working middle class. No amount of rhetoric can change \nthat.\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\n  I want my colleagues to think about what it means for the AMT to \nstart hitting families with children making $75,000 or $100,000. These \nare the same families facing higher health care costs, higher tuition \ncosts, higher energy costs. And they will soon start to lose their tax \ncuts to the AMT.\n  A police officer and a schoolteacher in my city of New York will \nalmost certainly be pushed into the AMT, if they have not been already. \nA Georgia family, maybe a marine biologist at the new Atlanta aquarium \nand her insurance broker husband, will pay the AMT, if we do nothing. A \ncomputer programmer in Virginia, married to a firefighter; or a \nprofessor in Oregon, married to a vintner that makes some of the \nState's great pinot noir; or two factory workers in Ohio--all these \nfamilies would be subject to the AMT if we fail to act.\n  There is something else these families likely have in common; and \nthat is, the dividends and the capital gains cuts passed in 2003 helped \nthem very little, if at all. The reason for this is most middle-class \nfamilies who own stocks, bonds, or mutual funds have them in either a \nretirement plan or a savings plan for their kid's education. That is \nwhere my family's savings go right now.\n  These middle-class families probably own very little in terms of \ntaxable investments. Their savings are already growing tax free. So \nthey get very little benefit from the lower rates on dividends and \ncapital gains. That is why these tax cuts benefit the very wealthy. It \nis because most of the stocks and bonds owned by the middle class--and \nthat is a lot--but they are shielded from tax already.\n  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about the so-\ncalled investor class and point out, correctly, how, for the first \ntime, more than half of all Americans own stock. Senator Kyl made this \npoint a moment ago. But the truth is, most middle-class families own \nvery little in the way of taxable investments. More than three-quarters \nof Americans earn less than $1,000 a year in taxable income from \ndividends and capital gains.\n  Let me repeat this because it may be a surprise to some. More than \nthree-quarters of American families earn less than $1,000 in taxable \nincome from dividends and capital gains.\n  So in terms of priorities, in terms of whom it affects, we should \nprefer the AMT, whatever we feel about dividends and capital gains \ncuts. And I am not averse to those cuts in a nonbudget-deficit \nsituation.\n  How about timing? This is even more obvious. Consider the statistics \nI mentioned and who will become subject to the AMT this year if we fail \nto act. Now consider when each tax takes effect, when it bites. Capital \ngains, dividends, not until 2009. AMT, immediately, in the next fiscal \nyear. Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle make the \nargument we need to extend the relief now since the market is counting \non it. They say it is ``built'' into the market, and the stock market \nwill decline if we do not extend those cuts today. That is simply not \ntrue.\n\n  If there's one thing I know about investing--and a lot of people in \nmy State make a living at it--it's this: People who are really affected \nby these rates who buy and sell significant amounts of stocks and bonds \nare sophisticated investors, and they follow politics. They know that \nCongress changes tax laws all the time. It is hard to believe people \nare investing their money today based on what the tax rate might be \nyears from now when they finally sell that investment. Smart \nbusinesspeople, smart investors make their investment decisions based \non market factors, not on what Congress might or might not do, \nparticularly in this type of situation where it is simply this year or \nnext year.\n  And, of course, there is the obvious argument that if making all of \nthese tax laws consistent and permanent was so important, then the \nleadership on the other side should not have pushed for reconciliation \nprotection in the first place. They should have compromised back in \n2001 and 2003 and passed less ideological legislation within the \nSenate's normal rules of procedure.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the Senate was right the first time. \nAfter some initial debate in the Finance Committee, we passed out a \nbipartisan bill that excluded the dividends and capital gains cuts and \nprovided generous AMT relief for 2006 that will keep nearly 8 million \nfamilies out of the AMT this year. That bill passed the Senate with 64 \nvotes, and I encourage Chairman Grassley to bring a similar bipartisan \nbill back from conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMontana. I commend my colleague from New York for that very eloquent \nand lucid description of what the challenges facing 8 million families \nare with respect to the AMT.\n  I rise to talk about Katrina. I introduced legislation to establish a \nKatrina commission last year. I am proud to have 17 cosponsors. I \nintend to offer this legislation as an amendment on this bill or any \nother bill that is coming before the Senate.\n  Now, I can imagine some asking: Why are we talking about a Katrina \ncommission on the tax reconciliation bill? The answer is that the White \nHouse is stonewalling the ongoing House and Senate investigations, as \nmany of us feared and warned that they would. And something must be \ndone about it.\n  I commend our colleagues in the Senate on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, led by Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, for their \ndiligent, persistent efforts to try to get information that would \nanswer the questions that people have about what happened.\n  Stonewalling the investigation into a storm that killed over 1,000 of \nour fellow Americans, displaced hundreds of thousands, and cost over \n$100 billion in damages is something every American should wonder \nabout.\n  Last week, it was reported that the White House is declining to turn \nover key documents related to Hurricane Katrina and that senior White \nHouse officials will not provide sworn testimony about the failed \nFederal response to the people in the gulf region. Other reports \nindicate that the White House Situation Room, which is the nerve center \nof the White House crisis response, received reports that a storm like \nKatrina would cause severe flooding and breaching of the levees, but \napparently that was not a priority. There are reports that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has attorneys telling witnesses not to \ntalk about any communications whatsoever between the Department of \nHomeland Security and the White House. In fact, reports indicate that \nMichael Brown, whom we will remember as ``heck of a job, Brownie,'' the \nformer head of FEMA, is now refusing to provide testimony because FEMA \nlawyers are advising him not to tell the congressional committees when \nhe talked to the President and what he said, if he did, about damage \nand destruction on the ground.\n  Just today the Comptroller General of the United States issued a GAO \nreport which stated that there was a complete failure of leadership at \nthe highest levels of our Government after the storm hit and that there \nneeds to be a single person put in charge.\n  There are also reports that the Army Corps of Engineers may not be \nproviding adequate information to investigators. We have heard that a \nteam of independent engineering experts, whose work is funded by the \nNational Science Foundation, say they have grown frustrated with the \nArmy Corps. In fact, it has been reported that the Corps has refused to \nrelease information needed to fully understand the levee failures that \nleft so much of New Orleans shattered and soaked.\n  If we don't have an open, broad-ranging inquiry into why the levees \nfailed, if the Army Corps is not responding to independent engineering \nexperts, can we, with any confidence, expect that whatever kind of \npatchwork is going on now will secure those levees when the next \nhurricane season comes around starting next summer?\n  There are separate committees in the House and Senate conducting \ntheir own hearings, seeking to establish what happened. We have to be \nabsolutely\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\nunafraid to face the facts, wherever they take us. People's lives are \nat stake. A great part of our country is devastated. I have been there. \nI have seen the destruction with my colleague, Senator Landrieu. It is \nheartbreaking.\n  How do we know that the money we are appropriating, that we are \nsending somewhere to someone--independent contractors and other \nrecipients, billions of dollars of taxpayer money--is doing what needs \nto be done when we don't know what was wrong the first time they did \nit?\n  I hope we look to the model of the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 \nCommission was instrumental in both helping America understand what \nhappened and beginning a process of us coming together to try to make \nsure it doesn't happen again. We had a dedicated group of citizens who \nlost loved ones who came to the Congress month after month, who went to \nthe White House and said: We want to know why our husbands, our wives, \nour children, our parents died. You have to give us answers.\n  I was heartened when I saw in the last several days a dedicated group \nof citizens from the impacted gulf coast region, called Women of the \nStorm, were up here demanding answers and actions. They deserve no \nless. These are our fellow Americans. These are our brothers and \nsisters. I commend them for coming to Washington to petition their \nGovernment. But if we do not establish this commission, I fear they \nwill not ever get the information they deserve. Even worse, we may make \nthe same mistakes again.\n  In this GAO report, it refers to a study that was done after \nHurricane Andrew in southern Florida. There were a series of \nrecommendations made. The Clinton White House followed the \nrecommendations. People were put in charge. There was a chain of \ncommand. Information went up. Decisions were made. FEMA, on the Clinton \nadministration's watch, functioned. It was filled with experts, not \ncronies. In 5 short years, all that work was undone.\n  So here we are, after the worst natural disaster in modern times, \nafter having demoralized and defunded FEMA, after having created the \nbehemoth Department of Homeland Security, and no one was in charge. I \nguess that is what the White House doesn't want anybody to figure out; \nalthough, frankly, I think we have a pretty good idea that no one was \nin charge. But we need to fix our systems.\n  I will, once again, be offering a Katrina commission amendment. I \nwill, once again, try to help the people of the gulf coast get the \nanswers they deserve. I will, once again, call on us to do what we did \nafter 9/11, put together an independent commission--appointed by \nDemocrats and Republicans--of distinguished people who can concentrate \non this issue. They are not in Congress, responding to a million \ndifferent pressures. Give them the power to get the answers and give us \nthe recommendations that we need in order to make sure that no part of \nour country, no American ever faces both the natural and manmade \ndisaster that happened on the gulf coast.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on another matter, I am speaking now \nbecause we are waiting for the Senator from North Dakota. I ask \nunanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             National Guard\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of our National Guard, \nand I want to express my serious concern for their future.\n  The National Guard comprises only 45 percent of the entire Department \nof Defense budget, yet next week when the President's budget and the \nQuadrennial Defense Review are presented to Congress, the Guard's force \nstructure may be dangerously reduced. There is a grave national \nsecurity danger in doing this, and quite simply, it just does not make \nsense.\n  Last night in his State of the Union Address, the President stated \nthat ``we remain on the offensive in Afghanistan and Iraq.'' At a time \nwhen we cannot forsee any cutbacks in our military commitments at home \nand abroad, why are we proposing cutbacks in our National Guard?\n  The Guard is now fighting overseas in unprecedented numbers. In the \nglobal war on terrorism, over 50 percent of the land combat forces in \nIraq are Army National Guard and over 85 percent of available Army \nNational Guard units have been mobilized. The Air National Guard is \nproviding over 50 percent airlift capability.\n  Since September 11, 2001, about 80 percent of Montana's National \nGuard members have been deployed to the Middle East, some of them more \nthan once. Our guardsmen have never failed a mission. In fact, they \nhave gone above and beyond, and they have fought with maturity and \nexperience.\n  Reports estimate that the Department of Defense will be carrying out \nacross-the-board cuts of up to 26,000 Guard personnel. On January 18, \nthe Secretary of the Army confirmed that DoD has proposed making cuts \nto the number of brigade combat teams. Their ground units are in \nPennsylvania, North Carolina, Washington State, Tennessee, Mississippi, \nLouisiana, Minnesota and Idaho.\n  In Montana, the National Guard's 1-163rd Infantry Battalion is a \nsubordinate unit of the 116th Brigade Combat Team of the Idaho National \nGuard. This is one of the units to face troop reduction, and the loss \nof this unit would mean the loss of 800 of Montana's Army National \nGuardsmen. That's one third of the Montana Army National Guard.\n  The Guard predicts that the payroll losses associated with these jobs \ncould reach $15.5 million.\n  Our Governors and adjutant generals should not have to send guardsmen \nto war without the security that those troops will have jobs and a \nfuture when they return home.\n  We are treating our guardsmen as active-duty members with full time \ndemands, but not in the benefits that they receive. Let me emphasize \nthe danger that this presents to the volunteerism that has kept our \nguard going. Montana has a proud tradition of serving our country, and \nwe need the resources of our National Guard.\n  Montana is a rural, northern border State, and it is crucial that we \nhave our guardsmen to fight fires, support law enforcement, and support \nhomeland security initiatives.\n  I traveled to the Gulf States days after Hurricane Katrina hit, and I \nsaw first-hand the valuable and unique emergency response capabilities \nof Montana's guardsmen who had been deployed to the region. The Guard \nhas a dual role, and we must have them available to fulfill these \nrequirements at home.\n  Last night, regarding Iraq, President Bush said, ``We must stand \nbehind the military in this vital mission.'' The President is a former \nGovernor and National Guardsmen. So I have no doubt that the President \nis aware of the Guard's immense contribution to our Nation.\n  I stand behind our military and I support the National Guard \nAssociation, the Governors, and the adjutant generals in their \nopposition to all reductions in National Guard troop structure.\n  Last week, I joined Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Lindsey Graham, and \nothers from both sides of the aisle as an original cosponsor of a \nresolution which calls for the Department of Defense to consult the \nGovernors and the TAGs whenever there are decisions to make changes to \nthe Guard. I have joined that National Guard Caucus' letter to \nSecretary Rumsfeld, and I have sent my own letters to Secretary \nRumsfeld and the President.\n  Last summer, I fought hard on behalf of Montana's 120th Fighter Wing \nwhen DoD proposed closing their base. I should not be here again.\n  Our Air Guard last year won the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the \nMaintenance Effectiveness Award, and the Air Force Security Forces \nAward, while standing alert and deploying to Iraq. Montana's Army Guard \nhas deployed many times overseas and the 1-163rd Infantry Battalion has \njust returned from an 18 month deployment in Iraq.\n  Our brave National Guards men and women join the ranks of many other \nmilitary personnel and lay their lives on the line to help protect the \nfreedoms we enjoy as Montanans and\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\nAmericans. At a time when our Guard is already stretched too thin, we \nshould not be sacrificing manpower. We should be boosting it. The \nNational Guard is the backbone of our armed services, and troop \nreductions of any kind would be detrimental to the Nation and to my \nhome State of Montana.\n  While I am waiting for the Senator from North Dakota--he wants to \nspeak for about 35 minutes, and he is the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee--let me again remind Senators of where we are. Essentially, \nwe are still on the House bill. My sense is that the majority leader, \nin the not too distant future, will offer the Senate amendment as a \nsubstitute. It will include the perfecting amendment by Senator \nGrassley and myself. It is my hope that the perfecting amendment can be \nadopted by voice vote. I think it is not controversial. Then we will \nhave before us both bills, the House bill, as well as the Senate \nsubstitute amendment. I am not sure how much time remains. We have 20 \nhours on this bill. But it is my expectation and my hope that Senators \nwill come up quickly and offer amendments.\n  I might say to my very good friend, the chairman of the committee, we \nface an alternative. Frankly, I hope we can work this out in a way that \nis amicable to Senators. We have two options. One option is to fill a \ntree; that is, prevent any amendments from coming up until we get to \nthe expiration of the 20 hours. At that point, Senators can offer \namendments because when you get off the bill and pass the bill, we have \nto start taking down the tree.\n  When the tree starts coming down, amendments come down, and Senators \ncan offer amendments then. Although we will be in a vote-arama \nsituation, time will not have expired for the purpose of offering \namendments. Senators will still be able to offer amendments. The \nquestion is, Is it better all the way around to have the tree filled \nand offer those amendments when we get to the so-called vote-arama, or \nis it better to let Senators offer their amendments earlier and \naccommodate Senators a little more because we are going to get the 20 \nhours one way or the other?\n  It is my thought that probably if Senators are allowed to offer \namendments earlier on--that is, the tree is not filled up--and there is \nan accommodation made to Senators who are going to offer amendments \nanyway, that we may be able to proceed more expeditiously because \nSenators will be accommodated and won't be upset and so forth. On the \nother hand, if the tree is filled and Senators are not allowed to offer \namendments until afterward--I don't know this; I am just saying this \nbecause it is a possibility or speculation--that Senators may say: I \nwas denied my opportunity, and I can't offer it now. They didn't give \nme an opportunity to offer my amendment. Maybe he wasn't going to offer \nit anyway.\n  I raise that question for the majority to think about as we decide \nhow to proceed on this bill. Many Senators have come up to me and said \nthey wanted to offer an amendment. That is a Senator's right. I have \nsaid to them I understand that, but I am not sure when they will be \nable to offer them. They will be able to anyway, but the question is \nwhether they will be able to do it earlier or later. I know that is not \na decision that is going to be decided at this point, but it is a \ndecision I think we are going to have to deal with. My general view is \nit is better to work with people than not. Generally, if you work with \npeople, you are more likely to get matters resolved more expeditiously \nand more amicably. I raise that point for the consideration of all \nconcerned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my response to that is a friendly \nresponse. It is not a very definitive response because I think my \nfriend from Montana knows that some of these negotiations go on at a \nlittle higher level than he and I are in leadership.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No negotiation goes on higher than the chairman of the \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, there are other considerations that come into \nthis. I will put it in this perspective. First of all, I hope what he \nsays could happen. It seems to me that, No. 1, we are kind of in an \nenvironment where we believe we are wasting some time, in the sense \nthat we are going through a lot of procedural motions that redebate \nsomething that was decided in a bipartisan way by this body back on \nDecember 18 on a 64-to-something vote, a very bipartisan vote. \nNormally, what we are doing now is trying to go to conference. We are \nfaced with a lot of amendments--some that might be the same as what we \ndealt with previously. So that is kind of an environment that maybe a \nlot of us believe we should not have to go through because it is a \nwaste of time. But now that is a fact of life. That is how the Senate \noperates.\n  So as what my friend, the distinguished Senator from Montana, said, \nit boils down to this: To the extent we can have a massive amount of \ntransparency on what might be offered, with some limit on the number of \namendments that might be offered, and get that settled very soon, then \nwhat happened in the sense of him saying we would fill up the tree with \namendments, we would not do that.\n\n  That is what we would like to do. But it seems to me there has been \nsome inability to know exactly how many amendments might come from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, what they were, and the extent to which \nthey were germane versus nongermane. Obviously, the more that are \nnongermane as opposed to germane makes it even more difficult. If we \ncan settle those things--I know Senator Baucus and I could settle those \nthings, and we could be on our way to not filling the tree. So far we \nhave not seen that sort of transparency.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, my good friend makes a very good point. I \nhad a chuckle to myself because, I say to my friend, I am not even \naware of all of the amendments. The Senators don't come to me, frankly, \nas I would like them to. It makes it difficult to decide some of these \nissues. The Senator makes a good point. Over the next hour and a half \nor so, let's sit down and see what we can do to work out a list the \nbest we can to get a sense of things so that we can proceed more \nexpeditiously.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I always anticipate the picture show \nthat we are going to have now from the Senator from North Dakota. \nAnyway, I hope he will be tolerant. I have always wanted to engage him \nin some debate on these issues because I think he always tells half the \nstory. I don't think he ever says anything that is wrong, but the whole \nstory could give a different impression to the public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield up to 35 minutes to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, the ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his courtesy. I \nalso laud his very good work and the chairman's good work in putting \nthis package together. I know we enjoy these debates. I certainly enjoy \nthem because we have found a way to disagree without being \ndisagreeable.\n  Mr. President, I also say to my colleagues that I believe deeply that \nthe additional tax cuts ought to be paid for. At the appropriate time, \nI will offer a way of paying for them. I think the package that the \nchairman and the ranking member put together is a responsible package. \nThere are things that need to be done for the American people and the \nAmerican economy. The one difference I have is I would really like to \nsee it paid for. I think there is a way to do that.\n  In addition, I will be offering, at the appropriate time, a pay-go \namendment to go back to the budget disciplines we have used in the past \nthat say: If you are going to have more tax cuts, pay for them. If you \nare going to have new mandatory spending, pay for it. I very strongly \nbelieve we have to restore those budget disciplines. It is also the \nview of the departing chairman of the central bank in this country, \nChairman Greenspan. I think it is the view of most people who are \nseriously interested in restoring fiscal discipline to this country \nthat we have to restore the pay-go rules that functioned very well for \nthe country in the 1990s.\n  The reason I am so concerned is I look at our budget situation today, \nand here is what I see. We have just had, in these last 4 years, four \nof the biggest budget deficits in the history of the country. In fact, \nwe have, in the case of these four budgets, the four biggest deficits \nwe have ever had in dollar terms. That is coming off the last year\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\nof the Clinton administration when we had a surplus. Of course, the \nyear before in the Clinton administration we had an even larger \nsurplus.\n  Last year, the deficit was $318 billion. This year, they are \nforecasting $337 billion, but they are leaving out certain things. If \nyou put back the things that they have left out, we can now anticipate \na deficit of about $360 billion this year.\n  That is just the beginning of the story. The situation we face with \nthe debt is really far more serious. The deficit, as we project it this \nyear, of $364 billion--it is a little more than that, but look at how \nbig the debt is going to grow. The debt is going to grow not by $364 \nbillion but by over $637 billion. I don't see the media cover the \ngrowth of the debt. All they want to talk about is the deficit because \nthat is the story they are used to writing. The problem is that things \nhave changed.\n  Well, what has changed? The biggest thing is that Social Security \nsurpluses are growing, and growing dramatically year after year. And \nthe idea was to prepare for the retirement of the baby boom generation. \nThe problem is, this Congress and this administration are taking the \nmoney. They are taking every penny of the Social Security surplus--it \nis not really a surplus at all because we are going to need every dime \nwhen the baby boomers retire. But instead of using that money that is \nin surplus this year, this Congress and this administration are taking \nevery dime to pay other bills.\n  When you look at every other trust fund, they are raiding every trust \nfund in sight. The result is, instead of $360 billion being added to \nthe debt, the real increase in the debt would be over $600 billion--not \njust this year, but every single year of this 5-year budget deal, at \nthe very time the President is telling us: Don't worry, we are going to \ncut the deficit in half over the next 5 years.\n  The problem is, the deficit does improve over the next 5 years, but \ngrowth of the debt keeps getting worse. Why the difference? Because \nSocial Security surpluses are growing every year to prepare for the \nretirement of the baby boom generation. But we are not using the money \nto either prepay debt or pay down the debt or prefund the liability. \nInstead, we are taking, and the President is taking every dime to pay \nother bills.\n  Here is the pattern of expenditures and revenues of the Federal \nGovernment, going back to 1980. The red line is the expenditure line of \nthe Federal Government. You can see that during the 1990s each and \nevery year spending as a share of gross domestic product came down. Why \ndo it as a percentage of gross domestic product? Every economist will \ntell you that is the fairest comparison to make. That takes out the \neffect of inflation. The same is done with the revenue line. You can \nsee that during the 1990s revenue went up every year and the result of \ndeclining expenditures and rising revenue was to eliminate the deficit, \nand during the 3 or 4 golden years here, we eliminated deficit spending \nand reduced the growth of the debt. Then President Bush came into \noffice and spending has gone up. In fairness to him, spending went up \nbecause of the increased spending for defense, the increased spending \nfor homeland security, and rebuilding New York. Just those three items \nexplain about 90 percent of the discretionary spending increase.\n  You can see that spending as a share of GDP is still substantially \nbelow where it was in all of the 1980s and much of the 1990s. So while \nit is true that we have had a substantial increase in spending, we are \nstill well below where we were in all of the 1980s and a big chunk of \nthe 1990s.\n  On the revenue side of the equation, President Bush came into office \nhere and he said revenue was at a record high. He was right. Look what \nhas happened--the revenue side of the equation has collapsed. And while \nit is true we had an uptick last year and the year before, we are still \nway below the historical average for the 1980s and 1990s.\n  Going forward, you can see we have this big gap between projected \nspending and projected revenue. The result is a never-ending stream of \ndeficits and burgeoning debt.\n  Some have said the tax cuts of the Bush era show that if you cut \ntaxes, you get more revenue. No, it doesn't show that. In fact, revenue \nhas just recovered last year over where it was--just gotten back to \nwhere it was in 2000. We have not had increases in revenue. As a share \nof GDP, here is what happened to revenue. It collapsed. It is this \ncombination of increased spending, dramatically reduced revenue--and a \nbig chunk of this is because of the tax cut. That combination has \nplunged us into record deficits and even more rapidly growing debt.\n  My colleagues, this is utterly unsustainable. My colleagues say when \nyou cut taxes, you get more revenue. No, you don't. You would have \ngotten more revenue had you not cut taxes.\n  Look, here is the reality. Back in 2000, the revenue was just over $2 \ntrillion. It took until 2005 for the revenue side of the equation to \ncome back to where it was 5 years before. Again, as a share of GDP, we \nhave never gotten back. We are nowhere close to where we were, and I \ndon't advocate we should get back to where we were because revenue was \nat record levels. We are nowhere near close to the average of the \neighties and nineties.\n  On individual income taxes, we are still below where we were in 2000, \nand by 10 percent. So the notion that if you cut taxes you get more \nrevenue is a great theory, but it has not worked in reality.\n  The President says to us we are going to cut the deficit in half over \nthe next 5 years. No. 1, I don't believe that ought to be the goal \nbecause if you look at the President's plan, the deficits explode right \nbeyond the 5-year window. But in addition to that, the only way the \nPresident reaches his conclusion is he leaves out all kinds of items. \nHe leaves out war costs, he leaves out the cost to fix the alternative \nminimum tax, and he leaves out the effect of his making the tax cuts \npermanent.\n  When we add all those items back in, including his defense buildup, \nhere is what we see in terms of the deficits, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, adjusted for the things that have been \nleft out. Here is what we see, the long-term deficit outlook. In fact, \nit is an ocean of red ink that gets much worse past the year 2011.\n  This is the harsh reality of the Bush plan. It is a plan of \nburgeoning deficit, of massive debt, and at the worst possible time, \nright before the baby boomers retire.\n  The President of the United States is, in effect, hiding from the \nAmerican people the full consequences of his proposals because he stops \nhis budget after 5 years. But here is what happens right beyond the 5-\nyear window.\n  He has dramatically underfunded long-term war costs. Fifty billion \ndollars has been appropriated for war costs in 2006 so far. The CBO \nestimates of additional outlays for ongoing military operations are \n$378 billion.\n  The President says he is going to cut the deficit in half, but he \naccomplishes that by leaving out things we all know we are going to \nhave to pay for. War cost is No. 1. The President dramatically \nunderstates what the war is going to cost.\n  Here is the big enchilada. The President said last night: Make the \ntax cuts permanent. This dotted line on this chart is the next 5 years. \nThis is what it costs over the next 5 years to make the tax cuts \npermanent. We see it is very modest. Look what happens to the cost of \nmaking the tax cuts permanent right beyond the 5-year budget window. \nThe costs of the tax cuts absolutely explode. Total cost over 10 years \nto make the tax cuts permanent is over $2.2 trillion.\n  That is the President's plan. He has no plan to pay for it. He is not \ncutting spending to cover this difference. We are already at record \ndeficits. The baby boomers are just going to begin to retire, and the \nPresident says: Dig the hole deeper; dig it deeper; let's have more \ndebt. What kind of a plan is that for America's future, more debt.\n  It is not just the war cost the President has left out or \nunderstated, it is not just the full effects of making the tax cuts \npermanent, but the President has left out entirely the cost of fixing \nthe alternative minimum tax.\n  The alternative minimum tax is the old millionaire's tax that is \nrapidly becoming a middle-class tax trap. If we don't act on the \nalternative minimum tax, it is going to affect 20 million people this \nyear--20 million people. It takes $1 trillion over 10 years to fix the\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\nalternative minimum tax. The President doesn't have a dime in his \nbudget to deal with this.\n  This is the problem we have. We have an air of unreality in this town \nabout where we are headed. Here is what the President told us back in \n2001:\n\n        . . . [M]y budget pays down a record amount of national \n     debt. We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next \n     decade. That will be the largest debt reduction of any \n     country, ever. Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay \n     back money that we have borrowed. We owe this kind of \n     responsibility to our children and grandchildren.\n\n  That is what the President said when he embarked on this course: \nPaydown of the debt. Let's do a reality check and look at what has \nhappened versus what the President said. See any paydown of debt going \non here? Any paydown of debt? There is no paydown of debt.\n  Leading up to this, when the President came in, the debt was $5 \ntrillion. The debt was below the bottom of this chart. The bottom of \nthis chart is $7 trillion. The debt was below the bottom of this chart \nwhen the President started. He has increased the debt by $3 trillion. \nThat is in 5 years. He said he was going to pay down the debt by $2 \ntrillion. Instead, he has increased the debt by $3 trillion, and that \nis where we are today.\n  But look where we are headed under his plan. He is going to add \nanother $3.5 trillion over the next 5 years. He has already added $3 \ntrillion; now he is going to add another $3.5 trillion. We are going to \nhave $12 trillion of debt by the time this President's plan is done.\n  What difference does it make? Ask yourself this question: Where are \nwe getting the money? Where are we getting the money to float this \nboat? Increasingly, we are borrowing this money from abroad. When we \nhave a debt auction, increasingly the ones who are buying our debt are \nforeigners.\n  It is very instructive. It took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 \ntrillion of external debt, debt of ours held by foreigners. This \nPresident has more than doubled that amount in 5 years. That is utterly \nunsustainable. Foreign holdings of U.S. debt have doubled under this \nPresident in just 5 years.\n\n  The result is we owe Japan almost $700 billion. We owe China $250 \nbillion. We owe the United Kingdom over $220 billion. My favorite, the \nCaribbean banking centers, we now owe them over $115 billion. We owe \nTaiwan $71 billion. We owe OPEC almost $70 billion. We owe South Korea \nover $60 billion. We owe Germany, Canada, Hong Kong, and up and up it \ngoes, debt on top of debt.\n  Now the Secretary of the Treasury writes us a letter on December 29. \nThat is an interesting time to write us, the week between Christmas and \nNew Year's when Congress is not here and nobody is paying attention. \nWhat does the Secretary of the Treasury say to us:\n\n       The administration now projects the statutory debt limit, \n     currently $8,184 billion--\n\n  Let me repeat that, the current debt of our country is $8,184 \nbillion. You can translate that into trillions. It is $8.2 trillion.\n  He says:\n\n       [The debt limit] will be reached in mid-February of 2006. \n     At that time, unless the debt limit is raised or the Treasury \n     Department takes authorized extraordinary actions, we will be \n     unable to continue to finance Government operations.\n\n  That is a fancy way of saying we won't be able to pay our bills. The \nmost powerful Nation in the world won't be able to pay its bills by the \nmiddle of February unless the debt is dramatically increased.\n  Here is what has happened to the debt under this President. Remember, \nhe said he is going to have maximum paydown of the debt; he is going to \npay the debt down by $2 trillion. That is not what happened. Instead of \ndebt being reduced, debt has been dramatically increased.\n  By the way, in the previous 5 years, during the Clinton \nadministration, this is how much the debt limit increased: Zero. We \nwere actually paying down debt. In 2002, the debt had to be increased \n$450 billion; in 2003, under this administration, the debt had to be \nincreased another $984 billion; in 2004, the debt had to be increased \nanother $800 billion; and now they want to increase the debt another \n$781 billion. You add it up. This President, in just these 4 years, has \nadded $3 trillion to the debt. The debt was only $5 trillion when he \ntook over. He has increased the debt in just these 5 years by 60 \npercent, and we now know that in the next 5 years, he is going to \nincrease the debt another $3 trillion. He will more than have doubled \nthe debt of our country during his administration.\n  One President--1 out of 43--has run up more debt than the other 42 \ncombined--more national debt, more debt held by foreigners.\n  Is this supposedly an indication of strength? What would people say \nout there? Is this an indication that our country is strong, that we \nare borrowing more and more money all around the world, or is it a sign \nof weakness?\n  I know what I think. I think it is a sign of vulnerability.\n  Last night, the President said we are addicted to foreign oil. He is \nright. You know what else? We are addicted to foreign money, and this \nPresident says: It is the people's money, give it back to them. The \nproblem is, he is borrowing the money from China, Japan, and all around \nthe rest of the world to give it back to them. That is what is going on \nhere.\n  It is the people's money, yes; absolutely, it is the people's money. \nDo you know what else? It is the people's debt. Every dime of this has \nour taxpayers' name on it, and they are going to have to pay it, and \nthis President doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about this \nexplosion of debt on his watch.\n  Now we have this budget proposal before us, and there are three \nchapters to it. There are three chapters to this book. Chapter 1 is to \ncut spending $39 billion. That is what they call the deficit reduction \npackage.\n  Look what the second chapter says. The second chapter says: Oh, when \nyou have cut the spending $39 billion, cut the revenue by $70 billion.\n  I was educated in schools in Bismarck, ND. I went to Roosevelt grade \nschool. I had wonderful teachers--Ms. Senzick, Ms. Barbie, Ms. Hook. \nThey taught me math and they were very good teachers, and I was good in \nmath. I could go back to the second grade and figure this out. Is the \ndeficit getting smaller or larger as a result of this plan? If you cut \nyour spending $39 billion but you cut your revenue $70 billion, have \nyou made the deficit bigger or smaller?\n  Everybody knows you have made the deficit bigger. Yet our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle say they have a deficit reduction package. \nNo, they don't. They have a deficit increase package when we already \nhave record deficits, record additions to the debt. And they say they \nhave a deficit reduction package? Come on. There is no deficit \nreduction going on here.\n  The third chapter of the book is the one they really don't want you \nto read. The third chapter of the book is they are going to increase \nthe debt $781 billion.\n  Here it is another way: $39 billion of spending cuts over 5 years--\nvirtually nothing as a share of the spending which will occur over that \nperiod--and $70 billion of tax cuts not paid for. The result is they \nhave just added to the deficit, added to the debt, and they will tell \nyou this is really working because we are getting strong economic \ngrowth.\n  Are we really? Are we really getting strong economic growth? Let me \nsay this: In the last 4 years, median family income in this country has \ngone down each and every one of the years. That is a fact. Median \nfamily income has gone down each and every one of the last 4 years. We \nonly have the records through 2004, but 2005 I predict will show the \nsame thing--another reduction in the median family income in this \ncountry.\n  When we compare this recovery to the previous recoveries since World \nWar II, here is what we see. This is the average of the nine previous \nbusiness cycles; that is, if you look at the nine recoveries we have \nhad from recessions since World War II, here is what we see. This red \nline is the average in terms of economic growth. This black line is the \ngrowth we have seen in this recovery. It is well below the average. It \nis 25 percent lower than the average economic growth we have seen in \nthe previous recoveries.\n  These are facts. Something is wrong. This strategy is not working. It \nis no wonder the American people are concerned about the economy, even\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\nthough people tell us the economy is great. What we see is, in a \nrecovery, this is one of the weakest of any we have had since World War \nII.\n  Let's look at another measure: business investment. This red line is \nwhat has happened in each of the nine recoveries. This is the average \nof each of the nine recoveries since World War II. But here is what has \nhappened in this recovery. Yes, things have gotten better, but they are \nway below--in fact, 50 percent less than the average of every other \nrecovery since World War II. These are signs something is wrong. \nSomething is not working with this strategy.\n  It does not stop there. Here is the job loss comparison. This red \nline shows the average of every recovery since World War II, nine of \nthem. We have had nine major recessions and nine recoveries. This red \nline shows what has happened on average with job growth during a \nrecovery.\n  Here is the line with respect to this recovery. We are 6.9 million \nprivate sector jobs short of a typical recovery. Is anybody paying any \nattention? Is anybody doing anything other than making rhetorical \nspeeches and running around the country chanting ``economic growth, \neconomic growth, this is really working''? Something is not working. \nThe average recovery since World War II has been stronger than this one \nin job production, in economic growth, and in business investment.\n  These are facts. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Mr. Greenspan, who \njust left office, said he opposes deficit-financed tax cuts. He said we \nshould not be cutting taxes by borrowing. The Chairman of the Federal \nReserve was exactly right. We should not be cutting taxes by borrowing, \nespecially borrowing from China and Japan and the Caribbean banking \ncenters.\n  The Chairman said this about pay-go, which is the amendment I will be \noffering when it is appropriate to do so. Pay-go is a budget \ndiscipline. Pay-go says simply this: If you are going to have more tax \ncuts, yes, you can have them, but you have to pay for them. Yes, you \ncan increase mandatory spending, but if you do, you have to pay for it. \nIf you want new spending, you have to pay for it. If you want more tax \ncuts, you have to pay for them.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who just retired, Chairman \nGreenspan says:\n\n       All I'm saying is that my general view is I like to see the \n     tax burden as low as possible.\n\n  So do I.\n\n       And in that context, I would like to see tax cuts continue.\n\n  So would I.\n\n       But as I indicated earlier that has got to be, in my \n     judgment, in the context of a PAYGO resolution.\n\n  That is what I am going to be offering to my colleagues, the exact \npay-go resolution the Chairman is referring to, the pay-go we had in \nthe 1990s, which helped us impose discipline, which helped us restore \nfiscal responsibility, which helped us turn record deficits into record \nsurpluses, which got us on a sound financial course, which, \nunfortunately, under this President and this administration and this \nCongress, we have veered from so dramatically back into the deficit \nditch--record deficits, record increase in debt. We are headed for $12 \ntrillion of debt, more than a doubling of our debt on this President's \nwatch and already more than a doubling of U.S. debt held by foreigners.\n  Think of it. It took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 trillion of \nexternal debt for this country. This President has more than doubled it \nin 5 years. What is conservative about that? This is the biggest \nliberal, when it comes to debt, we have ever had in the White House in \nthis Nation's history. He is very free with debt.\n  The pay-go I am offering simply says that all mandatory spending and \nall tax cuts that increase deficits must be paid for or require a \nsupermajority vote, 60 votes. The current pay-go rule, and you will \nhear from the other side that we have pay-go--we have it; it is a joke. \nIt exempts all tax cuts and exempts all mandatory spending increases \nthat are assumed in any resolution, no matter how much they increase \ndeficits. And they say they have pay-go? Come on. They don't have pay-\ngo; what they have is debt-go. Let's get going on the debt, that is \nwhat these guys have. And they are doing it and, boy, is our country \ngoing to pay a terrible bill for what these guys are doing.\n\n  This administration and this Congress are not going to be treated \nwell by history because at the critical moment, just before the baby \nboomers retire, instead of what other countries are doing, which is to \nrun surpluses to get ready for the retirement of the baby boomers, this \ncountry, under this administration, this Congress, is running massive \ndebt, doubling the debt of our country during this President's watch.\n  I will offer the pay-go resolution at the appropriate time. I will \noffer a second amendment which will say: Yes, we can have these tax \ncuts which the chairman and ranking member have brought before us, \nwhich is a responsible package. But it ought to be paid for.\n  Let me put up the tax cut package I will offer my colleagues, the \nvery same one the chairman and ranking member have come up with: small \nbusiness expensing, a savers credit, tuition deduction--all of these \nuntil 2009, the same as their package; new market tax credit until \n2008, same as theirs; sales tax deduction until 2007; the R credit \nuntil 2007, exactly what they have; work opportunity welfare-to-work \ncredits, the same as they have; teacher classroom expenses until 2007, \nthe same as they have; leasehold and restaurant improvements until \n2007; other traditional extenders until 2007, exactly as they have; the \nAMT hold harmless, through this year.\n  The difference is I am paying for it over the next 10 years, paying \nfor it all. How am I doing it? In this way: I am providing the same \noffsets as the Grassley-Baucus substitute. In other words, they have a \npackage of offsets here closing the tax gap by shutting down abusive \ntax shelters and other reforms. They have $34 billion. That includes \nending the tax benefit for leasing foreign subway and sewer systems--\nsaving $5 billion.\n  This is the scam of all time. This is the scam of all time. We have \npeople who are buying subway systems and sewer systems in foreign \ncountries and depreciating them for the purpose of their U.S. taxes and \nthen leasing back the sewer systems and the subway systems to foreign \ncountries in foreign cities. Is anybody listening? You tell me we \nshould not stop this scam? This is unbelievable. When my staff first \nbrought this to my attention, I could not believe it myself. You have \nto be kidding me. Companies in America are buying the sewer systems in \nforeign countries and depreciating them for the purposes of their U.S. \ntaxes. Can you believe this is going on? Companies are buying the sewer \nsystems in a foreign country and depreciating them for the purposes of \ntheir U.S. taxes? It is true. We could stop that and save $5 billion.\n  I take that package, then I add ending a loophole for oil companies \nthat lets them avoid taxes on foreign operations. That is another $9 \nbillion.\n  We could require tax withholding on Government payments to \ncontractors such as Halliburton just as we do to mainstream businesses \nin this country. You know, if you are a business in this country, you \nhave to pay withholding taxes. But we have Halliburton over there with \nall these funny-money contracts in Iraq--they don't have that \nrequirement. Why not? That would save $7 billion.\n  If we renew the Superfund tax so the polluting companies pay for \ncleaning up toxic waste sites, we would save $17 billion. And then we \nclose other tax loopholes for another $22 billion.\n  This is a picture of Ugland House in the Cayman Islands, the building \nfrom which they run all of these scams. I used to be a tax \nadministrator. One of my jobs used to be to scout out these scams. That \nis one of the reasons I am here, because people I represent thought I \ndid a pretty good job of unearthing these scams and shutting them down. \nBut this one takes the prize. I credit my colleague, Senator Dorgan, \nfor finding it.\n  Has anybody been to the Cayman Islands? The Cayman Islands are just \nsouth of Cuba. You go to the Cayman Islands, and you find this \nbuilding. It is five stories tall, and 12,748 companies call this \nbuilding home. This is one of the scams of the ages. Let me repeat \nthis. You have this building right\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\nhere--this is a picture of it--down in the Cayman Islands. It is five \nstories tall. It is home to 12,748 companies. Do you see them all? They \nare working there. Are they working there? Are 12,700 companies working \nthere? No, they are not. They are running fraudulent operations there. \nThey are shuffling paper there.\n  When I was tax commissioner, I found a major company that showed all \nof its profits down in the Cayman Islands. Gee, how would that be? They \nare doing work all over the country in the United States, buying and \nselling, buying and selling. They showed those were all break-even \noperations.\n  Then they ran a little operation with one person down in the Cayman \nIslands. They showed a $1 billion profit.\n  This shouldn't be a partisan issue. This is a scam. It is a scam on \nall of us to have 12,000 companies.\n  I was just describing the company. They had one employee down in the \nCayman Islands. They showed all of their profits down there with one \nemployee. I said that is the most efficient man in the world. This one \nman--all the profits of the company are in his division, and he is the \nonly one in the division.\n  Why do they do it in the Cayman Islands? Because there are no taxes \nin the Cayman Islands. They weren't doing any work down there. They are \njust shoveling profits between subsidiaries.\n  That is what is going on in this building. This building is home to \n12,748 companies that are doing business down in the Cayman Islands. \nThey are shoveling tens of billions of dollars in profit out of this \nbuilding. This building, I am sure, is a smart building. It must have \nthe latest wiring. They must have the latest technology to be producing \ntens of billions in profits in this one building--the profits of 12,000 \ncompanies. What a scam. We ought to stop it.\n  My bill says: Yes, we should have this tax relief for the American \npeople. We ought to pay for it by closing that kind of scam. We ought \nto stop the scam where companies are buying foreign sewer systems and \ndepreciating them on the books in the United States for the purposes of \nlowering their taxes here. It is nothing but a ripoff and a scam, and \nwe ought to stop it. We ought to pay for the tax cut, every dime of it. \nThat is what my proposal does.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the \ndistinguished manager.\n  Mr. President, we don't know at this point what is going to happen in \nterms of the parliamentary procedure. So I am not sure whether the \nSenator from New Jersey is going to have the opportunity, which I know \nhe wants, to be able to propose an amendment with respect to the AMT. \nMy hope is that he will be able to because I think it is absolutely \ncritical that the Senate address this issue.\n  I wish to speak for a few minutes about the amendments that the \nSenator from New Jersey will submit and why I support them and why I \nthink it is so important.\n  There is no rationale--no economic rationale, no social rationale, \npolitical rationale--for addressing tax issues that expire in 2009 \nbefore we take care of the individual alternative minimum tax issue \nthat affects people today.\n  There is no common sense behind saying we are going to address a tax \nissue with respect to 3 or 4 years from now when we have an enormous \nnumber of American families who are going to be negatively impacted by \nthe alternative minimum tax.\n  It is almost inexplicable that the House bill chooses capital gains \nand dividend relief over preventing 19 million families from having to \npay AMT.\n  Let me make it clear that I have supported a reduction in the capital \ngains tax on any number of occasions. In fact, I wrote it with Senator \nBumpers back in 1993. We drafted a targeted capital gains tax reduction \nthat passed the Senate. It got caught up in the complicated rulemaking \nprocess. It didn't work as effectively as it might because of the \nrules, not the concept. Ultimately, I have supported a reduction in \ncapital gains.\n  But to suggest that we ought to now make it permanent, when we see \nthe gap growing wider and wider between the ``haves'' and ``have \nnots,'' when we realize that what we are talking about in this tax \nreduction is providing those Americans who earn more than $1 million a \nyear about $32,000 worth of tax relief next year alone, while people \nearning less than $50,000 a year will get about $20 each.\n  It doesn't make sense, on any measurement of fairness or common sense \nabout how we are trying to expand the economic pie for all Americans, \nparticularly when you look at the data about the numbers of American \nfamilies who are being squeezed and squeezed when having a hard time. \nMedian wages have not gone up--they have gone down about 2 percent over \nthe last few years for average Americans. But public college tuition \nhas gone up about 57 percent. Since 2000, private college tuition has \ngone up something like 32 percent. Families are paying higher health \ncare costs.\n  All of us know, as the President reminded us last night in the State \nof the Union Message, gasoline prices are killing people at the pump. A \nlot of workers are seeing whatever gains they might have tried to save \nget taken away just trying to get to and from work.\n  We are struggling with this gap, which is growing. Yet the priority \nof the House of Representatives is to give the wealthiest people in \nAmerica yet another break while many Americans are going to be pushed \ninto the alternative minimum tax regime.\n  You shouldn't even call it the alternative minimum tax. You ought to \ncall it the family tax because that is what it is. The taxpayers get \nhit by the alternative minimum tax according to where they live and \nbecause they have children.\n  If you live in a certain State--take a State with a relatively high \nstandard of living and a fair amount of public contribution, such as \nMassachusetts or California or some other State, New York, Connecticut. \nIn those States, the only thing you can do to not pay this tax is to \nnot start a family. If you start a family and have children, the tax \ncuts end. You wind up being hit harder.\n\n  We are literally punishing Americans for having children and building \nfamilies. The more children you have, the more you are impacted by the \nalternative minimum tax at a lower income level. It doesn't make sense.\n  If no action is taken on the alternative minimum tax, a family with \nthree children with an income of $63,000 would be impacted by the AMT, \nand a family with six children with an income of $50,000 would be even \nmore impacted by the AMT.\n  In May, we heard testimony from the Urban Institute about how the AMT \nwas once upon a time a class tax, but it is soon becoming a mass tax \nbecause more and more taxpayers, mostly because they are having \nchildren, will be forced to pay it.\n  Nina Olson, the taxpayer advocate who works every day on practical \nimplications of what we do, has repeatedly testified about the \ncomplexities and the inequities of the AMT. She said sarcastically the \nAMT punishes taxpayers for such classic tax avoidance behavior as \nhaving children or living in a high-tax State.\n  If you look at his history of the AMT, you can tell that it really \ndoes need reform.\n  The individual AMT was created in 1969. It was created in 1969 to \naddress 155 individual taxpayers in America whose incomes exceeded \n$200,000 a year, who paid no Federal income tax at all in 1969. That is \nwhy this tax was created. You had high-income people paying no income \ntax, and 155 people were the target of this effort. But now it has \ngrown from 155 taxpayers in 1969 to 1 million in 1999, to almost 29 \nmillion by the year 2010. It now affects families with incomes well \nbelow $200,000 a year.\n  By the end of the decade, repealing the alternative minimum tax will \ncost more than repealing the regular income tax.\n  Unfortunately, we can't end this today. Obviously, we can't do that. \nBut we can do a lot more than what is in the House reconciliation bill. \nThe\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\nHouse tax reconciliation bill includes a provision that extends \ntaxation of capital gains and dividends at a lower rate through 2010; \nwhereas, the alternative minimum relief expired at the end of 2005, and \nit needs to be addressed. The capital gains and dividends provision \ndoesn't expire until 2008.\n  The amendment before the Senate--provided Senator Menendez is given \nthe opportunity to provide it--is going to strike the extension of \ncapital gains and dividends at a lower rate. That provision has a cost \nof $20 billion over 5 years and a $50 billion cost over 10 years.\n  The budget resolution has been drafted in a way that hides the cost \nof the capital gains and dividend cuts by putting most of the expenses \noutside of the 5-year budget window, and it will actually cost more \nthan twice as much as is stated.\n  One rationale for cutting the tax on capital gains and individual \ndividend income is that it stimulates investment.\n  That has not held true, and the record does not show that is, in \nfact, what happened. If you talk to people on Wall Street, they will \ntell you point blank, No. 1, they are concerned about the deficit, and \nNo. 2, they believe that their behavior is not going to be affected. It \nis a great windfall for them. They will all tell you that if they get \nan extra $100,000 in their pocket, at their income levels, they can do \nsomething with it. But it will not affect the fundamental investment \ndecisions that they are going to make anyway.\n  The fact is that the stock market, as we all know during the 1990s, \ndid a lot better than it is doing today when it had a higher capital \ngains rate, notwithstanding the fact that we lowered it at that time.\n  We have a choice, a very straightforward choice: Either help the \nwealthiest investors in America or you can help hard-working families.\n  It is that simple. That is exactly what this choice is about. I hope \na majority of the folks believe--that we ought to be helping those \nfamilies that most need the help today.\n  It is a simple matter of priority. It is a simple matter of fairness, \nand it is common sense with respect to our economy and the money we \nwant to put into the pockets of Americans so they can go out and pay \ntheir bills, continue to purchase, and drive our economy.\n  I want the tax bill to reward work first and wealth second.\n  This can be done by making the alternative minimum tax relief a \npriority over capital gains and dividend tax relief.\n  The fact is that Congress has an opportunity to stop punishing \ntaxpayers because of where they live, because they move from one State \nto another for work or for school, or because they decide to start a \nfamily. Those are not the reasons on which you ought to base a tax on \nin our country.\n  We have an important opportunity to take a step to deal with this. It \nis my hope that we will do so.\n  I yield whatever time may remain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to comment on what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts said.\n  First of all, I think everything he said about the AMT, I agree with; \nwhat he said about the capital gains, I disagree with.\n  I am only going to comment on that part that I agree with him on \nabout the AMT.\n  But let us have a little history in the process of doing that.\n  No. 1, either in 1998 or 1999, we repealed the AMT. President Clinton \nvetoed it.\n  So we wouldn't be dealing with this issue if President Clinton had \nsigned that bill.\n  In a sense I am kind of asking for support from anybody on the other \nside of the aisle who thinks we are not doing enough on AMT. I happen \nto be one of those who even today, 6 to 7 years later, is for repeal. I \nbelieve it ought to be repealed. We ought to have a standup vote, \nwithout any points of order, and get rid of this.\n  There are Republicans who would say if we do that in the out years, \nour budget might look like it has a much bigger deficit than it has, \nand over here there might be people who say if you are going to get rid \nof this tax, you ought to have an offset for it, so the budget deficit \ndoes not look different. The reason neither one of those concerns is \nlegitimate is because in this bill we are talking about having the AMT \nhit the middle-class Americans whom it was not intended to hit.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is right in the sense that for parents \nwith children and the larger the family the more it hits them. It was \nnever intended to hit but a few wealthy people who used every legal \nloophole to avoid paying taxes and that somehow everyone who makes a \nlot of money ought to pay a little something of income tax into the \nFederal Treasury. A little something or big something, whatever the \ncase might be, whatever the alternative minimum tax hit them with, they \nought to pay that.\n  If Senator Baucus will bear with me, he has heard me say 150 times \nhow ridiculous it is to have this side of the aisle say we ought to \noffset a tax that was never intended to be collected in the first place \nfrom the people who otherwise will be hit with it if we did not pass \nthis legislation, and over here, people are worried if we do away with \nit, the budget deficit will look bigger because we do not have the \nphantom tax income coming in from people who were never supposed to pay \nthe alternative minimum tax in the first place. If we have a tax \nhitting people who were never intended to pay it in the first place, it \nshould not be showing up in the budget figures, anyway. So we have to \nworry about an offset or we have to worry about whether we have a \nburgeoning budget deficit over here if it is not there. It is a \nphantom. We ought to do what you do with phantoms, hit them with a \nneedle, let the air out, get rid of them.\n  Also, particularly what the Senator from Massachusetts said about \nhitting people, it is like a geographical tax to some extent because a \nlot of States, such as New York, New Jersey, and California, have a lot \nof high-income people. Therefore, they have a disproportionate number \nof people getting hit by the AMT. If you fall into that income class, \nyou will get hit with it. More of these people live in higher income \nStates and it happens that some of the States are what we call blue \nStates instead of red States, so I don't know why we do not have a \nmassive drive on this side to force Republicans to do something that is \nhurting your constituents.\n  Let's do away with the darned tax. People aren't supposed to be \npaying it in the first place. Why are we spending a lot of time working \nthe issue? I would like to have the Senator from Massachusetts solve \nthis problem forever and help us repeal it, like we did in 1998, with a \nPresident who I am sure will sign it.\n  On a procedural matter, I wish also to make a comment. My good friend \nfrom Montana asked if we could see what we could work on, on \namendments. I will briefly comment even beyond what he has asked us to \ndo and try to help speed this along as best I can, as to where we are.\n  It has been suggested on this side that Republicans work with Members \nto help them get their amendments up and voted on. First, we should not \neven be in this situation, a truly unprecedented situation, where we \nare essentially being forced to do a reconciliation bill over. Yes, we \nare doing a reconciliation bill over, within 2 months of when we first \ndid it. We could be doing the Nation's business of problems that have \nto be solved, not waste 3 days on this bill now when we spent 3 days on \nit in November. We could be working on lobbyist reform. We could be \nworking on asbestos reform and a lot of other things that Members want \nbefore the Senate. However, leadership on the other side is wasting the \nSenate's time and the American people's time. Surely there is a better \nway.\n  For those who thought this was over back in November, we are in the \nmiddle of a rude awakening. Cooperation is a two-way street. Even \nthough we should not be in this position where the minority party is \ntrying to reopen the bill, we have said we are willing to entertain a \nlimited number of amendments. Another way to put this, I said to \nSenator Baucus privately that we need total transparency on this, get \neverything on the table. We do not get a response from the Democratic \nleadership.\n  They have taught me a few lessons from our first go-around on this \nbill. I\n\n[[Page S421]]\n\nlearned that you do not vote on amendments too early because we know \nwhat happens if you do that; they get their press release out, they \nlose the amendment, then it comes back within a matter of hours, \nsometimes two or three different versions of the very same amendment. \nWe end up voting on all of them, wasting everyone's time. So the extent \nto which we lay everything on the table and level with everyone on what \nwe are faced with, we will be able to get this bill completed. We could \nfinish this late tomorrow night.\n  Unless we can get an agreement for a limited number of amendments or \namendments in total, I don't see any reason but to wait until the time \nhas expired on the bill and let the so-called vote-arama begin one vote \nright after another and we spend a couple of minutes debating an \namendment back and forth, to have that vote-arama without an agreement. \nI am convinced this will save the Senate a lot of time in the end. \nEither way, we have a limited number of amendments. Let us know what \nthey are, have some sort of agreement so we can get done, or have a \nvote-arama.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I listened with great attention to my good \nfriend from Iowa. I feel very lucky to have him as chairman of my \ncommittee. I don't know any Member who is more decent and fair and in a \ncertain sense nonpartisan than the Senator from Iowa. I deeply \nappreciate his approach and friendship.\n  I think he knows no one is trying to delay anything. This is the \nSenate, after all. The Senators on both sides of the aisle have the \nopportunity to offer amendments. That is why we are Senators. We can \noffer amendments to bills. Sometimes one political party is in the \nmajority and sometimes the other party is in the majority. As the \nSenator knows, it goes back and forth. I remember years when the party \non the Senator's side of the aisle was in the minority, and my Lord, we \nfaced all kinds of amendments because Senators wished to offer \namendments to their points of view.\n  We are here today trying to work our way through. I have instructed \nSenators on the Democratic side of the aisle to tell me all the \namendments Members have and we will work our way through this so we can \nbe more than accommodating to the Senator from Iowa.\n  My view is to lay all your cards on the table so people know what \nthey are. As civil and reasonable people we will figure out a \nreasonable way to deal with this. We all know the rules. We will let \nSenators offer their amendments in a way that is civil, positive, and \naccommodating--nothing personal. These are legitimate points of view \nthat 100 Senators have. I hope to get the list to the Senator from Iowa \nvery quickly so we can work that out.\n  I yield 10 minutes to our new Member, Senator Menendez, from New \nJersey. We are honored to have him here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking \nDemocrat on the Senate Committee on Finance for yielding time and for \nhis work in preparing the opportunity to offer this amendment.\n  Later today I intend to offer an amendment, and I do certainly hope \nit will be in order, that lets families across the Nation know we are \non their side.\n  In the bill before the Senate we have a clear choice: We can stop a \ntax increase for 17 million middle-class taxpayers, a tax that was \nnever intended to penalize anyone considered middle class; or we can \ncontinue to give people who need it the least a break on their capital \ngains at the expense of middle-class workers.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Finance, Senators Baucus, \nSchumer, Kerry, and Feinstein, who have worked very hard on this issue \nto ensure that the final result of this bill will not be a tax increase \nfor middle-class families.\n  The options before the Senate are a choice of values. Do we value \nensuring fairness for all hard-working Americans or would we rather \ngive a break to those who need it the least? The Senate made the \nsensible choice when it passed the tax reconciliation bill last \nNovember by extending the protection for middle-class families from the \nalternative minimum tax. Now that the House bill is to come before the \nSenate, this Senate must make it clear it stands by that vote and that \nmiddle-class families will not bear an additional burden of tax cuts \nfor the wealthy.\n\n  In the past year, this Congress has given enormous tax breaks to an \noil industry that has racked up record profits while American drivers \nsaw the price of gas go through the roof, and given out tax break after \ntax break for those who need it the least, while ignoring middle-class \nfamilies.\n  I am proud to later offer an amendment that will help hard-working \nfamilies in America and New Jersey get real relief and to make sure in \nthis great body the middle class is heard at least as clearly as the \npowerful and the privileged.\n  Last night we heard more of the familiar rhetoric on tax cuts. We \nheard the President speak about ``a massive tax increase'' American \nfamilies will face that ``they do not expect and will not welcome,'' if \nthe President's tax cuts are allowed to expire as scheduled in the next \nfew years. The truth is, millions of families, not only in New Jersey \nbut across the landscape of the country, will face an unexpected \nincrease this year if the AMT exemption is not extended and the \nPresident's tax cuts do not include a fix for this problem.\n  Time and time again, the President has pushed for his tax credits \nfrom 2001 to be made permanent, which overwhelmingly benefit those who \nneed it the least. More than 70 percent of the President's tax cuts \nhave gone to people who make over $200,000, while families who earn \nbetween $50,000 and $75,000 have received less than 5 percent of the \ncuts. Yet the President has done nothing to make the AMT exemption \npermanent, a tax which in the next 4 years will affect nearly every \ntwo-parent family with two kids earning between $75,000 and $100,000.\n  We also heard the President call for more than just ``temporary \nextensions.'' Yet the fact is all the President has done in terms of \nthis middle-class tax is to propose temporary extensions and only \ncosmetic changes while proposing no underlying reform to the AMT \nitself.\n  Would we like to do more than a 1-year extension? Absolutely. But \nwhen the President has directed all of his efforts, his priorities, and \nthe Nation's bank account to tax breaks for the wealthy, there is \nlittle room, let alone money, left over for the reforms that affect \nnearly 20 million middle-class taxpayers.\n  When Americans wonder why there has been little attention on what \nmost tax analysts refer to as the single most important tax issue \nfacing the Nation, they should know that it is because tax cuts for the \nmiddle class have not been a priority for this administration.\n  Let's be honest. Once again, it is the middle-class families, the \nhard-working families, who are struggling to send their children to \ncollege, to keep up with the cost of health care, to care for aging \nparents, who pay all of their bills and try to make ends meet each \nmonth who are being asked to foot the bill for the top earners in our \ncountry. Why? How many middle-class families out of the 17 million know \nright now they could be facing a tax increase this year? I would guess \nnot very many. It does not help that the President has been silent on \nthis, one of the most significant tax increases facing the middle \nclass.\n  The fact is many families will be faced with a harsh reality at the \nend of the year. In my State of New Jersey, where nearly 180,000 \nfamilies were subject to AMT in 2003, the number of middle-class \ntaxpayers subject to this tax will at least double if no fix is \nenacted.\n  Average families, which are far from wealthy and think they are below \nthe threshold, could face significantly higher taxes this year if we do \nnot act on the crisis at hand. For example, a typical New Jersey family \nwith two parents, where one is a preschool teacher and the other a \nparamedic, with three kids would be subject suddenly to this new tax \nincrease this year.\n  So this amendment we hope to offer is for middle-class families who \nmay not know a tax hike is coming and for\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\naverage families who should not be expected to shoulder the burden of \nthe President's tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  This amendment will make very clear that our priority should be to \nprotect middle-class families from this unintentional tax hike and that \nmillions of taxpayers should not wake up next tax season to realize \nthey owe more in taxes even though their income has not changed.\n  Let's remember, this was a tax intended to assure those making some \nvery significant income pay some taxes. It was never intended to raise \nthe taxes of average Americans.\n  This is a zero-sum game. With soaring budget deficits and rapidly \nclimbing debt, tax cuts for top wage earners are just one more burden \nbeing put on the shoulders of the working middle class.\n  The reality is, without this amendment, many families could be paying \npossibly $1,000 more in taxes next year. That is $1,000 more they could \nput in their pocket, $1,000 more they could use to save for their \nretirement, $1,000 more they could use for college tuition, $1,000 more \nto help make ends meet.\n  It is clear there is not room on the President's tax cut agenda for \nthis middle-class tax crisis. That is why we seek to offer this \namendment. This is why it is vital this body once again show its \nsupport for a tax package that includes an increased AMT exemption to \nprotect middle-class families and not ignore the looming crisis before \nus.\n  We in this body know the consequences if we do not act. Many \nAmericans do not. We know that if we fail to act, an astounding 30 \nmillion Americans will be subject to a higher tax rate within the next \n4 years. We also know what many American families do not--that a family \nwith three kids making $63,000 will be facing a higher tax rate next \nyear if we do not enact this fix now.\n  Now, I hear a lot of talk about values. With this amendment, the \nSenate can decide which values--which values--it wants to embrace: \nrewarding those who work hard, play by the rules, and struggle to make \nends meet, or give yet another tax cut to those who need it the least?\n  Let's send a clear message that the values we embrace are the values \nof American families. Let's embrace fairness and equal treatment for \nthose who work hard. This is a chance for this body to go on record \nthat we should not be imposing an unfair tax break on our middle-class \nfamilies just to extend a tax break for those at the top.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment when it is offered, \npresuming we have the opportunity to offer it, and ensure that hard-\nworking American families, not just top dividend earners, remain our \ntop priority.\n  I also look forward to offering an amendment later on with Senator \nKennedy that would expand a critical tool for college students and \ntheir families under the HOPE scholarship tax credit. As the first in \nmy family to go to college, I fully understand the power of some of \nthese programs and how they helped me, in my case, be the first in my \nfamily to go to college.\n  This amendment will simply expand what the credit can cover to \ninclude other associated costs for a college education. I look forward \nto the opportunity to offer that amendment as well.\n  I yield back whatever time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I intend to bring forward an \namendment that will provide additional protections for Medicare \nbeneficiaries during the first year of the implementation of the new \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. And that first year is right now, \nsince it just started.\n  The amendment expands the existing 6-month open enrollment period \nfrom the May 15 deadline to 6 months later, into December. It is going \nto give people additional time to do the research to make the best \ndecisions.\n  Secondly, the amendment is going to give to every beneficiary the \nopportunity to make a one-time change in the plan enrollment at any \npoint during this calendar year, 2006.\n  Now, why is this important? Well, if every Senator here has been \nhearing from their senior citizens like the Senators in Florida have \nbeen hearing from our senior citizens, you can certainly understand \nthat the senior citizens are very concerned. In many cases, they are \nconfused because of the multiplicity of plans.\n  As a matter of fact, in Florida, there are 18 companies offering a \ntotal of 43 stand-alone prescription drug plans. Now, each of those \nplans differs in terms of premiums, cost-sharing requirements, drugs \ncovered, and pharmacy access, and some of these plans are very time-\nconsuming and very confusing. So when senior citizens are telling \nus Senators they are confused and bewildered, we ought to be paying \nattention.\n\n  Now, in some cases, the senior citizens are frightened, as well. This \nis because they know that come the deadline of May 15, if they have not \nselected a plan, they could be penalized 1 percent a month or 12 \npercent a year. That frightens them. What also frightens them is if \nthey pick a plan by the deadline and then realize they made a mistake, \nthey cannot rectify that mistake for a year. That is the source of \ngreat consternation and some fright to senior citizens.\n  Now, we can easily fix this. Back in November, when we had this bill \nbefore us then, I offered this amendment. It got 51 votes. It got a \nmajority of the Senate. But there was a point of order on the budget \nbecause there is a minor financial consequence to this. So under the \nrules of the Budget Act, there has to be a 60-vote majority to pass \nsuch an amendment. We got 51 votes. I think we have a good chance to \nget 60 votes now because of Senators having heard all of the confusion \nand the bewilderment and the fright our senior citizens are \nexperiencing. So I will be offering this amendment at the appropriate \ntime.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I wish to make the very simple but very \nimportant point that given the choice, given the alternative between an \nextension of dividend and capital gains tax provisions compared with \nthe AMT change, it is far better for this Congress to grant the \nalternative minimum tax relief than it is to grant an extension of the \ndividend and capital gains tax reduction.\n  First of all, the current law provides, under what is called the \nalternative minimum tax--which taxpayers who have certain incomes will \npay, basically middle-income taxpayers--that this year they will be \npaying more taxes if we do not change the law. And 17 million Americans \nwill be paying more taxes than they would pay under an ordinary \ncalculation of their income under the Tax Code.\n  To say the same thing differently, because of this provision called \nthe alternative minimum tax, 17 million more Americans will be paying \nmore taxes--actually 20 million. Three million Americans this last year \npaid more taxes because they fell under the alternative minimum tax. \nNext year, if we do not make changes for tax year 2006, 17 million more \nwill be paying it, for a total of 20 million. If we do not make these \nchanges, 20 million Americans will be paying increased taxes next year, \nand those 20 million are essentially middle-income taxpayers.\n  To contrast that with dividend and capital gains, current law \nprovides for lower dividend and capital gains taxation. That law \nextends, if we do nothing, for 2 more years, until essentially January \n1, 2009.\n  So we have a choice here, all things being equal. We have a choice \ngenerally because we have a $70 billion floor. The budget resolution \nsays we cannot pass more than $70 billion of tax cuts unless we want to \noverride that with 60 votes. We have that floor, and it is hard to do \neverything. It is hard to have a capital gains extension,\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\nand it is hard to have an AMT extension. But basically we have the \nchoice of either preventing a tax increase this year under AMT or \nextending dividends and capital gains, which need not be extended \nbecause currently the favorable dividends and capital gains is already \nin law and does not expire until January 2009.\n  The alternative is to extend capital gains and dividends from January \n1, 2009, for 2 more years and do nothing to AMT. Or do we say, that's \nnot very smart, we will deal with a dividends and capital gains \nextension later. Or do we, instead say, we are not going to extend \nsomething that does not need to be extended but rather we will reduce \nthe AMT bite for this year. To say it differently, will we prevent the \nimplementation of the alternative minimum tax this year, which has the \neffect of raising people's taxes? That is the question.\n  The Senate bill answered that question by saying, it makes more sense \nto prevent the AMT from going into effect this year than it does to \nextend dividends and capital gains which doesn't have to be extended \nanyway for the reasons I indicated.\n  The House bill, on the other hand, looks at that exact opposite. The \nHouse bill says, we are not going to prevent the increase of the \nalternative minimum tax this year. They are going to allow that to go \nahead. Rather, they are saying, we want to extend dividends and capital \ngains favorable treatment, even though current law gives that treatment \nand it is going to be in law until January 1, 2009. That is what the \nHouse did.\n  There were some on the Senate floor earlier today who said: Gee, the \nHouse bill is better. Why? The argument is, without addressing the \ntiming issue, because AMT relief is only for wealthy Americans. That is \nthe argument. Whereas a dividends-and-cap-gains extension gives \nfavorable tax treatment to a lot broader base and maybe middle-income \nAmericans because a lot of people have mutual funds and own stocks and \nso forth. So, really, if you are going to help middle America, \nbasically it is better to extend dividends and capital gains than it is \nto pass AMT relief, although we don't have to anyway because current \nlaw provides those benefits.\n  I would like to show with this chart a little bit about what AMT \nactually does to rebut that point. The facts show that AMT relief helps \nmiddle-income taxpayers a lot more than does favorable dividend and \ncapital gains treatment. I will show that with a couple other charts.\n  This first chart basically shows income levels where the alternative \nminimum tax starts to take hold. To remind everyone, taxpayers have to \nmake two calculations when calculating their income taxes. One is the \nregular way. You look at your deductions, decide whether you have the \nstandard deduction or itemized deductions. That is the standard, \nordinary way.\n  After a taxpayer has calculated his or her income taxes, every \ntaxpayer has to then go through a separate set of calculations. It is \ncalled the alternative minimum tax. Under that separate set of \ncalculations, if it turns out that you owed more under the AMT than \nunder the regular tax, then that is the tax you pay. You pay the \ngreater of the two calculations.\n  AMT, when it was passed years ago, was supposed to hit the very \nwealthy. That was the intention. But it has not worked out that way. \nThe actual effect of the AMT is to hit essentially middle-income \nAmericans.\n  It comes down to the question, what do you mean by middle income? \nThat is the question. This chart shows that for a family earning about \n$80,000--that is becoming more and more the middle-income taxpayer. If \nyou have a family making $80,000, they have expenses: kids going to \nschool--$80,000 these days is not an awful lot of money.\n  Unfortunately, most Americans earn less than that, but an awful lot \nof Americans earn $80,000. The point being, if you earn $80,000 \nroughly, then you probably don't have to pay the alternative minimum \ntax if you have no children. But this chart shows that the more \nchildren you have, if you have one child, two children, four children, \nthen--and that is what the brown lines show on the chart for this year, \n2006--it shows that if you have more children, then the level at which \nthe AMT starts to kick in is lower and lower.\n  That means, say, you have four children. At that level, if you are \nearning $60,000 for a family with four children, then at that point the \nAMT starts to kick in, which is to say, you start paying more tax.\n  There are other considerations, such as if the taxpayer is in a State \nwith high State and local taxes. If you are in a State with high State \nand local taxes, or the more children you have, et cetera, then the AMT \nis going to be much more of a bite and hurt you. The main point is, we \nare talking about income levels. For families with one child, it is \n$72,000; for a family down on the end of the chart with, say, six \nchildren, it is about $50,000. That is not a lot of money for a family \nwith six kids. So it is a middle-income tax.\n  Before I turn to the next chart, this is for this year showing what \nwill happen if we do nothing. Those are the brown bars on the chart. \nThe blue bars are really for last year, 2005, which goes to show you \nthat if we do nothing this year, this AMT is really going to hit. The \ncurrent AMT hit about 3 million taxpayers. This year, it is going to \nhit 17 million more, for a total of 20 million. That is why there is a \ndifference between the blue and the brown lines on the chart. This \nyear, it will really start to hit.\n  This chart shows that relief from the alternative minimum tax helps \ntaxpayers more in the middle income of the tax bracket compared with \ntax relief under dividends and capital gains. The blue bars are the \nalternative minimum tax relief. That is what the blue bars show. The \nother brown bars show relief from dividends and capital gains \nreductions. What does this show? We are talking about a little bit \nwealthier taxpayer. The blue bar shows if your income is, say, $75,000 \nto $100,000, and then especially about $100,000 to $200,000, 52 percent \nof the relief of what we will be enacting, if we pass the alternative \nminimum tax, will be for taxpayers in that bracket. I grant you that is \nhigher than a lot of Americans, but it still shows that beginning at \nabout $50,000 of income and up to $100,000, then it starts to fall off \nif you earn $200,000.\n\n  It also shows that the very wealthy don't pay the alternative minimum \ntax. The wealthy whose income is, say, $500,000, $1 million, $2 to $3 \nmillion, AMT doesn't affect them. Rather, the AMT hits people whose \nincomes are roughly between $75,000 up to, say, $200,000 to $250,000.\n  Contrast that with the dividends and capital gains tax relief. That \nis the brown bars on the chart. What does that show? The brown bars \nshow that by far the greater relief that people receive from the \nbenefit of the dividends and capital gains reduction is the very high \nincome bracket of Americans. That is what the brown bars show. That is \n$1 million--more than $1 million in income. The bar shows that about \nover 52 percent of the relief from dividends and cap gains relief goes \nto taxpayers where incomes are over $1 million; whereas 52 percent of \nthe AMT tax relief goes to taxpayers in the bracket at under $200,000. \nAgain, the facts show that dividend and capital gains relief goes by \nfar to the most wealthy Americans. Those earning $1 million or more get \nby far the largest break from this provision. Whereas the AMT tax \nrelief does not give relief to the most wealthy. It gives relief to \nthose, as shown by this chart, roughly between $50,000 in income and up \nto $150,000 and $200,000 in income. That is a big difference.\n  Again, I must remind all my colleagues, the alternative minimum tax \nwill be a tax this year, 2006, this year, if we do nothing. If we pass \nthe relief we are talking about here for 1 year, then taxpayers who pay \ntaxes in 2006 will find their taxes are not increased. If we do nothing \nabout capital gains and dividends taxes this year, there will be no \nchange in taxation on dividends and capital gains. There will be no \nchange next year on income taxes on dividends and capital gains.\n  It is abundantly clear to me that in the alternative, we should \ncertainly focus on passage of a provision which prevents a tax increase \nfor 2006 that will otherwise go into effect rather than not doing that, \nlet the tax increase go into effect, and say, well, we will extend the \ncurrent law with respect to dividends and capital gains for\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\n2 more years, beyond 2009 into 2010. That is a no-brainer.\n  You might ask: Gee, why not do both? Let's do both. Therein is the \nrub because we have a $70 billion limit given to us by the budget \nresolution which we all passed in this body and the other body. You \ncan't do it all. And add to that that we don't want to, I don't think, \nworsen the deficit. We already have huge deficits facing the country, \nincreasing debts on top of that.\n  We could pay for both, if we want to, by raising taxes someplace \nelse. That is an option. I don't know whether we want to do that. But \nwe cannot and should not pass dividends and capital gains relief at the \nexpense of AMT.\n  I might add, under a ruling from the Parliamentarian earlier today, I \nthink the Presiding Officer was presiding at that moment, a budget \npoint of order would lie against a conference report that came back \nwith dividends and cap gains extensions because of the outyear costs, \nunless it is paid for.\n  It is my fervent hope that we deal with what we have to deal with \nnow, and that is the alternative minimum tax. Let's not let that go \ninto effect.\n  I don't see anybody else who wishes to speak, so I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask that I be allowed to speak \nfor several minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise to let my colleagues know \nthat, at an appropriate time, I plan to offer an amendment to the \npackage of tax cuts that the Senate is, in fact, considering today.\n  The recent tragedy in West Virginia's coal mines, as well as in \nKentucky, highlights the need for Congress to take steps to better \nprotect miners who have worked hard for years to extract the coal used \nto create over half of all of our electricity and the country doesn't \nknow it because we are always talking about oil.\n  The amendment I am going to offer provides incentives for coal \ncompanies to make crucial investments in equipment and training that \nwill help coal miners return to their families safely each night. The \nworld of coal mining, as you know, is a very close one. Almost nobody \never gets to go into a coal mine for the obvious reasons--its danger \nand the training needed. So as to that which provides the majority of \nour power in this country, people never get to see and understand the \ndangers involved.\n  Let me briefly explain the tax incentives this amendment would \ncreate. First, coal companies would be allowed to immediately expense \n50 percent of the cost of purchasing new safety equipment. This is \nextremely important because American mines simply don't have the best \navailable equipment at this time. In fact, some of the equipment, I \nregret to say, is the most important--for example, oxygen. Rescue \nhasn't changed a whit since 1977. Other countries, such as Canada, New \nZealand, and Australia, have much more advanced mining equipment than \ndo we. That is not fair to American miners. We need to mine coal and \nhave companies willing to do it. We need to be absolutely certain that \nminers are as safe as we can possibly make them.\n  Several types of safety equipment would be eligible under my \namendment for the tax benefit. First, communications technology that \nenables miners to maintain constant contact with the ground above. That \nwould seem to be easy; to wit, we can talk from the Moon to the Earth \nbut we cannot talk from over ground 500 feet down or a thousand feet \ndown to a miner who is trapped to take their vital signs and do all \nkinds of things so we can protect them and get them out safely.\n  I am absolutely confident that the technology for doing this exists. \nIt is just that it hasn't been put into use. That is not fair. So there \nare several types, and I mentioned the contact with ground. Secondly, \nelectronic tracking devices that enable an individual above ground to \nlocate miners underground at all times.\n  Third, emergency breathing apparatuses, including devices carried by \nminers and additional oxygen supplies stored by the mine in tunnels off \nto the side of the mine as you go down the main shafts.\n  You are no doubt aware that Canada had a problem very recently. They \nhad these sort of sheds, little houses that went behind that people \ncould go in and be totally safe. In there was oxygen, food, and all \nkinds of things. Nobody was hurt or killed because they had equipment \nwhich we don't have. I think Congress needs to decide whether, with \ncoal mining increasing in this country and with probably not much \nchance of doing anything major about oil, we ought to be protecting our \nminers so they can mine coal for us.\n  Finally, mine atmospheric monitoring equipment to measure the levels \nof carbon monoxide and methane and oxygen in the mine at all times. \nThat is very important because often a rescue team, if it is in a mine, \ncannot proceed if the level of carbon monoxide, for example, is too \nhigh or if methane is too high and there is a chance of an explosion. \nKnowing the levels of all of those is important to be able to \nunderstand that from above ground.\n  In addition to investment in lifesaving technology, we need our mines \nto invest more in mine rescue teams. Experienced miners, specially \ntrained to rescue their fellow workers, are essential in the event of \nan emergency.\n  I can remember when I was Governor, we used to have right outside my \nwindow, so to speak, multi-State competition between mine rescue teams \nfrom various States. Mine rescue operations are extraordinarily \ncomplex, extraordinarily precise, and they have to be taught and \npracticed, and they have to keep at it. So that it is in our interest \nthat, unlike what happened at Sago where no mine rescue teams arrived \nfor a long time because Sago did not have its own rescue team, being a \nrelatively small mine, they do not have to wait. The result at Sago, as \nwe all know, in part, is that 12 people did not live.\n  Of course, training and equipping a mine rescue team is expensive. \nCompanies have not committed enough resources to having skilled rescue \nteams available at all times and during all shifts, if there is a \nmultishift operation.\n  Therefore, the amendment I am proposing would provide a mine operator \na tax credit of $10,000 for each miner that they have trained and \nequipped as a mine rescue team member. Somebody will say that is a lot \nof money. If a mine doesn't have a rescue team, then the chance--if \nthere is an explosion--of safely getting them out of the mine \ndiminishes enormously. To me, it is akin to the cost of doing business. \nHaving said that, the people don't have it. I think we have to be able \nto ease them into it, to encourage them, incentivize them to do it--not \nmake it permanent but incentivize them to make it permanent so they get \ngoing on that. It is my understanding that a credit of this size would \noffset approximately 20 percent of the cost of preparing a miner to be \nready to rescue his colleagues. So it is not paying for the whole \nthing.\n  I believe we need to make our mines safer as soon as possible, so I \nam proposing that both of these tax incentives be available only for \nthe next 3 years. We need coal mines that are improving their safety \nstandards immediately, which also gives them sufficient time to find or \ndevelop the best equipment.\n  I know that in DOD, DARPA, for example, in research labs around the \ncountry--I had someone visit me yesterday with all kinds of ideas, and \nthey are working on mine safety rescue equipment. There just has not \nbeen a push on the part of anybody--MSHA, the companies, us, whoever--\nto get more modern equipment into the mines. If you are using the same \noxygen rescue equipment that you were in 1977, we know that is \ninadequate.\n  Let me answer some skeptics who may be wondering why we need to \nprovide tax breaks to companies to encourage them to take safety \nprecautions they ought to be required to take. That is a very fair \nquestion, and I am sure it will come up.\n  I share the desire to mandate by, either Federal law or regulation, \nstrict safety regulations on America's coal mines. I believe we owe \ncoal miners the safest possible work environment, all\n\n[[Page S425]]\n\nwithin the context of coal being the energy source of the future, not \nexclusively, but the energy source, the biggest one of the future.\n  That said, I believe we must also act in good faith with coal \ncompanies. This is not a punishment. This is about improving the \nsituation. If we are asking them to make substantial new investments in \nspecific technology and training, it is appropriate to offer tax relief \nto lessen the impact of those investments at least for a period of 3 \nyears.\n  Following any kind of accident in a mine, the most important things \nare locating the miners underground--that is very hard to do now--\ncommunicating with them--and that is hard to do now--making sure they \nhave sufficient supplies of oxygen until they are rescued--and that is \nvery hard to do now since the oxygen usually runs out after 1 hour--and \nhaving skilled and well-trained mine rescue teams quickly available.\n  These are worthy results. Sometimes people say: Can a mine afford it? \nThe answer is yes. Look at the Sago mine in northern West Virginia. \nThat is going to be closed for a long period of time. What they are \nlosing in the way of their bottom line compared to what I am talking \nabout here isn't even close. So I think it is in our interest to do \nthis, and I really believe that.\n  Miners deserve to know that in the event of an accident that their \nemployers have made the investments necessary for their safe return. \nThe amendment I am proposing today will stimulate such investments.\n  In closing, I am very pleased to be working with my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee, Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus, on this \nproposal. I am grateful for their cooperation and assistance as we try \nto make coal mines safer. And I am very hopeful that these investment \nincentives can be included in the tax bill before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I was pleased to hear President Bush talk \nlast night about the U.S. economy in the State of the Union Address. \nSome of the other proposals of the President, such as reducing the \ndeficit and making the R tax credit permanent, make a lot of sense. I \nstrongly support them. Others, such as his proposal on health care \ncosts, frankly, would do very little to rein in soaring health care \ncosts that we see. And that is important, frankly. We must do more to \nrein in health care costs because they serve as a drag on the \ncompetitiveness of American industry. But there are certainly areas \nwhere we can work together on health care.\n  For the past year, I have made a number of statements on the steps \nour country must take, in my judgment, to bolster U.S. competitiveness. \nJust last week, I unveiled plans for a comprehensive legislative effort \nto bolster U.S. competitiveness from education to savings to innovation \nand research. I invite the President to support these provisions, to \nsupport this agenda. I look forward to working with him to turn these \nproposals into law. Only by working together can we ensure that we keep \nAmerica first in the world, preserve its economic leadership, and \nassure jobs and prosperity for American generations to come.\n  ``Competitiveness'' is an amorphous term because it covers some \ndifferent areas, from international trade to education. But these are \nthe issues which are critical to our future. Why? Because the world is \nchanging, and for America to remain on top, we have to make sure our \ndomestic house is order.\n  I just got back from a 10-day trip to China and India. I must tell \nyou, it was, to say the least, very eye-opening.\n  In China, I saw gleaming superhighways burrowing through brightly lit \ntunnels. I saw robots stacking the shelves of a Chinese computer \ncompany. I saw teams of Chinese researchers determined to discover the \nnext big thing. I saw capitalists and entrepreneurs betting on China's \nrise. I saw a confident middle class ready for the future.\n  It is astounding. We all know that. Every time you go to China, it is \namazing how much more advanced they are compared to the previous visit. \nI was there only a year earlier.\n  After a quarter century of growth, China is set to become the world's \nlargest economy by about the year 2030. Just think about that. By 2030, \nChina is positioned to become the world's largest economy. China is \nalready the world's third largest exporter. China has surpassed America \nas the largest exporter of information technology products.\n  India, I might say, is no different. There, I saw confident, young \nengineering students who have no doubt that the India of tomorrow will \nbe better than the India their parents left them. I saw information \ntechnology companies where state-of-the-art technology has made them \nglobal technology leaders. I saw Indian Government leaders bent on \nmaking 21st century India the world's success story.\n  As a side note--it is a very small point but not so small--I asked \nthe head of a major high-tech research center in India why they are in \nIndia. What is the answer I got? The answer I got was because India has \nthe greatest talent pool for engineers and scientists.\n  I asked, What is the next best country?\n  China, he said.\n  I asked, Where is the United States?\n  Sorry, Senator, you are down the list pretty far.\n  That is a small slice of what we are going up against. These two \nreawakening civilizations, with over 2.3 billion people between them, \nare on the march. Their confidence is palpable. Are we prepared to meet \nthe challenge they present? Of course we are. We are Americans. We have \na great history of meeting challenges. America is capable of overcoming \nany challenge. We are capable, but we must act.\n  America remains the world's economic powerhouse--very much so. We are \nundisputed today. We lead all major economies in output. Our companies' \nworkers grow more productive each year. However, we also have to face \nfacts. In many important areas, America is beginning to lose its \ncompetitive edge.\n  In information technology, we have lost our preeminence, falling \nbehind Singapore, Iceland, Finland, and Denmark. At the same time, \nFederal support for R is in a 30-year decline.\n  In education, we have neglected our human capital. When I started in \nthe Senate, America ranked third in the world in the share of young \npeople with science or engineering degrees. Thirty years later, we have \nslipped--not back to 3rd, 4th, or 5th; we have slipped to 17th. In \nglobal rankings of math, reading, and science skills, our 15-year-olds \nhave also fallen even further behind 17th in the world.\n  In health care, rising costs threaten to cripple many companies. Too \noften, employees have little or no health care coverage. The average \nAmerican spends more than $5,000 a year on health care costs--twice as \nmuch on a per capita basis as the next most costly country. We spend \ntwice as much on health care in America as any other country. I ask, \nare we twice as healthy even though we spend twice as much per person? \nClearly, the answer is no. We must cut back on the cost we pay for \nhealth care.\n\n  In international trade, over the last few years we have distanced \nourselves from Asia, leaving China to engage the region. By not pushing \nto open the world's biggest markets and not explaining the importance \nof trade, this administration fosters surging protectionism.\n  To make that same point, I heard constantly in Asia, China, India, \nand Singapore--I had a very long conversation with Lee Kuan Yew, who is \nthe wise man of Singapore--where is America? Where is the American \nGovernment? There are all kinds of international trade negotiations and \nforums. We don't show up. We don't participate. I asked: What about our \ncompanies? Our companies are not there. Sure, we have American \ncompanies in China. In India, I heard constantly from every person I \nspoke with that we can't find Americans; we need American companies to \ndo business in India.\n  There is a big, fancy subway, for example, in New Delhi. When you \nthink of New Delhi, most Americans don't have an image of tall, \ngleaming skyscrapers as in Manhattan. Think of\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\nDelhi, India. It is a huge city. There is a New Delhi and an Old Delhi. \nBut India and Delhi have a subway system built, completely finished, \nand it is gleaming. It is fancy. It is up to date. Guess what. Cell \nphones work in the New Delhi subway. In a lot of American subways, you \ncan't turn on your cell phone. They are not wired for cell phone use. \nYou can in India. And they plan to build subways in 18 other cities in \nthat country.\n  Finally, our macroeconomic fundamentals are at a danger point. That \nis a fancy term. What does that mean? Essentially, it means that we are \nin deep financial trouble. Our country is set to rack up another record \naccount deficit. That is another big, fancy word. It basically means we \nare importing a lot more materials and goods than we are exporting. \nThat is the current account deficit.\n  We borrow more than 80 percent of the world's savings. Think of that \nfor a second. Americans borrow more than 80 percent of the world's \nsavings.\n  Our net foreign debt has not been this high as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product--that is how we count our economy--since Grover \nCleveland was in the White House. This is unsustainable and costly. And \ntoo few people think about it. When they do they wonder, Why didn't we \ndo something about it earlier?\n  Do we just put our heads in the sand and give up? No. Clearly, we \nmust choose a path to greater economic competitiveness. That means \ntaking advantage of opportunities we see and meeting our challenges \nhead-on. We need a comprehensive agenda for a 21st century competitive \neconomy. We must look inward and scrutinize our own policies \nthoroughly, comprehensively, and honestly. Look at the facts, put aside \nideologies, put aside partisanship. The stakes are just too high.\n  I have spent much of the last year attempting to develop such an \nagenda--not perfect, clearly. I have no monopoly on the best ideas. But \nI believe we must start, and I have done my best to start.\n  In the coming months, I will launch seven individual legislative \nproposals to address America's competitiveness in education, energy, \nhealth, savings, research, tax, and international trade. That is how we \ncan compete better--by improving our education dramatically.\n  How do we wean ourselves from OPEC? Thank goodness the President \nmentioned that, and I praise him for his comments in the State of the \nUnion last night.\n  How do we address this health care problem in America, the high cost \nof health care, and make sure more Americans are covered? How do we \nencourage more savings? That is a bit alarming. I know that it is just \na statistic. It is still quite alarming.\n  We Americans are not savers. We Americans have a negative personal \nsavings rate. We also on average spend more than we save. We charge up \nour credit cards, mortgage payments, and we spend more than we save. \nThat adds up. After a while, it catches up to us.\n  What about other countries? In China, the personal savings rate is \nabout 40 percent. About 40 percent of what the Chinese people earn, \nthey save. There are similar, high statistics in other Asian countries. \nJapan--I do not know the exact figure; I know it is high. In Singapore, \nit is about the same level. In India, it is very high, too. Some might \nsay that is because those countries don't have savings accounts; they \ndon't have Social Security, as well, as we have; they do not have \nhealth care benefits or pension plans as lucrative as ours. Ask any \nAmerican how well our savings plans are working and how health care \nbenefits are working. We have a problem.\n  The point is, they are saving and we are not saving. They are saving, \nwe are spending. They are investing, we are consuming. After a while, \nthat catches up.\n\n  As I said, I don't pretend to have all the answers. But we have to \nstart tackling these questions right now. I invite my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle as well as the administration and anyone in our \ncountry to join me in enacting these bills.\n  I welcome the President's focus on education. I will soon introduce \nwhat I call the Education Competitiveness Act, designed to make the \npriority of lifelong learning an inseparable part of American society \nand American culture. We have to continue to be educated to grow and \nlearn. My bill will encourage more students to go into math and science \nby funding college scholarships for the sciences, providing free \ntuition for science and engineering students, and creating partnerships \nwith employers and continuing education centers to meet the technology \nneeds of companies. I will also propose legislation to invest in our \nteachers by raising starting salaries and providing loan forgiveness \nfor teachers.\n  I was very impressed a couple of nights ago to see on the evening \nnews that in the city of Chicago, Chinese language is offered at every \nlevel K-12. Chinese language is offered in the Chicago school system. \nThat is incredibly important. I wish Chinese were offered in many more \nAmerican school systems. Why? Because Chinese is the language that is \ngoing to be very important down the road. Sure, English is going to be \nthe major language in the countries of the world. That is absolutely \nclear. But the more we understand Chinese, the more we are going to \nhelp. We can learn the Indian language and lots of others, too, but \nMandarin Chinese is going to be very important in the future.\n  Also, students might not be fluent in Chinese. They may just take 2 \nor 3 years. Some students may become very fluent in Chinese. Even for \nthose students who don't become fluent in Chinese, what does it do it \nfor us and for our kids to think a little bit more about overseas, \nabout Asia, think more internationally, think more about what is going \non in the world? When some event occurs in a country--it doesn't have \nto be China--if you study Chinese, it will help. You will think about \nit more and read the newspapers or watch the news. You will begin to \nthink about how these things are interrelated.\n  We have to strongly boost our education system. I must say that I \ntake my hat off to the Chicago school system for offering Chinese at \nevery single level, K-12.\n  I applaud the President's recognition of energy as a critical facet \nof our Nation's competitiveness and the critical factor that innovation \nand R play in ridding ourselves of our dependence on Middle East oil. \nThe President said last night that we are addicted to foreign oil. We \nare at our peril. The sooner we wean ourselves from OPEC and become \nmore self-sufficient, the better off we are all going to be.\n  What can we do about it?\n  I will invite the President to support my energy competitiveness \nbill. What does it do? It will create a new agency, what I call the \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA-E, modeled after the Defense \nResearch Projects Agency, which is so helpful in providing so many \ncutting-edge technologies. It will help provide cutting-edge research \nto break out of the energy squeeze that we now face.\n  Last night, the President mentioned programs within the Department of \nEnergy. I think that is good. My personal view is that this is such an \nimportant issue, we have to have a separate outfit called ARPA-E; \notherwise, it will be consumed in the Department of Energy. I worry \nthat it is going to be lost in the bureaucracy much too soon. It has to \nbe a lean, mean agency.\n\n  I also support the commitment to expand research and to make \npermanent the research and development tax credit. I will introduce a \nresearch competitiveness bill in the coming weeks which does just that. \nThe tax credit is not enough, especially when it comes to basic \nresearch. We have to do more than the R tax credit. I believe more \nsupport for private and public research partnerships can be an \neffective vehicle for basic research. They can help find the resources \nfor more basic research.\n  We did this in the 1980s when semiconductor companies and the \nGovernment collaborated to share risk and leverage discoveries for \nsemiconductor technology. It is called Semtech. It was in Austin, \nTexas. I spent a couple of days there and was very impressed with what \nthey have done. It was so successful it helped support semiconductor \ntechnology that has spun off. Semtech is no longer necessary. It would \nget us jump-started in meeting the Japanese and other challenges where \ncountries are underwriting the development of semiconductor production.\n\n[[Page S427]]\n\n  I welcome the President's focus on savings and acknowledge the need \nto address mounting Government costs and the growing deficit. We should \nnot focus solely on programs such as Social Security and Medicare if we \nare going to address this problem. Rather, it is time to explore every \nnook and cranny for opportunity to bring the deficit down, to look at \ncorporate tax loopholes, and to close the annual $300 billion tax gap.\n  What is that? What is the $300 billion annual tax gap? Every year \nabout $300 billion in taxes legally owed is not collected. We can do \nbetter. I don't know if we can get it all, but we ought to get the \nlion's share of that collected. That is a way to help pay for some of \nthese things, the investments we have to make. Let's do a better job in \nclosing the tax gap. The IRS is working on it. I have prodded the \nchairman of the committee, Chairman Grassley, many times. The time has \ncome to light a bigger fire, accelerate this effort to make sure that \nmost of that $300 billion of taxes legally owed to Uncle Sam is \ncollected; otherwise, we are subsidizing $300 billion worth of \ndeadbeats because those taxes are not collected.\n  A savings competitiveness plan such as the savings competitiveness \nbill I will introduce will make certain the Federal Government spends \ntaxpayer dollars wisely. We can accomplish that objective if, when we \nspend money around here, we pay for it; otherwise, the debt and deficit \nkeep building. We are borrowing more and more. We cannot continue this \nborrowing binge.\n  It must also create incentives for private savings by pursuing the \nautomatic enrollment savings plan. Make the tax credit permanent for \nsavers. There are a lot of things we can do on the edges that will \nsnowball as we increase personal savings in the country, which clearly \nis needed for investment in energy, other technologies, education, in \ntraining programs to assure people they can keep their job, and if they \ncannot keep the job, they can make the adjustment to a new job; \notherwise, with all the hundreds of thousands of people who have been \nlaid off in companies in America because of global competition, they \nwill not have a stake in what we are trying to do. We have to do this \ntogether as a country. I certainly believe increasing the personal \nsavings will be a large part of that.\n  Then we have to turn to international trade. Competitiveness requires \nwe break down market access barriers and seek opportunities in foreign \nmarkets such as China and India, which continue to crave American \ninvestment. We pass laws to encourage our companies to export and to do \nbusiness overseas. We must do that to help American companies strive \nand do well, so long as they pay attention to local workers. We must \nlet them know their Government has their back and that foreign markets \nare open and stay open when they play by the rules. We have to make \nsure the countries play by the rules. They are not playing by the rules \nas much as they should and could.\n  Take intellectual property, for example. Many countries overseas--\nChina, India--are making some progress, but we are losing all kinds of \ndollars because America is not enforcing the rules sufficiently for \nother countries.\n  I will introduce a trade competitiveness bill to make the \nadministration more politically accountable to Congress, identifying \nand pursuing the most egregious foreign market access barriers. It will \nbuild on an idea of Senator Stabenow of Michigan to create a new \nSenate-confirmed chief trade prosecutor at the USTR dedicated to \ninvestigating and prosecuting trade enforcement cases.\n  Then we have taxes. The President's focus there is not quite properly \nplaced. We need to make sure our international tax rules, which were \nwritten in a time when U.S. businesses were the only players on the \nblock, are changed. Make sure they provide other businesses flexibility \nto compete.\n  The Tax Code contains a number of anti-abuse rules so companies \ncannot shelter passive income but must allow U.S. businesses to \nredeploy the resources from active to foreign operations, as their \ncompetitors already do.\n\n  I will review these rules, as well as transfer pricing rules, cost \nrecovery periods for business assets, and the inappropriate use of \noffshore tax havens to make sure U.S. businesses can compete fairly on \na level playing field with both domestic and foreign competitors.\n  A final element of my plan is health care. That is where the \nPresident's address fell short. The President offered some options for \nsome Americans, but as broad health care solutions, they may not be \ndoing very much to control costs or expand health insurance coverage. \nIn fact, Americans who need health insurance coverage the most could \npay more out of their pockets under health savings account plans.\n  The President ignored the health care elephant in the room: the \nproblems our seniors are having with the drug care benefit. I am \nsurprised he did not mention that. It is on seniors' minds. We have to \naddress that.\n  My health competitiveness legislation will invest in innovation, in \nefficiency, and also will put emphasis on making Medicare move toward \npay for performance as we get better quality of value for Medicare \ndollars.\n  I close by saying competitiveness is the key to America's future. \nBolstering our great companies' competitive potential will allow us to \nensure that we leave our children more productive, more prosperous, and \na more secure America than our parents left us. This is important. It \nis very difficult to get our hands wrapped around it. But the more we \ndo and the earlier we do so, the better off we are all going to be.\n  I yield up to 20 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, the \nranking Democrat of the Joint Economic Committee, the senior member of \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, it is my intention when it is appropriate to \noffer an amendment entitled Strengthening America's Military. This \namendment will repeal the extension of tax breaks for capital gain and \ndividends and instead use the funding to give our military some of the \nvital help it needs. There is no question we have the most formidable \nmilitary in the world. It is a combination of the courage and skill of \nour fighting men and women, together with the best technology. But we \nhave to ensure that this Army and our Marine Corps and all of our \nmilitary forces are adequately equipped.\n  It is a question of priorities. As members of this administration are \nquick to point out, we are a nation at war. But they have not asked all \nthe people of this Nation to sacrifice for that war, something this \ncountry has done in almost all past conflicts. There are literally \nthousands of young Americans serving and sacrificing in Afghanistan, \nIraq, and around the globe. Their families sacrifice as they wait for \nthem to return. Their communities have sacrificed as they have seen \nNational Guard units mobilized and sent overseas. But the vast majority \nof Americans has not been summoned to this great struggle. I argue now \nis the time where such sacrifice is necessary, particularly among those \nwho benefit most from society.\n  Rather than debating whether to extend certain tax cuts, we should \nconsider ways to increase Federal revenues to pay for the costs of the \nwar, something the country has done in almost all past military \nconflicts. To raise the additional revenues needed to equip our \nmilitary, we first need to remove the provisions in the tax \nreconciliation bill that extend the lower tax rates on dividends and \ncapital gains.\n  There are many reasons to oppose the extension of the lower tax rates \nand dividends on capital gains, but the key reason is the fact they are \nunfair. Most of the tax goes to upper income families: 53 percent of \nthe tax goes to .2 percent of families who have incomes of $1 million \nor more; 78 percent of the tax goes to families with incomes of \n$200,000 or more.\n  Secondly, there is a host of offsets that Democrats and Republicans \nalike have supported. As the ranking member on the Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad has long pressed for such amendments, including shutting \ndown abusive tax shelters, ending a loophole for oil companies that \nlets them avoid taxes on foreign corporations, and ending the tax \nbenefit for the leasing of foreign subway and sewer systems, requiring \ntax withholding on Government payments to contractors, and renewing the \nSuperfund tax so polluting companies pay for cleaning up toxic waste. \nThese offsets, included in this amendment, more than meet the equipment \nneeds of our soldiers, and as such,\n\n[[Page S428]]\n\nthe remaining revenue will go for reducing the deficit, another \nimportant goal and need.\n  When I say ``equipment needs,'' I mean repairing, rehabilitating, and \nreplacing, or what the military calls ``resetting and \nrecapitalization'' of the equipment of the Army and the Marine Corps \nwhich is being used in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I recently returned from my seventh trip to Iraq and my fourth trip \nto Afghanistan. I was impressed by the superb dedication and \nprofessionalism of our fighting men and women. However, it is clear to \nme and to many experts who study the military that our Armed Forces, \nparticularly our ground forces, are suffering from the strain on \npersonnel and equipment.\n  An article in today's USA Today notes that the war in Iraq is taking \nthe biggest toll on military equipment since the Vietnam war.\n  Last week, the National Security Advisory Group, chaired by former \nSecretary William Perry, released a report about the strain and risk \nfor our military. In their words:\n\n       Given the harsh environment of Iraq and Afghanistan \n     [resetting the force] is proving more extensive and expensive \n     than in previous operations. Estimates of the cost of \n     rehabilitating Army equipment coming back from operations \n     overseas continues to grow . . . in addition, both the Army \n     and the Marine Corps expect to see increasing costs \n     associated with recapitalizing aging forces and transforming \n     their capabilities for a broader range of 21st century \n     missions.\n\n  Gary Motsek, the Army's Deputy Director for Support Operations at the \nU.S. Materiel Command, has stated the Army has to repair or rebuild \nvirtually everything that goes to Iraq. If you have been to Iraq--and I \nknow many of my colleagues have--this is an intense and difficult \nenvironment to operate equipment; certainly intense and difficult for \nmilitary personnel there. The temperatures in the summertime can get to \nbe 120 degrees. There is sand throughout the country which is sucked up \ninto the blades of helicopters, into the intakes of moving vehicles on \nthe ground. The wear and tear is extensive.\n  The same is true with Afghanistan. It is very difficult, in addition, \nbecause of the high altitudes. It is extremely difficult for our \nhelicopters and our fixed-wing aircraft to operate, particularly \nhelicopters. These are very demanding environments and they are taking \ntheir toll on equipment. We have to ensure that our military forces \nhave this equipment.\n  Let me further point out, we are not talking about buying a new class \nof ships or planes. We are just talking about taking those vehicles \nthat have been run down because of combat operations and bringing them \nback into the shop, fixing them, repairing them, and getting them back \nto our troops. If we do not do that, then what we are going to see--\nperhaps not this month or next month or this year but inevitably--is \nthat our forces will be sent out with equipment which is inadequate, \nwhich is literally, perhaps, falling apart.\n  We owe it to these soldiers, we owe it to these marines, we owe it to \nthe Nation to make sure they have the best equipment, the best \nmaintained equipment. That is going to cost a lot of money. The \nquestion here today is, very simply: How will we pay for it? Do we give \ntax breaks to the wealthiest Americans in terms of dividend \npreferences, or do we give a dividend to our soldiers and marines? And \nthe dividend is equipment they can count on--reliable, well-maintained \nequipment, ready for battle. I would vote for a dividend for our \ntroops, not special dividend treatment for the wealthiest Americans.\n  In a briefing given to staff members of the Armed Services Committee \nthis month, the Army estimated over the next 6 years it will cost \napproximately $35.6 billion to reset and recapitalize the force.\n  Last November, the Marine Corps estimated it would cost $11.7 billion \nto repair and replace their equipment over the next 5 years.\n  These are costs that are already incurred. We cannot avoid them. This \nis not buying new things we need or want. This is fixing what we have \nand must operate. And there is no end in sight to our operations in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. We hope that improvements in the security climate \nwill allow forces to be redeployed, equipment to be redeployed. But any \nsensible observer in both countries would tell you quickly that our \npresence will be long term and the demands on our troops and equipment \nwill be there not just this year but for many years in the future.\n  GEN Paul Kern, who just retired as head of the Army Materiel Command, \ngave an estimate of between $60 and $100 billion to replace the Army \nequipment alone--just the Army equipment: to replace it, repair it, get \nour troops back to the condition they were before these operations \nbegan in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Last October, GAO released a report on military readiness. It \nassessed the state of 30 pieces of equipment, predominantly tanks, \nvehicles, helicopters, and aircraft. It made several disturbing \nobservations. It stated:\n\n       GAO's analysis showed that reported readiness rates \n     declined between fiscal years 1999 and 2004 for most of these \n     items. The decline in readiness, which occurred more markedly \n     in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, generally resulted from 1. the \n     continued high use of equipment to support current operations \n     and 2. maintenance issues caused by the advancing ages and \n     complexity of the systems. Key equipment items--such as Army \n     and Marine Corps trucks, combat vehicles and rotary wing \n     aircraft--have been used well beyond normal peacetime use \n     during deployments in support of operations in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  In sum, we are wearing this equipment out in combat operations \noverseas that are continuing today and will continue for the \nforeseeable future. This equipment is essential for our defense and for \nthe protection of our military personnel. We have to do this. It is \nunavoidable. And the question, again, is very clear: Are we going to \ngive a dividend to the wealthiest Americans or a dividend to our troops \nin the form of equipment they can rely upon, equipment they can use to \ndefend us, equipment that will protect them, equipment that will assure \ntheir families they have the best, so when they bid them farewell, as \ntheir unit deploys, they will not have to worry that equipment will \nbreak down and endanger their loved ones? That is our job. To me, the \nchoice is pretty clear.\n  This report of the GAO goes on to say:\n\n       Until the DOD ensures that condition issues for key \n     equipment are addressed, DOD risks a continued decline in \n     readiness trends, which could threaten its ability to \n     continue meeting mission requirements. The military services \n     have not fully identified near and long term program \n     strategies and funding plans to ensure that all of the 30 \n     selected equipment items can meet defense requirements.\n\n  This language is very disturbing. It suggests rather strongly that \nthe readiness of our military forces is in question in terms of \nequipment, certainly, if we do not respond quickly. And ``respond'' \ndoes not simply mean borrow some more money and throw it at the \nproblem. To me, it means making sure our priorities are such that we \ncan afford to do this not just today but in the years ahead.\n  Another GAO report states that more than 101,000 pieces of National \nGuard equipment, including trucks, radios, and night vision devices, \nhave been sent to soldiers in operations overseas. This means the Guard \ndoes not have the equipment it needs to respond to crises here. It is \nanother aspect of our deployment situation. We have shipped Guard units \nover along with their equipment. The equipment has stayed behind. The \nGuard has come back. If there is a crisis in the homeland, if there is \na natural disaster, we are deploying Guard units without a lot of the \nequipment they had just 2 or 3 years ago, a lot of the equipment which \nis essential to their plans to respond to crises in the homeland and \nnatural disasters.\n  I believe this problem was exemplified during Katrina when the Guard \nstated its communications equipment had been overseas and, therefore, \nit was unable to operate effectively in the aftermath of the disaster.\n  There are real costs that we have to face today, and we have to face \nit not simply by charging it to the next generation but by biting the \nbullet, asking people to make sacrifices. And, again, when the \nsacrifice is the choice between a dividend that accumulates for the \nvery wealthiest Americans or a dividend for the troops, give the \ndividend to the troops.\n  Mr. President, these reports are warning signs. Now, Secretary \nRumsfeld continues to state that our troops are performing well and are \nbattle\n\n[[Page S429]]\n\nhardened. He is absolutely correct. But our troops and their equipment \ncannot continue to perform well without the proper upkeep. Our troops \nneed a break, and their equipment needs to be repaired and refurbished. \nI think he has to distinguish, and we all have to distinguish, between \nthe individual valor and skill and patriotism of soldiers and marines \nand their units and the institutional Army and Marine Corps, with their \nneed to continue to provide adequate equipment for all of these troops \nand these units.\n\n  There is no doubt about the fighting spirit and fighting skill and \nthe tenacity and the experience of these units today. But you have to \nlook very clearly at the capacity of the Army and the Marine Corps to \ngenerate the equipment and rehabilitate the equipment and repair the \nequipment that these soldiers and marines rely upon.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld says reports such as the Perry report I mentioned \nand the report by Andy Krepenevich--a former military officer who was \nactually commissioned by the Pentagon to do the report, and who looked \nat it and reached the same conclusions, essentially, as the Perry \nreport--he says they were looking at old data when they found that the \nmilitary was strained. There Secretary Rumsfeld is wrong. These reports \nwere not looking back, they were looking forward. And they see danger \nahead, and make the point very clearly that our Army is not broken, but \nthe strain is increasing. And if we do not act now--responsibly now--to \nfix these problems, the future ahead is dire, indeed, for our forces in \nterms of their readiness, in terms of their equipment preparedness, and \nin terms of the strain on our personnel.\n  The responsible thing to do is not simply go out and borrow $50 or \n$60 billion more and add it to our deficit, it is to make the hard \nchoices here, to demand a little of the sacrifice that our soldiers and \nmarines and sailors and airmen and airwomen give us every day.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld says we have the finest fighting force in the \nworld. I agree with that. The difference is, I want to keep it that \nway, and I want to do it honestly. I want to do it by paying for it. I \nwant to do it by making sure we set the priorities right here, now, not \nsimply borrowing more money, going down the road borrowing again and \nagain and again because eventually--and I believe the military \nunderstands this--we are not going to be able to fund these operations \nand these requirements by simply having supplemental appropriations \nevery year which are outside the budget.\n  At some point, the effect on our economy, the effect on our fiscal \nposture is so crippling that we will have to scale back. And the people \nwho will be squeezed out, then, will be the soldiers and the marines \nand the sailors and airmen and airwomen we count on today to defend and \nprotect us.\n  The Perry report makes the following recommendation:\n\n       In order to restore the health of U.S. ground forces in the \n     wake of Iraq, the nation must step up and invest substantial \n     resources to reset, recapitalize, and modernize the force. . \n     . . Restoring the health of both services is not a matter of \n     simply returning them to their status quo; it is a matter of \n     ensuring that they are organized, trained, equipped and \n     restored to meet the full range of traditional and \n     nontraditional challenges in the future.\n\n  Next year alone, in the budget and the supplemental, the Army needs \n$23 billion and the Marines need $7.5 billion for reset and \nrecapitalization--again, military terms for repairing, rehabilitating, \ngetting the equipment back up to operational readiness. While we have \nyet to see the President's budget, or the supplemental, it is not \nguaranteed these needs will be funded.\n  In recent years, the President's budget requests and the \nsupplementals have provided less funding than the military services \nhave requested. Furthermore, if it is funded, this just covers this \nyear's bill. These bills will continue on for many years.\n  As I pointed out before, at some point economic pressures--and, \nironically, those pressures will be more severe if the situation in \nIraq and Afghanistan begin to resolve themselves--those pressures could \ncurtail the adequate funding necessary to fully care for this equipment \nand the personnel who operate this equipment.\n  It is time we asked Americans to sacrifice a little for those who do \nso much for us. As someone who commanded a company of paratroopers in a \nyounger day, I can tell you, there is nothing more disconcerting to \nmorale than not having good equipment to do your job. Not only does it \nendanger the soldier and the marine, it sends a much stronger signal \nabout our priorities and what we care about in terms of supporting the \nmilitary than any speech given by any politician in Washington or \nelsewhere.\n  That is our responsibility today, to stand up and be counted--like \nthose troops are standing up and being counted--to take care of their \nneeds, and do it responsibly, not add more to the deficit, not add more \nforce to choke off, eventually, the funding they need so desperately to \ndo their job so well.\n  More than anything else, when soldiers go out on operations, they and \ntheir families want to be certain they have the best equipment and that \nthat equipment is well maintained. Rather than providing dividends to \nthe wealthy, let's provide our troops with an equipment dividend.\n  Our fighting men and women have volunteered to risk their lives every \nsingle day in a war zone for the rest of us. They deserve the best, and \nwe owe it to them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. To me, the logic is \ncompelling. The need to help is there. Let's put our actions where so \nmany times our words are.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, once the Senate amendment is laid down, I \nintend to offer an amendment for myself and Senators Kennedy, Kohl, and \nLevin that will eliminate a very expensive pair of provisions contained \nin the 2001 tax bill, most of the benefits of which go to those \nindividuals in America making over $1 million a year in income. The \namendment I intend to offer would take that money and increase the \nbenefits going to working-class families trying to cover the costs of \ndaycare for their children or elder care for their parents. And the \nrest of the money would go for deficit reduction.\n  The bill we will have before us, as soon as the Republican leader \nlays down the Senate amendment, will sharply increase the deficit in \nfuture years by as much as $70 billion. Again, most of the benefits, as \nusual, go to taxpayers making high incomes.\n  Indeed, the House bill is even worse, with 40 percent of the benefits \ngoing to those making over $1 million per year. Forty percent of the \nbenefits in the House-passed tax bill go to those individuals making \nover $1 million a year.\n  Now, the chairman of the Finance Committee in the Senate discussed \nhow this measure contains a 1-year extension of relief from the AMT, \nthe alternative minimum tax. He correctly noted there are millions of \npeople who would face a tax increase if the 1-year fix in the Senate \nbill is not passed. Well, it should be passed. But I believe it ought \nto be fully paid for.\n  Fixing the AMT problem in the long term is likely to cost about $860 \nbillion from 2007 to 2017--$860 billion. So it is a big problem.\n  Well, why do we have this big alternative minimum tax problem that \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee was talking about? In large part, \nit is because of the way the 2001 tax bill was put together and pushed \nthrough by the Republican majority. That measure, very much on purpose, \ndoubled the number of people who would be affected by the AMT in the \nlong term, while only fixing the problem for the first couple of years.\n  Now, I have here a chart prepared by the Joint Tax Committee, which \nwas prepared when we were considering the 2001 tax bill. People knew \nabout it. What is important to note is, this chart was prepared in 2001 \nby the Joint Tax Committee. We had this data before us before the \nRepublican majority pushed through the 2001 tax bill. We had it before \nus. Prior to the 2001 tax bill being passed, we could see that in 2006 \nthe estimate was that about 8.7 million taxpayers would be affected by \nthe alternative minimum tax. Going out to 2010, there would be 17.5 \nmillion.\n\n  They passed the 2001 tax bill. Look what the Joint Tax Committee said \nwould happened if the bill became law. By 2006, the amount of taxpayers \naffected by the alternative minimum\n\n[[Page S430]]\n\ntax, an estimated 19.6 million--over double what it would have been had \nwe not had the 2001 tax bill passed. In the first years, they are all \nabout the same amount of taxpayers because they included a short-term \nfix to the problem. It explodes in 2005 and 2006, and it explodes in \n2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n  So for the chairman to say that we have this big problem and we have \nto do something about it--well, yes, but why do we have this problem? \nWe have the problem to a significant degree because of what they did in \nthe 2001 tax bill. You can actually say that if we hadn't had the 2001 \ntax bill, about 8.7 million taxpayers would still affected by the \nalternative minimum tax. Now, if the estimate held, it is 19.6. So you \ncould say over half of those with the alternative minimum tax have it \nbecause of what the tax committees did in 2001 and what the Senate did \nand the House did and what the President signed into law.\n  I find it of more than passing interest that people now come in and \nsay: My gosh, we have this terrible problem, we have to fix it. I am \nsorry. You created a large part of the problem. By not fully addressing \nthe AMT timebomb, the 2001 bill was able to encompass a range of \nadditional tax cuts. These other tax cuts were designed in such a way \nthat their costs would explode later on. That is why the President, in \nhis State of the Union Message, said: We have to make the tax cuts \npermanent. But, it is going to explode.\n  That is setting the groundwork for my amendment because my amendment \nseeks to do something about a pair of the provisions which were \nincluded in the 2001 tax bill that is grossly unfair. It is a provision \nin the 2001 tax bill that I defy any Senator--I ask if there is any \nSenator who has correspondence from individuals saying that they want \nthese two provisions repealed. I would like to see it. These two \nprovisions called PEP and Pease.\n  Rather than get into the ways to describe it--it is a little \nconvoluted. It has to do with deductions and how you figure deductions \non upper income people and exemptions. That is basically it.\n  What happened in 2001 in the tax bill is they said: Beginning this \nyear, in 2006, we will phase out provisions of the tax laws that were \nput in in 1990. The first year to go into effect may have been either \n1990 or 1991. It was put in by President George Herbert Walker Bush. \nWhy? To reduce the deficit. So we lived with these provisions from 1990 \nuntil 2006--16 years.\n  What my amendment does is three things. It stops the phaseout of \nthese PEP and Pease provisions, which, as I pointed out, helps mostly \nthose making over $1 million a year. And it will cost the Treasury $29 \nbillion between now and 2010--$29 billion that we will be collecting \ntaxes from high-income people which will go into the Treasury between \nnow and 2010 will not be collected. And in the decade after that, the \ncost of this phaseout is $146 billion.\n  My amendment stops this phaseout. It reallocates the savings in the \ncoming 5 years to reducing the deficit and a portion of the savings to \nhelping child and dependent care. Again, the need for this is \noverwhelming and obvious. This fiscal year alone, in order to pay for \nthe Iraq war and hurricane damages, the deficit is expected to climb \nback toward $360 billion, close to an all-time record. Yet, today on \nthe Senate floor, the majority party is using reconciliation not to \nreduce the deficit, which is what reconciliation was supposed to be for \nwhen we passed it in the 1970s--reconciliation was in order to hold \ndown the deficit. Here we have a reconciliation tax bill before us that \ndoesn't reduce the deficit but increases the deficit even further by \npassing another $70 billion in tax cuts. It actually increases the \ndeficit.\n  This is reckless. It is unconscionable. Our first priority must be to \nuse the savings from my amendment. It will reduce the deficit by more \nthan $100 billion in the long term.\n  My amendment also updates the child and dependent care tax credit. \nThis credit is provided to working families who have children in \ndaycare who need to pay for the care or who need to pay for the care of \nelderly parents. If taxpayers aren't working, they don't get the \ncredit. This goes to working families. Right now, the maximum amount \nthat can be taken is $3,000 for child or dependent care or up to $6,000 \nfor two or more. That was set some years ago. Clearly, dependent costs \nhave been rising. My amendment would increase the amount of dependent \ncare costs that can be taken against the tax credit to $6,000 for a \nsingle child or any other dependent or $10,000 for two or more.\n  The amendment also increases the percentage of the credit that can be \ntaken. Right now, a taxpayer with $50,000 of income gets a 20-percent \ncredit. Under my amendment, that would increase to 30 percent, and \nthen, as income increases, it would phase out and go down to 20 \npercent. So for a person making $50,000 a year, this could increase the \nsize of the tax credit from $1,200 a year to $3,000 a year. That is \nmeaningful. That would help working families with their childcare or \ndependent care costs.\n  The cost of improving this credit would be about $2 billion, while \neliminating PEP and Pease would save about $23 billion through 2010. So \nthe rest of that would be used for deficit reduction. But the big gains \nwould occur in the long term, since the full savings are expected to be \nover $140 billion in the decade after 2010.\n  Again, the repeal of these PEP and Pease provisions, which \noverwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans, was included in the \n2001 tax bill. But the effective date was delayed until 2006 which took \na far smaller share of what could be spent in the first 10 years. But \nlike other provisions in the 2001 tax bill, it created a bow wave of \ndebt beyond. We simply cannot afford it.\n  Five years after the passage of the 2001 tax bill, the chickens are \nnow coming home to roost. We now know the true cost of those 2001 tax \ncuts. They have created a string of record budget deficits, and the \ndeficits are only going to get bigger in the years to come. It is time \nto restore some measure of order and sanity to the Federal budget.\n  But the majority party, the Republicans, are not saying ``enough.'' \nDespite record deficits, despite a war in Iraq that has now cost us \nover $250 billion and rising, despite the unpaid bills for two \ndevastating hurricanes, they are demanding more tax cuts, more tax cuts \noverwhelmingly for the wealthiest in our country. They are using this \nreconciliation process not to cut the deficit but to ram through \nanother $70 billion in tax cuts rather than find offsets, increasing \nthe deficit. To make matters worse, they are insisting that the PEP and \nPease tax reductions go forward, adding another $146 billion to the \ndeficit over the next decade. Why? Again, to give more tax breaks to \nthose who least need it.\n  According to CBO, more than half of the benefits of repealing PEP and \nPease would go to taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year. \nNinety-seven percent of all the benefits of repealing this tax measure \nwould go to those earning more than $200,000 a year, 97 percent, half \nof it to those making over $1 million a year.\n  Again, when I raised this issue several months ago and I did, and we \nhad a vote on it during the so-called vote-arama last summer--the \nchairman of the Finance Committee came to the floor and said that my \namendment, which would retain the PEP and Pease provisions which had \nbeen in the law since 2000, would effectively be a tax rate increase. I \nam sorry. That is not right.\n  All I am saying is, don't lower the effective rates on people making \nmore than $1 million and those making over $200,000 a year with these \ntwo provisions. That is what the law was. If the provisions were in the \nlaw, my amendment would keep those rates the same. What the majority \nparty did in the 2001 tax bill is, they took the effective tax rates \nand further lowered them.\n  So it is wrong to say that my amendment will increase rates. My \namendment would just keep the rates the same as they have been for 15 \nyears. So there is no effective rate increase with my amendment. All I \nam doing is saying: Don't cut it out. Keep it in the law. I wanted to \nclear up that point.\n  Let me state the obvious. The rich don't need PEP and Pease taken out \nof the law. I have not heard from any rich people in America saying: \nOh, I have to get rid of this PEP and Pease that has been in the law. \nThey hardly notice it. Yet we are just going to give them some more \nmoney. We are going to take money from hard-working Americans who have \nto pay their taxes, and\n\n[[Page S431]]\n\nwe are going to give it to the wealthy. That is all they are doing by \ndoing away with PEP and Pease. It is income transfer from working \nfamilies to the wealthy.\n  I am going to offer this amendment to keep PEP and Pease in. And to \nuse the money to offset the deficit and to help pay for the increased \ncost of childcare and dependent care.\n  Again, I believe that by voting for this amendment, Senators have an \nopportunity to join with the American people to say: Enough of this \ngiveaway to the wealthy. Enough of putting the burden on our grandkids \nto pay these huge bills. Enough of exploding the deficit. Enough of \ngoing to China with hat in hand and asking them if they will just \nplease buy some more of our bonds, which they are doing. That is \nanother issue we have to address--the amount of our debt being \npurchased by foreign countries, especially by China.\n  Now, you may say that is not a problem right now. Well, China already \nfinances our debt to the tune of more than $800 billion. That gives \nthem leverage in trade disputes and in diplomatic negotiations. It put \nour whole economy at the mercy of decisions made by the Chinese \nGovernment regarding our bonds they own, which at last look was not a \ndemocratically elected government, by the way. They may choose to dump \ntheir dollars and hurt our currency and throw us into a recession.\n  We are increasing our deficits and giving more tax giveaways to the \nwealthy. I urge my colleagues to vote yes to reduce the deficit, yes \nfor shared sacrifice, and yes to help working class families with their \nchildcare and dependent care.\n  When the Senate lays down its amendment, I will be offering this \namendment. I assume it will be some time tomorrow. I hope to have a few \nmore minutes to expound on it tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  Let me begin by congratulating Senator Harkin for his outstanding \nexplanation of some of the flaws in the reconciliation bill that we are \nreceiving from the House. I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus \nfor the fine work they are doing in trying to deal with what is \nprobably the biggest ticking timebomb we have in the Tax Code, and that \nis the alternative minimum tax. It is absolutely a critical necessity \nfor us to address that.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment to the tax \nreconciliation bill that I intend to offer at the appropriate time.\n  The amendment achieves two goals. First, it helps keep a promise the \nPresident made to rebuild the gulf coast in the wake of Hurricane \nKatrina. Second, in a $70 billion bill laden with tax cuts for the \nwealthy and well- connected, it sets aside less than 1 percent for the \nneediest in our society.\n  Two weeks after Katrina made landfall, President Bush stood in the \nruins of New Orleans and vowed to ``do what it takes'' to help the \nregion recover. He also acknowledged the terrifying images of abject \npoverty that struck Americans on their TV screens and said, ``We have a \nduty to confront this poverty with bold action.'' Five months later, \nthe President's timid actions have not matched his bold rhetoric. He \nhas not lived up to his promises.\n  My amendment uses a cost-effective and proven tool in our tax code--\nthe child tax credit--to extend aid to 1ow-income working families \naffected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  Enacted in 1997, the child credit allows families with qualifying \nchildren to receive a credit of $1,000 per child against their Federal \nincome tax. Unfortunately, the credit is skewed so that many families \nwho need it the most can't get it.\n  Under current law, families that earn less than $11,000 get no \nbenefit from the refundable child credit. That means that a child is \nleft out of the credit even if her parent works full time at minimum \nwage, which has not increased since 1997. And the child doesn't get the \nfull benefit of the $1,000 credit until her parent earns close to \n$18,000, or even more if the child has siblings.\n  What's worse, if her parents' incomes stagnate, are disrupted for any \nreason, or the economy stalls and work hours or wages are reduced, the \nvalue of the credit drops or even disappears. Under current law, almost \n17 million children get less than the full credit.\n  We all know what happened to the families on the gulf coast due to \nHurricane Katrina, and it will be a long time before these families can \nrebuild their lives. Many of the families in the affected States were \nevacuated to other areas, and many of them cannot even afford to go \nback. And the Federal response so far has been inadequate to get these \nfamilies effectively back on their feet.\n  We need to do better. At a time when we are debating $70 billion of \ntax breaks, many of which will benefit those who need the least help, \nit is critical that we remember the worst off and the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society.\n  When I went to Houston after the hurricane, I met an evacuee from New \nOrleans who said to me: ``we had nothing before the hurricane, and now \nwe've got less than nothing.'' Life was hard for many families even \nbefore Katrina hit. In Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, for \nexample, more than 900,000 children under 17 years of age were so poor \nthat they got no child tax credit or only a partial credit. These \nStates had among the highest rates of children too poor to get the full \ncredit. In fact, more than one-third of the children in Mississippi and \nLouisiana didn't get the full benefit of the child tax credit. That is \nwhat our measure is designed to do.\n  This amendment, at a cost of less than 1 percent of the overall tax \nreconciliation bill, will provide necessary assistance to many of these \nfamilies. The amendment eliminates the income threshold that excluded \nall children in families with less than $11,000 of income.\n  My amendment sends a simple message: If you work, your kids get a \nbenefit. It provides a partial credit starting with the first dollar of \na parent's income for families who lived in the areas affected by \nHurricane Katrina.\n  The amendment is simple. It says that the children of low-income \nworking parents affected by Hurricane Katrina will no longer be denied \nthe child credit. You work, your kids get a benefit. If you don't work, \nno benefit. And if you want the full benefit, you have to earn at least \n$10,000, which is just about the income of a full time job at minimum \nwage.\n  That's a commonsense way to support families with children, \nespecially families that have experienced the huge cost--psychological \nand financial--of a natural disaster.\n  My amendment is also narrowly tailored and fiscally responsible. It \nis aimed at families affected by the hurricanes, and it provides short-\nterm support, expiring in 2008.\n  With this amendment, hundreds of thousands of this country's most \ndisadvantaged children will see an increase in their credit. Katrina \noffered us a window into America's poverty. Let's not let that window \nclose without doing something to provide a chance for America's \nchildren to rebuild their lives with dignity, hope, and opportunity. \nThat is what this country is about. I hope that is what this Chamber is \nabout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana.\n  I begin by once again expressing my appreciation to both he and my \ngood friend from Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and their \nstaffs. They do tremendous work and we are all grateful to them and the \nmembers of their staffs for pulling together important pieces of \nlegislation such as this one. It is not an easy job. It is one of the \nmost important, if not the most important, committees of the Senate. \nThey do a remarkable job and I personally thank them for a tremendous \njob. I know we don't make their lives any easier when we, who are not \non the committee, offer different amendments\n\n[[Page S432]]\n\nand ideas, but we have ideas we would like to suggest as well.\n  Let me mention, if I can--I will state the obvious--that we are a \nnation at war. It has been said over and over again by others, but \nmaybe not often enough. We enjoy a relative calm and comfort in \nWashington these days, but as we speak, we know that there are the \nyoung men and women of our armed services who are in harm's way in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. These soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are \nbravely defending our freedom on battlefields overseas, and keeping \nAmerica safe and secure at home. The President, last evening, in the \nState of the Union Address spoke to this issue, and the thunderous \nresponse from Democrats and Republicans in the joint session of \nCongress, I think, evidenced the strong support we all feel for these \nbrave men and women who wear the uniform of the United States both on \ntroubled battlefields as well as elsewhere around the globe. They \ndeserve our unending support and admiration for their work.\n  We all know that over 2,200 men and women in uniform have been killed \nin Iraq, and over 16,000 have been severely wounded. The U.S. \nGovernment should have few higher priorities than taking care of our \nmilitary veterans who have served in harm's way to defend our freedom.\n  Sadly, however, the Bush administration in recent years has had other \npriorities, it would seem. Throughout the last 5 years, the \nadministration failed, in my view, to meet its commitments to our \ntroops and their families, despite the rhetoric coming from the White \nHouse. In fact, just days ago we learned the Pentagon has now only \nstarted to address the inexcusable and shocking shortfalls in troop \nprotection. Three years into the Iraq war and more than 4 years after \nthe start of the conflict in Afghanistan, the Pentagon has just now \ndecided to order more than 200,000 additional sets of body armor. \nSadly, it may take another year before all of this equipment reaches \nour soldiers and marines deployed in harm's way.\n  The administration's failures have not ended there. When our troops \nhave come home, the Government's efforts to meet their needs also has \nfallen short. In fact, last year, despite adamant denials by the \nadministration, we now know as a matter of fact that the President's \n2006 budget fell over $1 billion short of meeting veterans' health care \nneeds. Although our colleagues such as Dan Akaka of Hawaii and Patty \nMurray of Washington, had said so from the very outset last year on \nthis floor and warned about what was being done, Congress had to step \nup as late as June to restore funding in an emergency supplemental.\n  Such an occurrence, in my view, is unconscionable--that the White \nHouse's Office of Management and Budget seemed to treat America's \nveterans and their health care needs as almost an afterthought. I fear \nthe administration is poised to repeat that mistake in 2007 as well.\n  Indeed, we already know that our Federal resources are straining to \nmeet veterans' needs, particularly the needs of military personnel just \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  According to the Department of Defense, 120,000 servicemembers, or 28 \npercent of military veterans returning from Central Asia, are being \ntreated in the VA system. But for some reason, the administration \nrefuses to incorporate those very figures into its development of the \nVA budget.\n  Other medical facilities treating America's brave men and women are \nstraining as well--military hospitals, such as Walter Reed, put on the \nbase closure list by the administration; State veterans facilities \nfunded by State budgets already stretched far too thin, such as my own \nState of Connecticut's State Veterans medical and residential \nfacilities at Rocky Hill; and private health facilities that help \nveterans throughout the country.\n  It has been noted recently in the press that a rehabilitation center \nfor amputees and other wounded soldiers is being built near the Brooke \nArmy Medical Center. This critical facility, to be established at Fort \nSam Houston, will be the nation's premier facility for treating troops \nwho have lost limbs, suffered severe burns, blindness, and head \ninjuries on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  But as the San Antonio Express-News recently asked on its front page: \nWhy isn't the Federal Government paying for any of it? In fact, \nalthough eventually this facility will be handed over to VA and Army \npersonnel to administer, its construction is being fully financed with \ndonations of private citizens.\n  I admire those making these contributions to support this facility \nfor our heroes, but the idea that the Federal Government would not be \ntaking better care of our veterans, I think, is an outrage. But \napparently, the Bush administration believes that our military veterans \nshould have to rely on the charity of private citizens to provide the \nresources for their critical care--because to the White House, tax \nbreaks for millionaires seems to be a far bigger priority.\n  Such logic simply makes no sense. It is our Federal Government's \nresponsibility to meet its obligations to our combat veterans.\n  I mentioned the other night that I had a knee replacement operation a \nfew weeks ago. I go downstairs in this very building and I get \nrehabilitation. We have a wonderful facility where I can spend an hour \neach day and get rehabilitation. I am happy to do that.\n  Explain to this Senator why it takes private donations to provide \nfacilities for rehabilitation for veterans coming back from Iraq or \nAfghanistan who lost a leg, is blind, or has suffered burns or other \nserious injuries? There is something wrong with a situation when \nMembers of Congress can get taken care of, but our veterans do not.\n  The amendment I will be offering tomorrow will provide critical \nresources to facilities such as the Center for the Intrepid in Texas \nwhich, due to current shortfalls in the federal government, is being \nconstructed using exclusively private funds.\n  Again, I respect immensely those making the private donations, but we \nhave to do better on behalf of our veterans than we are doing. It is \nunconscionable that we now have to rely on the charity of citizens to \nestablish important rehabilitation centers for our military veterans.\n  We already know that our Federal resources are being stretched thin \nas a result of this administration's policies. The package of budget \nreconciliation legislation this body has considered over the previous \nfew months presents us with a clear choice in philosophies: Do we \ninvest in the priorities that will meet our commitments to America's \nbrave men and women who have sacrificed on the battlefield for our \ncountry, or do we continue to prolong a primitive agenda that has \nfailed to address the major challenges of our era?\n  We heard the President at least begin to say the right things in his \nState of the Union Message last evening to support our troops, and I \nthank him for that, but it is not enough just to talk about these \nissues; we need to do far more. We need to start matching our words \nwith our policies. Rather than put Federal resources toward important \nfacilities, including the ones I have mentioned, the President has \ndecided to reward the wealthiest of our fellow citizens with these tax \ncuts.\n  One could argue that no Presidential administration in history has \nbeen as generous toward the ultra-affluent as this administration has. \nUnder the tax breaks of 2001 and 2003 alone, individuals with incomes \ngreater than $1 million a year, who represent two-tenths of 1 percent \nof the population, have received more than $125 billion in tax-cut \nbenefits. Meanwhile, our soldiers and veterans are being told to go \nwithout essential items and rely on private donations to take care of \nthem with items such as body armor and the health care they need and \ndeserve.\n  If we cancel the final 2 years of the capital gains and dividend tax \nbreaks for two-tenths of 1 percent--two-tenths of 1 percent, Mr. \nPresident--of individuals with incomes greater than $1 million--only \ntwo-tenths of 1 percent--then we can save approximately $28 billion, \nwhile still preserving reduced rates for 99.8 percent of all the other \nAmericans.\n  My amendment would make this change, and with the $28 billion saved \nover the next 2 years, funds would be distributed to health facilities \nthat treat military personnel and veterans. These facilities would \ninclude, as I mentioned, Federal military hospitals, VA hospitals and \nclinics, State and other institutions that treat military\n\n[[Page S433]]\n\nveterans throughout our Nation. We owe it to America's men and women in \nuniform.\n  This is not hyperbole. These are the facts. It is tragic, in this day \nand age, that we can't do a better job of servicing these brave \nindividuals. So at an appropriate time tomorrow, I will offer this \namendment which will do what I have been talking about.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Montana and my colleague from Iowa \nfor their gracious leadership on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Baucus of Montana, for yielding a few minutes to me.\n  We are in the process of considering an important tax bill, the \nreconciliation bill. The chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator \nfrom Iowa, is on the floor now. I am about to offer an amendment which \nI have offered before. Senator Grassley is aware of this amendment. I \nam hoping this time to win his support for the amendment. Let me tell \nmy colleagues very briefly what amendment No. 2701 will do. I know the \ntime will come when we can make a specific offer of these amendments.\n  We have choices to make on the floor of the Senate just as families \nacross America have choices to make every day. We have to take a \nlimited amount of Federal revenue and decide who will receive it. In \nthis case, we are talking about who will receive a tax break. The tax \nbreak is rather substantial for the wealthiest people in America. We \ncan't quite put our finger on how many may benefit from this tax break \nthat will give them added benefits if you claim capital gains or \ndividends as income, but we know that the amount is substantial. In \nfact, the estimates I have suggest that over a 2-year period of time, \nthe extension on capital gains would cost some $20 billion. That is the \nreality.\n  So we have to decide whether giving a capital gains tax break to the \nwealthiest people in America is the best expenditure of America's \nresources. The only way to make that choice is to take into \nconsideration what else we might do with that money. My amendment No. \n2701 makes a specific suggestion, and here is the reasoning.\n  There are 9.1 million children in America without health insurance. \nNot having health insurance has its consequences for these children. \nAccording to the Center for Studying Health System Change, uninsured \nchildren, when compared to privately insured children, were 3\\1/2\\ \ntimes more likely to have gone without needed medical, dental or health \ncare; uninsured kids are four times more likely to have delayed seeking \nmedical care; five times more likely to go without needed prescription \ndrugs; 6\\1/2\\ times less likely to have a usual source of care.\n  Let me give a hard number. From the year 2003, 6 million children in \nAmerica went without needed health care. The President last night \nchallenged us and America to do something about health care in America. \nThe amendment which I am offering does something directly.\n  While Congress has failed to address the overall problem of health \ncare coverage, we should, at the very least, take steps to extend the \ncoverage of health insurance to our children to make health insurance \naccessible, affordable, and quality health insurance coverage.\n  Kids are the least expensive people to insure. The average cost to \ncover a child under the SCHIP program is $93.25 a month. So the total \ncost to the Federal Government to cover all 9.1 million children in \nAmerica under SCHIP would be about $7 billion a year.\n  Remember that figure I mentioned earlier. The capital gains tax break \ngoing to the wealthiest people, primarily to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica, is going to cost us, over a 2-year period of time, $20 \nbillion. We could cover all the kids in America for 2 years for the \ncost of the capital gains and dividend tax cuts and still have money \nleft over for deficit reduction.\n  My amendment will make it possible for all States to do what my home \nState of Illinois is already setting out to achieve: Make sure every \nchild in my State has health insurance.\n  I salute my Governor, Rod Blagojevich, who has engineered this \napproach. If Illinois achieves it--and I believe we can under his \nleadership--we will set a standard for the Nation. It will be \ninexcusable for States and for our Nation not to insure all the \nchildren.\n  If you are going to extend health insurance across America, wouldn't \nyou start with our kids?\n  My amendment would provide grants to States, safety-net providers, \nschools, and other community and nonprofit organizations to facilitate \nthe enrollment of 6.8 million children currently eligible for SCHIP but \nnot enrolled.\n  It will make all uninsured children in America eligible for the SCHIP \nprogram.\n  It will establish a grant program under which a State may apply for a \nwaiver to expand coverage of children in their State.\n  It will encourage States to cover all insured children by providing \nthem with an enhanced matching rate under SCHIP if they submit a plan \nto cover all children.\n  The majority of the benefits of the capital gains and dividend tax \ncuts go to households with incomes over $1 million a year.\n  Think about that. Do we want to provide a tax cut for families and \nhouseholds making over $1 million a year or do we want to provide \nhealth insurance for 9 million uninsured children in America? That is \nour choice. It is a choice on which we can vote.\n  With amendment No. 2701, Members of the Senate can make that choice. \nSo like families in America, we will decide our priorities. A family \nhas to decide whether it is going to buy a big car or a small car, an \nexpensive vacation or a modest one. We have to decide whether \nhouseholds making over $1 million a year are a higher priority than 9 \nmillion uninsured children. We have to decide whether giving those \nhouseholds more money to put into their savings account, the \nopportunity to perhaps buy another home or another car or a boat or \nsome luxury item is more important than basic health care for children.\n  I think it is a pretty simple choice, and I hope that my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle will remember what the President told us \nlast night: Health care is a priority for America. If it is a priority, \nwith amendment No. 2701, we will be able to move this country closer to \nthe goal of full insurance. Out of 46 million uninsured Americans, we \ncan make sure that the 9 million most vulnerable children are covered.\n  I think this amendment speaks to the priorities Americans want us to \naddress. There is no special interest group standing outside the door \nbegging for health insurance for children. There are plenty all around \nWashington begging for tax breaks for millionaires. To whom are we \ngoing to listen? The special interest groups for the millionaires or \nthe children of families across America who need health insurance?\n  We should make giving kids a healthy start in life a priority over \ngiving millionaires the high life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope every taxpayer in this country \nknows that what they heard was a philosophy that every dollar you make \nbelongs to the Government, and we are going to let you keep a little \nbit of it.\n  We kept hearing about tax cuts costing us, tax cuts costing us. If we \ngive you a tax cut, it is costing us in Government, and we can't do as \nmuch for you as if we tax you more.\n  So there is a basic philosophy behind this legislation whether we \nought to let tax cuts stay in the pockets of Americans and let them \nspend it and do the economic good and let the marketplace decide how \nthe goods and services in this country be divided or whether we ought \nto tax at a higher rate and bring it to Washington and let a few \npoliticians make a decision on how to spend it.\n  I opt for trusting the American people with how they spend their \nmoney and the growth that comes from the investment that creates jobs \nthat causes our economy to expand.\n  I will have more to say about some of the other speakers who have \nbeen in\n\n[[Page S434]]\n\nopposition to this bill as soon as the Senator from New Hampshire \nconcludes. I wanted to make that point before my good friend got out of \nhere because a lot of times he never gets a chance to hear what I say, \nand I wanted to make sure he heard it.\n  I yield whatever time he might consume to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa. I associate \nmyself with the Senator's comments. I agree, as I think most Americans \ndo if they apply common sense, and this is a little Midwestern common \nsense we are getting from the Senator from Iowa, as we always do, which \nis that the Government doesn't own this money. This money doesn't \nbelong in Washington. This money belongs in the pockets of the \ntaxpayers who earned it. And, yes, taxes must be paid, but they must be \npaid at a reasonable rate, a rate which allows people to continue with \ntheir lives, to make the investments to start a small business or to \nsend a child to college or to buy a home or purchase a car.\n  You cannot tax people simply because somebody in Washington has a \ngood idea and they want to pay for it and they figure, Let's go out and \ntake it from the people working for a living and bring it to Washington \nand spend it.\n  It reflects a certain elitism and arrogance to take that position, in \nmy opinion, basically saying to average Americans that those of us sent \nto Washington--and this great bureaucracy grown up in Washington--know \nmore about how to manage your life than you do as working Americans. If \nyou turn your money over to us, we will do a better job of managing \nthat money than you can do. I don't agree with that. I think the \nSenator from Iowa made that point, an appropriate point.\n  The point I want to reinforce is that the Senator from Iowa, as \nalways, has done yeoman's labor to bring forward a very strong bill to \nextend tax cuts or tax proposals which benefit working Americans. The \nirony of this is that it is being attacked from the other side of the \naisle with enthusiasm on the basis, essentially, as the Senator from \nIowa has pointed out, that tax cuts and extending tax cuts is a bad \nidea; that this money should stay in Washington. But, also, the irony \nof this is most of the items within this bill are actually supported \nfrom the other side of the aisle, or will receive significant votes \nfrom the other side of the aisle if they are taken up separately. These \nare items like the alternative minimum tax patch, items like extending \nthe R tax credit, items like the deduction for teachers who spend \nmoney for their classrooms so they can bring crayons or whatever they \nwant into their classrooms. Those are items which have general support \naround here. If you add them all up they make up the vast majority of \nthis tax package.\n\n  Yet if you were to listen to the generalities of the language from \nthe other side of the aisle, you would think this proposal to extend \nthese tax cuts was an outrage, that we were somehow taking money out of \nWashington and transferring it to rich people across the country. That \nis not true at all. It is not true at all. These tax cuts, in fact, \nbasically have the impact of giving working Americans the opportunity \nto take advantage of the dollars they earn and not have them taken by \nthe Federal Government.\n  I think equally important is the issue of the one item of tax policy \nwhich does not happen to be in the Senate bill but which is in the \nHouse bill, which is the extension of the capital gains and dividends \nrates, where we do get this debate or this argument that this is a tax \nwhich basically benefits wealthy Americans. To begin with, the \npractical effect of these proposals, the reduction in capital gains \nrates--or the maintenance of the capital gains rate at 15 percent and \nthe maintenance of the dividend rate at 15 percent basically benefits \nthe Government because the effect of those two tax rates is that it \ngenerates significant economic activity which results in more taxes \ncoming into the Federal Treasury.\n  You do not have to believe me on this. Just look at the numbers. The \nnumbers are hard, they are real, and they are there. Prior to the \ncapital gains rate going into place, the Joint Tax Committee estimated \nthat there would be $45 billion raised from capital gains in 2003. But \nafter the cut, it turns out there is $50 billion. That is a $5 billion \nchange.\n  Then in 2004 it was estimated there would be $44 billion with the \ncapital gains rate at 15 percent. After the change in rates, the \nFederal Government got $60 billion. In 2005 it was estimated that with \nhigher rates there would only be $49 billion coming in through capital \ngains taxes. It turns out with the lower rates the Federal Government \ngot $75 billion.\n  As a result of lowering the capital gains rate, the Federal \nGovernment received $47 billion we didn't expect to get. Those are \nJoint Tax numbers. Those are hard numbers. Those are real numbers--$47 \nbillion. Why is that? It is very simple. It is called human nature, and \nhuman nature drives what revenues are here at the Federal Government. \nIf you are going to have a high tax on someone when they sell their \nhome or when they sell their business or when they sell some sort of \nthe stock that they may have purchased a long time ago and it has \nappreciated in value, the odds are that person may make a decision: I \ndon't want to pay all those taxes upon making that sale, so I am just \ngoing to hold on to that asset. As a result, they hold on to the asset \nand the Federal Government does not get it. There is no sale, no \ncapital gains tax as a result of that, and the Federal Government \ndoesn't get any income from that event.\n  But when you lower that tax rate, as we did under the President's \nsuggestion, a person says: Now I can adjust to this. I can make this \nsale and I can live with this tax rate and then I am going to take the \nprofits from that sale and I am going to reinvest them. That creates \ntwo events that are very positive for the Federal Government and for \ntaxpayers generally. No. 1, it is a taxable event so that money comes \nin. As we have seen, $60 billion came in that was not there before, or \nwe did not expect it before because the people were making that \nactivist decision now that the tax rates were lower.\n  No. 2, what was money which was locked up in maybe a nonproductive \neconomic activity is moved. By human nature it is going to be moved \ninto something that is more productive, and that is going to generate \nmore economic activity. Maybe somebody is going to start a small \nbusiness or something with those extra dollars they now have, and that \nis going to create jobs. It is just basic economics that when you \nreinvest money like that you have the money go to a much more efficient \nuse, which produces a more productive, more efficient economy, and \ntherefore more jobs. So you get more tax revenues and you get more jobs \nout of a lower rate. This has been proven time and time again. It was \nproven by the Kennedy tax cuts. That was President John Kennedy. It was \nproven by the Reagan tax cuts, and now it has been proven by the Bush \nreduction in capital gains and dividends rates.\n  Reducing those rates creates more economic incentive for people to be \nproductive, and it actually generates more economic activity which is \ntaxable and therefore generates more income to the Federal Treasury, \nand as a result $47 billion of income came in that we would not \notherwise have had.\n  I misstated, I said $60 billion before. It was $47 billion during \nthat 3-year period we would not have gotten before--$47 billion more \nthan was anticipated.\n  Last year, as a result of this economic activity that was created by \nthis engine of productivity which was generated by having lower tax \nrates, we saw the biggest jump in revenues, I think, or the second \nbiggest jump in our history. We picked up literally tens of billions of \ndollars of income as a Federal Government that we did not expect to \nget. That helped reduce the deficit, and it also helped us carry on the \nbusiness of the Federal Government, specifically the need to fight \nterrorism, invest in health care, invest in education.\n  These tax cuts have been extraordinarily positive, and the extension \nof these rates is critical to maintaining that economic activity. But \nto get back to one point here, which is this: this package of proposals \ncoming out of the Senate has very broad support in this body, and it is \na good package in general. However, there is a single item that I \nhappen to take reservation with,\n\n[[Page S435]]\n\nand that is the deductibility of State and local sales taxes.\n  Why do I have concerns about that? It is not the biggest item in the \npackage. The R tax is bigger, and obviously the AMT patch is bigger, \nbut the deductibility of State and local taxes creates an atmosphere \nwhere we give to high tax States an incentive to increase their taxes \nbecause we allow the people in those States to deduct the taxes as \nthose taxes are increased. So you are basically transferring taxing \nroom, if you will, available assets that may be taxed from the State \ngovernments to the Federal Government, which allows those States which \npursued a high tax policy to benefit and creates, actually, an \nincentive in those States to increase those taxes.\n\n  I don't happen to be a big supporter of the deductibility of State \nand local taxes, but I suspect the majority of the other side is, even \nthough they are railing against this bill. My view is a State such as \nNew Hampshire, which doesn't have a sales or income tax and takes a \nvery frugal approach to government, should not be penalized for that at \nthe Federal level by turning a deduction over to other States, thus \nreducing Federal revenues, which encourages high-tax States--such as \nNew York, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, California--to basically \nraise their taxes.\n  This comes to the irony of this bill. Even though it is being \nattacked profusely and aggressively by the other side, it turns out \nprobably the majority of the Senators on the other side support \ndeductibility of State and local taxes, sales taxes. As a matter of \nfact, all those high-tax States I have listed have only Democratic \nMembers of the Senate. This bill benefits them. I would like to take a \ntest and offer an amendment to strike that language from this bill and \nsee whether there was strong bipartisan support for that type of \nlanguage. My own view is from a tax policy standpoint it makes little \nsense to have it in here.\n  In a general sense, what we are dealing with here is the economics of \nwhat happens when you give people the chance to keep more of their \nmoney. The simple fact is, what happens is that when you give people a \nchance to keep more of their money, they are more productive and they \nhave a bigger incentive to go out and work and therefore they create \nmore economic activity which in turn creates more taxable events which \nin turn creates more revenue for the Federal Government.\n  We should continue tax proposals which do expand and energize the \ncreativity of the economic entrepreneur. A key element of that is to do \nthe capital gains and dividend extension. If we fail to do that, in my \nopinion, we are going to have a fairly significant negative effect on \nrevenues coming into the Federal Government, and instead of having $47 \nbillion revenues coming in as a result of a lower capital gains tax \nrate, we will probably see we actually go back to the original Joint \nTax proposals or estimates, and we will lose revenue. So it is not a \nrevenue gainer to our Government to overtax people.\n  Although I said it in a convoluted way, it is just a summary or \nrestatement of what the Senator from Iowa said in a very down-to-earth \nand commonsense way. Therefore, I congratulate the Senator from Iowa. I \nappreciate his bringing this bill forward and look forward to working \nfor its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate hearing from all my \ncolleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, about everything that is \nwrong with the AMT because there is a lot wrong with the AMT. But I \ntake great pleasure in trying to remind, particularly my Democrat \ncolleagues, that a Republican-controlled Senate and House in 1998 \ncompletely repealed the alternative minimum tax. They completely \nrepealed it, sent it to President Clinton, and he vetoed it. So I don't \nwant anybody telling me how bad the alternative minimum tax is and that \nsomething ought to be done so that middle-income Americans, who were \nnever intended to pay the tax, don't get caught paying it.\n  Besides the repeal that we proposed in 1998, I can also point to a \nlot of tax bills since then where we have done what we call hold-\nharmless so no more people are hit by the alternative minimum tax \nbecause of tax changes that you make in any tax bill which indirectly, \nthen, affects who might pay the alternative minimum tax.\n  So I specifically want to take issue with the remarks of my colleague \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin. It was suggested the tax cuts have \ncontributed to this AMT problem. That demonstrates a complete \nmisunderstanding of what we have done in several tax bills, going back \nto the year 2001, or it at least doesn't give us credit for proposing \nrepeal of the AMT in 1998.\n  It is true that we are required to act to extend the hold-harmless \nprovision as the Senate has done in Senate-passed reconciliation bills \nand in the years going forward--the bill we are on now and in the bills \ngoing forward. But that is the point of the hold-harmless. Of course, \nit is critically important that we included AMT relief in our bill. \nMoreover, it has been the subject of public debate, as all my \ncolleagues likely know. But we take issue with analyses that suggest \nthat tax cuts are the source of enhancing the AMT problem. Quite to the \ncontrary, the fact is that failure to index the alternative minimum tax \nfor inflation for the last 35 years is the key source of the problem.\n  I don't know why folks cannot own up to that fact and recognize that \nat a minimum we are going to have to index the alternative minimum tax \ngoing forward, if it is meant to serve its original purpose of hitting \njust very high-income people who avoid paying any income tax through \nuse of legal loopholes and not hit middle-income Americans.\n  Again, for the understanding of my colleague from Iowa who spoke on \nthis point--but other people have spoken on it as well, mostly from the \nother side of the aisle--in 2001 and 2003, in those tax bills, we made \nsure that the alternative minimum tax would not impact any more \ntaxpayers as a result of the tax reductions of those bills.\n  So it is entirely wrong to say that tax cuts bring about the AMT \nproblem or that we don't care about that problem or that we didn't do \nanything about that problem because we did in each of those tax bills.\n  We have to continue to uphold the promise that we made that we were \nnot going to tax any more people with the alternative minimum tax.\n  This is a very important part of this reconciliation bill that we \npassed back in November that we are now making a rerun of this year.\n  This bill includes $30 billion of alternative minimum tax relief to \nensure that Senator Harkin's argument is, in fact, untrue, and it is \nalso untrue as far as the 2001 tax bill and the 2003 tax bill is \nconcerned.\n  I wish to give some figures so people know what this is. It is not \njust in the State of New Jersey, as we heard from the junior Senator \nfrom New Jersey. It is not just a problem in Illinois, where we heard \nfrom the junior Senator from Illinois. It is not just a problem in \nMassachusetts, as we heard from the Senator from Massachusetts. The \nalternative minimum tax problem is a problem in Iowa as well.\n  Another point that my colleague brought up--I don't think anybody \nelse has talked about the arcane issues of what we call PEPS and Pease. \nI don't want to say those things without explaining what they are. They \nwere put in, I think, in the 1990 tax bill because nobody wanted to go \nover the 40-percent marginal tax rate. Yet they wanted to raise more \nmoney and have a higher marginal tax rate on a little higher income \npeople.\n  What was done in that tax bill to camouflage a higher marginal tax \nrate was to leave the marginal tax rate at 39.6 percent, but for \ncertain people above--for certain people of higher income--then phase \nout a lot of the exemptions that every other taxpayer can use and \neffectively raise the marginal tax rate--I do not know for sure, around \n42 percent--maybe people who were involved in subchapter S \ncorporations, maybe even a marginal tax rate around 45 or 46 percent. I \nam not sure exactly what those percentages were.\n  But the idea was the terms ``PEPS'' and ``Pease'' were put into the \nTax Code to camouflage higher marginal tax rates by making it look like \nnobody ever paid a tax rate above 39.6; whereas, the fact was a lot of \ntaxpayers got hit at a marginal tax rate above 40\n\n[[Page S436]]\n\npercent--in some cases quite a bit above 40 percent.\n  I am very troubled by the comments of my colleague regarding PEPS and \nPease because they are hidden in the marginal tax increase that affects \nmillions of Americans, including thousands of Iowans. We have 32,906 \nIowans that are hit by the Pease part of the Tax Code on their returns. \nAnd we have 14,000--almost 15,000--Iowans that are hit by what we call \nthe PEPS part of the Tax Code on their returns.\n  If somebody tells me that these are tax cuts for the millionaires, \nlet me tell you, I know that we don't have 32,900-plus, or 14,900 \nmillionaires in my State of Iowa.\n  So we are talking about camouflaging the Tax Code to raise the \nmarginal tax rate on a lot of middle-income Americans.\n  That was done in the 1990 tax bill. Starting this year, under the \n2001 tax bill, these are gradually going to be phased out.\n  I think it is truth in taxing, truth in packaging, that if you have a \nmarginal tax rate of 35 percent, it ought to be a marginal tax rate of \n35 percent. And you shouldn't remove a lot of exemptions from a certain \nnumber of people to raise it up to 40 or more percent. If you want to \ntax people that high rate of taxation, you ought to have the guts to do \nit.\n  We took those camouflage things out of the Tax Code because we wanted \na marginal tax rate of 35 percent which was transparent, with no hidden \nadditional taxes.\n  Now it is said that we are trying to benefit millionaires through \nthis, when 33,000 and 15,000 people--that would be 48,000 people in my \nState--are being hit by those taxes.\n  To listen to my colleagues, you would think that PEPS and Pease was \npaid only by millionaires. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nPEPS and Pease hit millions of families, two-income families that are \nstruggling to pay their mortgage, as most Americans do, struggling to \nsend their children to college, as most families do, or people who want \nto contribute to their churches and charities, as most middle-income \nAmericans do.\n  In fact, the families hit by PEPS and Pease are very often the same \nfamilies hurt by the AMT that my colleague was expressing so much \nconcern about.\n  PEPS and Pease is bad tax law. It is dishonest tax law. It \ncomplicates the Tax Code. It hurts families and discourages charitable \ngiving. It is bad tax law that needs to be shown the door.\n  We did that in the 2001 tax bill, truth in taxing, and somebody is \nfinding fault with it. It isn't a millionaire tax. Keeping PEPS and \nPease is a ``Full Employment for Accountants Act'' because of that \ncomplicated Tax Code, and the people who have to deal with it are going \nto hire more accountants to accomplish the goal that we have.\n  We have heard from many Senators today, singing the old song that the \nproblem of the deficit before us, the budget deficit, is because we cut \ntaxes. The tax cuts that have brought about our economic growth and \ncreated millions of jobs is good policy. I don't expect anybody to \naccept Senator Grassley, the Senator from Iowa, making that statement. \nThere is no one with better credibility on economic and tax policies \nthan Chairman Greenspan. And he has made it very clear that the 12 \nquarters of economic growth that we have had, creating 4.6 million new \njobs, and a higher rate of growth than we had even during the 1990s--\nand most of my Democrat colleagues would think the 1990s was the best \neconomy you could ever have. But in fact, the economic growth of the \nlast 12 quarters is higher than the average growth we had during the \nprevious administration. Chairman Greenspan said that the tax cuts are \nresponsible for this growth.\n  To get back to the reality of deficits, it is caused by record \nspending. It is done by Republican Congresses or Democratic Congresses, \nwhether we have a Democratic President or a Republican President. \nSpending beyond our means has caused our budget deficit problem.\n  Because of the tax cuts, revenues are way up--record highs projected.\n  Chairman Greenspan gives Congress credit for the tax cuts of 2003 \nbringing about the best economic growth we have ever had and which has \nresulted in $270 billion more coming into the Federal Treasury from \nincome taxes in 2005 than we had in 2004; in fact, so much beyond \nprojection that we had $70 billion more coming in throughout 2005 than \nwe even thought we would have coming January 1, 2005.\n  The answer is not to raise taxes and hurt our economy. The answer is \nto do something on the spending side of the ledger.\n  We can say, after the vote in the House of Representatives this very \nday by a 2-vote margin, they passed our budget reconciliation bill, \nsaving $39.6 billion over the next 5 years that Congress would have \notherwise spent if we had not passed that measure. We didn't get any \nhelp from the other side of the aisle on getting this budget \nreconciliation through.\n  That came from the fiscal responsibility of people on this side of \nthe aisle.\n  Whether it is tax cuts, spending cuts, tax increases, whatever the \nissue might be, if you listen to your people in town meetings--and I \nonly have the opportunity to listen to Iowans in my town meetings \nbecause I don't represent anyplace else in the country--I know I don't \nhave people coming to me and saying: I am undertaxed, tax me more. But \nI surely have people come to my town meetings and saying: You guys are \nresponsible for your spending there in Washington, DC. Get your \nspending down.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nWall Street Journal article, ``Iraq's Future, Our Past,'' be printed \ninto the Record. This article was written by Mr. Rastislav Kacer, Mr. \nPetr Kolar, Mr. Janusz Reiter and Mr. Andras Simonyi, respectively, the \nSlovak, Czech, Polish and Hungarian Ambassadors to the United States.\n  I applaud the Ambassadors' leadership and the work of the Visegrod \nGroup, a partnership of their four countries. Emerging out of a shared \nhistory of dictatorship, these Central European countries strive for \ncooperative and democratic development. They deeply understand the \nchallenges of an emerging democracy but champion its ultimate rewards. \nTheir vision and experience are strong examples for the country of Iraq \nand they stand ready to lend a helping hand.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 16, 2005]\n\n                        Iraq's Future, Our Past\n\n  (By Rastislav Kacer, Petr Kolar, Janusz Reiter, and Andras Simonyi)\n\n       When it comes to tyranny, we believe we can offer some \n     personal experience. After all, it was only a short while ago \n     that our countries emerged from Soviet oppression. During the \n     decades of dictatorship, our peoples' attempts to restore \n     freedom and democracy were crushed. Who would have thought in \n     1956 in Hungary, in 1968 in Czechoslovakia, or in 1980 in \n     Poland, that we could get rid of the dictatorial regimes in \n     our lifetimes and shape our own future?\n       The memories of tyranny are still alive in the minds of \n     many Czechs, Hungarians, Poles and Slovaks. We also remember \n     the challenges we faced early in our democratic transition. \n     It is a testament to the resilience of our peoples that we \n     are where we are now--members of NATO and the European Union, \n     and strong allies of the U.S. We got here by believing in the \n     transformational power of democracy and a market economy. But \n     we needed others to believe in us, too. We could not have \n     made it alone. We needed the perseverance and support of \n     Western democracies for freedom finally to arrive.\n       The attainment of our immediate goals of stability and \n     prosperity could have made us complacent. It has not. We feel \n     that as free and democratic nations we have a duty to help \n     others achieve the security and prosperity that we now enjoy. \n     That is why we\n\n[[Page S437]]\n\n     have been part of the coalition to help democracy emerge in \n     Iraq.\n       Establishing democracy in Iraq was never going to be easy. \n     Yet it is essential for the political and economic stability \n     of the entire Middle East--and also vital for the security of \n     our countries. We are convinced that for Iraq to become a \n     vigorous partner in the war on terrorism, the Iraqis will \n     need our continuous help for rebuilding their country, as \n     well as for establishing democratic institutions and a market \n     economy. The good news is that we are not alone; it's a truly \n     international partnership, based on a U.N. mandate. More than \n     30 nations are on the ground with the coalition and NATO, and \n     more than 80 have signed up for the ``new international \n     partnership'' with Iraq. European countries work closely with \n     the U.S. on strengthening stability and democracy in Iraq, \n     and the U.N. is providing key support to achieve our goals.\n       The Visegrad Group, which includes our countries, has been \n     one of the most effective regional partnerships in Europe \n     established after the changes of 1989. With our vast \n     experience in transitioning from dictatorship to democracy, \n     we can be of special help. Although the Central European \n     reality is quite different from Iraq, we offer our assistance \n     in building democratic institutions as well as civil society. \n     We can share the successes and challenges of our transition \n     with the Iraqis, as we all know that freedom comes at a \n     price. The experiences from the area of responsibility of the \n     Multinational Division Central-South prove that \n     transformation in Iraq can be completed with success. Right \n     now we are transferring more power and responsibilities to \n     the local Iraqi authorities, which, thanks to our assistance, \n     are capable of securing their future.\n       Democratic transition is a long, painful process. It \n     requires sacrifice. But, more than anything, it requires a \n     belief that democratic values will prevail and people will \n     have a better life as a result. We had that belief to guide \n     us during the most difficult years of transition and we want \n     to keep that belief alive in the people of Iraq. Maybe it \n     takes countries with vivid recollections of tyranny to serve \n     as the institutional memory of a larger community of \n     democracies. If so, we are ready to fulfill that role.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S437-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SOUTH AMERICA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this month,I led a delegation \nto South America to review security, trade, and foreign assistance \nissues. Joining me were Senators Martinez, Burr, and Thune. With the \nexception of my friend from Florida, this was the first visit to \nBrazil, Argentina, and Chile for my colleagues and me. In short, this \nis a region full of promise--and problems.\n  Let me begin my remarks with a word of appreciation to the \nGovernments of Brazil, Argentina and Chile for their excellent \ncooperation on security matters, including countering terrorism and \nnarcotics. These are shared threats and pose myriad challenges, whether \nin the case of Brazil's massive border--particularly with Colombia and \nVenezuela--the notorious tri-border area--TBA--of Brazil, Argentina, \nand Paraguay, or vicious terrorist attacks against Israeli and Jewish \ninterests in Buenos Aires in the 1990s. Given the unequivocal support \nfor indigenous coca growers by Bolivia's new President, Evo Morales, I \nencourage the State Department to further strengthen cooperation on \nsecurity matters with these countries in the months and years ahead.\n  Brazil, Argentina and Chile also deserve recognition for their \nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions, particularly in \nHaiti. While not always popular with domestic constituencies, their \nrespective contributions provide critical support for international \nefforts to secure stability in the region. Peacekeeping is not without \nrisks, and I condemn attacks against peacekeepers in Haiti, including \nthe recent incident in the Cite Soleil district of Port-au-Prince that \nkilled two Jordanian nationals.\n  Brazil, Argentina and Chile should be recognized for their support of \ndemocracy and human rights throughout the region. While we did not see \neye-to-eye on every issue, it is clear everyone is watching Bolivia and \nVenezuela closely. In one meeting in Brasilia, Senator Martinez \ncounseled that in determining the new agenda of President Morales, the \nregion would be wise to ``trust but verify.'' This is a wise maxim \nwhether assessing coca cultivation or threats to nationalize the energy \nsector in Bolivia, or professed support for democracy and justice in \nChavez's Venezuela.\n  In general, there is significant room for improvement in U.S. trade \nrelations with Brazil and Argentina, particularly regarding \nintellectual property rights and demonstrable support for the free \ntrade area of the Americas negotiation. Through meetings with business \nleaders in Brazil and Argentina, the delegation heard first hand many \nof the challenges facing the business community in both countries. \nPresident Kirchner would be wise to listen to the concerns of \ninternational companies doing business in the region regarding price \ncontrols and the harassment and intimidation of business leaders.\n  As one businessman familiar with Argentina's investment climate \nquipped, ``If you want to make a small fortune in Argentina, go there \nwith a big one.'' The challenge for President Kirchner is to maintain \nexpansion of Argentina's economy by attracting investment and capital--\nand not aiding in its flight.\n  Let me close with a word or two on Chile, a country clearly committed \nto democracy, the rule of law and free trade. Our delegation was \nheartened by the views of our Chilean friends and U.S. country team \nthat regardless of the outcome of the January 15 elections, won by \nMichelle Bachelet, democracy was alive and well in Chile, and that our \nbilateral relationship would remain strong. I am pleased our bilateral \nfree trade agreement, FTA, with Chile has been beneficial to both U.S. \nand Chilean businesses, with exports boosted by an estimated 40 percent \nsince the FTA's implementation in January 2004. Still, there is room \nfor improvement, and I encourage continued engagement on intellectual \nproperty rights issues. Ambassador Craig Kelly and his team are doing a \nterrific job in Santiago, and I have every confidence that under his \ncapable leadership relations will continue to be vibrant and strong.\n  Mr. President, I have shared a few, brief observations of this trip, \nbut I hope Senator Martinez,--who has much experience in this part of \nthe world, will speak to this body on his views of the region and, in \nparticular, the challenges to U.S. policy and business interests posed \nby Presidents Chavez of Venezuela, Morales of Bolivia, and Castro of \nCuba. There is much going on in South America deserving of the Senate's \nclose scrutiny.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S437-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S437-S438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAMAS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to take a brief moment to speak \nto the issue of U.S. foreign assistance for the West Bank and Gaza.\n  Hamas's victory at the polls poses immediate challenges to the United \nStates, the European Union, and other countries and organizations that \nprovide humanitarian and development assistance to the Palestinian \npeople. Perhaps frustrated with the corruption of the ruling Fatah \nParty, the slow pace of reforms, or, more darkly, supportive of \nindiscriminate violence against innocent Israeli men, women, and \nchildren through terrorist attacks on Israeli soil, Palestinians cast \ntheir ballots for an organization that supports terrorism and rejects \nIsrael's right to exist.\n  In the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinians had a choice between ballots \nand bullets--and chose both.\n  As domestic and international observers appear to have deemed the \nelection process as credible, Palestinian leadership choices are now \ncrystal clear. But as President Bush and Secretary of State Rice have \nalready said, the United States will not provide assistance to a \nforeign terrorist organization.\n  The ball is now in Hamas's court. Either its leadership will renounce \nterrorism and violence against Israel in both word and deed, recognize \nIsrael's right to exist, and--in President Bush's words--be a ``partner \nin peace''--or they will come to the harsh realization that governance \nin the territories absent foreign aid is an impossible task. In the \npast, American taxpayers have paid for Palestinian private sector \ndevelopment, health, community services, and higher education. This \ngenerous support is now in real jeopardy.\n  As the chairman of the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs \nSubcommittee, I intend to continue to follow developments in the region \nclosely and to work with the administration and others to determine the \nbest and most appropriate course of action regarding the provision of \nU.S. foreign assistance in the wake of the Palestinian elections.\n\n[[Page S438]]\n\n  To paraphrase the Israeli diplomat and politician Abba Eban, Hamas \nliterally cannot afford to miss this opportunity to renounce terrorism, \nrecognize Israel, and embrace responsible governance. If they do that, \nthey will find the missed opportunity very costly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S438-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, today the House of Representatives \ncompleted final action on the S. 1932, the Deficit Reduction Act of \n2005, DRA. I am pleased that this important legislation will soon be \nenacted into law.\n  It has been 8 years since Congress last passed a reconciliation bill. \nIn crafting S. 1932, we worked hard to ensure that none of the changes \nmade would adversely affect beneficiary coverage. The Deficit Reduction \nAct will allow States across the country to continue to offer these \nessential services to their beneficiaries.\n  The Deficit Reduction Act also includes a number of provisions to \nensure that the Federal Government pays Medicare providers accurately \nand appropriately. One such provision relates to payment policies under \nthe Medicare Advantage program. Specifically, Section 5301 of S. 1932 \nphases-out the budget neutrality adjustment for Medicare Advantage \nplans. Section 5301 and the joint statement which accompanied the \nconference report in the Senate requiring adjustments for differences \nin coding patterns is intended to include adjustments for coding that \nis inaccurate or incomplete for the purpose of establishing risk scores \nthat are consistent across both fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage \nsettings, even if such coding is accurate or complete for other \npurposes. This will ensure that the goal of risk adjustment--to pay \nplans accurately--is met.\n  I am also pleased that the Deficit Reduction Act includes the Family \nOpportunity Act. I have been working tirelessly on this legislation \nsince 1999 with Senator Kennedy. The measure will allow States to \ncreate options for families who have children with multiple medical \nneeds to buy into Medicaid while continuing to work. Families with \nchildren with such medical needs should not have to choose between \nproviding for their children and their children's health care. This \nprovision in the Deficit Reduction Act will help prevent just that.\n  I applaud the Congress for passing this important legislation today. \nBeneficiaries and taxpayers across the country deserve to get the \nhighest value for every dollar that is spent on Medicare, Medicaid and \nother safety net programs. This legislation will help accomplish that \nobjective.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S438-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S438-S439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, one of the many things one learns as a \nSenator is that speaking out about autocratic, corrupt and abusive \ngovernments invariably elicits a response.\n  The victims of such regimes, including human rights and prodemocracy \ncitizens who are often imprisoned and tortured, express their \nappreciation. Knowing that they have supporters halfway around the \nworld gives them hope.\n  The officials of those governments and their supporters respond \ndifferently. Knowing that they cannot honestly defend their ill gotten \ngains and abuse of power, they do what they can do. They attack the \nmessenger. And they do so through distortion and outright fabrication.\n  I have made several statements about the troubling situation in \nNepal, a poor country with the most majestic mountains on Earth, which \nhas received too little attention by the Congress. It is a country \nstruggling against a determined Maoist insurgency that has brought \nextortion, brutality and false promises of a better future to virtually \nevery province.\n  And it is a country in which an autocratic monarchy has sought to \nconsolidate its grip on power and take the country backwards after a \ndecade of fledgling democracy.\n  One year has passed since last February 1 when King Gyanendra \ndissolved the multiparty government, curtailed civil liberties, and \nimprisoned political opponents. He has ignored appeals of the United \nStates, India, and Great Britain, as well as the United Nations, to \nnegotiate with the leaders of Nepal's political parties on a plan to \nrestore democracy.\n  When the Maoists unilaterally announced and then extended a 4-month \ncease-fire, the army and the palace rejected out of hand the suggestion \nthat reciprocating could test the Maoists' intentions and possibly \ncreate an opening for dialogue to end the conflict.\n  What we are witnessing in Nepal is, put simply, a struggle between \nthe discredited, anachronistic past, and the possibility of a \ndemocratic future.\n  There is also a third possibility. A Maoist government that imposes \nits will on whomever remains in Nepal after a mass exodus, and which \nfurther destabilizes an already troubled region.\n  Predictably, those who have enjoyed the undeserved benefits of \nabsolute power and privilege want to hold on to what they have. They \nseem to believe that the Maoists can be defeated by military force. As \ndesirable as that might be, there is no evidence to support it.\n  Those who see the King's repressive policies as reckless and playing \ninto the hands of the Maoists, have risked their freedom and their \nlives by calling for an inclusive democratic process. And, as the \nsituation continues to deteriorate, calls for a republic are growing \nlouder.\n  On January 2, the Maoists ended their cease-fire by triggering bombs \nin several locations. A few days later they killed 12 police officers \nin Katmandu. They have carried out attacks in Nepalganj and other \ncities, causing civilian casualties. A week ago, in an apparent attempt \nto derail the controversial municipal elections scheduled for February \n8, gunmen who are suspected of being Maoists killed a promonarchy party \nmember in the city of Janakpur. These brutal acts should be universally \ncondemned. There is absolutely no justification for the use of violence \nto terrorize civilians or to disrupt an election.\n  But neither can it be said that the United States has an effective \npolicy when it appears to amount to little more than blaming the \nMaoists and repeating over and over that the King should reach out to \nthe political parties. He should, but for almost a year he has refused \nto do so and absent stronger pressure there is no reason to believe \nthat he will.\n  It also begs the question of what is the legitimate role in the 21st \ncentury for a monarchy that has squandered its moral authority and \nshown no competence for governing.\n  Three weeks ago, in the King's latest attempt to quell mounting \npublic criticism of his failed policies, the palace announced a \npreemptive curfew and a ban on political demonstrations. Since then, \nhundreds of prodemocracy citizens, including several political party \nleaders, have been imprisoned around the country.\n  Two weeks ago, the police used tear gas and water cannons to break up \na rally in Katmandu, and more political protesters were arrested. The \nformer Prime Minister remains in custody after a widely ridiculed \n``trial'' by the King's hand picked anticorruption commission.\n  The Nepali people want peace. But nearly a year after King Gyanendra \njustified his power grab as necessary to defeat the Maoists, they are \nstronger and peace is more elusive. As many others have said, the only \nviable way forward is through dialogue, including the Maoists, under \nUnited Nations or other international auspices, with the clear purpose \nof developing a broadly accepted plan to restore and strengthen \ndemocracy.\n  To those of Nepal's ruling class who in various opinion pieces have \ndistorted my words, mischaracterized my record and questioned my \nmotives, I can only say that sooner or later they will have to face \nreality. They could help save their country, but not if they continue \nto bury their heads in the sand and malign those whose only desire is \nto see a democratic, peaceful Nepal.\n  Nepal is a beautiful country with a remarkable culture. Its people, \nas resilient as they are, do not deserve the hardships of caste \ndiscrimination, poverty and violence that they endure daily. The \nMaoists have shown no respect for the rights of civilians. But neither \nhas the King shown that he has a workable plan to stop Nepal's downward \nspiral. His decision to hold municipal elections has only widened the \ngap between himself and the leaders of the political parties who were \nnever consulted, who see this latest move as part of a calculated \nstrategy to consolidate his power, and who have said they won't \nparticipate.\n  Far more creative and persuasive leadership is urgently needed in \nNepal, including from the army, as well as from the United States, \nIndia, China and other friends of Nepal, to prevent a tragic situation \nfrom becoming a disaster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S439-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S439-S440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONSOLIDATION IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY: RAISING PRICES AT THE PUMP?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this morning, the Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on the consolidation of the energy industry. \nRegretfully, due to a scheduling conflict, I was unable to attend the \nhearing which was noticed only 1 week ago. I come to the floor this \nafternoon because this is an issue that needs to be addressed, not only \nby me, or the Committee, but by this entire body. The exorbitant cost \nof fuel is one of the most critical issues facing our nation.\n  Strong leadership by this Congress is needed to help all of the \nAmericans whose pockets are being emptied by the skyrocketing costs of \nfuel. Consumers, small businesses, farmers, families trying to heat \ntheir homes in the cold winter months, senior citizens on limited \nincomes, every community in this country has felt the pinch of trying \nto keep up with energy costs. Everyone has suffered--or rather, almost \neveryone.\n  The day before yesterday, the big oil companies posted their year-end \nprofit reports for 2005. The five biggest--ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, \nConocoPhillips, BP, and Shell--trumpet raking in record profits for the \nyear. In fact, ExxonMobil, with $36.7 billion in profit last year, \nturned the highest yearly profit in U.S. history for any business.\n\n[[Page S440]]\n\n  We did not hear from these companies today because they have declined \nto appear at this hearing. I am disappointed by their decision. \nBoycotting this hearing will not stifle our questions or the need for \ntheir accountability to Congress and American consumers. The chairman \nhas announced a second hearing for the end of this month, and the \nexecutives from the oil companies will attend, whether voluntarily or \nin answer to subpoenas. We will not rest in our effort to understand, \nand then correct, the problems in the energy markets.\n  On its face, the deplorable issue here is not the unprecedented \nprofits garnered last year. Surely, any business the size of these \ncorporations could produce a high yield selling their product at $60 a \nbarrel. Rather, the striking issue here is how these profits compare \nwith years past. For example, since 1999, oil refiners have seen a 334 \npercent increase in yield made on each gallon of gasoline refined. \nMoreover, these same companies have more than doubled their control \nover oil production.\n  Time and time again, oil companies have defended startling statistics \nsuch as these. They claim that increased costs for production, \nexploration, and meeting environmental standards justify increasing \nprices at the pumps. This is obscene. I say it is time to invest in the \nAmerican people. We need to investigate excessive market concentration \nin the oil industry that is stifling competition, constricting supply, \nand ultimately harming consumers. And then we need to do something \nabout it.\n  I was glad to hear the President sounding like a Democrat on energy \nlast night in his State of the Union speech. I can only hope that his \nwords mean that he has finally abandoned the failed policy of the \nCheney energy task force that had worked in secret with Ken Lay and \nother energy industry bigwigs. Had we adopted the Democratic energy \nproposal on which Senator Bingaman and others have worked so hard over \nthe last several years, we would be much farther along. Nonetheless, we \nwelcome the President and, I hope, some congressional Republicans to \nthe Democratic emphasis on alternative and renewable fuels. After all \nthat the Bush administration and the Republican leadership have done to \nadvance the interests of the oil companies, including the attempts by \nHouse Republican leadership to insert special interest provisions in \nconference reports to give oil companies immunity for the environmental \nand health damage they cause, this reversal of position would be a good \ndevelopment for the American people.\n  Along with conservation, renewable energy is a key to a cleaner, more \nefficient energy future. If the President would work with us and follow \nthrough with sensible proposals, we can forge a bipartisan partnership. \nWorking together, we can do better to make this a safer more energy \nefficient and more prosperous country. I along with the rest of America \nwill be watching to see if these statements are reflected in the \nPresident's policies and budget request, however.\n  We need to relieve America's dependence on foreign oil. Although the \nMideast is not the source of the majority of our energy, its share has \ngrown during this administration. I also urge the President and the \nRepublican leadership of Congress to work with us to relieve our \ndependence on foreign investors and on borrowing from Social Security \nto finance the record deficits and growing debt that their policies \nhave created.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S440-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S440-S441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING CORETTA SCOTT KING\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I offer my \ncondolences on the passing of Coretta Scott King, who passed away at \nthe age of 78. Indeed, I offer these remarks on behalf of all \nMissourians who have been touched by her legacy and that of Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr. A tireless champion and partner in her husband's work, \nMrs. King's life represents an American story from which we can all \ndraw strength. She never stopped working toward the prize God called \nher to achieve.\n  Born in rural Alabama on April 27, 1927, Coretta Scott was the second \nchild of Obadiah and Bernice Scott, hard working parents who wanted \nmore opportunities than they had for their children. An ambitious \nstudent, Mrs. King graduated first in her high school class and \ncontinued her studies at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, OH. She had \na passion for education and music and went on to the New England \nConservatory of Music in Boston, following her graduation from Antioch.\n  It was in 1952 in Boston where she met the man who would become her \nhusband, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They were married the next year \nand eventually settled in Atlanta, where they reared their four \nchildren, Yolanda, Martin, Dexter, and Bernice. Mrs. King was by no \nmeans a bystander in the groundbreaking changes her husband worked to \nachieve. She was a partner in her husband's historic work to make this \ncountry whole.\n  Following the murder of her husband in 1968, Mrs. King could have \nchosen to retreat into the privacy of her family. Indeed, in the \naftermath of that tragedy, she was a widow who had the sole \nresponsibility of raising four young children. But instead, Mrs. King \nbravely chose to continue her husband's work and his quest for racial \nequality. She worked tirelessly to have her husband's birthday \nmemorialized as a national holiday and to establish the King Center, a \nlasting memorial and research institution dedicated to the Dr. King's \nprinciples of justice, equality, and peace.\n  Mr. President, Coretta Scott King continued her work to bring this \ncountry together until her final days. She never stopped believing that \nwe have a historic responsibility to move America forward and extend \nthe American dream to all those who seek it, regardless of race. Today, \nas a nation, we mourn Mrs. King's passing. We are thankful for her time \nhere with us, the fruits of her labor, and the profound impact she has \nleft on a grateful country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to offer some remarks on our loss \nof Mrs. Coretta Scott King, who has passed away at the age of 78. I \njoin my colleagues in cosponsoring and supporting S. Res. 362 to honor \nthe life of and express the condolences of the Senate on her passing.\n  Coretta Scott King was born April 27, 1927, on a farm in Heiberger, \nAL, to Obadiah, Obie, and Bernice McMurry Scott. Though her family \nowned the land, it was often a hard life. All the children had to pick \ncotton during the Great Depression to help the family make ends meet.\n  Graduating from Lincoln Normal School in Marion, AL, at the top of \nher class in 1945, Coretta went to Antioch College in Yellow Springs, \nOH. After graduation, she moved to Boston, MA, where she met Martin \nLuther King, Jr. They were married in 1953 on the lawn of her parents' \nhouse and with the ceremony performed by King's father. Coretta King \nreceived a degree in voice and violin at the New England Conservatory, \nthen moved with her husband to Montgomery, AL, in September 1954 after \nhe was named pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Together, they \nhad four children: Yolanda Denise King, Martin Luther King III, Dexter \nScott King, and Bernice Albertine King.\n  Mrs. King received honorary degrees from many institutions including \nPrinceton University and Bates College. She was a member of Alpha Kappa \nAlpha, a noted African-American women's sorority.\n  The King family was front and center to one of the most turbulent \ntimes of the 20th century. Just 2 weeks after the birth of her first \nchild, Rosa Parks was arrested on a Montgomery bus, helping spark what \nwould develop into the modern civil rights movement that would be led \nby her husband. The struggles that followed included a narrow escape \nfrom death in 1956 when Mrs. King and her daughter were home when a \nbomb exploded at the family's residence--her husband was speaking at \nRev. Ralph Abernathy's First Baptist Church at the time.\n  Mrs. King later put together a series of Freedom Concerts that \ncombined poetry, narration, and music to highlight the movement and \nalso raise funds for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In \n1962, she served as a Women's Strike for Peace delegate to the 17-\nnation Disarmament Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.\n  Notably, she preceded her husband by 2 years in opposing the Vietnam \nWar,\n\n[[Page S441]]\n\naddressing a 1965 antiwar rally at Madison Square Garden in New York \nCity, while also serving as a liaison to international peace and \njustice organizations.\n  Over the years, she was active in preserving the memory of her \nhusband and in other political issues. After her husband was \nassassinated in 1968, she began attending a commemorative service at \nEbenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta to mark her husband's birth every \nJanuary 15th and fought for years to make it a national holiday, a \nquest that was realized in 1986, when the first Martin Luther King Day \nwas celebrated and which we just recently celebrated 2 weeks ago.\n  In her own right, Mrs. King was vocal and influential on many issues, \nincluding opposing apartheid; opposing capital punishment; opposing the \n2003 invasion of Iraq; and advocating for the rights of women, lesbians \nand gays, as well as AIDS/HIV prevention.\n  I was disturbed to hear of Mrs. King's hospitalization in August 2005 \nafter suffering a stroke and a mild heart attack but encouraged by her \nprogress in regaining some of her speech and continued physiotherapy at \nhome. I understand that on January 14, 2006, Mrs. King made her last \npublic appearance in Atlanta at a dinner honoring her husband's memory \nand that, fittingly, she will be buried in Atlanta next to her husband \nat The King Center.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King were remarkable \npeople who led remarkable lives. Our Nation is a better place for their \nactions, and they will continue to live in our collective memory for \nmany years to come. I wish to offer her family and friends my deepest \ncondolences.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We first came to know Coretta Scott King as Dr. Martin \nLuther King's wife, but we came to treasure her for the more than 50 \nyears of courageous and inspiring leadership she gave to our Nation. \nDuring Dr. King's tragically brief yet profoundly important time as \nAmerica's most prominent civil rights leader, Mrs. King played an \nindispensable role, speaking before church and community groups, \nserving as a pastor's wife, and raising four children. She was Dr. \nKing's rock during one of the most turbulent times in our history.\n  Mrs. King's heroism and unyielding determination to continue the \nstruggle for justice and equality for all could not be more evident \nthan in how she responded to a despicable incident in 1956. Mrs. King \nwas in her home with her infant daughter, Yolanda, while Dr. King was \naway on one of his many missions for the civil rights movement, \nspeaking at the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, AL. Someone threw a \nbomb into the Kings' home, and the bomb exploded. Even though Mrs. King \nand little Yolanda narrowly escaped physical harm that day, the bombing \nfailed to deter her. Instead, Mrs. King's involvement in the civil \nrights movement intensified.\n  Following her husband's assassination, Coretta Scott King picked up \nhis mantle and made clear that his dream, of a just America, was her \ndream too. Over the nearly 40 years that followed, her fight for that \ndream took her to every corner of the world and into every heart that \nloved justice. She established the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for \nNonviolent Social Change. She worked to advance the cause of justice \nand human rights around the world, speaking out for racial and economic \njustice, women's and children's rights, religious freedom, full \nemployment, health care, and education. She championed the national \nholiday in honor of Dr. King's legacy. And, as she carried on Dr. \nKing's message, she became an icon of the civil rights movement in her \nown right.\n  In September 2004, the Senate passed legislation to honor Mrs. King \nand Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., posthumously, with Congress's highest \nhonor--the Congressional Gold Medal--for their contributions to the \nNation. It was my great honor to deliver this news to Mrs. King the \nnext day at an awards ceremony sponsored by the Senate Black \nLegislative Staff Caucus, where Mrs. King was honored with their \nLeadership and Achievement Award. Over the next few months, my staff \nworked with Mrs. King, along with the U.S. Mint and Congressman John \nLewis's staff, in designing the gold medal. In March 2005, Mrs. King \ncontributed these words, from some of her favorite lines from Dr. \nKing's speeches, to appear on one side of the medal: ``I suggest that \nthe philosophy and strategy of nonviolence become immediately a subject \nfor study for serious experimentation in every field of human conflict, \nby no means excluding the relations between nations. This may well be \nmankind's last chance to choose between chaos and community.'' Mrs. \nKing offered these lines less than a year ago, reflecting her steadfast \ncommitment to nonviolence throughout her entire life.\n  Coretta Scott King moved our Nation forward, and we owe her a debt \nthat we cannot repay. As we mourn Mrs. King's passing today, let us \ncelebrate her exceptional life, and let us honor her by recommitting \nourselves to the dream the Kings shared of freedom, justice, and \nequality for all people.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter, and \nBernice King and all of the King family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S441-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S441-S442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SPACE SHUTTLE ``CHALLENGER''/``COLUMBIA''\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

LEILA DAUGHTRY DENMARK ON HER 109TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, Dr. Leila Daughtry Denmark is \ntruly a remarkable person; she is someone to be greatly admired. Her \naccomplishments as a doctor and a humanitarian are exceptional. It is \nwith great pleasure that Julianne and I extend our warmest \ncongratulations to her on her 109th birthday.\n  Today, Dr. Denmark's loved ones gather around her to celebrate her \nbirthday and recognize a lifetime of achievement. Her tireless, \nselfless, compassion for others is an example to all of us.\n  Edna Jones, a friend of Dr. Denmark, said it best when she described \nher as truly a ``one of a kind lady.'' Edna's remarks are right on \ntarget, she is a true pioneer. After being the third woman to graduate \nfrom Georgia Medical College, she became Egleston Hospital's first \nintern, as well as Georgia's first pediatrician. She quickly gained \nexpertise and respect, joining with her colleagues to develop the \nD.P.T. shot which immunizes against whooping cough and tetanus. This \nbreakthrough has saved countless lives all over the world.\n  Dr. Denmark's kindness and compassion as a human being along with her \nbrilliance and talent as a doctor have earned her considerable praise \nand recognition. She has been commended by both Georgia's Senate and \nHouse legislative bodies--Dr. Denmark has even had a highway \nintersection named in her honor. In 1998, she was named as one of \nAtlanta Business Chronicle's Health Care Heroes.\n  She also published her book, ``Every Child Should Have a Chance'' in \n1971. Her message to parents was how to raise happy healthy children \nwho are well adjusted and well mannered, children who are of virtue and \nof strong character. Her book and her wisdom have had an impact on \nnumerous parents and children alike and continue to serve as a guide to \nmany.\n  For 56 years, Dr. Denmark volunteered once a week at Atlanta's \nCentral Presbyterian Clinic, and chances are, if you were a patient of \nDr. Denmark, she wouldn't charge you more than $10 a visit. In \neverything she does, Dr. Denmark exemplifies a true humanitarian and \nremains committed to her healing profession. We could all stand to \nlearn from a person like her.\n  Dr. Denmark has a sincere, no-nonsense devotion to others. She has \nbeen an example and an inspiration to generations. I am impressed by \nher lifetime commitment and service to others. And I know that \nGeorgians are proud to count Dr. Denmark as one of our own.\n  Mr. President, again, my wife, Julianne, and I are delighted to wish \nher a happy 109th birthday and continued happiness and health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S442-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Pierz \nPublic Schools, in Pierz, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  The Pierz Public School District is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. Mr. George Weber, the superintendent of the Pierz School \nDistrict, describes ``the overall feeling of pride the citizens have in \nour schools and in our work ethic, which has resulted in a broad sense \nof excellence.'' The District's accomplishments are even more \nimpressive, given that they have occurred during an era of revenue \nreductions at the State and Federal levels, in a relatively poor \ncommunity where more than 40 percent of the children qualify for free \nand reduced lunches, and in a part of the State experiencing falling \nenrollment and economic decline.\n  Despite repeated State revenue shortfalls, the Pierz Public School \nDistrict has managed to preserve a balanced budget. The district \noperates on a very lean administrative staff, whose superintendent and \nbusiness manager perform all central administrative functions, \nincluding curriculum, human resources, plant management, student \nservices, transportation, and food service. This restraint has allowed \nthe district to devote the vast majority of its resources to the \nclassroom.\n  The district's commitment to its classrooms has allowed the schools \nto keep class sizes small--ranging from 19 to 27--with half of the \nclassrooms kept to fewer than 23 students. By contrast, in Minnesota, \nthe number of students per classroom averages between 27 to 30. The \ndistrict also provides all-day kindergarten for all, which is not \nsupported by the State's school revenue formula.\n  The Pierz School District has also demonstrated its commitment to \nproviding exceptional facilities for its students. The district has \nadded a new computer lab in each of the past 3 years; remodeled an old \ngymnasium into a new performing arts center; and built a new gymnasium, \nan eight-lane running track with state-of-the-art electronic timing \nequipment, two irrigated baseball fields, and a newly remodeled \nfootball stadium.\n  Much of the credit for the Pierz Public School District's success \nbelongs to Superintendent George Weber, elementary school principal \nLealen Swoboda, high school principal Paul DeMorett, and their \ndedicated teachers.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Riverside \nElementary School, in Brainerd, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Riverside Elementary School is truly a model of educational success. \nOn my recent visit to Riverside, 10 fourth-graders shared with me their \nessays on what makes Riverside a special place to learn. Toni Gohman, \nAmanda Kunde, Allison Morris, Tom Stoxen, Kallie Konklin, Gretchen \nGramer, Paige Phillips, Kaela Middleton, Anna Razidlo, and Emma \nHiggenbothem are to be commended for their exceptional writing ability \nand for superbly reading their essays at an all-school assembly.\n  I would like to quote briefly from several of the essays to offer a \ntrue flavor of the exceptional educational achievements at Riverside \nElementary.\n  Amanda Kunde writes, ``I feel safe and happy here at Riverside. . . . \nMrs. Engler, the teachers and the teachers' assistants are awesome. \nIt's nice to know that people care about me.''\n  Allison Morris writes, ``Our teachers make learning fun, interesting \n& exciting. They . . . not only teach the standard subjects like \nreading and math, they help teach us to be responsible for our actions, \nand to respect one another.''\n  Gretchen Gramer writes, ``Every student has a different personality. \nWe help each other when we are stuck and when we are hurt. . . . We get \nrewarded when we are good by a new program called `Caught Being Good.' \n. . . We have other great helpers at our school. The custodians, the \nnurse, the office staff and the cooks all do a great job.''\n  Toni Gohman writes, ``Riverside is an awesome school. It has an \nawesome principal, great teachers, and respectful and kind students.''\n  Tom Stoxen writes, ``All of the people at our school are really \nfriendly and helpful to all of the kids. . . . The cooks are really \nnice and cook good food. We even get seconds sometimes, but not on the \ndessert.''\n  Paige Phillips writes, ``Every day when I come to school I feel safe, \nand to me that is very important. . . . When I get hurt I always know \nsomeone's ready to take care of me.''\n  Kaela Middleton writes, ``I am going to tell you what we do in our \neveryday school day so you know that it is not always fun and games, \nbut that it can also be very hard work.''\n  Anna Razidlo writes, ``Riverside deserves this award because we have \nso\n\n[[Page S443]]\n\nmany kind, fun and exciting teachers! . . . Almost every student gets a \ngreat score . . . on their tests because we learn so much . . . we \ndon't even notice how hard we are working to learn. . . . I feel lucky \nto go to a great school.''\n  Emma Higgenbothem writes, ``Riverside makes you want to come to \nschool everyday because we have nice people, kind teachers, and we \nlearn a lot of things. . . . We also have kind custodians who work hard \nto clean our school. I like coming to a clean school everyday.''\n  And, finally, Kallie Konklin captures the overall success of \nRiverside by writing, ``If you are wondering why Riverside is a school \nof excellence, I think you came to the right person to ask. . . . Our \nteachers are very kind, caring and patient with our needs and different \npersonalities. . . . Last, but not least, we have Mrs. Engler, our \nprincipal. She is the one who keeps everything running smoothly, and \ndeals with all of the politics associated with running a large grade \nschool.''\n  As Kallie and several other pupils noted, much of the credit for \nRiverside Elementary School's success belongs to its principal, Cathy \nEngler, and her dedicated teachers. The students and staff at Riverside \nElementary understand that, in order to be successful, a school must go \nbeyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a nurturing \nenvironment where students develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes \nfor success in life. All of the faculty, staff, and students at \nRiverside Elementary should be very proud of their accomplishment.\n  I congratulate Riverside Elementary in Brainerd, MN, for winning the \nAward for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional contributions \nto education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S443-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING CAROLE PAGONES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly recognize \nand honor Carole Pagones on the occasion of her retirement from Main \nStreet Sioux Falls, Inc. Under her extraordinary leadership, Main \nStreet Sioux Falls helped to engineer a dramatic revitalization of the \ncore commercial district in South Dakota's largest city.\n  When Carole took the helm at Main Street Sioux Falls, first-floor \nvacancies in downtown buildings were at a discouraging 69 percent, and \nthe downtown area was usually deserted after 5 o'clock. Like so many \ntowns and cities, Sioux Falls struggled to maintain the vitality of the \narea that was once its heart and soul.\n  While some merely lamented this situation, Carole energetically set \nabout changing it. During a 12-year stint as the executive director of \nMain Street Sioux Falls, and later as the organization's development \ndirector, she initiated new events to draw people to the area. She \nworked to enhance the area's appearance to make it more inviting. The \nhistoric preservation of building facades and outdoor dining \nopportunities are particularly valuable enhancements for the downtown \narea. And she wielded her personal charm to persuade individual \nbusinesses to return to the area.\n  Today, any visitor to downtown Sioux Falls can immediately sense the \nwonderful results of Carole's efforts. Numerous shops, restaurants, and \nother businesses now operate in an area that is once again one of the \ncity's most desirable locations. Statistics tell the same story--under \nCarole's tenure, the vacancy rate that once stood at nearly three \nquarters of all first-floor downtown properties has been whittled down \nto a mere 7 percent.\n  Besides restoring the vibrancy of the core downtown area, Carole has \nalso helped Sioux Falls prepare for transformational developments that \nwill expand and improve what we have traditionally considered to be \n``downtown''. For example, the Philips-to-the-Falls project will link \ndowntown with the natural amenities of nearby Falls Park. And \ndevelopment is now gaining steam on the ``East Bank'' of the Big Sioux \nRiver, opposite the vibrant area on the west side of the river.\n  Though Carol's presence at Main Street Sioux Falls will be sorely \nmissed following her retirement, she leaves the organization well \nprepared to build upon her remarkable record of success. Fortunately, \nSioux Falls and the entire State will continue to benefit from Carole's \nleadership through her membership on the State's Board of Regents and \nher ongoing participation in many Main Street Sioux Falls events.\n  On behalf of all South Dakotans, I congratulate Carole Pagones for \nher outstanding leadership, and I wish her continued successes on all \nher new challenges and opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S443-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JESSIE TEHRANCHI\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, Jessie Tehranchi was a passionate \nadvocate for improved public transportation and universal health care \nfrom my State of Alabama. Jessie dedicated her time to helping others \nas she worked to advocate on behalf of the issues that shaped her life.\n  Jessie's passion was personal; diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in \n1987, she spent much of her adult life confined to a wheelchair. Faced \nwith seemingly insurmountable odds, Jessie used her experience to \nbetter the lives of many others with similar handicaps. A fixture in \ntransportation activist groups, she spoke across the country on behalf \nof her causes.\n  Jessie testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs in 2002 at a Housing and Transportation \nSubcommittee meeting. Jessie emphasized the need for effective public \ntransportation and cited her own experiences as a person unable to \ndrive. Her testimony was powerful and useful as the Senate worked on \nthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century.\n  Jessie was optimistic, energetic, and passionate. I am proud of her \nefforts, and I am grateful for her dedication to this important cause. \nI know that she will be missed not only by her husband, Jim Tehranchi, \nand two sons, David and Michael, and her many friends, but by the many \npeople whose lives she touched through her devotion to public \ntransportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S443-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MARTHA TSCHETTER\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Martha \nTschetter for her tireless work bringing warmth and kindness to total \nstrangers. Mrs. Tschetter, at the age of 85, has worked tirelessly \nsince 1988 hooking quilts for a Mennonite charity. In November, Martha \ndonated her 3,000th quilt to charity. Martha's contribution to her \ncommunity does not stop there.\n  Martha's service to her community did not start eighteen years ago \nbut began many decades ago. Mrs. Tschetter served as a teacher in the \nFreeman area for the better part of five decades. Martha spent thirty \nsix years as a full time teacher in the Freeman area only to serve \nanother twelve years as a substitute teacher at Freeman Elementary.\n  Martha is a shining reminder to us all that life does not end at 65. \nShe has never stopped giving of herself to help those in need. Today, I \nam glad to rise with Martha's friends and family in congratulating her \non her continual service to her community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S443-4", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S443-5", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S443-6", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S443-S444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 6:12 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agree \nto the amendment of the Senate to the amendment of the House to the \nbill (S. 1932) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 202(a) \nof the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. \nCon.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Labor to prescribe \nadditional coal mine safety standards, to require additional penalties \nfor habitual violators, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my honor today to join with my \ncolleague Senator Byrd, who I am sure will be here very shortly. We are \nvery proud to announce that we are, as an entire West Virginia \ndelegation, introducing the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 2006.\n  The last few weeks have been an emotional roller coaster in West \nVirginia and across large parts of the country as we watched the damage \nand the pain and the crying and the anger because of a series of coal \nmine accidents that happened in West Virginia where 14 miners lost \ntheir lives and in the State of Kentucky where a miner lost his life. \nThere is no real way of describing the sadness and the grief of being \nwith families as they find out their coal-miner spouses are no longer \nalive.\n  Everybody understands that coal mining is very dangerous, but you go \nin every day with the hope that it will be all right. It is a way of \nlife. People ask, Why do you go into coal mining? They go into coal \nmining to keep the lights of America on and they do it to earn a good \nwage.\n  What we have to do is make sure the legacy of these 15 miners who \ndied--1\n\n[[Page S448]]\n\nin Kentucky and 14 in West Virginia, 15 miners in all--is that we make \nsure this kind of tragedy never happens again.\n  It is amazing to be in a coal-mining community when tragedy hits. \nPeople pull together amazingly, in Kentucky very much like West \nVirginia in that respect, and there is a sense of family. One person's \nloss is every person's loss.\n  Obviously, we have the losses that come in Iraq and in wartime in \ngeneral. But there is something about coal mining. When there is a \ndeath in coal mining, it is devastating to a community and it takes a \nlong time to heal.\n  I would come to churches--the Freewill Baptist Church in Logan \nCounty, the Sago Baptist Church in Upshur County, one south and the \nother up north--and you learn spiritually and personally forever with \npeople who are bound together forever because they have gone through \nsomething which is truly difficult.\n  I note that in the case of Kentucky, we even have evidence of a miner \nwho was killed two years ago who was actually videotaping with his \nvideo camera things which he thought were not proper in that particular \nmine, as he was killed. He was still videotaping as he was killed.\n  Legislation is needed.\n  I note the presence on the floor of my distinguished senior \ncolleague, Senator Byrd.\n  What we plan to do in the Senate and in the House--we in the Senate \nand our three Members in the House--is, in fact, to take the first step \ntoward improving mine safety and doing it through legislation.\n  It is a sad thing to say, for the country and for all of us, where we \nhave gone through a period of years where we haven't had large numbers \nof people killed in the mines, that we have been lulled into thinking \nthat mining is not dangerous. That has been compounded by the fact that \nthe obsession with oil which the President spoke about last night has \nbeen very real. What is going on overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nother places of danger across the world has generally tended to pull us \naway, I think maybe for 20 years, from a review of what coal mine \nsafety legislation, rules, and regulation through MSHA, the Mine Safety \nand Health Agency, ought to be. Things haven't changed a lot. The \nsafety technology in the mines has not changed a lot. There is a bit of \na lax attitude, and a little bit of indifference. This is the world we \nlive in--the world of mining--and it is as it is, and it ever shall be. \nThat kind of thinking we have to stop.\n  As a delegation, led by Senator Byrd, we are determined to do that. \nWe are determined that the legacy of these 14 miners in West Virginia \nand the one in Kentucky will be that this kind of accident never takes \nplace again. We do not want that to happen.\n  The irony is that coal, which has always been taken for granted by \nthe American people, to my distress, is a full 31 percent--and it has \nbeen for years--of all of our energy use in America. People are always \nthinking about importing oil, and we do. That is a tremendous addition \nto our trade deficit, and it causes all kinds of other problems when we \nare dealing with very unstable countries--increasingly unstable \ncountries. But all the while coal has been sitting there. We have a \n250-year supply of coal in the United States of America. That can be \nsubstituted for much of that oil.\n  The coal industry is growing. The price of coal is going up. People \nare going to be opening new coal mines. I wouldn't say it is a hot \nindustry in financial terms, but it is very close to it, which means \nthere are going to be more mines opened. Therefore, more people will be \ngetting into mining--some will be small, some will be larger. We have \nto make sure they will be mining safely and responsibly. That takes \nvigilance on our part, on the part of the Secretary of Labor, and on \nMSHA's part. That is why Senator Byrd, my senior Senator, will no doubt \nsubmit the bill.\n  But we want to call immediate attention to the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration and the Secretary of Labor because they have in their \npower right now the ability to cause to happen a number of the \nsuggestions which we are making. They can simply do it. They have the \nrulemaking power to do that, but they have not done that.\n  What we are doing is looking at a few ways that the Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration and also the Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao, can \nact aggressively to improve mine safety, as they can do without a \nsingle change in any law at all. In many cases, Congress has given them \nthis authority. It is just a matter of the Secretary of Labor moving \non these issues. It ought to ring loud and clear, and there ought to be \nresults from that.\n\n  In our bill, we also instruct the Secretary to promulgate rules \nquickly to require a series of things: advanced communication and \nbreathing apparatus, technologies that can be deployed in our mines.\n  This is something which has baffled Senator Byrd, myself, and our \ndelegation for a long time. We have a lot of rules and regulations; \nregarding breathing apparatuses, for example; oxygen supplies, for \nexample--which have not changed since 1977, or before. We have just \ngone through a period of years when we have not put the focus on coal \nmine safety. Now that is at an end. We have to have advanced \ncommunications and breathing apparatus technologies.\n  It has been said often--it will be said once again--that we could \ntalk with Neil Armstrong on the Moon when he was there many years ago, \nbut we can't talk with a coal miner in a two-way communications system \nwho may be 1,000 or 2,000 feet underground. To say the technology for \nthat doesn't exist is to say that America isn't America.\n  I have had in my office, as I am sure others have, numerous people in \nthe last several days pouring out ideas they are working on or have \ndeveloped. The families of the victims gave us many ideas of what could \nbe done. We are a country of new technologies. We have simply declined \nto apply it to coal mine safety, and the coal mines have been a bit lax \nto take the initiative on that. This is something we are all going to \nhave to do together. We have to demand that rescue teams be staffed and \non site in every single mine.\n  There was a major problem, particularly at the Sago mine up north. \nBut rescue teams have to be a part of an operation. If you are going to \nstart a business, a rescue team within your workforce has to be a part \nof what you do--not simply wait for a rescue team 2 hours away to \ncollect itself and then come. That is usually too late. It is amazing \nto me that that situation exists.\n  We have to also develop a schedule of fines for mining violations. \nThey have to mean something. The average mine violation at Sago--there \nseem to be several hundred of them--all seems to be $60 or $270. That \ndoesn't change behavior. That encourages a company to say, Look, we \nwill pay because there is no real penalty on us.\n  Fines can be charged up to $60,000, and we are going to increase \nthat. Mines can be shut down by Federal mine inspectors if they choose \nto do that. But for the most part they have not chosen to do that. The \nlesson has to sink in to be responsible as a coal mine or else you \ncan't do it.\n  Another matter in our legislation is that we have to notify the MSHA \nimmediately when there is an accident. That was not done in a couple of \nour cases. In one case, it took a very long period of time to notify \nthe agency. That seems a small thing, but that is a huge thing, \nparticularly because small mines today don't necessarily have their own \nrescue teams.\n  There have to be extra alerts that go out across the Federal and the \nState bureaucracy and within the mining community so that rescue teams \ncan get to the spot as soon as possible.\n  So we want the Federal mine safety agency to make the health of \nminers its first and foremost priority.\n  As of the day that first problem happened at Sago with the death of \nso many miners, it has become my first priority and will stay that way \nuntil we get what we need in coal mine safety, working with the \ncompanies, with the Federal Government and, where necessary, to use \nlegislation.\n  The enforcement of mine safety laws requires a set of penalties that \nreflects the seriousness. We cannot have a situation such as we had at \nSago Mine--$60 or $270 fines with over 200 violations. They have to \nreflect the seriousness, and be proportional. They have to be larger \nand have impact. Companies cannot just say, I will go ahead and pay \nthat, but I don't have to make any\n\n[[Page S449]]\n\nchange because I can afford to pay that; then I don't have to have \npeople coming in and looking at what is going on in my mine as much.\n  MSHA has minimal penalties and that is the fault of all of us; but \nprimarily MSHA should do its job. As part of MSHA's invigorated \ncommitment to the safety of miners, we are going to seek to have in our \nlegislation the agency enforce a longstanding rule which was canceled \nin 2004. It is a very serious rule and one that I will briefly explain. \nMine operators have been using fresh air escapeways to house coal \nconveyer belts. What does that mean? The first thing we need to \nunderstand, mines are required to have fresh air escapeways. These are \nsupposed to be free from potentially combustible material, combustible \ngases, and the possibility of fire. Where there is a beltway--which \ncosts $100 million plus in some cases; it is a very large operation--a \nsingle friction could ignite a fire. That fire, then, can take off into \nthe coal seams and cause terrible damage and destruction of human life.\n  Belt fires such as the one resulting in the deaths of the two brave \nWest Virginians at the Alma mine in southern West Virginia are some of \nthe most dangerous occurrences in coal mining in any form. The very \nleast we can do to protect miners is keep the entrances to the mines--\nwhere these miners risk their lives every day to provide the rest of \nthe country with the energy--free of such avoidable hazard. That was \nthe rule. That was the law for many years.\n  For reasons we can only guess, MSHA altered the enforcement practices \nto allow for entry coal belts in 2004. That is wrong. That is the lack \nof vigilance on the part of all who watch over mining.\n  Finally, our legislation calls for the creation of a position of \nminer ombudsman. People say, So what? There is a big ``so what.'' It is \na fact that miners in some mines are afraid to report safety \ndeficiencies. They are afraid to report certain matters because they \nthink if they do they will get in trouble or get fired or their sister \nor brother will get fired from a coal mine. I am not making an \naccusation, but I heard a great deal of talk about that condition when \nI was in West Virginia for many days, along with my senior Senator, \nSenator Byrd. I heard that a great deal.\n  The miners have to have a voice in an overall Federal agency. That \nvoice in the overall Federal agency--MSHA--has to be out of the \npolitical process, almost detached, in a sense, from MSHA itself. That \nis important because we have to provide people a place to report mine \nsafety problems. They have to be able to do it anonymously and they \nhave to be able to do it feeling safe about so doing.\n  My West Virginia colleague and I do not pretend to be doing a \ncomplete fix of mine safety legislation. We do believe our act is a \nfirst strong step on a path that Congress should have started down some \ntime ago. It is immensely sad it took the deaths of 14 West Virginians \nand 1 Kentuckian to galvanize the emotion, anger, and determination one \nhas to have when it comes to making sure the coal mines are safe.\n  Coal mines are a world within themselves. The taste of a coal mine, \nthe smell of a coal mine, the brotherhood of a coal mine, the danger of \na coal mine, these are things which are part of people's lives. Most \npeople in West Virginia, most people across the United States of \nAmerica, have never been down a coal mine because it is restricted and \npeople cannot wander in to look around. Those who have oversight \nresponsibility have to make sure they do their job.\n  I, for one, believe those who do represent the mining State need to \ntake this responsibility, as do the companies, as do the operators at \nthe ground level, and also the miners themselves. I have had a slew of \nideas in the last several days. I am optimistic we can find \ntechnology--it may come out of DARPA or DOD. Remember in the first gulf \nwar, the Marines, Air Force, Navy, and Army could not communicate with \neach other when they went into Kuwait. Their radio bands were all \ndifferent. Everyone knows that story. That was bad. They fixed it. That \nis what we have in our coal mines. That has to be fixed.\n  Mine safety moved to the top of my legislative priority list the very \nday I heard of these tragedies. I commend this important legislation to \nmy colleagues. I invite them to join Senator Byrd and myself in \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have under the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 25\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nminority side. There is no more specific order.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time was there at the beginning?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The allotted time was 45 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. And 25 minutes remain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it has been almost 1 month since the \nexplosion that killed 12 miners at the Sago mine in Upshur County, WV, \nand almost 2 weeks since the conveyor belt fire that killed two miners \nat the Aracoma Alma mine in Logan County, WV. In that same time, the \nMine Safety and Health Administration, MSHA, of the U.S. Department of \nLabor has briefed my office on several occasions. The Senate Labor-HHS \nAppropriations Subcommittee, at my request and under the leadership of \nChairman Arlen Specter and ranking member Tom Harkin, has held a \nhearing and solicited testimony from mine safety experts. The West \nVirginia delegation in the House and the Senate has met with the \nGovernor of West Virginia, Governor Joe Manchin, has met with the White \nHouse Chief of Staff, and has met with the acting MSHA Director to \nreview mine safety legislation passed by the West Virginia legislature \nin the wake of the Sago and Alma tragedies.\n  We now can speak with some certainty about what contributed to the \ntragedies at the Sago and Alma mines that killed 14 coal miners. We \nknow these tragedies have highlighted gross weaknesses in mine \nemergency preparedness and the failure of leadership at the Federal \nMine Safety and Health Administration to get tough about rescue \nprocedures.\n  We know that communications technology in our Nation's coal mines is \ninadequate. The Federal mine regulators require only that a telephone \nline connect the working sections of mines to the surface. If that \ntelephone line does not work, in the event of an emergency, the miners \ntrapped underground are cut off from the rescue effort. Those on the \nsurface cannot get a message to the miners underground and the miners \nunderground cannot get a message to those on the surface.\n  At the Sago and Alma mines, families waited, waited, waited in \nanguish for 40 hours, not knowing if their loved ones were alive or \ndead because the communications equipment in the mine did not work.\n  We know that Federal mine safety officials cannot immediately locate \nminers trapped underground. At both the Sago and Alma mines, families \nwaited, and waited, and waited while rescue teams searched meticulously \nthrough the underground caverns. Those teams could only make educated \nguesses about the location of the trapped miners, putting the rescue \nteams' lives and the lives of the trapped miners at increased risk \nwhile the search went on.\n  We know that the MSHA notification and response system is ponderously \nslow. Federal mine safety officials did not know of the Sago explosion \nuntil 2 hours after it happened. It took another 9 hours--9 long, \nexcruciating hours--before rescue teams could enter the mine.\n  The same thing happened at the Alma mine. Federal mine safety \nofficials did not know of the underground fire for 2\\1/2\\ hours, and in \nthat time the fire spread and got worse. We know Federal mine \nregulators require only that miners have a 1-hour emergency breathing \ndevice; and at the Sago mine, 1 hour of oxygen was not nearly adequate \nto sustain those miners through a 40-hour rescue operation. We also \nknow that the Mine Safety and Health Administration, tragically--\ntragically--abandoned its assessment of the rules governing these 1-\nhour emergency breathing devices in December of 2001. What a travesty.\n\n  We know that the mine rescue teams, at both the Sago and Alma mines, \nwere forced to wait for a frustrating amount of time because the coal \noperators had to negotiate the question of liability before the rescue \nteams could enter the\n\n[[Page S450]]\n\nmines. We know that Federal mine regulators have been aware of this \nliability problem since 1995. We know that MSHA has not taken steps to \naddress it, or to update and improve the rules related to the number of \nrescue teams per mine and their ability to respond rapidly. The only \nrecent effort to update these rules was halted by MSHA--now get that--\nthe only recent effort to update these rules was halted by MSHA in \n2002.\n  The Sago mine was a habitual violator with 276 citations and orders \nissued in 2004 and 2005. The coal operator never paid a fine more than \n$440, even though mandatory health and safety standards were \nrepeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly violated. Meanwhile, MSHA assessed \nfines as low as $99 for violations that were classified as \n``significant and substantial.'' Let me say that again. Meanwhile, MSHA \nassessed fines as low as $99 for violations that were classified as \n``significant and substantial'' in threatening the safety and health of \nthe miners at Sago.\n  MSHA has broad authority to protect coal miners, and the 1977 Mine \nAct is the strongest and most sweeping workplace safety law ever \nenacted in the United States, and, yet, even with these tools--even \nwith these tools--the Mine Safety and Health Administration failed--\nyes, it failed--to protect the 14 miners who perished at the Sago and \nAlma mines. What a shame. What a shame.\n  MSHA has the authority to require that secondary communications \nequipment be available in the event of an emergency. That authority was \nnot used. MSHA has the authority to require that emergency breathing \ndevices be placed in the mines in the event of an extended recovery \neffort. That authority was not used. That authority was not used. MSHA \nhas the authority to penalize habitual violators, and to close those \nmines where pattern violations threaten a coal miner's life. That \nauthority was not used. That authority was not used. What a travesty.\n  MSHA is the Federal agency charged with protecting coal miners. I \nwill say that again. MSHA is the Federal agency charged with protecting \ncoal miners, but it has scuttled--get that; it has scuttled--18 \ninitiatives in the last 5 years to update and improve mine safety and \nemergency preparedness. MSHA's leadership has embraced the status quo \nas good enough, and that attitude puts miners' lives at risk.\n  In the past, mine disasters such as these have spurred tougher mine \nsafety laws. The Farmington, WV, disaster spurred the 1969 Coal Act, \nand subsequent disasters spurred the 1977 Mine Act. Now, I was here at \nthe time in both instances. I was in the Senate. This time, the legacy \nof the Sago and Alma mine disasters must be a tougher agency that \nwill--will--enforce the law.\n  Together with Senator Jay Rockefeller and the West Virginia \ndelegation in the House, I am introducing legislation today that is a \nmandate for action. Our legislation does not amend the Mine Act. Our \ndelegation takes the position that the Mine Act already provides the \nSecretary of Labor with every authority necessary to prevent these \nkinds of tragedies. Instead, the legislation that I am introducing on \nbehalf of myself and Mr. Rockefeller--and which is being likewise \nintroduced in the House of Representatives today--our legislation \ndirects the Labor Secretary to employ the authorities of the Mine Act. \nIt directs the Labor Secretary, within 90 days, to promulgate a series \nof health and safety rules aimed at improving mine safety enforcement \nand emergency preparedness.\n  This legislation directs the Labor Secretary to establish a rapid \nnotification and response system. This legislation requires coal \noperators to expeditiously notify MSHA of emergencies. Any coal \noperator who fails to expeditiously notify Federal mine safety \nofficials will be subject to a $100,000 fine.\n  We must reduce the amount of time that is lost between a mine \nemergency and MSHA's notification and arrival on the scene.\n  Our legislation directs the Labor Secretary to reassess regulations \nthat govern mine rescue teams to ensure that their numbers are \nsufficient and that obstacles to their deployment are minimized. Mine \nrescue teams ought to be able to respond just as local fire departments \nwould respond to an emergency. It must not take 11 hours.\n  Our legislation requires coal operators to store additional emergency \nbreathing supplies underground to sustain miners who may be trapped for \nan extended period. Our legislation requires the Labor Secretary to \nupdate and improve the rules governing emergency communications \nequipment that would allow miners underground to communicate with \nsurface rescue efforts, and allow surface rescue efforts to locate \nminers underground. Never again--never again--should a coal miner or \nany other miner lack access to a reasonable supply of oxygen \nunderground or be unable to receive directions from the surface about \nescape routes--never again.\n\n  On the enforcement side, our legislation requires the Labor Secretary \nto create a new $10,000 mandatory and minimum penalty for coal \noperators who display negligence or reckless disregard for safety \nstandards. By negligence or reckless disregard, I am talking about coal \noperators who knew or should have known of a dangerous condition or \npractice and failed to take the steps necessary to fix the problem, or \nwho displayed conduct which exhibits a deplorable absence of care for \nthe safety and health of the miners. If penalties are required in this \nkind of situation, then this statutory floor will help to ensure that \nthose penalties will hurt--let me say that again--if penalties are \nrequired in this kind of situation, then this statutory floor will help \nto ensure that those penalties will hurt, and hurt sufficiently to \nencourage violators to comply with the law.\n  Our legislation prohibits the use of belt entries for ventilation in \ncontravention of an MSHA regulation issued in 2004, which likely--hear \nme now--which likely played a part in the Alma fire.\n  Our legislation creates a science and technology office in the Labor \nDepartment to help expedite the introduction of the most advanced \nhealth and safety technologies into the mines, and to ensure that \nFederal mine safety officials are actively pulling from other Federal \nagencies those technologies that can help to protect miners. No \nlonger--hear me; hear me now: no longer--should miners be sent \nunderground with safety equipment that is decades out of date.\n  Our legislation creates the new position of ombudsman in the Labor \nDepartment's Inspector General's office to allow miners to more easily \nreport safety violations. To be effective, such a position requires the \nappointment and the confirmation of someone with at least 5 years--no \npolitical hack--someone with at least 5 years of expertise in mine \nsafety and health. No place for a political hack. A miner should never \nhave to feel that he has no options other than to continue to work in a \ndangerous environment.\n  Now, I speak from the heart. I grew up in a coal miner's home. My dad \nwas a coal miner--a coal miner. I married a coal miner's daughter. \nLoretta Lynn sings a song. She is a coal miner's daughter. Well, my \nwife is a coal miner's daughter. My brother-in-law died of silicosis, \nblack lung. His father was killed by a slate fall in a coal mine. So I \nspeak from the viewpoint of a coal miner, a coal miner's son.\n  For 5 years, the leadership in the Labor Department and the Mine \nSafety and Health Administration has worked against--get that--worked \nagainst the health and safety needs of coal miners. If we must hold the \nhand of the Labor Department--if we have to hold the hand of the Labor \nDepartment--and lead it like a stubborn and obstinate child, to force \nit to promulgate rules to implement the Mine Act and save lives, then \nthat is exactly what we should do. If this administration and if MSHA \nwill not lead, then this Congress must lead, and, if necessary, poke, \nprod, kick, and push MSHA into fulfilling its mandate.\n  At this late date, we need more than platitudes--more than \nplatitudes--to protect the safety of our Nation's miners. We are not \njust talking about West Virginia miners, not just talking about coal \nminers in West Virginia. We need resources. We need swift action. And \nwe need to impress deeply upon the psyche of MSHA--they better hear \nthat--impress deeply upon the psyche of MSHA and the Nation's coal mine \noperators that the safety of miners will not be compromised for \npersonal profit or for politics.\n\n[[Page S451]]\n\n  Protecting the safety of our miners is a moral responsibility. Hear \nme. Protecting the safety of our miners is a moral responsibility, and \nthis legislation will help to make sure that we never, ever forget \nthat.\n  I send the bill to the desk, a bill by Mr. Byrd for himself and Mr. \nRockefeller. I ask that it be relayed to the appropriate committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator from West Virginia yielded the floor?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield the floor, and I thank the distinguished \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I had the opportunity to listen to the remarks of Senators \nByrd and Rockefeller. I wanted to add my remarks about mine safety.\n  As I have told the Senator from West Virginia, my father was a miner. \nWhen I was less than a week old, my father was working in a mine at \nChloride, AZ. It was a gold mine. It was a vertical. There were two men \nin the hole. That was standard operating procedure at the time. There \nwas only one person present to light the holes for obvious reasons. So \nmy dad's working companion, a man named Carl Myers, had gone up to the \nnext level so he would be away from the dynamite. In those days, they \ndidn't have product liability protection, and so my dad had lit 12 \nholes. One of them went off early. The fuse ran and blew my dad in the \nair, blew the soles off his shoes, blew his carbide light out. In those \ndays, you would take a sinking ladder down in the hole with you, and \nwhen you would go out, when the holes were burning, you would take it \nup with you. My dad was in a state of shock and didn't know that it had \nblown one of the legs off the ladder. So every time he would try to put \nthe ladder down to climb out, he would fall. And he kept falling.\n  The man in the next level who heard the 1 hole go off knew there were \n11 others that were supposed to go off and knew my dad hadn't come out. \nThis man, Carl Myers, climbed down the hole and, even though he was a \nsmaller man than my father, helped my dad out of the hole, drug him up \nto the next level. The other holes went off. My dad went to the \nhospital and spent some time there. But as a result of the heroic feat \nof Carl Myers, who received a medal for heroism for doing what he did, \nmy father was able to raise his four boys.\n  The reason I mention that to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia is mine safety means saving people's lives. Growing up in \nNevada, my dad worked many times down in the mines alone. That was \nagainst the law, but he did it all the time. It was against the law, \nbut there were no mine inspectors. He was down there alone all the \ntime.\n  I have watched with interest the rash of mining accidents in West \nVirginia and Kentucky in the last few weeks. I want the Senators from \nWest Virginia to know that I will do anything I can legislatively to \nmake sure these mines are safe. I speak from experience. Mining is a \nterribly difficult job. That is why there are so many songs written \nabout the dangers of mining.\n  As I indicated, when I was growing up, my dad didn't have much \nprotection from the State. They abandoned Searchlight. There wasn't a \nlot going on, so they didn't watch it very much. A rock fell on the \nhead of my dad's best friend. They carried him out of the mine. It \nkilled him. He wasn't as fortunate as my dad because his widow raised \nthe three Hudgens children alone. There are lots of accidents. These \nthings happen.\n  Without proper protection, there is no occupation more dangerous than \nbeing down in a hole.\n  I applaud the Senator from West Virginia for protecting his State as \nhe always does. But understand also that in faraway Nevada, 2,500 miles \naway, you have a Senator who will do anything possible to make sure \nthat in the State of West Virginia and in all places where mining takes \nplace, there are Federal regulations in place to protect people like my \ndad.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me thank my friend, the leader, our leader on this side \nof the aisle, who is a gold miner's son. There are not many of us in \nhere who are gold miners' sons. I am proud that my leader is a gold \nminer's son. I am proud that he assured us, from his standpoint and \nwithin his power, that he will do everything possible--and I hope he \nwill--to help bring this legislation to the floor. He understands that \nit is needed, and I will welcome his assistance in that regard. I am \nproud of him as a gold miner's son. I am glad he reminds us of this \nfrom time to time. I believe this legislation is badly needed. I \nimplore my leader to do everything he can to see that this bill gets on \nthe calendar and gets taken up by the Senate and acted upon promptly.\n  I thank all Senators and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nFederal Mine Safety and Health Act of 2006, introduced today by \nSenators Byrd and Rockefeller.\n  The recent tragedies at Sago Mine and Alma Mine in West Virginia \nremind us that the safety of the Nation's workers is paramount. Mining \ncontinues to be extremely hazardous--it has consistently been the first \nor second most dangerous industry in the country. This year we have \nalready had 17 mine fatalities, 15 of them in coal mines, and 14 of \nthem in West Virginia. And sadly, I understand that two more miners may \nhave been killed today.\n  Our entire Nation joins their families and communities in mourning \nthese fallen miners. We have a continuing obligation to do everything \nwe can to protect the safety of America's workers. It is obvious that \nwe are not meeting that obligation.\n  Two weeks ago, I traveled with Senator Rockefeller, HELP Committee \nChairman Enzi, and Subcommittee Chairman Isakson to meet with the \nfamily members of the miners who were killed at Sago Mine, and with \ncoalminers, company representatives, and health and safety experts. \nEach of us made a sincere commitment to improving the Nation's mine \nsafety laws.\n  This legislation provides a vital first step. It requires swift \naction by the Mine Safety and Health Administration to adopt standards \nthat are long overdue and bring mine safety standards out of the Stone \nAge and into the 21st century. It will bring stronger enforcement and \nup-to-date technology to every mine in America.\n  First and foremost, we need to ensure that the rescue and \ncommunications technology available to our Nation's miners is the most \nup-to-date available. Coal companies have spent millions on improving \ntechniques for extracting coal and metals from the ground, but miners \nstill have to rely on oxygen units and phone lines that were developed \n30 years ago. We already know better communications and miner tracking \ntechnology exists in other countries. It has been available in the \nUnited States for several years but, despite its proven availability to \nhelp save miners' lives, only a handful of mines here in the U.S. are \nusing it. This bill would create a dedicated office at MSHA to explore \nmine safety technologies and to work with other Federal agencies to \nensure that our Nation's mines are using the newest and best safety \nequipment.\n  While innovation is important, we also need to ensure that we use all \nof the tools available today to keep our Nation's miners safe. Earlier \nthis week, 72 workers at a mine in Canada were saved because Canadian \nmines are required to provide adequate stores of oxygen. It's a \ntravesty that we aren't doing the same for American miners. This bill \nwould require every coal mine in this country to have rescue chambers \navailable, with emergency air supplies and breathing devices to help \nkeep miners alive while they are waiting for rescue.\n  We also need to see that every mine is adequately prepared to respond \nto future emergencies. When miners are trapped underground, every \nminute is precious. Yet our laws and policies do not require mine \nrescue teams to be onsite. All too often it takes hours for rescuers to \nreach a mine and, when they do arrive, they are not familiar with the \nmine's layout. We also are losing experienced miners to work on these \nteams, as the average age of rescue workers is rising. The number of \ntrained rescuers is decreasing, even as demand for coal production \nincreases.\n  This legislation would require coal companies to have onsite rescue \nteams\n\n[[Page S452]]\n\nemployed by the mine, who are familiar with the layout of the mine and \nare at the ready in the case of an emergency. It also directs the \nSecretary of Labor to develop requirements for the training and \nqualifications of mine rescue workers, and the equipment and technology \nused in mine rescues.\n  We also need to ensure that our penalties are a significant deterrent \nto mine operators who continually violate the law. Sago Mine had an \ninjury rate nearly three times that of the national average and had \nbeen cited by MSHA for over 200 safety violations in 2005. Nearly half \nof these were ``serious and substantial''--meaning that the violations \nhad the potential to lead to serious injury. Eighteen of the violations \nwere so serious that they led to partial closures of the mine.\n  I know that President Bush has proposed raising maximum fines for the \nmost flagrant violations from $60,000 to $220,000. But this ignores the \ncritical failures of our minimum penalties, which are so low as to be \ntoothless. It is difficult to believe that penalties lower than traffic \ntickets will deter companies that make millions of dollars in profits \neach year. This legislation would ensure that willful and negligent \nviolators of the law would face a minimum fine of $10,000. Mine \noperators who fail to immediately notify MSHA of an emergency face \nfines of up to $100,000.\n  This bill starts a long overdue process to improve the safety of our \nNation's miners. We must act before another tragedy like those at the \nSago and Alma Mines occurs. I commend Senator Byrd and Senator \nRockefeller and the West Virginia Delegation for crafting this \nlegislation. And I join them in asking my colleagues to support its \nswift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2233. A bill to reform and improve the regulation of lobbying and \ncongressional ethics; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nthat reforms and improves the regulation of lobbying and raises \ncongressional ethics standards.\n  There is a perception in America that members of Congress care less \nabout the public interest and more about advancing their own personal \nand financial interests. We need to make fundamental changes in how we \npermit lobbyists to influence legislation, hearings, appropriations, \nand our general oversight of the Executive Branch.\n  The Democratic leadership bill to reform lobbying rules, the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act, which I am cosponsoring, contains \nsensible enough reforms.\n  Rather than standing pat, the measure I am introducing today is \ntougher medicine. I believe it will go a long way to changing the view \nof constituents that Congress is corrupt and ethically challenged.\n  The measure: institutes a Congress-wide two year ban on Senators, \nHouse members and their staffs lobbying Capitol Hill; takes a zero \ntolerance approach to lobbyist offered sports and entertainment tickets \nand meals; prohibits any lobbyist sponsored, or paid for, travel; and \neliminates the option of registered lobbyists working in any capacity \nfor a Senator's or House Member's election campaigns or fundraising \noperations.\n  A New York Times poll this past Friday sums up, in stark terms, \npublic perceptions of Congress.\n  When asked ``Do you think that recent reports that lobbyists may have \nbribed members of Congress are isolated incidents or is this the way \nthings work in Congress'', 77 percent of the respondents said bribing \nis the ``way things work'' in Congress. The survey indicates a 61 \npercent disapproval rating of Congress as well.\n  One poll participant, Mr. Donald Pertius from Arkansas, commented \nthat ``It seems like the integrity of Congress Members in the last few \nyears has just gone to pot.''\n  A key step, that will go a long way to clearing up the perception \nthat individuals leaving the Hill immediately trade on their contacts \nand friendships, is a two year Congress-wide ban on lobbying for \nMembers and staff once they leave their jobs.\n  Members and staff make a beeline for K Street when they leave the \nHill. According to the New York Times, 50 percent of the 36 Senators \nretired since 1998 and 40 percent of the 162 House Members have signed \nup as lobbyists.\n  The Democratic leadership bill, and from what I understand the \nRepublican measure being drafted, restricts staff from lobbying their \nformer offices. That is good but we need to go further.\n  We need to change the minds of people across America that working in \nthe Senate or House is about a commitment to public service--not a \nrevolving door to cashing in as a private sector lobbyist.\n  On another front, numerous Senate and House campaigns have registered \nlobbyists as Treasurers for Members' PACs and in other key finance \nroles. It's another backdoor way for a lobbyist to insinuate his or her \nway into a politician's inner circle.\n  Published reports confirm that 71 lawmakers now list lobbyists as \ntreasurers to their PACs or their campaign committees, nearly a \nfivefold increase since 1998. We need to make a clean break from this \nkind of collaboration that's fast on the rise.\n  The legislation I am introducing prohibits the formation of any \npolitical committee by a politician if a person registered as a \nlobbyist is formally affiliated with such an entity. Alex Knott at the \nCenter for Public Integrity stated in the Wall Street Journal last week \nthat ``By putting a lobbyist in charge of your political operations, \nyou are conflicted from the start.'' He's absolutely correct.\n  Senators, House Members, their staffs and lobbyists alike ought to \nbrace themselves for major change. The old rules and regulations that \ngovern Washington are due for overhaul, and I believe that the two \ncomprehensive leadership bills will represent a good start to that \nprocess. I hope my colleagues are receptive to even more stringent \nefforts, in the form of this legislation I am introducing today, and \nlook forward to the full Senate debate on this issue in the coming \nmonths.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lobbyist Reform Act of \n     2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TWO-YEAR TOTAL BAN ON LOBBYING BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS \n                   AND EMPLOYEES OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Subsection (e) of section 207 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(e) Restrictions on Members of Congress and Officers and \n     Employees of the Legislative Branch.--\n       ``(1) In general.--\n       ``(A) Prohibition.--Any person who is a Member of Congress, \n     an elected officer of either House of Congress, or an \n     employee of a House of Congress and who, within 2 years after \n     that person leaves office, knowingly makes, with the intent \n     to influence, any communication to or appearance before any \n     of the persons described in subparagraph (B), on behalf of \n     any other person (except the United States) in connection \n     with any matter on which such former Member of Congress or \n     elected officer seeks action by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of either House of Congress, in his or her official \n     capacity, shall be punished as provided in section 216 of \n     this title.\n       ``(B) Contact persons covered.--The persons referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) with respect to appearances or \n     communications are any Member, officer, or employee of either \n     House of Congress, and any employee of any other legislative \n     office of Congress.\n       ``(2) Definitions.--As used in this subsection--\n       ``(A) a person is an employee of a House of Congress if \n     that person is an employee of the Senate or an employee of \n     the House of Representatives;\n       ``(B) the term `employee of the House of Representatives' \n     means an employee of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives, an employee of a committee of the House of \n     Representatives, an employee of a joint committee of Congress \n     whose pay is disbursed by the Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives, and an employee on the leadership staff of \n     the House of Representatives;\n       ``(C) the term `employee of the Senate' means an employee \n     of a Senator, an employee of a committee of the Senate, an \n     employee of a joint committee of Congress whose pay is \n     disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, and an employee on \n     the leadership staff of the Senate;\n       ``(D) the term `Member of Congress' means a Senator or a \n     Member of the House of Representatives; and\n       ``(E) the term `Member of the House of Representatives' \n     means a Representative in,\n\n[[Page S453]]\n\n     or a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, Congress.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to prohibit offshore drilling on the outer \nContinental Shelf off the State of Florida, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Bill Nelson, in introducing the Permanent Protection \nfor Florida Act of 2006.\n  I believe this bipartisan legislation will provide Florida's pristine \ncoastline, beaches, and our critical military training area with \nstrong, permanent protections--while at the same time providing limited \noil and gas exploration in areas that have traditionally been under \nPresidential moratoria.\n  Our Nation is struggling with crippling energy prices and the growing \npressure to explore off Florida's coast has never been greater than \nnow. Instead of sitting on the sidelines and waiting for others to \ndictate the terms of oil and gas operations on our coast, we felt \ncompelled to offer an alternative that will protect our State's \ninterests in perpetuity.\n  This legislation offers historic protections that would create a \nFlorida Exclusion Zone--a buffer area extending 150 miles south of the \nPanhandle that would also place the Florida Straits and Atlantic Coast \npermanently off limits to oil and gas exploration.\n  All leases inside the Florida Exclusion Zone would be relinquished or \nremoved in exchange for royalty forgiveness on active leases in the \nCentral and Western Gulf of Mexico. These relinquished leases must also \nbe environmentally restored to their original condition. In addition, \nthe Permanent Protection for Florida Act would remove the mandatory \ninventory of the Outer Continental Shelf and extend the current \nPresidential moratorium through 2020.\n  This bill sends a message that is loud and clear--Florida's waters \nare off limits. Florida's leaders have worked too long and too hard on \nbuilding up these protections just to have them disappear during a \nbrief moment of high energy prices. We have a lot at stake and it is \ntime to solidify our protections into law.\n  I believe these historic protections will garner significant support \nfrom our State's congressional delegation and coastal members of \nCongress that are concerned with resource exploration off their coasts.\n  I urge those that are looking for bipartisan solutions to energy \nexploration to join with me and my colleague Senator Nelson in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with \nmy fellow Senator from Florida, Mel Martinez, legislation we believe \nwill enhance our Nation's military preparedness, while also protecting \nthe State of Florida's economy from harm by oil drilling.\n  It could be said that debate on this issue began 37 years ago last \nmonth. It was in January 1969 when an explosion at an offshore drilling \nsite caused a 200,000-gallon crude oil spill off California's coast. \nWhile small in comparison to other spills, that incident dealt a \ndevastating blow to neighboring beaches and aquatic life.\n  As tides brought an 800-square-mile slick ashore, oil coated 35 miles \nof the coastline, blackening beaches and killing thousands of birds, \ndolphins, seals, fish and other wildlife. A national outcry followed, \nand sparked a movement that led to legal bans on drilling on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, including the eastern Gulf of Mexico off of Florida.\n  Unfortunately, this past year has seen a number of legislative and \nadministrative attempts to undo this longstanding ban--without a cause \nthat is worth the risk.\n  In fact, Senator Martinez and I have been fighting an almost daily \nbattle to protect our State's tourism economy, which is heavily \ndependent on our beautiful beaches and abundant fisheries. At the same \ntime, we have been fighting to preserve our military's vital testing \nand training sites there in the eastern gulf.\n  The Martinez-Nelson Permanent Protection for Florida Act will forever \nsafeguard the State's tourism-dependent economy from offshore drilling, \nwhile also removing active drilling leases in the eastern gulf. It \ncreates the Florida Exclusion Zone, which will extend out at least 260 \nmiles off much of the State's west coast, and at least 150 miles off \nthe Florida Straits and all the way around the entire east coast.\n  In short, our proposal will protect Florida's economy and its \nenvironment; and, at the same time, enhance our Nation's military \npreparedness. We, therefore, expect to receive strong support from the \nFlorida Congressional Delegation.\n  We also expect to receive support from our fellow Senators \nrepresenting other coastal States.

Res. 363) designating February 2006 as \n     ``Go Direct Month.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleague \nSenator Grassley in submitting this important resolution commemorating \nFebruary 2006 as Go Direct Month.\n  In 2004, the Treasury Department issued over 70,000 checks worth $61 \nmillion that were illegally signed for. The Treasury receives \napproximately half a million phone calls each year from people having \nproblems with paper checks.\n  Go Direct encourages Americans to use direct deposit for their \nFederal checks, such as Social Security. Under direct deposit, the \nFederal Government transfers its payments directly to a person's bank \naccount, eliminating the risk of lost or stolen checks. Since 1986, \ndirect deposit has also saved the Federal Government $5 billion in \nadministrative costs--$120 million a year for Social Security checks \nalone.\n  Now, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have launched Go \nDirect to encourage Americans to protect their Federal benefits and \ntake more control of their money. Go Direct Month, promoted by the \nFederal Government and by State and local governments and the private \nsector as well, will inform as many citizens as possible about the \nadvantages of direct deposit and help them adopt direct deposit for the \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this worthwhile resolution and to \nencourage their constituents to take advantage of this time-saving and \nproblem-avoiding initiative.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 363) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 363\n\n       Whereas the Department of Treasury issued over 70,000 \n     checks worth approximately $61,000,000 that were illegally \n     signed for in 2004;\n       Whereas the Department of the Treasury receives \n     approximately 500,000 telephone calls each year regarding \n     problems with paper checks;\n       Whereas the use of direct deposit has resulted in \n     approximately $5,000,000,000 in savings for the Federal \n     Government since 1986;\n       Whereas 1 out of every 5 newly eligible Social Security \n     recipients has yet to sign up for direct deposit;\n       Whereas the United States would generate approximately \n     $120,000,000 in annual savings if all federal beneficiaries \n     used direct deposit;\n       Whereas the use of direct deposit is a more secure, \n     reliable, and cost effective method of payment because the \n     use of direct deposit--\n       (1) eliminates the risk of lost or stolen checks;\n       (2) helps protect against fraud; and\n       (3) provides citizens of the United States with more \n     control over their money;\n       Whereas the Department of the Treasury and the Federal \n     Reserve Bank has launched ``Go Direct'', a national campaign \n     organized to encourage citizens of the United States to use \n     direct deposit for the receipt of Social Security and other \n     Federal benefits; and\n       Whereas, by working with financial institutions, advocacy \n     groups, and community organizations, the sponsors of ``Go \n     Direct'' educate citizens of the United States about the \n     advantages of using direct deposit and assist them during the \n     enrollment process: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideas of ``Go Direct'';\n       (2) proclaims February 2006 as ``Go Direct Month'';\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\n       (3) commends Federal, State, and local governments, and the \n     private sector, for promoting February as ``Go Direct \n     Month''; and\n       (4) encourages all citizens of the United States to--\n       (A) participate in events and awareness initiatives held \n     during the month of February;\n       (B) become informed about the convenience and safety of \n     direct deposit; and\n       (C) consider signing up for direct deposit of Social \n     Security or other Federal benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/01/senate-section/article/S460-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

At this \npoint I expect further debate tomorrow morning until all time has \nexpired. As all Senators are aware, once all time expires Senators may \noffer amendments, and therefore a series of stacked votes over the \ncourse of tomorrow afternoon is to be expected. Senators should expect \na busy afternoon, and I ask Members to remain close to the Chamber \ntomorrow while these amendments are considered to this tax \nreconciliation bill. We don't know exactly how many amendments that \nwill be, but once those amendments start we will go straight through \nthose amendments until completion, whether that be tomorrow night or on \nFriday. We will finish the bill this week and it is possible we could \nfinish it tomorrow night if we have good cooperation from both sides of \nthe aisle on this legislation. But if not, we will go into Friday to \ncomplete the bill.\n  Progress was good today. There was a lot of discussion over the \ncourse of the day. We have a lot of people who said they wished to \noffer amendments and I do hope that they would reconsider and make \nsure, if the amendment is to be offered, it is a substantive amendment, \nimportant to the tax reconciliation bill and, if not, not offer the \namendment.
