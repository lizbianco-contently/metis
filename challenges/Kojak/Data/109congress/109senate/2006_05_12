Mr. President, today we will be in a period of morning \nbusiness in order for Senators to make statements. Yesterday we \ncompleted our work on the Tax Relief Act with a vote of 54 to 44. We \nhad a good debate--a great debate--on the importance of this extended \ntax relief, this progrowth policy put forth by the President and \nsupported by this body yesterday. We had a lot of Senators participate \non both sides of that important debate of the direction of the country \nto continue this strong economic growth with the creation of over 5.3 \nmillion jobs in the last 30 or so months. I congratulate Chairman \nGrassley for his tremendous work in helping bring that tax relief \npackage to the floor which will ensure continued economic growth and \njob creation.\n  Yesterday, unfortunately, we missed an opportunity to assist small \nbusinesses across this Nation. We all know it is in those small \nbusinesses that we find the engine of economic growth and the creation \nof new jobs. We had an opportunity to assist them with lowering their \nhealth care costs by allowing them to group together, to band together \nto capture marketing clout, which would lower prices for health care \nfor their employees. We were unsuccessful in that particular effort, \nalthough it is one that will come back again and again because the cost \nof health care is skyrocketing and is getting increasingly out of the \nreach of everyday working Americans.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Enzi, who has worked tirelessly on this \nbipartisan bill which would attempt to do just that and would have \naccomplished that if we had been able to pass it yesterday. Chairman \nEnzi has done a tremendous job in pulling people together and in \neducating people broadly on it. I thank him for his work.\n  As we stated yesterday, we will return on Monday to a very important \nbill, the importance of which is captured by the passion expressed \nacross the country, whether it is on television or in newspapers, on \ntalk shows or on the streets or at the workplace, and that is the \nimmigration debate. As we all know, we need to tighten our borders and \nwe need to focus on our borders. But we also need to approach the issue \nin a comprehensive way because we are a magnet attracting people across \nthat border, and then people are hiring them illegally, so many \nemployers are breaking the law. We need to tighten up there and address \nthe temporary worker program, as well as the people who have come here \nillegally in the past.\n  As we talked about yesterday morning, we will have a robust debate, \nan open debate, and Senators will have ample opportunity to offer their \namendments. But as the Democratic leader and I said on the floor 24 \nhours ago, it is important for people to bring their amendments right \nnow to the leadership in language so we can start the process and so \nthat process, with debate and amendment, is not pushed off for a few \ndays but literally starts on Monday. We should consider several \namendments on Monday and then begin voting on those on Tuesday. So I do \nencourage our colleagues to come forward.\n  On Tuesday morning, we have locked in a vote on a circuit court \nnomination that will begin around 10 o'clock in the morning, and I \nexpect we will have votes on the immigration bill shortly thereafter. \nIt is my hope that we will have votes over the course of Tuesday and, \nindeed, on each day next week. We may be working into the evenings \nbecause we will finish this bill prior to the Memorial Day recess.\n  With that, Mr. President, over the course of the day, I expect there \nwill be a number of Senators coming down to make statements, reflecting \non what has occurred over the past week and celebrating the great \nvictory for the American people in the bill that passed\n\n[[Page S4508]]\n\nyesterday in terms of tax relief. The passage of that bill yesterday \nwill affect about 7 million people who report on capital gains each \nyear, about 20 million people who report on dividends each year, and \nanother 7 million, almost 8 million people who would otherwise see \ntheir taxes go up because of the alternative minimum tax.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4508-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4508-S4509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE WITH CUBA\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced a measure which \nis a companion to one introduced in the House of Representatives by \nCongresswoman Ros-Lehtinen relating to the business of trade with Cuba. \nThis morning, I wanted to speak a little on the issue of my bill as \nwell as on the overall need for us to file this bill.\n  Many years ago, perhaps too long for some in this Chamber to \nremember, as a result of hostile acts by the state of Cuba, under the \ngovernment of Fidel Castro, who today continues to terrorize his people \nand to be a very negative influence on the world and is one of the \nlongest reigning dictatorships in the history of the world--certainly \nthe modern history of the world--because of hostile acts by the Cuban \nGovernment against the United States and against the interests of the \nUnited States in Cuba, the Government of the United States felt it \nnecessary to begin trade sanctions against the Cuban Government. These \ntrade sanctions were designed as retaliation for the actions of the \nCuban Government.\n  Those actions included, among other hostile actions, the \nexpropriation without adequate compensation of properties of citizens \nof the United States on the island of Cuba. They included the property \nof oil companies such as Texaco and Standard Oil and other interests of \nthe United States that had large refineries in Cuba, that had oil \nexploration interests, and that also had, of course, retail outlets on \nthe island.\n  As a result of Cuba's action, the United States imposed the \nsanctions. The sanctions were designed to help the Cuban Government \nunderstand that it had to live by international law and by \ninternational standards, which were to pay just compensation, fair \ncompensation, for the expropriated properties. Unfortunately, the Cuban \nGovernment chose not to do so, and to this day these claims of the \nnationals of the United States for the unfair, unlawful, and \nuncompensated expropriation by the Cuban Government continues \nunsettled. The Cuban Government has never taken steps to recognize \nallegations under international law or obligations under international \nlaw or obligations to a neighbor with whom it purports to want better \nand improved relations.\n  So the United States began a policy of an embargo or trade sanctions \nagainst Cuba. It really wasn't an embargo, it was simply: We will not \ntrade with Cuba. The Government of the United States will not trade \nwith Cuba. That has been in effect even until today. It was done by \nExecutive order for many years, but then many years ago, with the \nHelms-Burton Act, it was codified into legislation. It became part of \nthe law of the land as a result of congressional action.\n  That legislation also provided a path by which these sanctions could \nbe ended. It provided a path by which more normal trade and other \nrelations could be had, and they had to do with the issue of something \nsimple, something this President has so eloquently spoken about: \ndemocracy, rule of law, elections--a quaint thought, that the people of \na country ought to elect their leader. The thought that the people of a \ncountry would have an opportunity on a given day in life to go to a \nbooth and in private exercise that universal right to vote, to say whom \nthey want their leader to be--Cuba doesn't permit that.\n\n  There might be a free press. Wouldn't that be a nice thing? People \ncould speak their mind. Folks would have an opportunity to go into a \npublic square and debate the issues of the day. Cubans are denied that. \nThat is no longer an opportunity and continues not to be so.\n  In addition to those problems, the actions of the Cuban Government \nover its history have been anything but benign. They have been quite \nhostile to the interests of the United States.\n  This is to not go into all of the details of the actions of the Cuban \nGovernment toward its own people--human rights and its denial of the \nmost basic human rights--but as we look to other issues such as the \nissues of actions in the world, Cuba has tried to export revolution, to \nfoment and foster revolutions throughout the world. They were very \nactive in Africa as a surrogate for the Soviet Union in Angola, working \nhostile to the interests of the United States. In addition to that, \nthey proceeded to encourage and foster wars in Central America which \ncaused countless thousands of deaths in the 1980s.\n  Thanks to the determined and decided action of the United States, it \nwas possible for these countries to live in peace and for these \ncountries to have Democratic and normal elections.\n  Fast forwarding to now, even as recently as a few days ago, the U.S. \nState Department continues to have Cuba on the list of States that are \nsponsors of terrorism. There are probably 180-some nation states in the \nUnited Nations. Of those, there are only a half dozen that are on the \nlist of terrorist states around the world. Cuba is one of them.\n  In addition to that, Cuba now is part of an axis, an axis that works \nin partnership with Hugo Chavez, the somewhat democratically elected \nPresident of Venezuela but someone who increasingly governs as an \nautocrat. This is someone who, in partnership with Fidel Castro, has \nencouraged and helped Evo Morales to be elected as President of \nBolivia. What have these countries under the tutelage of Castro done? \nMorales, in the past few days, has shown or expressed his intentions to \nnationalize the gas industry, to nationalize the natural resources of \nhis country, beginning with gas. Yet in Europe he made some very clear \nstatements that he believed that for 500 years Europeans have pillaged \nhis country and that all natural resources ought to belong to the \npeople of Bolivia, and therefore more expropriations are sure to come \nof the natural resources as defined by Mr. Morales, President Morales, \nand they include natural gas, and he will move on to others.\n  Yesterday as well, or the day before, the Congress in Venezuela said \nthat they also believe they should be nationalizing all the natural \nresources of Venezuela. This includes, of course, the investment that \nthe U.S. oil companies have had in Venezuela for a number of years.\n  So what is the suggestion and answer that some would have to our \ndependence on foreign sources of oil, to our dependence on unstable \nforeign governments, to our dependence on foreign governments that are \nhostile to the United States? To enter into business with the country \nof Cuba in order to partner with them in oil exploration, a little less \nthan 50 miles off the shores of Florida. Why is this not a good idea? \nSimply for the fact that to enter into a partnership with a government \nthat does not observe the rule of law, to enter into a partnership and \nencourage American companies to invest in a country where we have very \nstrained, if any, diplomatic relations, is not only not a good idea--to \nenter into a partnership for oil exploration with a country that has in \nthe past expropriated American oil companies' properties in Cuba would \nbe only to repeat a cycle of mistakes made in the past. It would be \nonly to come back into the fold of a dictator who does not observe or \nunderstand the rule of law. To go into a business in a country that \ndoes not have a judicial system that is independent, to go into \nbusiness with a country that does not recognize the fact that foreign \ninvestors have a right to their property when they purchase it, who \nwill not honor the rule of law, will not honor private property rights? \nWith this kind of country, it is suggested we go into a partnership in \norder for us to have sufficient energy, in order for us to be \nindependent in our resources.\n  These efforts are sadly misguided. What we must do is do things such \nas explore for oil--and I know the Presiding Officer, our President pro \ntempore, so passionately cares about this--\n\n[[Page S4509]]\n\nin the ANWR, an area that is totally under the control of the United \nStates, that is part of the United States. We can also drill in the \nGulf of Mexico, an area that is so sensitive to Floridians and where we \nhave acquiesced to drilling in 2 to 3 million acres of the gulf.\n  To conclude, I suggest the bill we have filed, which tries to reenact \nand speak to the Cuban embargo that has been in place for many years, \nwith good reason. That embargo would be stringently enforced with those \nwho seek to invest in partnership with this illegitimate government, a \ngovernment that continues to be a threat to its neighbors, continues to \nbe a hostile government to the United States.\n  In September of this year, the President of Iran, Mahmud Ahmadi-\nNejad, is going to be visiting Castro in Cuba. This is a return visit \nfor one that Fidel Castro paid to Iran a year or so ago. At that time, \nCastro said to the people in Iran: Working together and in partnership \nwe will bring the United States to its knees. It is with this \ngovernment that some would suggest we should enter into a partnership \nin order to solve our energy woes. I would say those efforts are \nmisguided, and I look forward to further debate on my proposal which \nseeks to reassert the long-held position of the United States that \ntrade with Cuba today would not be in the best interests of this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4509-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4509-S4510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     S. 147, NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise again to talk about legislation of \ncritical importance to me and the people of Hawaii, S. 147, the Native \nHawaiian Government Reorganization Act. As my colleagues are aware, we \nhave been trying to schedule this bill for a debate and vote on the \nSenate floor. Unfortunately, the bill has been blocked by a handful of \nmy colleagues who fail to understand the importance of this issue to \nthe people of Hawaii.\n  S. 147 is a bipartisan bill. It is supported by members on both sides \nof the aisle. I want to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this \nlegislation: Senators Cantwell, Coleman, Dodd, Dorgan, Graham, Inouye, \nMurkowski, Smith and Stevens. Your support for the people of Hawaii has \nnot gone unnoticed.\n  I want to talk about what we did to draft this legislation. I want to \nexplain the broad and inclusive process that we used. My colleagues \nshould know that in drafting this legislation we consulted a broad \narray of individuals, both native and non-native.\n  In 1999, Hawaii's Congressional delegation formed the Task Force on \nNative Hawaiian Issues. The Task Force was composed of myself, the \nsenior Senator from Hawaii, and our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, Representative Neil Abercrombie and Patsy Mink. It was \ndetermined that I would serve as the head of the Task Force.\n  My colleagues need to understand that the issue of political status \nfor Native Hawaiians is not a new issue. It has been a hot topic for \nmany, many years and in fact has been a topic of contention since \nHawaii became a State in 1959. Given its history, I wanted to tap into \nthe experience of the many individuals who have addressed this issue \nand who would be impacted by Federal recognition for Native Hawaiians. \nI decided to establish five working groups: the Native Hawaiian \nCommunity working group, the State officials working group, the Federal \nofficials working group, the Native American and Constitutional \nScholars working group, and the Congressional members and caucuses \nworking group. Overall, more than 100 individuals were involved in \nmeeting and advising Hawaii's Congressional delegation on what should \nand should not be included in this legislation.\n  The Native Hawaiian Community working group's role was to advise us \nas to the views of the Native Hawaiian community. The membership of the \nworking group was balanced to include a broad variety of individuals \nfrom different islands, professions and backgrounds.\n  The State officials working group was composed of State legislators \nas well as the heads of State agencies who would be directly impacted \nby a Native Hawaiian governing entity participating in a government-to-\ngovernment relationship with the United States. This group advised us \non the impact of such a policy on State programs and agencies.\n  The Federal officials working group was composed of Federal officials \nfrom agencies currently administering services and programs impacting \nNative Hawaiians. The role of this working group was to advise us of \nhow best to extend the Federal policy of self-governance and self-\ndetermination to Hawaii's indigenous peoples.\n  The Native American and constitutional scholars working group was \ncomposed of a number of tribal leaders and key constitutional scholars \nin Indian law. We benefited from the advice provided by tribal leaders \nwho were willing to share lessons learned and from constitutional \nscholars well-versed in Federal Indian law.\n  The Congressional members and caucus group was composed of our \ncolleagues who sought to help us at the member level to move this \nlegislation.\n  We held several public meetings in Hawaii with the members of the \nNative Hawaiian community working group and the State working group. \nIndividuals who were not members of the working group, and many who \nopposed our efforts, were allowed to attend and participate in the \nmeetings. Overall, we had over 100 individuals provide initial input to \nthe drafting of the legislation.\n  The bill was first considered by the 106th Congress. Five days of \nhearings were held in Hawaii in August 2000. While the bill passed the \nHouse, the Senate failed to take action. The bill was subsequently \nconsidered by the 107th and 108th Congresses. In Each Congress, the \nbill has been favorably reported by the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs and its companion measure has been favorably reported by the \nHouse Committee on Resources.\n  Despite the many modifications to the legislation over the past 7 \nyears, I have ensured that the process authorized in this bill has \nalways retained the appropriate balance between the structure necessary \nto comply with Federal law and the flexibility necessary to ensure that \nNative Hawaiians can make the critical decisions necessary to form \ntheir governing entity.\n  I want all of my colleagues to know that when the Senate considers \nthis bill, I will offer a substitute amendment. The substitute \namendment has been widely distributed since September 2005 and is the \nresult of successful negotiations between the executive branch \nofficials and our Congressional delegation and Governor. I thank the \nchairman and vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs \nfor helping to facilitate the negotiations process.\n\n  The substitute amendment satisfactorily addresses the concerns raised \nin a letter from the Department of Justice to the chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Indian Affairs. The letter addressed 4 concerns \nwith the legislation: liability of the United States, civil and \ncriminal jurisdiction, military readiness, and gaming. The legislative \nlanguage in the substitute amendment has been cleared by the executive \nbranch and addresses the practical concerns expressed in the July 13, \n2005 letter.\n  I look forward to the debate on the substitute amendment.\n  My colleagues can see from the process that I have just outlined that \nthis legislation is based on the collective thoughts of a wide array of \nindividuals, native and non-native, from Hawaii and across the entire \nNation. It is based on the contributions of individuals well-versed in \nthe Federal policies dealing with indigenous peoples--by those who \nunderstand the legal and political relationship the United States has \nwith its indigenous peoples. It is based on Federal law and is \nsubstantiated by the many judicial rulings on the political and legal \nrelationship between the United States and its indigenous peoples. It \nreflects the respect that the people of Hawaii have for the \npreservation of the culture and traditions of Hawaii's indigenous \npeoples--the culture and traditions which form the basis of the spirit \nof Aloha--which all citizens of Hawaii are proud to demonstrate.\n  This bill is supported by Hawaii's Governor, Linda Lingle, the Hawaii \nState Legislature, Office of Hawaiian\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n\nAffairs and Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. The National Congress of \nAmerican Indians and the Alaska Federation of Natives have passed \nresolutions in support of this bill. The bill is also supported by a \nnumber of organizations, native and non-native, including the American \nBar Association, Japanese American Citizens' League, Inter Tribal \nCouncil of Arizona, and the Hawaii State Teachers Association.\n  I want to express my sincerest appreciation to our majority and \nminority leaders for working with me and Hawaii's senior Senator on \nscheduling the Senate's consideration of S. 147, the Native Hawaiian \nGovernment Reorganization Act of 2005. It is my understanding that the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 147 will be \nfiled on June 6, 2006, with the vote on the motion to occur on June 8, \n2006.\n  I look forward to this opportunity to finally discuss S. 147. As my \ncolleagues have heard over the past week, this is an issue of \nimportance to all of the people of Hawaii, and this is not a native \nversus non-native issue in Hawaii. Rather, this is about authorizing a \nprocess for the people of Hawaii to be able to address longstanding \nissues resulting from a tragic, poignant period in our history. This is \nabout establishing parity for Hawaii's indigenous peoples in Federal \npolicies. This is about clarifying the existing political and legal \nrelationship between native Hawaiians and the United States.\n  Again, I express my deep appreciation to our majority and Democratic \nleaders, to the cosponsors of this legislation, and to the senator from \nArizona for helping to work out this agreement. I want to express my \ndeep appreciation to Hawaii's senior Senator who has stood firm with me \nas we have sought to do what is right for the people of Hawaii.\n  Passing this legislation will make it right.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative \nclerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4510-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4510-S4514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts about the \nimmigration legislation that we will be dealing with next week. The \nbill before us is a massive piece of legislation--over 600 pages, as I \nrecall, and deals with a number of extremely important issues. Little, \nif any, thought has been given, and certainly no debate and discussion \nor seeking of economic and scientific information to help us decide \nwhat our future immigration policies should be.\n  I have studied that legislation in some depth. I am a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, and have some fine lawyers on my staff. We have \nbeen digging into it, and have become more and more troubled as we \nstudied what the legislation actually means and says. It does not do \nwhat it purports to do, which is to create a guest worker or temporary \nworking policy for America. It has a number of other problems with it \nthat I think deserve the most serious consideration.\n  Few, if any, issues that we face in this Senate have greater long-\nterm consequences for our country than immigration. That is a fact.\n  Why are the American people so interested in this? Why have they \nexpressed such concern about it? Because it is very important. We are \nresponsible for them, and we have an obligation to them to think about \nthis very carefully. Unfortunately, we have not done so. It is an idea \nthat we have to do something. Yes, we need to do something. Let us all \nagree on that.\n  I have suggested that we should first proceed, as the House of \nRepresentatives did in a bipartisan, substantial majority vote decided, \nto deal with enforcement first, and establish some credibility with the \nAmerican people that we can and will enforce whatever laws we have. To \npass a new law and enforce it no better than the one that we have \nenforced in the past is no good.\n  That is the biggest frustration out there with anyone in our country \nwho believes in law and order, policy and fairness and decency. You \ndon't allow people to break in line ahead of others. How much more \nbasic can it be than that? That is what we learned in elementary \nschool. That is what we follow as adults in this country, but that is \nnot what we are doing at the border.\n  We all know the system is broken. It has made a mockery of the law, \nand it is a terrible challenge for us, but one that we need to \nconfront.\n  We decided in the Senate, and the President believes, we can't fix \nthe law enforcement system first--we need to fix the entire scheme of \nimmigration.\n  We have not had enough serious hearings on the fundamentals of what \nwe are doing. I have asked for five hearings in the Senate on the \nJudiciary Committee on the economic and social implication of \nimmigration. We were given one. It was a very valuable hearing but not \nenough, in my view. Certainly, I do not think the average Senator is \nfully engaged and aware of the serious concerns this legislation \nraises.\n\n  I will take a few minutes to go back over what I called in a speech a \nfew weeks ago loopholes in the legislation. Some of that speech was \nbased on the original Kennedy-McCain bill. I made that speech right \nafter a compromise, the so-called Hagel-Martinez bill, hit the Senate. \nI will go back over these fundamental problems with the legislation. It \nindicates the weaknesses that exist today under the bill which will be \nin the Senate beginning next week.\n  As we go forward into the week, I will be discussing, and perhaps \nothers will as well, deeper flaws in the legislation that deal with the \nfundamental guiding principles of this legislation: What should we be \ndoing? How many people should be allowed into this country? What skill \nsets should they bring? How should those decisions be made? How can we \ncreate a system which is enforceable, which will work to allow the \ncountry to decide what is in its best interests with regard to those \nwho come here?\n  They say we are not supposed to talk too much next week. We are just \nsupposed to come to the floor, offer amendments and maybe ask for 30 \nminutes of debate. We can have 20 amendments, and we will talk for just \n30 minutes on those amendments on each side. We have been told: Don't \ntalk too much, Senator, because we have to move this bill and get it \noff our plate. They do not want to talk about it too much because \npeople back home might find out what is actually in the bill. That is \nthe honest truth. On both sides, Republican leadership and Democratic \nleadership want to move something through. But ``something'' is not \ngood enough. We ought to do the right thing.\n  Now I will talk about some of the flaws that continue to exist in \nthis bill. I begin with loophole No. 1, illegal aliens. People here \nillegally are going to be part of this mass amnesty. We have discussed \namnesty and whether the provisions in this bill are amnesty. I have to \nsay I spent 30 minutes in the Senate going back to the immigration laws \npassed in 1986, and everyone admitted 1986 was amnesty when they passed \nit. They promised they would enforce the law in the future. They got \nthe amnesty, and they didn't enforce the law. In 1986, they said there \nwould be 1.5 million people claiming amnesty, yet over 3 million people \nclaimed amnesty. They claimed we would have lawful immigration in the \nfuture, and now we have 11 million people here illegally. Why should \nthe American people not have some doubts about the promises of Congress \nand the President to carry out a legal system that will work?\n  Let me point out a few of the things we are dealing with. ``Blacks \nLaw Dictionary,'' which is the premiere dictionary that virtually every \nlawyer in America has on his desk, has a definition in its section on \namnesty, and it is defined as the 1986 Immigration Act. It is included \nas one of the definitions of what amnesty is.\n  What I suggest, essentially this current bill is probably less tight, \nless enforceable than the 1986 act. If amnesty has any meaning, this \nbill is amnesty. I don't want to get into any more debate about it, but \nI do not back down on the fundamental concept that the legislation \nbefore the Senate today is basically an amnesty for the people who came \nhere illegally in violation of our law. They have to do a few things, \nthey have to take some steps, but in no way will they be denied the \nfundamental things they sought when they came here illegally.\n\n[[Page S4511]]\n\n  We are a generous nation. We know we have a real problem. We are not \nintending in any way to make all of these people who have come \nillegally leave the country. We will have to work through this in some \ngenerous and humane way to make sure we treat this sensitively and \njustly, but it is a difficult problem when we reward people who violate \nthe law, for their very violation of that law. It is not a principle \nthat should be lightly traversed.\n  Now here are just some of the loopholes.\n  Loophole No. 1: Illegal aliens with felonies or three or more \nmisdemeanors will not be barred from getting amnesty under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act.\n  Different crimes make different aliens inadmissible and deportable or \nineligible for benefits. As written in this bill, on page 347, it only \nrequires an alien to show they are not inadmissible to qualify for the \namnesty. However, some felonies make an alien inadmissible under the \nact and others do not.\n  The Kyl-Cornyn amendment that we will deal with next week that was \nblocked by the other side previously was designed to fix this loophole. \nSenator Reid refused to allow these amendments to be voted on when the \nbill came up before because he did not want to have his Members \nrecorded as voting for anything. I am not sure too many on our side \nwant to have any votes, either, but it was clear that the Democratic \nleader was intent on moving this bill forward without any votes or as \nfew votes as possible so we would not have to deal with some of these \nissues. This was a hot issue. We tried to get a vote on it, and we \ncould not get a vote. So the Kyl-Cornyn amendment which was blocked was \ndesigned to fix this loophole. It will keep aliens with felony \nconvictions or three misdemeanors from being eligible for amnesty.\n  Why do we want to give amnesty to felons? The United States ought to \ndecide who it wants to be part of its citizenry. Since we cannot accept \neveryone in the world who would like to come here, why in the world \nwould we not want to say: If you have a felony conviction, you are not \none of them. We will invite someone who is honest and decent who will \ncontribute positively to our country's growth, development, and \nculture. We could not even get a vote on this to fix it.\n  We have to make this change. Hopefully, we will get a vote on it this \nweek to fix it. I believe we will have a vote in favor of not allowing \nfelons to be given amnesty, but I am not sure, given the mood of the \nSenate today.\n\n  Loophole No. 2: Aliens previously barred from receiving immigration \nbenefits for life because they filed frivolous asylum applications will \nbe able to receive amnesty.\n  This is an interesting reversal of existing law. If you come in and \nmake some bogus claim that you are entitled to asylum, you can still \nget amnesty. We have had a lot of problems with people coming from a \ncountry, where maybe they were arrested for a legitimate crime and fled \nto the United States, saying they are being persecuted back home, and \nthey want asylum. After looking into their claim, we find out it is \nbogus and they were actually an armed robber in their home country. We \nbarred them from being able to get an application for any benefits \nunder the immigration laws. It is a form of saying: We are not going to \ntolerate that. This bill reverses that.\n  Under INA section 208(d)6, if the Attorney General of the United \nStates determines an alien knowingly filed a frivolous asylum \napplication, he is to be permanently ineligible for any benefits under \nthe INA. This bill would change that. On page 345, it says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the secretary \n     shall adjust an alien who meets the requirements for amnesty.\n\n  No provision of the bill states that the alien is ineligible for \namnesty if they previously committed immigration fraud by filing a \nfrivolous asylum application. The bill gives benefits to aliens \npreviously barred from all immigration benefits. We give amnesty to \nthem. If we want to keep those who have committed immigration fraud in \nthe past from getting amnesty, we have to change that. We need to \nchange that by closing this loophole.\n  Why did they put that in there? Who wrote this bill, I keep asking. I \nam sure the sponsors of the bill do not know the implications of all of \nthese provisions. I don't know who put this together.\n  Loophole No. 3: All aliens who are subject to a final order of \nremoval who fail to leave pursuant to a voluntary departure agreement, \nor who are subject to the reinstatement of a final order of removal \nbecause they illegally reentered after being once removed from the \nUnited States are eligible for amnesty.\n  Pages 358 to 359 of the bill clearly state that certain grounds of \ninadmissibility in the act will not apply to aliens who apply for \namnesty under the bill. The current inadmissibility provisions that are \nwaived include aliens with final orders of removal for document fraud. \nIf you file a false claim to the Government as an American citizen, \nthat is a felony. These charges are providing false documents, offenses \nthat are felony offenses.\n  I repeat, the current inadmissibility provisions that are waived \nunder this bill that will be in the Senate this week include aliens \nwith final orders of removal for document fraud. They have been \napprehended, caught, found to be here as a result of making false \nclaims to the Government, failed to attend removal proceedings, were \nallowed to be out on bail, asked to come to court and answer the \ncharges, and did not show up. They violated a court order to show up. \nThey did not attend their removal proceedings. We call them absconders. \nAnd aliens who already have final orders of removal and many other \ncategories are exempted.\n  This means aliens who have already received their day in court, they \nhave had their cases fully tried and have failed to depart the United \nStates unlawfully, will now be rewarded for not leaving. They will \nqualify for amnesty. They will be able to become citizens of the United \nStates. This will include many of the 37,000 Chinese nationals China \nhas refused to take back whom we have ordered deported. If we want to \nenforce the laws against illegal aliens who already had their day in \ncourt, this loophole must be closed.\n  Loophole No. 4: Aliens who illegally entered multiple times, which is \na felony, qualify for amnesty.\n  The first time you come into the country illegally, it is a \nmisdemeanor. If you are apprehended and deported and you come back the \nsecond time, it is a felony. Aliens who have illegally entered multiple \ntimes--that is, chargeable with felonies--are eligible for amnesty. The \nbill, on pages 12-23, requires that the illegal alien be continuously \npresent in the United States since 2001 to qualify for amnesty. \nHowever, the bill allows the alien to have left the United States for \n``brief, casual, and innocent departures.''\n  Let us remind ourselves that criminal laws are being broken each time \nan illegal alien crosses the border of the United States. Title 8, \nsection 1325, of the United States Code says that illegal entry into \nthe United States is a misdemeanor the first time and a felony \nthereafter. I don't think multiple illegal felonies are casual, brief, \nor innocent. It rewards those who have not followed the law.\n  Loophole No. 5: The bill allows aliens who have persecuted anyone--a \npersecutor on account of race, religion, national membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion--to get amnesty. It fails \nto make persecutors ineligible for amnesty.\n  I would have thought this was an oversight until we noticed that on \npage 375--there are a lot of pages in this bill, over 600--line 22 \nmakes these heinous acts bar aliens here between 2 and 5 years from \namnesty. The same bar is left out for the 8.8 million aliens who have \nbeen here for more than 5 years. This can only be interpreted by any \ncourt as an intentional decision that Congress has made to allow \npersecutors who have been in the country more than 5 years to be able \nto stay here. I do not think we want to do that. Let's close that \nloophole.\n\n  We are told that people who come here come here to work, and for many \nthat is certainly true. And many are fine, decent, good workers. \nLoophole No. 6, however, is that there is no continuous work \nrequirement for this amnesty. We have been told that you have to earn \nyour citizenship, earn your amnesty by working. But there is no real \nrequirement for that.\n  To be eligible to adjust from illegal to legal status under the bill, \nthe alien\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nmust simply have been ``physically present in the United States on or \nbefore the date that is 5 years before April 5, 2006,'' and have been \nemployed ``in the aggregate'' for ``at least 3 years during the 5-year \nperiod ending on April 5, 2006,'' and employed for ``at least 6 years \nafter the date of enactment'' of this bill.\n  But it does not say--on pages 346, 347--that the alien must be \nemployed continuously or that the requirement of employment be full-\ntime employment.\n  The bill will be interpreted to allow the alien to be eligible if \nthey have been employed in the United States either full time, part \ntime, seasonally, or self-employed. It also allows the time of \nemployment to be shortened if the alien is in attendance at a school or \nis under 20 years of age.\n  The employment requirement under the language as written is as broad \nas possible. Essentially, any alien who worked in the United States for \n3 out of 5 years at any time prior to April 5, 2006, will fulfill these \nrequirements. This is not any kind of rigorous standard. It is designed \nto let everybody qualify. It is so broad that if the Immigration \nService were to try to go to court and challenge it, almost any alien \nwould be able to meet and defeat the challenge and be able to have a \njudge--who is required to enforce the law as we write it--not enforce \nthat law.\n  Loophole No. 7: The bill tells the Department of Homeland Security to \naccept ``just and reasonable inferences'' from day labor centers and \nthe alien's ``sworn declaration'' as evidence that the alien has met \nthe amnesty's work requirement.\n  Under the bill, the alien would meet the ``burden of proving by a \npreponderance of the evidence''--that is all the burden is, a \npreponderance of the evidence--``that [he] has satisfied the [work] \nrequirements'' if the alien can demonstrate employment ``as a matter of \njust and reasonable inference.''\n  An alien can present ``conclusive evidence'' of employment in the \nUnited States by presenting documents from Social Security, the \nInternal Revenue Service, employers, or a ``union or day labor \ncenter.''\n  The bill then states:\n\n       [I]t is the intent of Congress that the [work] requirement \n     . . . be interpreted and implemented in a manner that \n     recognizes and takes into account the difficulties \n     encountered by aliens in obtaining evidence of employment due \n     to the undocumented status of the alien.\n\n  What does that mean? It means it is unenforceable, if you want to \nknow the truth. I was a prosecutor for 15 years, a Federal prosecutor. \nHow are you going to enforce the language? What kind of prosecutor is \ngoing to go to court when the Congress has basically said: ``It is our \npolicy that anything goes. Any documents they present, any inference \nthat is raised would be sufficient to allow this to occur?''\n  Then it goes on to say that even if the lax standards I mentioned \ncannot be met, in order to make sure everybody meets the standard of \nbeing allowed to work here, it allows them to self-submit affidavits, \n``sworn declarations for each period of employment.''\n  The invitation for fraud cannot be clearer. Congress is telling the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to take the illegal aliens' word for \nit, to accept pretty much anything as proof of work.\n  These provisions are all contained on pages 349 and 350. If we want \nto make sure the fraud that occurred in the 1986 amnesty does not occur \nagain in the 2006 amnesty, these loopholes have to be closed. Why do we \nhave these standards? Because politicians want to say that everybody \nhere are workers, and we are not going to give amnesty to people who \nare not workers. OK. That sounds good. But when you read the bill, it \ndoes not require that. There is no way this can be enforced. And the \nauthors of the legislation know it. They know it cannot be enforced. \nThat is why they wrote it the way they wrote it, to let everybody \nqualify. So it is not true that this is a bill that requires earned \namnesty by work. It does not.\n  Loophole 8: The bill benefits only those who broke the law and not \nthose who followed it and got work visas to come to the United States \nor those who left when their visas expired.\n  I want you to understand this, colleagues. It is important to point \nout the unfairness that is inherent in the bill. Page 346 lays out the \nrequirement that you must have been ``not legally present in the United \nStates on April 5, 2001.'' So to qualify for the benefits here, you had \nto be illegally present in the United States on April 5, 2001. Illegal \npresence allows people to qualify for the amnesty and the pathway to \ncitizenship that the amnesty provides.\n  The bill goes on to define ``not . . . legally present'' to include \nvisa overstays--an ``alien who has violated any conditions of his or \nher visa''--making sure that illegal alien visa overstays qualify for \namnesty.\n  So if you were here legally on April 5, 2001, meaning you followed \nthe rules, and you got a work visa to come here, you will not get any \nbenefits from this amnesty. If you had a visa in 2001, but it expired \nbefore April 5, and you, therefore, followed the law and left the \nUnited States before April 5, you will not get the benefit of this \namnesty. This amnesty benefits you only if you did not leave the United \nStates, as the visa required, and you stayed here illegally or you came \nhere illegally.\n  Another loophole, No. 9, deals with this guest worker concept. The \nbill's future flow ``guest worker'' program in title IV of the \nlegislation leaves no illegal alien behind. It is not limited to the \npeople outside the United States who want to come here to work in the \nfuture, but includes illegal aliens currently present in the United \nStates who do not qualify for the amnesty programs in title VI, \nincluding aliens here for less than 2 years.\n  Now, we are told if you have been here for less than 2 years--you \ncame since we started talking about this legislation in 2004--that you \ndo not qualify for the benefits of the program, and have to go home. \nThat has been part of the mantra. You have heard that debate: If you \nhave been here for less than 2 years--and the reason for that is, We \nare giving notice to people around the world who might want to come \nhere: Don't rush into our country while we are considering this \namnesty, to take advantage of it, because if you come in after we \nstarted discussing it, then you are not going to get the benefits of \nit--a fairly legitimate approach to things, I would suggest. And we are \ntold the legislation does that. But it does not do that, I have to tell \nyou.\n  Under the language, you can qualify for the new H-2C program to work \nas a low-skilled, permanent immigrant even if you are unlawfully \npresent in the United States today. The bill specifically says:\n\n       In determining the alien's admissibility as an H-2C \n     nonimmigrant . . . paragraphs (5), (6)(A), 7, (9)(B), and \n     (9)(C) of section 212(a) may be waived for conduct that \n     occurred before the effective date. . . .\n\n  By waiving these grounds of inadmissibility, the new H-2C program is \nspecifically intended, I submit, to apply to, No. 1, absconders--those \nare people who were apprehended, ordered to leave the country or \nordered to come to court, and they have skipped and did not leave and \ndid not come to court; 400,000 of those we are trying to find this very \nday to deport them to enforce the law--No. 2, it applies to illegal \naliens who were in removal proceedings and signed a voluntary departure \nagreement but violated that agreement and did not leave, and, No. 3, it \napplies illegal aliens who were already removed from the United States \nbut who illegally reentered.\n  The bill covers everybody. No illegal alien will be left behind. No \nillegal alien will have to go home--not this 2-year group, as has been \nsaid. So once again, the rhetoric about the legislation does not match \nthe reality.\n  Loophole No. 10: The annual numerical cap on this program is \ncompletely artificial. The bill's sponsors say that the new H-2C guest \nworker program is limited to 325,000 people and their families per \nyear.\n  However, the cap has a built-in automatic escalator. If the 325,000 \nlimit per year--the cap on the number who can come here legally--is \nreached, the cap automatically adjusts itself to make more room, by \nadding an additional 20 percent, which is 65,000 more visas the first \nyear. So if somewhere in the year the cap limits are being met by \npeople who want to come here, that very year the cap goes up by 20 \npercent. And then, the next year, automatically the cap will not be \n325,000, it will be that number increased by 20-percent. And if that \ncap number is met, it goes up that\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\nyear 20 percent. And the next year, that additional 20-percent increase \nwill be the cap.\n  It is an utterly escalating cap, without any thought whatsoever as to \nhow many people this country needs in our workplace or otherwise in the \nNation. They can be readily assimilated and made a part of this \nglorious and wonderful country. What kind of language is that?\n  We calculate if this cap is reached each year, the number of people \nallowed under this one program to enter this country legally, 10 years \nfrom passage--hold your hat--would be 2,012,314. I am not kidding. That \nis an automatic provision in the act. We have given no thought, no \nserious evaluation, whatsoever, to how many people ought to be brought \ninto this country.\n  And even if the cap never increases and stays at the 325,000 per \nyear, we will have a minimum of 1,950,000--almost 2 million--low-\nskilled workers who are permanent immigrants in the first 6 years of \nthe program, which is the length of an H-2C visa if the individual does \nnot file for a green card.\n  In 10 years, we will have immigrated 3,250,000 low-skilled workers \nand their families. Understand, each and every one of these 3 million \npeople who would enter under this provision alone--and there are others \nwhere the impact is large--all of these workers will be eligible for \ngreen cards.\n  What does that mean? A green card means you are a permanent resident. \nThey say these are temporary workers and guest workers. Within the \nfirst year, they can obtain a green card if their employer requests it. \nAfter 4 years, if their employer doesn't and they don't have an \nemployer, they can self-petition for a green card. This is a big change \nin our policy since immigrants under this provision were supposed to be \nworkers and it allows them to petition for a greencard even thought \nthey are not working for anybody. They can self-petition under this \nbill. That is a big change. This is pretty thunderous in its impact.\n  Loophole No. 11, a new H-2C guest worker does not have to prove they \nare essential to the economy to come to the United States or to stay or \nto apply for a green card once they are here. Nothing about the H-2C \n``temporary guest worker program'' is temporary. They can say it is \ntemporary until they are blue in the face, and it is just not so. That \nis why we need to be talking about this legislation. To be eligible for \nan H-2C visa, an alien merely has to establish that they are ``capable \nof performing the labor or services'' they have an intent to perform in \nthe United States. So page 250 of the bill only makes them prove they \nare capable of performing a labor they have an intent to perform when \nthey come here, and they have received a job offer from an employer who \nhas complied with the requirements.\n  To stay in the United States once they enter, the H-2C holder simply \ncannot be ``unemployed for 60 or more consecutive days.'' If they are \nunemployed for that period of time, they are supposed to leave. Such a \nrequirement, of course, is absolutely and utterly unenforceable. Who is \ngoing to be checking on this? They will say: It is not enforceable. If \na guest worker is out of work for 60 days, 2 months, it is obvious that \nthe economy does not depend on them. The fact that H-2C status only \nterminates after 60 consecutive days of unemployment means an alien is \nstill essential to the economy and able to stay in the United States if \nthey are working for as little as 1 or 2 days every 2 months. That is \nwhat it means. If somebody has to try to enforce this law, that is the \nkind of thing they would be dealing with when they go to court.\n  More importantly, no Government entity is going to spend their time \nsearching over the country to determine if aliens have been out of work \nfor 55 or 65 consecutive days, because the bill allows the alien worker \nto move from employer to employer and then, as noted on page 263, \nspecifically exempts employers from having to notify the Department of \nHomeland Security when the alien is fired or voluntarily quits. This \nwill ensure that the Government will never have the information it \nneeds to enforce the 60-day requirement. Employers are not required to \nnotify. If they bring in somebody, they certify they need them to work, \nthey have them work for 6 months, they no longer need them and lay them \noff, there is no requirement that they notify the Department of \nHomeland Security or Labor or Commerce that they are no longer needed.\n  The bill contains, more importantly, no economic trigger enabling us \nto send workers home when the economy dips. This has been a matter of \nsome dispute. I hear it asked by Senators. I have been asked several \ntimes. Some have stated publicly to the contrary. We have read the \nbill. This is what the bill says about the economy. What if we go into \na recession and have brought in these 3 million workers. Now we have 40 \nmillion workers in the next 3 or 4 years, 5 years, 8 years, and we go \ninto a recession. They are temporary workers. What is the deal? They go \nhome? Do we not use those workers? We don't need them any longer and \nthey have to go home? No, there is no trigger that reduces the number \nof workers here if the economy goes into recession. It is not in this \nlegislation. There is an automatic increase every year, as I noted, if \nthe applicants reach that level. It can go up to as much as 3 million a \nyear, but there is no way to reduce it unless we pass a bill in \nCongress.\n  More importantly, once the H-2C worker is in the United States, they \nwill be here permanently. On day one, when the alien begins to work in \nthe United States, their employer can sponsor them for a green card. If \nthey come here under this program, the employer can sponsor them for a \ngreen card that first day. That means 5 years later, they can be a \ncitizen entitled to all the benefits. As a green card holder, they are \nentitled to bring their wife and children immediately. Five years \nlater, they can become a citizen. Five years later, the wife can become \na citizen. Do you know what the wife can do then? She can bring her \nchildren in as a green card holder. He can bring in his brothers and \nsisters, and she can bring in her brothers and sisters, once they \nbecome a citizen under the chain migration rules. It has tremendous \nimplications for us.\n  Those are matters that are very important. I have a couple more \npoints. I see my distinguished colleague from West Virginia. I think I \ncan wrap up in about 3 or 4 minutes, if that is OK with him.\n  I would also say, I am honored to have worked with Senator Byrd, the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, former Democratic leader and \nmajority leader of the Senate, on a realistic approach to immigration. \nI asked, are we able to enforce our borders, are we able to do things \ntogether. We had Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Senator Byrd of West \nVirginia, both Democrats. We worked together. We presented some very \ngood proposals. Not enough of them have been accepted and made part of \nthis legislation, unfortunately. But there is a genuine bipartisan \nconcern here that we are moving too fast and getting the cart before \nthe horse in a lot of different ways.\n  Loophole No. 12, a work requirement for a blue card can be satisfied \nin a matter of hours, under the AgJOBS portion that was added in \ncommittee with about 30 minutes of debate. Under the AgJOBS component \nof this substitute bill, illegal alien agricultural workers who worked \n150 workdays in agriculture over the last 2 years will receive a blue \ncard allowing them to live and work permanently in the United States. \nLet's get that straight. We keep talking about the guest worker \nprogram, the seasonal worker program. Why we don't have that in the \nbill, I can't understand. Almost every provision puts people on the \nroute to permanent citizenship.\n\n  So under the AgJOBS portion that was adopted in committee without \ndebate, agricultural workers who have worked 150 workdays--that is not \na full day--over the last 2 years, less than half time, will receive a \nblue card, and that will allow them to live and work permanently in the \nUnited States. However, because current law defines an agricultural \nworkday as 1 hour of work per day--that definition is reinstated in the \nbill on page 397--an alien who has worked for as little as 150 hours in \nagriculture over the last 2 years will qualify for a blue card.\n\n       Loophole No. 13: Once an illegal alien worker receives a \n     blue card, the blue card never expires. Blue cards, the new \n     category of cards given to aliens who are amnestied under the \n     AgJOBS provision of this bill,\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\n     never expire. The blue card holder can choose to pursue a \n     green card, legal permanent resident status, by working for \n     more hours in agriculture, but that is not a requirement to \n     stay in the United States.\n\n  Page 399 specifically states:\n\n       An alien in blue card status shall be provided an \n     employment authorized endorsement or other appropriate work \n     permit, in the same manner as an alien lawfully admitted for \n     permanent residence.\n\n  This means that once the illegal alien has a blue card, he or she can \nlive in the United States and work in any job permanently. They can \nadjust to a green card status and move on the path of citizenship, \nbringing in their aging parents and have them receive the great \nbenefits of health care in America.\n  Loophole No. 14, free legal counsel: The AgJOBS amendment goes as far \nas to provide free legal counsel to illegal aliens who want to receive \namnesty, page 421. In a paragraph entitled ``eligibility for legal \nservices,'' the bill lays out that recipients of funds under the Legal \nServices Corporation Act can ``provide legal assistance directly \nrelated to an application for adjustment of status under this \nsection.'' So not only will AgJOBS give amnesty to 1.5 million illegal \naliens, it would have the American taxpayer pay the legal bills for \nfilling out the applications of those 1 million illegal aliens.\n  Finally, I will mention loophole No. 15. There are a lot of other \nprovisions that concern me. I will only mention 15. It deals with the \nDREAM Act. The bill makes in-State tuition and other higher education \nbenefits available to illegal aliens. Current law, some years ago, was \npassed to deal with a perceived abuse in the system.\n  So the current law that is in effect today says:\n\n       [A]n alien who is not lawfully present in the United States \n     shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a \n     State (or a political subdivision) for any posteducation \n     benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is \n     eligible for such a benefit (in no less an amount, duration, \n     and scope) without regard to whether the citizen or national \n     is such a resident.\n\n  The DREAM Act portion of this bill, page 503 through 520, eliminates \nthis provision and will allows a benefit to those who came here \nillegally even when all United States citizens are not afforded those \nsame privileges. The bill goes further making other types of higher \neducation assistance available through the illegal aliens that receive \namnesty under the bill, student loans, Federal work study programs and \nFederal services to access this assistance.\n  One of the first things you want to do if you want to reduce illegal \nimmigration is not provide benefits to people who come illegally. How \nmuch more commonsensical can it get than that? You don't provide \ninducements, generous social benefits that we would like to provide to \nmore people in the country but can't, to people who come here \nillegally. That does not make sense and it is not a principled \nposition.\n  I will conclude by saying, I urge my colleagues, with the greatest \nsincerity, to look at this legislation and to think about these \nloopholes I have mentioned. While they are very real and evidence an \nintent by whoever drafted the legislation to go far beyond what they \nare publicly saying the bill does, read it carefully and make sure that \nyou feel comfortable supporting it. When amendments come up, we will \nfix some of these things, although there will not be sufficient time in \nthe debate or sufficient amendments allowed to fix all the problems. \nThey need to vote for those amendments to make the bill better. More \nimportantly, we have continued to study the legislation. My concerns \nhave deepened that we have an unprincipled, not well thought out policy \nfor future immigration that increases legal immigration to an \nextraordinary degree, far beyond what those people think is part of \nthis legislation.\n  It is permanent and it allows those who are outside our Nation to \ndecide when they come. It is similar to an entitlement. If you are a \nveteran, you walk up and you get your entitled benefit. If 10 times as \nmany people showed up for that benefit as we expected, all of them get \nthat benefit--American citizens, veterans. That is an entitlement.\n  In this legislation, we basically create an entitlement to let people \nwho are noncitizens of the country decide how many are going to come \nin, without this Nation making those decisions. Canada has a point \nsystem. They limit immigration, and they review it based on what their \nneeds are. The more the immigrant has qualities and education and \ntraining that meet what they need, the better chance they have of \nentering. If you don't have qualifications and abilities that are \nrelevant to Canada's needs, you don't get in. Our bill does none of \nthat. I urge my colleagues to be more focused on the actual wording of \nthe legislation.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for showing leadership and \nrecognizing that we need to do better in this legislation on \nimmigration.\n  I suspect that the Senator from West Virginia might talk about \nMother's Day. I have had the honor to be in the chair--and I see \nSenator Isakson--when Senator Byrd in previous years has spoken about \nhis mother on Mother's Day. I think we are all in for a treat.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4514-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4514-S4515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MOTHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished and able friend \nfrom Alabama. I thank him for his reference to Mother's Day. I do \nindeed have some remarks that I want to make in reference to Mother's \nDay.\n  Mr. President, the irises are blooming, their beauty as refined as a \nJapanese print. Roses are spilling their sweet perfume into the air. A \nbountiful harvest of sweet, red strawberries is making its way into \npies and shortcakes. The phones are busy at the florists around the \ncountry. The signs are clear that this coming Sunday the Nation will \nagain observe the annual celebration of that great day, Mother's Day. \nMother's Day is beloved by florists, by candy makers, by greeting card \nproducers, by phone companies, and by restaurants, for it is a busy day \nindeed for them. But the day is also beloved by mothers, for it is on \nthis one day, more than any other day, that they receive credit for \ntheir favorite and most important job. This coming Sunday, mothers will \nbe showered with affection, waited upon, called upon, and honored. They \ndeserve all of it, every bit of it.\n\n     It is the little things that count\n     And give a mother pleasure--\n     The things her children bring to her\n     Which they so richly treasure . . .\n     The picture that is smudged a bit\n     With tiny fingerprints,\n     The colored rock, the lightning bugs,\n     The sticky peppermints;\n     The ragged, bright bouquet of flowers\n     A child brings, roots and all--\n     These things delight a mother's heart\n     Although they seem quite small.\n     A mother can see beauty\n     In the very smallest thing\n     For there's a little bit of heaven\n     In a small child's offering.\n\n  A mother stays with you throughout your life. Her words and her \nactions resonate. Yes, we can hear her voice echoing across time when \nwe repeat to our children the lessons that mother taught us: ``Sit up \nstraight,'' ``use your napkin,'' ``stop fidgeting and pay attention,'' \nDo you remember? She said those things to us. ``Say thank you,'' and \n``if everyone else jumped off a cliff, would you jump, too?''\n  Every mother molds and shapes her children in ways large and small, \nfrom lessons as important as treating others with thoughtfulness and \ncourtesy to tasks as small as how to fold laundry. Years later, as we \nteach our own children to fold laundry, we might smile to recall that \nit was our mother--your mother--who taught us how to fold a shirt in a \nparticular way. It is also probable that she was teaching you to fold \nit in the same way her mother had taught her--that is the way it is, \nyou know--just as her mother taught her courtesy and just as she taught \nyou. Those gentle hands carried the ingrained lessons of many \ngenerations, lessons honed and reinforced over many generations.\n  On Mother's Day, when we honor mothers all across the Nation, we also \nhonor grandmothers and great-grandmothers, whether or not we were \nfortunate enough to have known them in life. ``Children and mothers \nnever truly part, bound in the beating of each other's heart.'' So \nwrote Charlotte Gray, and her words speak to the heritable nature of a \nmother's love. A mother's love. It passes through the generations like \nour own DNA.\n  Mothers also model efficiency. Mothers were the earliest adopters of\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\n``multitasking,'' long before such a phrase had even been coined. \nModern appliances make mothers even more efficient, simultaneously \nwashing and drying clothes while cleaning the house, making dinner, \nkeeping up with the news, and monitoring their children's homework. In \ntoday's busy world, working mothers must master such multitasking, and \nmany do it with amazing dexterity, juggling work and family and all of \ntheir children's outside activities with all of the skill of a circus \nact. You know how it goes. Mothers are also the lifeblood of many \nactivities important to their children, from scouting to athletics, \nparent-teacher associations to Sunday school, music lessons to swim \nteams. The phrase ``soccer mom''--have you heard that phrase? It \naccurately reflects a wide swath of American culture.\n  And still mothers find time to nurture, to cuddle, to listen, to \nheal, and to teach. Henry Ward Beecher observed that ``the mother's \nheart is the child's schoolroom.'' Think about that. This is surely \ntrue, for with every action, every look, every word, be they soft and \nloving or briskly authoritative, mothers teach their children.\n  Their influence upon the world is incalculable. George Washington, \nthe first President of our great country, that great general who fought \nat Valley Forge, said:\n\n       My mother was the most beautiful woman I ever saw. All I am \n     I owe to my mother. I attribute all my success in life to the \n     moral, intellectual and physical education I received from \n     her.\n\n  Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n       I remember my mother's prayers and they have always \n     followed me. They have clung to me all my life.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       All that I am, or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.\n\n  Andrew Jackson noted about his mother:\n\n       There was never a woman like her. She was gentle as a dove \n     and brave as a lioness. . . . The memory of my mother and her \n     teachings were, after all, the only capital I had to start \n     life with, and on that capital I have made my way.\n\n  Booker T. Washington. Let's hear what he said. He said:\n\n       In all my efforts to learn to read, my mother shared fully \n     my ambition and sympathized with me and aided me in every way \n     that she could. If I have done anything in life worth \n     attention, I feel sure that I inherited the disposition from \n     my mother.\n\n  The leaders of our future are being molded and shaped right now by \ntheir mothers. It is hard to imagine that those small faces being wiped \nclean by their mother's hand might someday smile at us from the Oval \nOffice, or that those chubby fingers might someday operate dangerous \nmachinery. But that childish confidence is fostered by their mother's \nlove, urged on by her unwavering support, and raised up by her tender \nsympathy. Their mother's support will give them the wings to fly high \nand to achieve great success.\n\n  I am sure that these future leaders will someday echo the words of \nWashington, Lincoln, and Jackson in crediting their mothers for their \nsuccess--their angel mothers.\n  I have no recollections of my mother. She died on Armistice Day 1918. \nShe told the faithful couple who raised me: Take the baby--I was a \nbaby--and three older brothers and a sister. Take the baby. Keep him as \nyour own. And she went away. I am sure that her prayers have followed \nme and that today she looks down from Heaven waiting. I don't remember \nseeing her in this life, but I shall have the opportunity to see her \nsomeday.\n  Every child deserves a mother worthy of such sentiments. And as a \nnation, we are fortunate to possess so many wonderful mothers.\n  There is a poem called ``Mother's Love'' that I would like to recite \nat this moment. ``Mother's Love\":\n\n     Her love is like an island\n     In life's ocean, vast and wide;\n     A peaceful, quiet shelter\n     From the wind, the rain, the tide.\n     'Tis bound on the north by Hope,\n     By Patience on the West,\n     By tender counsel on the South,\n     And on the East by Rest.\n     Above it like a beacon light\n     Shine Faith, and Truth, and Prayer;\n     And thro' the changing scenes in life\n     I find a haven there.\n\n  Mr. President, my own dear mother waits for me.\n  I would like to reflect on this great old poem, ``Rock Me To Sleep,'' \nand I dedicate it--it is not my poem, but it is the one I love--I \ndedicate it to my dear wife Erma, who was a wonderful mother to her \nchildren, and to all the mothers throughout this broad land. Let us \nthink of them. They thought of us. They rocked us. They gave us \ncomfort. They nurtured us. Think of them, the mothers of America.\n\n\n     Backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight,\n     Make me a child again just for to-night!\n     Mother, come back from the echoless shore,\n     Take me again to your heart as of yore;\n     Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,\n     Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;\n     Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Backward, flow backward, oh, tide of the years\n     I am so weary of toil and of tears--\n     Toil without recompense, tears all in vain--\n     Take them, and give me my childhood again!\n     I have grown weary of dust and decay--\n     Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away,\n     Weary of sowing for others to reap;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,\n     Mother, O Mother, my heart calls for you!\n     Many a summer the grass has grown green,\n     Blossomed and faded, our faces between:\n     Yet, with strong yearning and passionate pain,\n     Long I to-night for your presence again.\n     Come from the silence so long and so deep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Over my heart in the days that are flown,\n     No love like mother--love ever has shown;\n     No other worship abides and endures--\n     Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours:\n     None like a mother can charm away pain\n     From the sick soul and the world-weary brain.\n     Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,\n     Fall on your shoulders again as of old;\n     Let it drop over my forehead to-night,\n     Shading my faint eyes away from the light;\n     For with its sunny-edged shadows once more\n     Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore;\n     Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep:--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Mother, dear Mother, the years have been long\n     Since I last listened your lullaby song:\n     Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem\n     Womanhood's years have been only a dream.\n     Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,\n     With your light lashes just sweeping my face,\n     Never hereafter to wake or to weep;\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Friday, May 5, at the invitation of \nSenator Landrieu, I went down to New Orleans, LA, for a second trip to \nthe State since the hurricane. I wanted to have a chance to be able to \nget around the city, meet with people, and measure the recovery effort \nup close and personally now that we are 8\\1/2\\ months since Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  Let me, first of all, express my gratitude to Senator Landrieu who \nhas been tireless, as I know Senator Vitter has. They both have been \npushing hard for their State, as they ought to. But I particularly want \nto thank Senator Landrieu who spent the day with me and who, together \nwith me, sat through a small business roundtable with a great many \nsmall businesspeople in New Orleans who were struggling to make things \nwork in the aftermath of the hurricane.\n  She took me around New Orleans East, and we drove through on the \ninterstate, able to see on both sides of the interstate the still-\ncurrent state of abandonment of so much of the city. The statistics \nsomehow don't really convey what is happening there and what is not \nhappening there.\n  I know Washington is a tough place to make anything mean anything \nright now. We are caught up in an awful lot\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\nof partisanship, and there is a lot of back and forth and not a whole \nlot that is going on legislatively as a consequence of that, though we \nall hope there is going to be a breakthrough on the immigration bill in \nthe next days. But I have to tell my colleagues that somehow we have to \nfind a way to break through on the reality of what is happening to a \nwhole bunch of folks down in New Orleans and on the gulf coast, whose \nlives have been disrupted, who have all the hope in the world of being \nable to return to their homes but increasingly are finding a lagging \neffort and a bureaucracy and other kinds of problems standing in their \nway. That has a huge cost--a huge cost. Before Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita, Louisiana had 86,000 small businesses, employing more than \n850,000 people and contributing $22 billion to the local economy. Of \nthose 86,000 small businesses, 71,000 were in the disaster zones, and \nnearly 20,000 were catastrophically destroyed. More than 365,000 \nresidents were left homeless. But those statistics 8\\1/2\\ months later \ndo not tell the story of New Orleans.\n\n  I thought I was going to go down there and I was going to see this \nincredible burst of energy of the cleanup, unbelievable numbers of \nfolks out in the streets loading trucks and moving debris and doing \nthings. But instead what I saw in New Orleans East and, most \nimportantly, what I heard from people who are there struggling to make \nends meet, to make this work, stunned me as to how little organized, \nfundamental activity is still taking place 8\\1/2\\ months after New \nOrleans was devastated.\n  When I went to New Orleans the first time in the immediate days after \nthe hurricane, I saw a region that was damaged by a storm but at that \npoint in time still very strong in spirit. I saw people determined to \nturn things around and to make it work. I talked to people who proved \ntheir resilience and their love of their State when they committed \nthemselves to not just not giving up, but to not leaving, to rebuilding \ntheir homes and their businesses. On that trip I met people who felt \nthat if the words of the Federal Government and the State and the city \nwere, in fact, followed through on, they had hope for the future.\n  On this trip that I just made a week ago, I met with small business \nCEOs. I met with people who have spent a lifetime there who are \nbeginning to feel a kind of despair about the lack of presence of real \nleadership that is changing their lives for the better. As I went down \nstreets, I saw street after street after street filled with debris, \ngarbage bags just out in the streets, cars with the word ``tow'' on \nthem waiting to be towed. Eight and a half months later, we can't tow \ncars.\n  Where were the trucks lined up with people loading them up with the \ndebris being taken out? I expected to see a backed-up line of trucks \nwith an enormous burst of energy. No such thing.\n  I met people in New Orleans who are increasingly afraid, angry, and \ndisillusioned. I was reminded by small business owners and homeowners \nlast week that New Orleans doesn't only have a hurricane problem, New \nOrleans has a levee problem. And the levee problem is more than just a \nproblem of the levees that broke, it is an overall levee problem. And \nif that levee problem were addressed with the speed--I know there are \nsome who say, well, we just allocated additional money and this and \nthat. I tell you, we are building bases in Iraq a lot faster than we \nare rebuilding New Orleans, and we are putting more energy into saying \nwe will stay the course there than we are staying the course in New \nOrleans.\n  Too little has been done in any kind of rapid fashion to help deal \nwith those levees with respect to the hurricane season that starts in \njust a few weeks. I left New Orleans convinced that the gulf coast \ndoesn't have a morale problem, but I will tell you what: Washington and \nthe community there have a leadership problem, and it is up to us to \nchange it before it is too late. I want to explain that.\n  We all understand the response immediately after Hurricane Katrina, \nand there is a lot on the record about who did what, and so forth. I \ndon't want to go back to that. That is not what this is about. But what \nis most distressing to me is that after that lesson was supposed to \nhave been learned, the people I met in New Orleans told me they were \nfed up with empty promises that have followed the initial shock of what \nhappened at the Superdome. They believe the promises have been broken \nand more mistakes have been made after they had been promised that \nmistakes weren't going to be repeated.\n  What I heard from people on a very personal level is that schools are \novercrowded, that parents are struggling to hold on because they want \nto stay there, but they don't know if they can. There is an enormous \npersonal anxiety that takes a toll day after day after day as people \nare living like that.\n  One of the businesses I visited is a linen and laundry business that \nused to take care of all of the hospitals in the region. Well, now \nthere is only one trauma center open. They are paying more employees \nthan there is work because they want to try to keep the employees \nthere, but the CEO just left last week. He took his family and left New \nOrleans. Gone because they don't see the revitalization taking place \nthat they need.\n  Across the way from that particular business was another business: \nTommy's Seafood. He has been there a long time. He bought a new \nbuilding. The new building was mortgaged. The new building was hurt, \ndamaged in the winds. So he gets the insurance check, but guess what. \nThe insurance check is made out to the bank. So the bank gets the money \nand the building still has to be fixed.\n  That is not what we intended in the U.S. Congress. That is not what \ndisaster assistance is supposed to do in a smart way. There are all \nkinds of examples like this where people are waiting for SBA loans, \ntrying to get the loans. They can't get the loans. More loans have been \ndenied than have been granted. Out of $9 billion--the administration \nsays: Well, we have given $9 billion in loans. Guess what. Only $1 \nbillion of that $9 billion has actually gone out to people.\n  On September 15, the President spoke to the Nation from Jackson \nSquare, and he made a series of promises. Here is what he said:\n\n       Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what \n     it takes. We will stay as long as it takes to help citizens \n     rebuild their communities and their lives. When the streets \n     are rebuilt, there should be many new businesses, including \n     minority-owned businesses, along those streets. When the \n     houses are rebuilt, more families should own, not rent, those \n     houses. When the regional economy revives, local people \n     should be prepared for the jobs being created.\n\n  Over 8 months later--over 8 months later--history is repeating \nitself. Too little has been provided in real response, and a lot of \ntime has been wasted without real solutions for getting the gulf coast \nback to business. Eight months after the President stood in Jackson \nSquare, there aren't trucks massively lined up, hauling this debris out \nof the city and garbage out of the city. In fact, there seems to be \nvery little activity from the Federal Government.\n  I know the President has been down there 12 times. That is what they \nwill tell you very quickly. They will tell you about the amount of aid \nthat has flowed into the region. We will talk about that in a minute. \nThe fact is, the piles of debris that remain standing before every \nbuilding are an unbelievable reminder of the devastation to people, but \nthey also stand as a blockade, as a barrier to the ability of \nbusinesses to get going, to the ability of people to be able to come \nback and figure out what they are doing with their homes. The more they \nsee that, the more a homeowner sees that kind of debris just stuck \nthere, the more they begin to say: This ``ain't'' happening. I am out \nof here. I am out of here.\n\n  Local officials told me they have fears that mosquitoes and rodents \nare carrying diseases as a result of the piles of garbage on the \nstreets. In the richest country on the face of the Earth, we shouldn't \nhave Americans abandoned to the worry that their children are going to \nbe at risk for Third World health problems because Washington didn't \nmeet its most basic obligations to those citizens. More than $10 \nbillion in contracts have been awarded for debris removal, emergency \nresponse, and reconstruction efforts, but where is it? Tens of \nthousands of abandoned cars are still littering different streets. \nThere is garbage, hurricane debris, trash in front of virtually every \nhome or business that I saw. Most of those homes are abandoned still, \nobviously.\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\n  Katrina pulled back the curtain, and it revealed poverty and squalor \nthat many didn't believe could exist in our country. But 8 months \nlater, after people said no more and never again, and the cameras went \naway to a large degree, those images are still there on the streets of \nNew Orleans.\n  I don't know any Americans who remember what they saw in the \nSuperdome who feel that their dues have been totally paid by making a \none-time contribution to the Red Cross. And in the same way, when you \nlook at what the Federal Government response is, people in New Orleans \nare left wondering whether we have come to a different conclusion.\n  Eight months after the President promised the revitalization of new, \nsmall, minority-owned businesses, the businesspeople who have shown \ngreat courage staying in New Orleans are literally fighting to keep \ntheir doors open in the face of such a slow and woefully inadequate \nFederal response. Orleans Parish, which is the center of Louisiana's \neconomy, had 12,695 small businesses employing 245,000 people before \nAugust 29 of last year. Today, it is estimated that only a little more \nthan 2,000 of the 12,600 have opened. Where is our response? Those \nbusinesses need people to sell things to and people need a place to \nlive.\n  The President seems to mean something when he speaks about staying \nthe course in Iraq, but it doesn't appear as if we are staying the \ncourse down in New Orleans, notwithstanding the money that has been \nallocated. It takes more than money. It takes a strong leader who is \nrolling up his sleeves and bringing people together and organizing all \nof these contractors and different efforts in a way that maximizes both \nthe volunteer and paid effort of the United States of America.\n  One person I spoke with confirmed what I could see with my own eyes. \nOne person said to me--this is a professional who has spent years down \nthere, whose home is there, who helped rescue people, who stayed \nthrough the whole thing, and he was rescuing people in boats blocks \naway from his house. He said: Basic services in 70 percent of the city \ndon't exist. In those areas, there is no fire protection, police \npresence is minimal, there is garbage, hurricane debris, trash in front \nof all of the homes. Billions have been spent. Yet the city is piled \nhigh with debris of every kind.\n  Those are his words. Those are his words.\n  The residents of New Orleans are beginning to put their hopes \nelsewhere. That is what is happening. Maybe some people want that to \nhappen. That is a question that ought to be asked. They are starting to \nput their future in a new place. Over 3,400 private homes are for sale \nin New Orleans, more than at any other time since we started tracking \nthis indicator 6 weeks after Katrina made landfall. This is up from \napproximately 2,800 homes that were for sale in February, and it is the \nhighest number since October of 2005.\n  Jim Funk, who is CEO of the Louisiana Restaurant Association, said \nthe pre-Katrina restaurant workforce of New Orleans has been reduced \nfrom 133,000 to 22,000. Only 1,500 of the almost 3,500 pre-Katrina \nrestaurants are back open. Of course, restaurants need people and need \nworkers. The unemployment rate of those who remain displaced jumped to \nnearly 35 percent in March, a 54-percent increase from the month \nbefore. Unemployment is up 54 percent from the month before, even \nthough we are supposed to be putting people back to work.\n\n  I met Pat Murphy, who owns United Cab. United Cab is a 66-year-old \nbusiness. He spoke at our roundtable. After wading through redtape and \nmonths of administrative delay in a process that he described as, \nquoting Pat Murphy, ``turning into harassment,'' he finally received \nhis SBA loan.\n  Why does a small business that has existed for 66 years have to go \nthrough 8\\1/2\\ months of a painful process, which they term \n``harassment,'' in order to get a loan after a disaster and come back \ninto business, from the very agency whose sole purpose is to be able to \nprovide that kind of assistance? The worst part is that Pat Murphy will \ntell you he is one of the lucky ones. He actually received a loan, and \nhe knows a whole bunch of folks who are still waiting around for that \nmoney.\n  Some may have heard that the administration brags about that $9 \nbillion of disaster loans they have approved. But as I said, only one-\nninth of that, only $1 billion, has found its way into the hands of \npeople. Why can't you deliver the checks? If you approve it, why can't \nyou make sure people get it right away? Mr. President, 11 percent of \nthe funding has actually reached the people who are asking for it. In \naddition, what is more, about half of those who applied for disaster \nloans were denied. What are they going to do? All these folks who have \nbeen denied loans have nowhere to turn.\n  If you are serious about revitalizing New Orleans, you have to be \nwilling to put that money into their hands. One of the biggest problems \nthey have is capital, being able to pay some people for a period of \ntime so they can stay. For people who need to put food on the table and \ntake care of their kids, if there is no certainty as to that \navailability of money, they are going to go somewhere. They have to go \nsomewhere. What happens is the fabric of New Orleans gets destroyed \nbecause people put down their roots somewhere else.\n  For those who have been fortunate enough to receive housing \nassistance, they are living in front of their damaged homes, many of \nthem in trailers that are sitting on concrete blocks. What is the \nproblem with that? Let me tell you what the problem is. No. 1, the \ntrailers FEMA is providing cost $70,000 a piece. They are not \npermanent.\n  Hurricane season starts in a few weeks. The National Weather Service \nis predicting 14 named storms to hit the gulf during this next \nhurricane season. I might add that they were accurate last year in the \nnumber of named storms they predicted. Do you know what is going to \nhappen when the wind hits, 90 miles an hour, 100 miles an hour or more? \nThose trailers are going to blow around, and they are going to create \nmore damage.\n  I am told by people in New Orleans you could have built modular \nhousing for less money with greater permanency. If you had been smart \nabout this, you could have set up a village of modular housing for \npeople who are working on their permanent housing, you could create \nlumber distribution centers, you could bring carpenters from around the \ncountry, plumbers, electricians. Labor unions from all around the \ncountry would be willing to donate, come down and live in a special \nvillage and then to rebuild. None of that kind of basic organization \neffort that America is supposed to be so good at--that we are so good \nat, when led--is taking place.\n  I want to know what kind of leadership spends $900 million to buy \n25,000 manufactured homes and 1,300 modular homes and they can't be \nused because FEMA rules say they are too big or unsafe in a flood zone. \nBureaucracy, lack of imagination, lack of willingness to do what it \ntakes--which is what the President said we would do in Jackson Square.\n  What type of leadership spends $249 million to secure 8,136 cruise \nship cabins for 6 months at a cost that Inspector General Richard \nSkinner estimated at $5,100 a month per passenger, six times the cost \nof renting a two- bedroom apartment?\n  Eight months after the promises were made, New Orleans has only one \nlevel 1 trauma center. The largest medical complex, Charity Hospital, \nneeds to be rebuilt, but FEMA will only fund repairs, so they are not \ngoing to rebuild, or can't yet.\n  So what do the residents of New Orleans do during the coming \nhurricane season if one of those named storms is severe? Eight months \nafter promises were made to expand local business participation in the \nrecovery, guess what, FEMA is continuing its business model of hiring \nmegacontractors to oversee the recovery efforts. Why is it that debris \nremoval contract dollars aren't making it to the local businesses? We \nhad one particular guy who has been in business for I think it was 27 \nyears. He does tree removal and tree work. He has not been used. In \nfact, he was called and told by FEMA that they are using an outside \ncontractor. He is one of the people trying to stay, and they are going \nto take his business away for somebody out of State.\n  Why are so many local contractors waiting for FEMA to pay them \nmillions of dollars for work they have already completed?\n\n[[Page S4518]]\n\n  Last Thursday, the Senate passed an emergency spending bill that \nincludes $2.2 billion for levee reconstruction in southeast Louisiana, \n$1.5 billion for Orleans Parish levee projects, and $1.3 billion for \nthe disaster loan program. Senator Landrieu and I offered--I \ncosponsored an amendment that she proposed--two amendments. One was to \nensure the SBA sends up its disaster response plan to Congress before \nJune 1, which is the start of the 2006 hurricane season; and second, to \nrequire the SBA to report to Congress monthly on the status of the \ndisaster loan program now and after future disasters.\n  Senator Landrieu, Senator Snowe, and I also cosponsored an amendment \nby Senator Vitter that declares areas hit by Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita as historically underutilized business zones--HUBZones, as we call \nthem. It makes sure, though, that small, local businesses will get \nfirst consideration for Federal contracts. This is something we have \nbeen trying to get done since last September. We put that on the floor \nof the Senate right after the hurricane, and still it has taken the \nCongress to this day to get this done.\n  But that is only part of the story. We passed bipartisan legislation \nwhich offers a more comprehensive approach to help get small businesses \nback on their feet. Let me tell you what we wanted to do. We wanted to \ngive some small businesses grants--not loans, grants--because clearly \nthose small businesses are going to need a tide-over period of time \nuntil you can get a population back that is going to begin to use them. \nIf you are serious about keeping the integrity of this city and you are \nserious about rebuilding it and allowing those citizens who have been \ntold they will have the opportunity to stay there, to stay there, you \nhave to give them some money. They can't repay the loans if they can't \ndo the business right now.\n\n  How much money have we spent in Iraq that is going to turn out to be \na grant versus what is happening down in New Orleans, to our own \ncitizens.\n  The Senate passed that legislation. I will tell you what, it has been \nblocked. It has been blocked since we passed it after Hurricane \nKatrina. There has not even been a serious effort, despite our efforts, \nSenator Snowe and mine, to try to get some sort of negotiation on it--\nnot even serious. It was dropped from the 2006 CJS conference, and now \nit is waiting for action as a freestanding bill. This legislation \nincludes essential bridge loans and the grants that would help those \nsuffering the most to be able to keep their doors open so you do \nmaintain the integrity of New Orleans.\n  The Senate has yet to take action on a bill introduced by Senator \nLandrieu which I cosponsored to follow on this other bill which has \nadditional provisions, recognizing the situation and the needs on the \nground. There is no excuse for us not making every good-faith effort \npossible, in a bipartisan way, to do what makes sense if we are going \nto keep faith with those folks and with all of our citizens, to whom \nthis sends a message.\n  I don't want to just talk about the slow response. I think we have to \nfind a way to get some urgency here. The businesses in the gulf coast \ncannot and should not have to face bureaucratic redtape and delays. \nThey will not be able to last much longer. Many of the businesses that \ndidn't have business interruption insurance are already gone. Many \nothers are on the verge of closing unless they are able to secure \nfinancial assistance in an expedited manner. These companies cannot \nsurvive on empty promises. What Louisiana and Mississippi need, \nobviously, is a level of leadership that is prepared to break through \nthe bureaucracy and come together and create the ingenuity and \ncreativity to rebuild the region.\n  There are a lot of Americans who would be prepared to volunteer time \nif you want to organize them. That could be done. You could have a \ncivilian assistance corps of experts who are willing to undergo some \nhardship for a period of time, live in tough circumstances--a tent city \nor whatever it is--to lend their expertise to helping to rebuild and do \ncertain things. There are all kinds of ways you could do more cleanup \nand more rebuilding in an expedited fashion.\n  The fact is, we saw after Katrina, when the National Guard was \nthere--I give them great credit. Under General Honore, a career soldier \nin the Army, he showed what strong leadership, what a hierarchal \norganization with clear lines of command, what a real structure could \nbring. In those areas where the National Guard did cleanup and did \nimmediate work, a great deal happened. That is what should have \ncontinued. But guess what. They have gone. I thought we were going to \nstay as long as it takes. I thought we were going to do whatever it \ntakes. Those are the words of the President. But they are gone. They \ncould be there today still doing things if we had the will.\n  New Orleans is one of the great cities of our country. It has an \namazing history, a diverse and ethnically rich population, and great \nculture. I think every American has a stake in its resurrection.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu again for inviting me there for a firsthand \nlook. I really thought I was going to see something very different. I \nknow there have been about 40 Senators or more who have gone down there \nat one point or another. They have seen a lot of this with their own \neyes. It just defies my sense of what the possibilities are in our \ncountry. With all of the unbelievable equipment we have, with all of \nthe skilled labor we have, with the volunteer spirit of our Nation, it \nis stunning to me that we are not proceeding more rapidly to do for New \nOrleans what New Orleans needs.\n  My hope is that we will pass those bills I talked about and that over \nthese next 8 months, over the next months, we can ramp up.\n  Everybody said never again. I will tell you what is happening in New \nOrleans today. The images people saw at the Superdome, of people who \nfelt abandoned, who didn't have adequate shelter, while misjudgments \nwere being made around them by those who were supposed to be \nresponsible, is actually being repeated at this very moment.\n  There is a Superdome II taking place in New Orleans today, for those \ncitizens who can't get back on their feet, who don't know what to do \nwith their property, for the 70 percent of the city that has no basic \nservices, for the people who cannot move because of the debris or the \ngarbage, the people who don't have a prayer of getting their home going \nagain or their business going again because of the lack of adequacy of \nthe housing and a clear plan that says to them with certainty that \nthere is a future. Right now, that future for a lot of folks is very \ndifficult.\n  One of the problems I heard about from a number of responsible \npeople--there were chamber folks there and other folks there--is the \nmental health issue. There are a lot of citizens who have been living \nunder an extraordinary level of stress since Hurricane Katrina. Some of \nthem have lost family members. Almost all are struggling to pay bills. \nIt is hard to think about the future. That stress takes its toll.\n  I was told how crime is rising, about how the sense of despair is \ntaking a greater toll, and how there is going to be a larger mental \nhealth problem within that region, as a consequence of the lack of \nadequacy of response and the plight in which people find themselves.\n  We can do better. I think everybody here knows we can do better.\n  We have strong leaders in this country. We have excellent generals \nand military personnel. They know how to manage. We have business \nleaders who run extraordinary companies, who understand the hierarchy \nand understand how to get things done. Clearly, FEMA doesn't, and \nclearly whatever the structure is that is there, it is inadequate to \nget the job done.\n  My hope and prayer is that we can deliver on the promises to New \nOrleans and turn this around.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4518-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4518-S4519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will be closing shortly. I take the \nopportunity before doing so to comment on two issues. One is the event \nof the last\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\nweek in terms of our health care initiatives and, second, comment on \nthe 125th anniversary of the Red Cross which is this year.\n  We have had a good week this week with a relative victory for the \nAmerican people in terms of the issue of tax relief and the tax package \nwhich left here which will create jobs. The bottom line is, a good \neconomy with 5 million jobs created in the last 30 or so months. \nUnemployment is down to 4.7 percent, which is lower than the average of \nthe 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s or the 1990s. Homeownership is doing \nwell, with minority homeownership at an alltime high.\n  We have good, solid economic growth. That is, in large part, first \nand foremost, due to the hard work, entrepreneurial spirit of the \nAmerican people, no doubt. But in terms of the policy standpoint, it is \nbecause of the progrowth tax policy put forward by President Bush that \nthis Congress has followed. Indeed, we followed it again this week in \naddressing issues surrounding tax policy on capital gains and dividends \nand keeping the alternative minimum tax from reaching out and grabbing \nanother 7 million people this year. The President will sign that bill \nnext week which will give us another opportunity to celebrate the great \nvictory for the American people.\n  Most of the time this week was spent on an issue that I feel \npassionately about, I think most people in this Senate do, the health \ncare of Americans. Without health, one cannot do very much in life. We \nneed that healthy body, that healthy mind for being able to be \nproductive.\n  We have a system today that has too many gaps in it. The greatest \nhealth care system in the world, one that I have been a beneficiary of \nin my own field of heart and lung transplantation and the treatment of \nheart disease and lung disease, but there are huge gaps in our health \ncare system today that lead to less quality, less access, higher costs, \ngaps that are so obvious that they do require action on our part.\n  This week we tried to take two of those, to keep focused on those \ntwo, and other Members want to grab all the other different challenges \nand challenging issues and pull them in. The only way to make progress \nin this Senate is to stay focused on an issue and move to the next \nissue and the next issue and pull together the very best.\n  The first issue was medical liability. We, on this side of the aisle, \nvoted to lower the cost of medicine by controlling, in some manner, the \nout-of-control litigation costs, what has become a litigation lottery--\na system today that because of medical liability premiums, because of \nfrivolous lawsuits, because of the incentives given to the trial \nlawyers out there, the more predatory trial lawyers who are out there, \npunishes expectant mothers who are delivering children by driving \nobstetricians out of county and out-of-state, causes neurosurgeons to \nno longer take trauma calls at night, closing down obstetrical wards. \nWe have to get that under control. It is apparent from debate, this \nside of the aisle voted in favor of commonsense reform and the other \nside voted against it.\n  Then we moved to the issue of expanding health care coverage for \nmillions of uninsured people in this country, focusing on the small \nbusinesses today that simply do not have the purchasing clout that \nlarger organizations have, that the big companies have. It is sad \nbecause we have small businesses that are the engine of economic growth \nin this country that operate on very small margins, that simply cannot \nafford to offer health care today but allowing them to group together \nin larger and larger groups, we have that clout to bring the costs \ndown.\n  In both of those instances, the Democrats chose to obstruct on \nmotions to proceed so we could not fully debate those issues. To me, it \nis a disappointment. It means millions of people will have access to \nhealth care that is not as affordable as it might be or they have no \naccess at all, especially those with small businesses.\n  Reforming our health care system, eliminating the gaps, getting rid \nof the waste, fraud, and abuse in our health care system today, the \nbest health care system in the world, in terms of what we can do, has \ngot to be a goal of this Senate. We as Republicans have led on that. We \ngot a majority vote in the Senate, but we were unable to reach that 60-\nvote threshold.\n  The 46 million people who do not have health insurance in this \ncountry are a major concern to me because it is such a large gap. We \nhave addressed it in the past in an incremental way with some success \nin health savings accounts, which I will come back to. The problem is \nwe have so many tangled regulations, we have complicated bureaucracies \nout there with overlapping responsibility. We have an insurance market \nthat is getting choked. A lot of it comes from excessive mandates. One \nmandate put on another, on another, on another, and if you put all the \nmandates in there, the cost of insurance for everyone goes up. Then it \nis out of reach of the small business person or the person who has a \nmodest income.\n\n  We will keep pressing forward. We on this side of the aisle, \nRepublicans, recognize that our health care system lacks some of the \nfundamental mechanisms that are required in order to get rid of the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse to make it more transparent, to make it more \nefficient. We have to be able to harness the transparency, having the \n21st century information out there in order for people to make good \ndecisions so that individuals can make more choices. We have hundreds \nof millions of health care decisions being made, all of which drive \ntoward better access and higher quality and lower cost.\n  If we look out to where we want to be going as we address medical \nliability, which is killing our system, as we address the small \nbusiness health reform, it is for a 21st century health care system \nthat is driven by that information, that is out there that is available \ntoday, that is driven by choice, it is driven by that element of \ncontrol.\n  Health care should not be a red State, blue State, Democratic, \nRepublican, liberal, conservative matter. We have to come together. We \ndid so with the health savings accounts, I mentioned few moments ago; \naccounts where an individual has a deductible plan where you can save \nfor you only, you take it with you, you control it. The decisions you \nmake have an impact, and they have been very successful. Three million \npeople today have health savings accounts. None had health savings \naccounts 3 years ago. And most of the 3 million people had no health \ninsurance in the past. So it begins to chip away at that large number \nof uninsured people in this country.\n  Another issue we have passed in this Senate in a bipartisan way is \nelectronic medical records, information technology so that we can \ndevelop a platform on which we can make good choices, transparent \nchoices, and can be held accountable. There is a communication among \nhospitals and doctors and consumers and patients which, with that \ncommunication, gets rid of all the waste. That has the obvious ability, \nthrough electronic medical records, to have seamless health care no \nmatter where people are. If you are in an accident in Kentucky and you \nare from Tennessee, your doctor at that trauma hospital can immediately \nknow something about you, what your blood type is, what your allergies \nare, what medicines you are on, by a push of a button. Now this is done \nthrough fax machines and phone calls or going to the basement for \nrecords of hospitals and clinics to retrieve information.\n  We passed that in the Senate. The House has not yet addressed that \nissue. But, again, it is another example of where this Senate can work \ntogether, as with the health savings accounts, that we can pass \nlegislation that is to the benefit of all Americans. That is real \nprogress. We can make progress.\n  I am disappointed in this week that we did not have the other side of \nthe aisle participating in these very important issues. But we will \ncontinue to address them as we move ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4519-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4519-S4520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RED CROSS ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I mentioned a second issue, and that is the \n125th anniversary of the American Red Cross. This year is 125 years of \nvoluntarism. We have seen it in our own lives, especially in the \nKatrina episode over the last year.\n  Yesterday, I had the opportunity of going in front of the Capitol. My \noffice actually looks out over the Mall, and there is a big red tent \nwith the big Red Cross on it. I have been watching that tent for the \nlast several days. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to speak to\n\n[[Page S4520]]\n\nprobably 400 or 500 volunteers who had come from around the country \nfrom their various Red Cross entities, I assume from about every State \nin the country.\n  I mention this because volunteers are the lifeblood of the American \nRed Cross. I have seen it directly in my own life, both as a doctor, as \na physician, of course, as a citizen, as well as a Senator. These \nvolunteers affected my life in a very direct way. I told them \nyesterday, as I ran the multiorgan transplant center at Vanderbilt, we \ndid heart transplants, we did lung transplants, bone marrow \ntransplants, we transplanted pancreases, we transplanted livers, \ntransplanted kidneys. None of that could take place without the Red \nCross because all of the blood that is required in terms of \ntransfusions--liver transplants especially, probably heart transplants, \nsecondly, and lung transplants, all of that blood comes from where? The \nRed Cross, from volunteers who manage the Red Cross facility and from \nthe people who actually donate their blood.\n  I would not have done all of the heart transplants I have done if it \nwere not for the Red Cross, the volunteers associated with the Red \nCross. People do not think about how much we depend on the volunteers.\n  Jump, fast forward, 15 years and go to New Orleans. About 3 days \nafter the levees broke, I was in New Orleans, more as a physician, as a \nvolunteer, than as a Senator. I was in the airport there in September \nwith evacuees who lost everything--their medicines, sometimes their \nfamily members, clothes, their home. Sitting there on the baggage \nbelts, coming in on the baggage carts, being unloaded from helicopters, \nall they needed at that point in time was someone to talk to, for the \nmost part--some needed medical help--someone to talk to and a hot meal \nto be comforted, some semblance of security, having lost everything.\n  So who was there? Who was there right up front? It was the Red Cross. \nOnce again, and almost instantaneously, shelters sprung up in \nTennessee. But Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, and Texas, of \ncourse, all opened their doors to the gulf coast evacuees.\n  By the end of that week, 675 Red Cross shelters had opened up in 23 \nStates, which was the single largest response to a natural disaster in \nRed Cross history. Remarkable. Remarkable.\n  Then, jump forward about a few months to what happened last month in \nTennessee. We had tornadoes that came right through middle Tennessee \nand all through west Tennessee about 2 or 3 weeks apart. Thousands of \nhomes were damaged. Many people lost their lives.\n  Once again, it was the Red Cross that came in and set their trucks, \nhad food cooked, talked to people, arranged for places for people to \nstay who had just lost their homes. There were tens of thousands of \nmeals served. People were taken care of. And there was mental health \ncare in terms of the devastation people felt, the depression people \nfelt. They came to that Red Cross van to be able to talk to somebody.\n  I mention those three examples because I have seen them. I saw it in \nTennessee when I was back there talking to people whose homes had been \ndestroyed. I saw it in New Orleans, 3 days after those levees broke. \nAnd I saw it for years and years and years, for 20 years of my life, \nwhen I saw it every day, working in hospitals, with that donation of \nblood.\n  It is the 125th anniversary of the Red Cross. They had a gala last \nnight. Karyn, my wife, was one of the cochairs for that gala. We were \nthere to see the generosity of people who have volunteered and also \nhave contributed. One person who was honored last night had given $9 \nmillion--one person had given $9 million--to the Red Cross.\n  It takes a lot of people working together. But all of that does \nprovide a symbol of hope and compassion and strength and endurance. It \nis going to take the continued commitment of those volunteers to \ncontinue that, so I do want to thank you, those of you who might be \nlistening who have volunteered and will volunteer for the American Red \nCross.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4520-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MOTHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, one last item, a very important statement, \nand then we will close down. But it is very important and people will \nrecognize why.\n  This Sunday, millions of families around the world will celebrate \ntheir moms. I was changing my reservations around. I know a lot of \npeople are scurrying around for reservations. I should be cooking at \nhome that day, I guess, but I am looking for an appropriate place for \nreservations, shifting it from Sunday afternoon to Sunday evening.\n  Restaurants will be packed on Sunday. Living rooms will be packed \nfull, crammed full of aunts and uncles and fidgety children.\n  Families will warmly ``remember when'' to show their moms they love \nthem. I have three boys, and they let me know all the time how much \nthey love their mom. But I don't know where all three boys are going to \nbe. They are going to be traveling all over the country today, so I am \ntrying to get them together as well--all the challenges of Mother's \nDay.\n  Mother's Day, as we all know, is the busiest long distance calling \nday of the year. It accounts for more than one-fifth of all the floral \npurchases made for the holidays that 1 day.\n  We typically start the day by going to church and then gathering \neither in the afternoon or the evening--a tradition that millions and \nmillions and millions of people will celebrate and have celebrated over \nthe years.\n  The celebrations of our moms have gone back millennia. The ancient \nGreeks celebrated a holiday in honor of a mythological mother of gods. \nAncient Romans celebrated their mother goddess symbol. In the British \nIsles and Celtic Europe, the people honored the goddess Brigid in a \nspring celebration of motherhood.\n  Mother's Day in America got its start in West Virginia in 1858, led \nby Anna Reeves Jarvis, a local schoolteacher. After years of strenuous \npetitioning, Mother's Day finally became an official American holiday \nin 1914. It was passed by the U.S. Congress as a joint resolution and \nsigned by President Woodrow Wilson.\n  Today, 90 years later, Mother's Day is celebrated all over the \nworld--all over the world--including Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, \nAustralia, and Belgium.\n  It is celebrated by the humble and by the proud throughout the ages \nand across continents.\n  Abraham Lincoln said of his mom:\n\n       All that I am, or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.\n\n  Human nature does bind us to our mothers. The Bible instructs us to \nrespect and obey them. Mothers give us the gift we can never return--\nlife itself.\n  I will close with a quote by the basketball legend Kareem Abdul \nJabar. His mom knew him well, and I suspect never stopped looking after \nhim. He once confessed:\n\n       My mother had to send me to the movies with my birth \n     certificate, so that I wouldn't have to pay the extra fifty \n     cents the adults had to pay.\n\n  I do want to wish a happy Mother's Day to all of the mothers of the \nworld.\n  To my own mother, who I miss very much, her daily image comes down on \njust about everything I do in terms of what she might have done, what \nshe would do, what she would whisper into my ear to do.\n  To my own wife, Karyn, the mother of our three boys, Jonathan, \nHarrison, and Bryan, I say thank you, I love you. You are the rock that \nholds our family together and makes everything possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4520-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4520-S4521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DAVID WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Kentucky \nSenate President, David Williams. He is a master legislator, a fighter \nfor the people of Kentucky, and a true friend.\n  David has served the people of the 16th Senate District since 1987, \nand has served as Senate President since 2000. In his leadership \nposition, he is one of the dominant figures in Kentucky politics. David \nand I have worked together on many issues important to the Commonwealth \nover the years, and I have always been impressed by his knowledge, \nability, and talent to persuade others. David defends his ideas and his \nprinciples well, and as a result has positively influenced much of the \nlegislation that comes out of the state capital.\n  Every Kentuckian benefits from having David Williams as Senate \nPresident. This year, the Kentucky State\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\nSenate had a productive and beneficial session under his helm. I ask \nunanimous consent to print in the Record an article that appeared in \nthe Lexington Herald-Leader on May 8, 2006, that details his recent \naccomplishments. I ask my fellow Senators to join me in thanking David \nWilliams for his service to the people of Kentucky.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Power Politics Has A New Captain\n\n                            (By Ryan Alessi)\n\n       Frankfort.--For better or for worse, this was Senate \n     President David Williams' General Assembly session.\n       Williams, the commanding and strategic-minded Republican \n     from Burkesville, has gradually established himself as the \n     dominant personality in the legislature since taking the helm \n     of the upper chamber six years ago.\n       But during this year's session, which wrapped up last \n     month, Williams played multiple starring roles.\n       He was the deal maker--adding more money in the budget for \n     the University of Kentucky and ensuring that one of Gov. \n     Ernie Fletcher's priorities, the addition of two school days, \n     was approved.\n       He was a facilitator. Just when most everyone thought a \n     seat-belt enforcement bill was dead, Williams tacked the \n     measure--another key priority of Fletcher--on to less \n     controversial legislation, which eventually passed.\n       And early in the session, Democrats praised him for \n     allowing bipartisan proposals relating to mine safety and a \n     ban on protests at military funerals.\n       He also was a lightning rod for criticism, notably the \n     controversy over the University of the Cumberlands.\n       It was Williams who inserted $10 million into the budget \n     for construction of a pharmacy school on the campus of the \n     Baptist-run university in Williamsburg, which is in his \n     Senate district. Another $1 million would go to scholarships \n     at the pharmacy school.\n       The revelation about public funds going to a private \n     university sparked some outcries, particularly after the \n     school expelled a student for announcing on a Web site that \n     he is gay. Williams has defended the funding.\n       And an ongoing rhetorical feud between Williams and Supreme \n     Court Chief Justice Joseph Lambert provided an interesting \n     sidebar to the legislature's work, as Williams sparked \n     debates about separation of powers between the legislative \n     and judicial branches.\n       Throughout the 60-day session, all roads seemed to lead \n     through Williams.\n       ``They led through me or over me?'' joked Williams, who at \n     times comes off as affable and self-deprecating, and at \n     others as defiant and argumentative.\n       He acknowledged that he tried to approach 2006 differently \n     than recent sessions that digressed into bickering and \n     stalemate among the legislative leaders over key issues--\n     especially the budget.\n       ``I felt like in the past, I had been drawn into a few \n     confrontations that I shouldn't have gotten into. I don't \n     think it was constructive to the institution,'' Williams \n     said.\n       That's not to say he remained above the fray.\n       The last week of the session was a particularly grueling \n     test of Williams' restraint. Lawmakers were trying to \n     finalize details of the budget while scrambling to pass the \n     last batch of other bills, including a proposal to lessen the \n     tax burden on certain small businesses.\n       As Williams attempted to ram through the Senate's version \n     of that tax-relief plan, Democratic Sen. Tim Shaughnessy \n     vehemently objected, at one point declaring: ``I don't trust \n     you guys.''\n       So Williams switched off Shaughnessy's microphone.\n       In the end, negotiations between Senate Republicans and \n     House Democrats crumbled on the small-business tax issue--one \n     of a handful of key priorities pegged by both parties that \n     failed.\n       But the main goal--passing the state's two-year, $18.1 \n     billion spending plan--was achieved. And negotiations between \n     House Democratic and Senate Republican leaders again proved \n     to be a stage for Williams.\n       For instance, House Democrats first included $17.5 million \n     in their budget draft to repair a dam on the Kentucky River.\n       The Senate stripped that funding in its version.\n       During later closed-door negotiations between the two \n     chambers' leaders, Williams was the first to emerge to tell \n     reporters that they had restored the funds and allowed the \n     Kentucky River Authority to use $33 million in additional fee \n     money to fix more dams.\n       Senate Republicans often gain the upper hand during such \n     budget negotiations because Williams and Majority Floor \n     Leader Dan Kelly of Springfield usually convey a united \n     front, lawmakers say.\n       Sen. Ernesto Scorsone, a Lexington Democrat, said that's \n     because Williams ``controls the party caucus.''\n       But Williams noted that it's easier for Senate Republicans \n     to get on the same page because there's just 21 of them, \n     compared to 56 House Democrats.\n       ``It would appear to me that the Democratic negotiators \n     generally do not have a unified plan or plan of action. There \n     are about five or six strong personalities,'' he said. ``They \n     don't seem to come to a consensus before they come to the \n     table.''\n       Others say that the Senate Republican leaders have a knack \n     for putting their own stamp on just about every key bill.\n       ``David and Sen. Kelly are the driving force behind all the \n     legislation that comes out, no matter where it originates,'' \n     said Rep. Stan Lee, a Lexington Republican.\n       As a result, many legislators have dubbed Williams the most \n     powerful man in Frankfort, with more effect than even the \n     governor.\n       ``David knows what he wants and goes out and gets it. I \n     don't think the governor knows exactly what he wants, and \n     certainly doesn't know how to get it,'' said Scorsone. \n     ``Fletcher's future, in terms of legislative success, is very \n     much in the hands of David Williams.''\n       The governor's staff disagreed, saying Fletcher has stood \n     on his own.\n       ``Governor Fletcher's record of accomplishments speaks for \n     itself. His style is to build consensus and find areas of \n     common ground with members of the assembly,'' said chief of \n     staff Stan Cave in a statement.\n       Williams, who has said he supports Fletcher's re-election \n     bid in '07, is deferential, noting that Fletcher missed a \n     month of the session battling complications from a gallstone \n     and pancreatitis.\n       ``It's hard to compare management styles,'' he said. \n     ``Obviously the governor, because of his illness, was not \n     around a lot at crucial times.''\n       Williams, meanwhile, rarely missed a cue at those critical \n     points.\n       ``I feel I had the most productive session I've ever had,'' \n     he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4521-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask that it be submitted to the Record \nthat I inadvertently missed the vote on cloture on the motion to \nproceed to S. 22, the Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2006, due \nto unavoidable airline flight delays. Had I been present, I would have \nvoted ``yea.''\n  Americans are going to spend $2.3 trillion this year on health care. \nOne out of every three dollars does not go to help anybody get well. We \nare never going to be able to compete globally if we cannot control the \nhealth care costs in this country. The threat of medical liability \nraises the cost of health care for everybody in this country.\n  Only 16 percent of the lawsuits that are filed across the entire \ncountry have any merit whatsoever--84 percent of them are filled with \nthe idea that we can intimidate people into settling a case so a lawyer \ncan make money. It has nothing to do with the patient. It has \neverything to do with enriching the trial bar. I have experienced that \npersonally as a physician who has delivered over 4,000 children into \nthis world.\n  We have a problem with out of control medical liability--the cost of \ndefensive medicine alone is up to $126 billion per year. We can fix \nthose problems. But we can't fix them by protecting special interest \ngroups that have been protected for years--special interest groups that \nclaim they want to do something great for people but who most of the \ntime are motivated to do something great for themselves.\n  The Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2006 is based on the \nsuccessful Texas model of medical liability reform. It's a solution to \nthe problem that is already getting results.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4521-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4521-S4522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL POLICE SURVIVORS DAY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. In 1962, the Congress enacted and President Kennedy \nsigned into law a joint resolution designating May 15 as Peace Officers \nMemorial Day and the week in which May 15 falls as National Police \nWeek.\n  National Police Week is observed with numerous events here in our \nNation's Capitol and parallel events in communities across the Nation. \nThe two most moving of these events are the Peace Officers Memorial Day \nceremony, on the Capitol grounds, and a candlelight vigil at the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on Judiciary Square. At that \ncandlelight vigil, the name of each officer who perished in the line of \nduty during the preceding year is read aloud to an assemblage numbering \n10,000 or more.\n  These events emphasize the heroic acts of the law enforcement \nofficers who lost their lives in the line of duty. The National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial bears the inscription that our fallen \nofficers are not heroes for the way that they died but for the way they \nlived their lives. Heroes, as we know, live on forever in our hearts, \nour spirits and our collective memories\n  But for the families, friends and co-workers of law enforcement \nofficers\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\nwho lost their lives in the line of duty, the grief and the loss are \nvery real. The survivors of fallen law enforcement officers command our \nsympathy and our prayers.\n  Yet after the funeral is over and news of the tragedy falls off of \nthe front pages of the daily newspaper, the very hard and often \nsolitary process of adjustment begins. In many cases, that process can \nlast for years and years after the loss and during that lengthy period, \nour police survivors need support in more tangible ways.\n  On May 14, 2003, on the eve of the National Peace Officers' Memorial \nService, 10 widows of fallen law enforcement officers came together at \ndinner to ask the question, ``What about us?''\n  At the National Police Week gatherings, everyone focuses on the loved \none whose life is lost, but it is also important to focus on the needs \nof survivors who must rebuild their lives from the ashes.\n  From this dinner conversation came the birth of a new national \norganization called ``Concerns of Police Survivors.'' The acronym is \n``COPS''.\n  One year later, COPS was formed at the first National Police \nSurvivors Seminar which drew 110 law enforcement survivors.\n  Suzie Sawyer, a former President of the Fraternal Order of Police \nAuxiliary was selected as COPS' first Executive Director. She is also \nthe only person to have served as the group's executive director.\n  Today, COPS provides healing, love and the opportunity for a renewed \nlife to over 15,000 families through a network of 48 chapters around \nthe country.\n  Over its 22 year history, COPS, as it is called, has expanded its \noffering of programs to include: peer support and counseling for \nsurvivors every day of the year, assistance in obtaining death \nbenefits, assistance in coping with parole hearings, and scholarships \nfor surviving spouses and children.\n  It offers special programs for parents, siblings and spouses of \nfallen officers as well as a summer camp for young and teenage \nchildren.\n  COPS also trains police agencies on how to cope with a line of duty \ndeath.\n  But one of the most important activities COPS offers is the Annual \nPolice Survivors Seminar. This weekend at a hotel in Alexandria that is \nclosed off to the public and the media, survivors from across the \ncountry will find a safe place to vent, to cry, to laugh, to think, and \nto heal.\n  COPS has played a pivotal role in helping the families of Alaska's \nsurvivors rebuild their lives. COPS was there for Laurie Heck Huckeba, \nthe widow of Alaska State Trooper Bruce Heck, slain on January 10, \n1997. Laurie went on to become a member of the COPS national board of \ndirectors, and facilitates sessions at the National Police Survivors \nSeminar.\n  Survivors helping survivors--that's what COPS is all about.\n  And COPS was there for the family of slain Kenai Police Officer John \nWatson, who tragically lost his life on Christmas Day, 2003, while \nchecking on the welfare of another. Officer Watson is the last Alaska \nofficer to lose his life in the line of duty.\n  COPS will be there for the family, co-workers and friends of Vicki \nArmel, the Fairfax County Detective who was senselessly slain by a \nsniper outside the Sully District Police Station this week.\n  And it will do the same for the survivors of slain Philadelphia \nPolice Officer Gary Skerski, also shot to death this week after \nresponding to a robbery call at a bar. The perpetrator told patrons \nthat he planned to kill an officer. Eleven Philadelphia officers have \nbeen shot in the last 25 months, according to the Fraternal Order of \nPolice. Every one of those incidents takes an emotional toll on so many \nothers.\n  Thanks to the work of Suzie Sawyer and COPS, all of those affected by \na police line of duty death no longer need to ask the question, ``What \nabout us?''\n  They refer to law enforcement as the ``thin blue line.'' Thanks to \nCOPS, that thin blue line of support for our law enforcement families \nis tens of thousands of people thick.\n  In honor of our police survivors and the vital work that is \nundertaken by COPS, I joined with my colleagues earlier this week in \noffering Senate Resolution 473 which designates May 14, the anniversary \nof the founding of COPS, as National Police Survivors Day. The \nresolution is intended to engage all of our fellow citizens to lend \ntheir hearts and to lend a hand to the survivors of our police heroes.\n  I am pleased that the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 473. I \nappreciate the support of our colleagues in moving this resolution \nthrough swiftly. It is especially timely given the unfortunate events \nthat occurred this week in Fairfax County and in Philadelphia. How \ntragic that these events occurred on the very eve of National Police \nWeek.\n  I also want to acknowledge the leadership of my colleague, Mr. \nTalent, in whose state of Missouri COPS is headquartered, and my \ncolleague, Mrs. Lincoln, our lead co-sponsor on the Democratic side, \nwho worked with me to put forward this resolution.\n  In the United States, one law enforcement officer dies in the line of \nduty every 53 hours. Each year somewhere between 140 and 160 lose their \nlives in the line of duty.\n  As we remember the heroic deeds of the 17,535 law enforcement \nofficers whose names are carved into the marble wall on Judiciary \nSquare, let us also take a moment to reflect on those who are left to \ncarry on. Let's do this on May 14--National Police Survivors Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4522-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GULF OF MEXICO RESTORATION AND PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have been pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Martinez and Senator Landrieu, in \nintroducing bipartisan legislation that will take a very significant \nstep forward in restoring and protecting the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I want to highlight how important the Gulf of Mexico is to our \ncountry. The Gulf of Mexico is the ninth largest body of water in the \nworld, and the Gulf region covers approximately 600,000 square miles. \nThe Gulf of Mexico contains 7 of this Nation's top 10 ports in terms of \ntonnage or cargo value, 4 of the top 7 fishing ports in the Nation, \nyields more finfish, shrimp, and shellfish annually than the south and \nmid-Atlantic, Chesapeake, and New England areas combined, and supports \na $20 billion annual tourism industry.\n  Sadly, over many years, the resource productivity and water quality \nof the Gulf of Mexico and its watershed have been diminished by \nnonpoint source pollution largely resulting from pollutant transport \nalong the nearly 2,300-mile-long Mississippi River. I believe many \nAmericans would be surprised to know that the Environmental Protection \nAgency's Gulf of Mexico Program, the only Federal program solely \nfocused on protecting the health and productivity of the Gulf of \nMexico, is neither authorized nor adequately funded to perform critical \nprogram functions vital to protecting and restoring one of this \ncountry's greatest natural resources.\n  The Gulf of Mexico Restoration and Protection Act will authorize the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's Gulf of Mexico Program to undertake \nspecific nonregulatory functions, and authorize annual appropriations \nto support activities designed to improve Gulf of Mexico water quality \nand marine resource productivity. With an 18-year track record of \nsuccess, the Gulf of Mexico Program proves that it is not only possible \nbut also practical to manage our natural resources through \ncollaborative, nonregulatory approaches that leverage support, \nresources, and capabilities from Federal, State, nonprofit, and private \nsector partners. Unfortunately, the Gulf of Mexico Program is \nstruggling with a very limited budget and a staff comprised largely of \npeople ``on loan'' from other Federal agencies. The historic storm \nseason of 2005 gravely worsened the situation by placing increased \ndemand on the program's technical services, and I expect this pressure \nwill continue to rise as the gulf coast rebuilds.\n  I commend the EPA Gulf of Mexico Program and its Federal, State, \nnonprofit, and private sector partners for doing so much with so little \nfor so long. However, it is impractical to expect this to continue in \nperpetuity. Now is the time to take actions to ensure the Gulf of \nMexico is protected for continued economic productivity, recreation, \nand to make certain this great water body remains a place of beauty and \nenjoyment for current and future generations.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4523-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n         TAX INCREASE PREVENTION AND RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I support the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act \nof 2005. I wish to commend Chairman Grassley and the House/Senate \nconferees for forging an important package to ensure continued economic \nvitality which was spurred by commonsense tax cuts enacted under the \nleadership of President George W. Bush.\n  The conference report, which has already passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 244 to 185, will help small businesses, \nfarmers, and working American taxpayers. Most significantly, the \nconference report: Extends for 2 years the capital gains and dividend \ntax rate reductions; increases the exemption threshold for the \nalternative minimum tax, meaning that fewer working Americans will be \nsubjected to this hidden and creeping tax increase; increases important \nexpensing for small businesses; eliminates the income limits on \nconversions to Roth individual retirement accounts; accelerates the \napplication of $20 million capital expenditure limitation on tax-exempt \nState and local bonds used to finance private business manufacturing or \nthe acquisition of land and equipment by certain farmers.\n  The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal has correctly pointed \nout that the President's tax cuts and lower rates on dividends and \ncapital gains has resulted in an increase in revenue of $137 billion, \n11.2 percent, as reflected in the Treasury's monthly budget report for \nMay. This is more than triple the rate of inflation and is in addition \nto the $274 billion, or a 14.6 percent increase, in Federal revenues \nfor all of fiscal 2005, which ended September 30.\n  Passage of this measure is essential to continue America's \nextraordinary economic expansion to benefit all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4523-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4523-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4523-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2791.

A bill to provide competitive status to certain Federal \nemployees in the State of Alaska; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we approach the start of National \nPolice Week and the annual memorial service, I would like to take this \nopportunity once again to speak about the life and accomplishments of \nthe late Thomas P. O'Hara, a National Park Service Protection Ranger \nand pilot and an Alaskan hero.\n  Thomas P. O'Hara was assigned to the Katmai National Park and \nPreserve in the Bristol Bay region of western Alaska. On December 19, \n2002, Ranger O'Hara and his passenger, a Fish and Wildlife Service \nemployee, were on a mission in the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife \nRefuge. Their plane went down on the tundra.\n  When the plane was reported overdue, a rescue effort consisting of 14 \nsingle engine aircraft, an Alaska Air National Guard plane, and a Coast \nGuard helicopter quickly mobilized. Many of the single-engine aircraft \nwere piloted by Tom's friends. The wreckage was located late in the \nafternoon of December 20. The passenger survived the crash, but Ranger \nTom did not.\n  Tom O'Hara was an experienced pilot with 11,000 hours as a pilot-in-\ncommand. He was active in the communities of Naknek and King Salmon \nwhere he grew up, flying children to Bible camp and coaching young \nwrestlers. Tom provided a strong link between the residents of Bristol \nBay and the National Park Service.\n  Although Tom O'Hara was a most valued employee of the National Park \nService, he did not enjoy the same status as National Park Service \nemployees with competitive career status. Tom was hired under a special \nhiring authority established under the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, ANILCA, which permits land management agencies like \nthe National Park Service to hire, on a noncompetitive basis, Alaskans \nwho by reason of having lived or worked in or near public lands in \nAlaska, have special knowledge or expertise concerning the natural or \ncultural resources of public lands and the management thereof.\n  Tom O'Hara possessed this knowledge and offered it freely to the \nNational Park Service. But because he was hired under this special \nauthority, his opportunities for transfer and promotion within the Park \nService were limited, even though his service was exemplary.\n  As a lasting memorial to Tom O'Hara's exemplary career, I am \nintroducing legislation today that will grant competitive status to \nANILCA local hire employees who hold permanent appointments with the \nFederal land management agencies after the completion of 2 years of \nsatisfactory service. In Tom's honor, the short title of this \nlegislation is the Thomas P. O'Hara Public Land Career Opportunity Act \nof 2006.\n  It is my sincere hope that the enactment of this legislation will \nencourage other Alaskans, particularly Alaska Natives, to follow in Tom \nO'Hara's footsteps and seek lifelong careers with the Federal land \nmanagement agencies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2797\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, on Monday, we will return to the \nimmigration reform bill. Members wishing to offer amendments to this \nbill and wishing to debate the bill are encouraged to do so starting on \nMonday.\n  The first rollcall vote next week will be on Tuesday morning at 10 \no'clock. That particular vote will be on the confirmation of a circuit \ncourt judicial nomination. In all likelihood, we will have several \nother votes stacked on immigration shortly thereafter.\n  We will have a full week next week. The Democratic leader and I \noutlined yesterday morning what the plans would be, expecting a full \ndebate on what we know is a contentious issue, in large part because of \nthe complexity of the issue.\n  We all know we need to address the insecurity that exists on our \nborders today. It has to be first and foremost, up front. That is where \nillegal people, millions of illegal people, come through every year.\n  There is a real distrust of Government being able to accomplish that \namong the American people today. We hear it by direct conversation, and \nwe see it by e-mail. We have to do our absolute best to secure those \nborders. It takes money, it takes planning, it takes Federal \ninvolvement, State involvement, and that has to be accomplished.\n  I feel very good about the progress that has been made to date. It is \nstill totally inadequate, but last year we put about $10 billion on our \nborders, increasing the number of border security guards, and adding \n1,400 detention beds inside this country. It does take time when we put \nthe money there to train people and to get them on board. I am not \nmaking any excuses, but that was the end of last year.\n  Last week in this body, we said we need to spend another $1.9 billion \non the border in terms of providing the technology, the surveillance, \nthe infrared cameras, the unmanned aerial vehicles, the capital \nexpenditures that are required.\n  Now it is important for us to put together a comprehensive plan which \nstresses border security. We have to tighten it, but we also recognize \nthis country is a magnet for people coming in from other countries. If \nwe have employers hiring people illegally, who break the law, people \nare going to climb over the fence no matter how high we make it, or dig \nunder that fence, and that is why we have to extend it to comprehensive \nreform.\n  From a workforce standpoint, we in this Nation welcome legal \nimmigrants to come and work. That will be addressed as well.\n  It is going to require lots of debate, lots of amendments, and \nagreement. Again, the Democratic leader and I agree 100 percent on our \napproach, coming together in this body to address an issue which I hope \nwill be in a dignified and civil way that reflects the very best of \nthis institution. We will complete this bill before the Memorial Day \nrecess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/12/senate-section/article/S4527-5", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 15, 2006, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
